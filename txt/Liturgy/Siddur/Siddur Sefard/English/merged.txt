Upon Arising

Modeh Ani

<i>Upon waking in the morning, even before washing your hands, say:</i>
I give thanks to You living and everlasting King for You have restored my soul with mercy. Great is Your faithfulness.
<i>After washing your hands, say:</i>
The beginning of wisdom is fear of Adonoy, good understanding to all who perform [His commandments], His praise endures forever. Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.
<i>Before putting on your </i>tallis katan<i> say:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>tzitzis</i> (fringes).
May it be Your will Adonoy, my God, and God of my fathers, to consider [my fulfillment of] the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>tzitzis</i> before You as though I had fulfilled it in every detail, accurately and with full intent, and the 613<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The numerical value of the word צִיצִית is 600 which, with the 8 threads and 5 knots of the צִיצִית itself, makes 613, the exact number of the <i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah. This symbolizes the Talmudic statement (Maseches Nedarim 25a) that the wearing of <i>tzitzis</i> equals the observance of the whole Torah.</i> commandments that depend on it. Amein, Selah.

Tallit

<i>While examining the fringes of the </i>tallis<i> say:</i>
My soul, bless Adonoy, Adonoy, my God, You are greatly exalted. With beauty and splendor are You clothed enwrapped in light, garment-like; You spread out the heavens like a curtain.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 104:1,2.</i>
For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, with fear and love and love and fear, to unify the Name of <i>Yud Hei</i> with <i>Vav Hei</i> with a complete unity, in the name of all Israel. Behold, I am wrapping my body with <i>tsitsit</i> (fringes). So too may You wrap my soul – my 248 limbs and my 365 tendons – in the light of the <i>tsitsit</i>, [the letters, strings and knots of] which add up to 613. And in the same way that I cover myself with a prayer shawl in this world, so too may I merit to be in the section of the rabbis and to have a fine prayer shawl in the next world, in the Garden of Eden. And through the commandment of <i>tsitsit</i>, save my essence, my spirit, my soul and my prayer from [negative forces]. And may the prayer shawl spread its wings upon them to save them, ‘like an eagle that rouses his nestlings, hovering over his young.’ And may [this] commandment of <i>tsitsit</i> be considered before the Holy One, blessed be He, as if I fulfilled it in all of its details, all of its minutiae and all of its intentions – [as well as] the 613 commandments that are dependent upon it. Amen, Selah.
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with(His commandments and commanded us to enwrap ourselves with <i>tzitzis.</i>
<i>Cover your head with the </i>tallis<i> and say:</i>
How precious is Your kindness, God; the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings. They will be filled from the abundance of Your House, and from the stream of Your delights You will give them to drink. For with You is the source of life, in Your light shall we see light. Extend Your kindness to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 36:8-11.</i>

Tefilin

For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, with fear and love and love and fear, to unify the Name of <i>Yud Hei</i> with <i>Vav Hei</i> with a complete unity, in the name of all Israel. Behold, in placing the <i>tefillin</i> [upon myself], I intend to fulfill the commandment of my Creator, Who commanded us to place <i>tefillin</i>; as it is written in His Torah (Deuteronomy 6:8), “Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead.” And they are four sections [from the Torah]: Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-8); And it shall be if you will truly listen (Deuteronomy 11:13-21); Sanctify (Exodus 13:1-10); And it shall be when He brings you (Exodus 12:11-17) – since within them they contain His unity and oneness in the world, may His name be blessed; and [through them,] we can remember His miracles and wonders when He took us out of Egypt, and that He has the power and control over the higher beings and the lower beings to do what He wants with them. And He commanded us to place it upon the arm in memory of the ‘extended forearm’ (with which He took us out of Egypt); and that it be across from the heart in order to subjugate the desire and thoughts of our heart for His service, may His name be blessed. And upon the head across from the brain, such that the soul in my brain – along with all my other senses and powers – be subjugated to His service, may His name be blessed. And may the bounty from the commandment of <i>tefillin</i> flow upon me, such that I should have long life, holy bounty, holy thoughts – free from any conjectures of sin or transgression – such that the evil impulse not seduce us or disturb us, but leave us to serve the Lord, as it is in our hearts. And may it be Your will before You, Lord our God and God of our fathers that [this] commandment of <i>tefillin</i> be considered before the Holy One, blessed be He, as if I fulfilled it in all of its details, all of its minutiae and all of its intentions – [as well as] the 613 commandments that are dependent upon it. Amen, Selah.
<i>Place the "tefillin of the arm" on the muscle of your left arm, and before tightening it, say:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to put on <i>tefillin.</i>
<i>Wrap the strap around your arm 7 times and then place the "tefillin of the head" on your head above the region between your eyes, and say:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us concerning the <i>mitzvoh</i> of <i>tefillin.</i>
<i>Then say immediately:</i>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.
<i>With the "tefillin of the head" in place, say:</i>
And from Your wisdom, most high Almighty, may You impart to me; and from Your understanding, give me understanding. With Your lovingkindness, do great things with me. With Your merit, cut off my enemies and opponents. Pour bountiful oil upon the seven branches of the menorah, in order to cause goodness to flow to Your creatures. Open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
<i>When wrapping the strap around the middle finger of your left hand, say:</i>
And I will betrothe you to me forever; and I will betrothe you to me in righteousness, in justice, in kindliness, and in mercy. And I will betrothe you to me in faithfulness and you shall know Adonoy.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 2:21-22.</i>
<small>The following chapters, found in Exodus 13:1-16, are recited while wearing the tefillin, since they make direct reference to the mitzvah of tefillin.</small>
Adonoy spoke to Moses, saying: "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever opens the womb among the Children of Israel, both of man and beast is Mine." And Moses said to the people: "Remember this day on which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for with a strong hand Adonoy brought you out from here, and [therefore] you must not eat <i>chametz.</i> This day you are departing, in the month of springtime. And it will be when Adonoy will bring you to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall perform this service in this month. Seven days, you shall eat matzos, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival [dedicated] to Adonoy. Matzos shall be eaten during these seven days, and no <i>chametz</i> and no leaven shall be seen in your possession within all your boundaries. And you shall relate to your son on that day, saying: ‘Because of this Adonoy acted on my behalf when I came out of Egypt. And it shall be for a sign upon your arm<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary here, to touch the tefillin of the arm with the tallis or hand.

See previous note.</i> so that Adonoy's teaching will be [the words of] your mouth; for with a strong hand Adonoy brought you out of Egypt. And you shall keep this ordinance in its appointed time from year to year.
And it will be, when Adonoy will bring you to the land of the Canaanites as He swore unto you and to your fathers, and will have given it to you. Then you shall bring to Adonoy every one that opens the womb, and every firstling that is dropped by cattle that belong to you, the males shall belong to Adonoy, The firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you do not redeem it, then you must kill it by breaking its neck. You must redeem every firstborn of man among your children. And it will be when your son asks you in future times, saying: ‘What is this?' You shall say to him: ‘With a strong hand Adonoy brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. And it was when Pharaoh unyieldingly refused to let us go, that Adonoy killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man, to the firstborn of beast; therefore I sacrifice to Adonoy all that opens the womb that are males, and every firstborn of my sons, I redeem.' And it shall be a sign upon your arm,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary here, to touch the tefillin of the arm with the tallis or hand.

Introductory Prayers














Elijah the prophet, remembered for his righteousness, did open his mouth and spake, saying, "O Sovereign of the worlds, Thou who art One and not in count, Thou art the Supreme above all supremes, the Most Hidden of all that is hidden. No thought can apprehend Thee at all. Thou art He who hath emanated ten rectifications (Tikkunim), and they are called the ten emanations (Sefirot), to govern therewith the hidden worlds, which are not revealed, and the revealed worlds, and with them Thou dost conceal Thyself from the sons of men. Thou art He who binds them and unites them; and because Thou art indeed the One, whosoever separates one from another of these ten emanations (Sefirot) is considered as if he had effected separation in Thee. These ten emanations (Sefirot) proceed according to their order: the long (Arikh), the short (Qatzir), the intermediate (Beinoni); and Thou art He who guides them, and there is none that guides Thee, neither above, nor below, nor from any side. Thou hast appointed garments for them, from which souls blossom forth to the sons of men. And how many bodies hast Thou prepared for them, which are called body in respect to the garments that cover them. And these ten emanations (Sefirot) are called by Thy name: loving-kindness (Chesed) of the right arm, might (Gevurah) of the left arm, beauty (Tiferet) of the body, eternity (Netzach) and splendor (Hod) the two legs, foundation (Yesod) the end of the body, sign of the holy covenant, kingdom (Malkhut) the mouth, the oral law that we call it. Wisdom (Chokhmah) of the brain is a thought from Thee, understanding (Binah) of the heart, and in these two it is written, 'The hidden things belong unto the LORD our God.' The supreme crown (Keter Elyon) is the crown of the kingdom, and of it is said, 'Declaring the end from the beginning.' It is the skull where phylacteries lie (Karkafta d'tefillei). From Thee it is Yod 20 and Vav 20, which is the path of emanation, the irrigation of the tree with its branches and boughs, like the water that irrigates the tree, and it grows with that irrigation. O Sovereign of the worlds, Thou art the Cause of causes, and the Reason of reasons, who irrigates the tree with this flow, and this flow is like a soul to the body, and it is life to the body, and in Thee there is no likeness nor image at all, from all that is within and without, and Thou hast created heaven and earth. And from them Thou hast brought forth the sun and the moon and the stars and the constellations, and on earth, trees and grasses, and the Garden of Eden and herbs and living creatures and birds and fish and the sons of men, to make known with them the supremes and how they are conducted with the supremes and the lowers, and how they are known from the supremes and the lowers, and there is no knowledge in Thee at all, and except for Thee there is no unity in the supremes and the lowers, and Thou art known as the Cause of all and the Sovereign over all. And all the emanations (Sefirot), each one has a known name, and they are called angels (Malachim), and Thou hast no known name, for Thou art He who fills all their names, and Thou art the perfection of them all, and when Thou departest from them, all their names remain as a body without a soul. Thou art wise and not with a known wisdom, Thou art understanding and not with a known understanding, Thou hast no known place except to make known Thy power and Thy might to the sons of men, and to show them how Thou conductest the world in justice and in mercy, which are righteousness and judgment, according to the deeds of the sons of men. Judgment is might, judgment is the middle pillar, righteousness is the holy kingdom, the scales of righteousness are two supports of truth, behold righteousness is the sign of the covenant. All this to show how Thou conductest the world, but Thou hast no known righteousness, for it is judgment, nor judgment known, for it is mercy, nor from all these attributes at all. Blessed be the LORD forever, Amen and Amen."

Upon Entering Synagogue

<i>Before beginning the Morning Prayers you should say the following:</i>
I hereby accept upon myself the positive commandment to love my fellow Jew.
<small>The following verses from Scriptures are recited upon entering the synagogue, as though asking permission of God to enter and pray in His Holy place.</small>
How good are your tents, Jacob: your dwelling places, Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 24:5. The Talmud (Maseches Sanhedrin 105a) relates that this verse contains Billam’s prophetic allusion to Jewish houses of study and worship.</i> As for me, through Your abundant kindness I will enter Your House; I will prostrate myself toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 5:8.</i> Adonoy, I love the Dwelling, Your House, and the place where Your glory resides.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 26:8.</i> I will prostrate myself, and bow, I will kneel<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These are three distinct degrees of worship, representing various levels of subjugation before God.</i> before Adonoy, my Maker. May my prayer to You Adonoy be at a favorable time; God, in the abundance of Your kindness answer me with the truth of Your deliverance.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 69:14.</i>
<small>This hymn has been attributed to R' Shlomo ibn Gabirol who lived in Spain during the eleventh century. While praising God's omnipotence and providence, it clarifies the meaning of the name Adonoy so that before proceeding to pray, each worshiper understands the significance of the God he is addressing.</small>
Master of the Universe Who reigned before any creature was created.
At the time when all was made by His will, then was His Name proclaimed King.
And after all things shall cease to be the Awesome One will reign alone.
He was, He is, and He shall be in glory.
He is One, and there is no second to compare to Him, to associate [with Him].
Without beginning, without end, power and dominion are His.
He is my God and my ever-living Redeemer, the Rock of my destiny in times of distress.
He is my flag<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is to Him that I rally and through Him that I am identified.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> and my refuge; He is the portion of my cup on the day I call.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He answers me.</i>
Into His hand I entrust my spirit [both] when I sleep and when I awaken.
And with my spirit my body [too], Adonoy is with me, I shall not fear.
<small>This hymn, written by Daniel ben Yehuda, who was a Dayan in Rome about 1300, is based on Maimonides' 13 principles of Judaism. According to Maimonides, failure to believe in a single one of these principles places one outside the pale of Judaism.</small>
<b>1) <i>the existence of God</i></b>
Exalted is the living God, and praised He exists, and His existence transcends time.
<b>2) <i>God is One</i></b>
He is One, and there is no unity like His, He is invisible, His unity is infinitive.
<b>3) <i>God is uncorporeal</i></b>
He is unlike the corporeal or even the non-corporeal,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God can also not be compared to the angels.</i> His holiness is beyond comparison.
<b>4) <i>God is Eternal</i></b>
He preceded every being that was created, He was First, and there was no genesis to His beginning.
<b>5) <i>God alone must be worshipped</i></b>
He is Master of the Universe to every creature, (all) proclaim His greatness and His majesty.
<b>6) <i>Truth of Divine Prophecy</i></b>
The fullness of His prophecy, He bestowed on those He treasured, and in whom He gloried.
<b>7) <i>Moses was the greatest of all prophets</i></b>
There never arose in Israel another like Moses, a prophet who beheld God's image.
<b>8) <i>Divine revelation of the Torah</i></b>
The Torah of truth the Almighty gave to His people through His prophet, the trusted one of His house.
<b>9) <i>The Torah is immutable</i></b>
The Almighty will not exchange nor alter His Law. Never will He offer any alternative.
<b>10) <i>God knows the acts and thoughts of man</i></b>
He scrutinizes and knows our secrets. He beholds the end of a thing at its beginning.
<b>11) <i>Divine reward and punishment</i></b>
He rewards man with kindness according to his deeds. He sends evil to the wicked according to his wickedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word “deed” is not applied to the wicked man. Since Divine reward and punishment are distributed with kindness, reward is granted to man not only for his deed, which may itself be insignificant, but also for the long range effect of that deed. He is punished, however, only for his act of wickedness, not for the consequences of his deed.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i>
<b>12) <i>Belief in the coming of the Messiah</i></b>
He will send our Messiah at the end of days, to redeem all who await His final deliverance.
<b>13) <i>Divine resurrection of the dead</i></b>
The Almighty will revive the dead because of His abundant kindness: Blessed forever is His praised Name.

Weekday Shacharit

Morning Blessings

Blessed<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word “blessed” is similar in concept to the words: “merciful” or “gracious” when applied to God. Just as merciful means that He is merciful, the source of mercy; so too, blessed means that He is the source of blessing.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> are You, Adonoy<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Generally speaking, the name Adonoy is understood as it is pronounced—Adonoy—my Master, and indicates His rule and providence of the universe. When reciting the Shema however, one should bear in mind the written character of the Name which indicates God’s everpresent existence. He was—is—and ever will be.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the washing of hands.
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who formed man with wisdom<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This may mean either that man was formed by God’s wisdom, or that God formed man and endowed him with wisdom.</i> and created within him openings and hollows. It is obvious and known in the presence of Your glorious throne<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In refutation of those who claim that God is not concerned with earthly matters, we declare that even in the presence of His glorious throne, where He is surrounded by myriads of angels, He is aware of the mundane needs of each individual.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> that if one of them were ruptured, or if one of them were blocked, it would be impossible to exist and stand in Your Presence even for a short while. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who heals all flesh and performs wonders.
My God! the soul which You bestowed in me is pure; You created it, You formed it, You breathed it into me and You preserve it within me. You will eventually take it from me, and restore it in me in the time to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This statement refers to the time when the dead will be resurrected.</i> So long as the soul is within me I give thanks to You, Adonoy my God,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it is said, “I will praise Adonoy with my life, I will sing to my God with my being” (Psalms 146:2).</i> and God of my fathers, Lord of all creatures, Master of all souls. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who restores souls to dead bodies.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to God’s restoring of the soul each morning following its departure while the person sleeps.</i>

Blessings on Torah

Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The observance and fulfillment of His commandments makes a person holy.</i> us with His commandments and commanded us to be engrossed in the words of Torah.
Adonoy our God, please make pleasant the words of Your Torah in our mouths and in the mouths of Your people Israel. And may we and our descendants and the descendants of Your people the House of Israel, all be perceivers of Your Name and students of Your Torah for its own sake. Blessed are You, Adonoy Who teaches Torah to His people, Israel.
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe Who chose us from among all the peoples<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to God’s declaration, “And you will be a treasure unto me from among all people” (Exodus 19:6) which preceded the giving of the Torah at Sinai.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> and gave us His Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to the actual giving of the Torah at Sinai.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, Giver of the Torah!
And Adonoy spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, thus shall you bless the Children of Israel, say to them:
May Adonoy bless you and guard you. May Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you. May Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:24.</i>
And they shall set My Name upon the Children of Israel, and I shall bless them.
These are precepts<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, Peah 1:1: Talmud Maseches Shabbos 127a.</i> for which no fixed measure is prescribed: [leaving] the corner [of a field unharvested],<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The unharvested produce was left for the poor; Leviticus 19:9.</i> [the offering of] the first fruits,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:9.</i> the appearance-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">These offerings were brought when a Jew “appeared” before God in the Temple on the three Pilgrimage festivals—Pesach, Shavuos and Sukkos—Exodus 23:14-17, Deuteronomy 16:16-17.</i> [performing] deeds of kindness, and the study of Torah. These are precepts, the fruits of which man enjoys in this world, [while] the principal [reward] is preserved for him in the World-to-Come. They are: honoring father and mother, [performing] deeds of kindness, early attendance in the House of Study morning and evening, providing hospitality to guests, visiting the sick, participating in making a wedding, accompanying the dead [to the grave], concentrating on the meaning of prayers, making peace between fellow men and between husband and wife— and the study of Torah is equal to them all.
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who gives the rooster understanding to distinguish between day and night.
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who did not make me a gentile.
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who did not make me a slave.

May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers, to save me today and every day from arrogant men and from arrogance; from an evil man, from an evil companion, from an evil neighbor; from an evil mishap from an evil eye, from a malicious tongue, from slander, from false testimony, from hatred from scandal, from unnatural death, from harsh disease, and from misfortune, and from the destructive Satan; from a difficult judgment and a difficult opponent, whether he is a fellow Jew or not a fellow Jew and from the retribution of Gehinnom.

Morning Prayer

Our God and God of our fathers, remember us favorably before You and be mindful of us for deliverance and compassion from the eternal high heavens. Remember in our behalf, Adonoy, our God: the love of our ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants; the covenant, the kindness, and the oath which You swore to our father Abraham on Mount Moriah, and the binding of Isaac, his son on the altar, as it is written in Your Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 22:1-19.</i>
After these events,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These events refer to the previous nine tests by which God tested Abraham. This was to be the tenth and the most difficult test of all.—<i>Ha’amek Dovor</i></i> God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham!" and he [Abraham] said, "Here I am." He said, "Please, take your son, your only one,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac was Abraham’s only son by Sarah.</i> whom you love—Isaac— and go to the land of Moriah, and bring him up as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will designate to you. Abraham awoke early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took his two attendants<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael and Eliezer.—<i>Rashi</i></i> with him, and also his son Isaac. He split the wood of the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went to the place that God had designated to him. On the third day, Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place from afar. Abraham said to his attendants, You stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go to that place. We will prostrate ourselves [in worship] and return<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham unwittingly prophesied that both of them would return.—<i>Rashi</i></i> to you."

Another interpretation is: his knife is called <i>ma’acheles </i>because we still enjoy (eat) the reward of Abraham’s virtue when he agreed to use it to slaughter his son.—<i>Rashi</i></i> and they both went together. Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, "Father," and he said, "Here I am my son." He said, "Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?" Abraham said, God Himself will show the lamb for a burnt offering, my son."

Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. An angel of Adonoy called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham! Abraham!" and he said, "Here I am."

An angel of Adonoy called to Abraham a second time from heaven, and said, ‘I have sworn by Myself,' declares Adonoy, ‘that because you performed this deed, and did not withhold your only son, I will greatly bless you and make your descendants as numerous<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11 If these blessings were intended to increase the population of Abraham’s descendants, it was superfluous, since God had previously blessed him for that purpose. God here blessed the descendants of Abraham with the nobility of spirit and courage to fulfill the command to sanctify God even when self-sacrifice is required. Only the nation of Israel, Abraham’s children, were commanded to fulfill this mitzvoh, because of the legacy we inherited from him.—<i>Ha’amek Dovor.</i></i> as the stars of the sky and like the sand on the seashore, and your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies. Through your children, will be blessed all the nations of the world, because you heeded My voice.'" Abraham returned to his attendants, and they rose and went together to Beer Sheva, and Abraham dwelt in Beer Sheva.

A person should always be in fear of God, privately as well as openly,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Some people conduct themselves in a God-fearing manner in the presence of others (in public), but in the privacy of their homes, do whatever they please.

Rav Safra refused the increment because in his heart he had already accepted the original offer.</i> and rise early and proclaim:

<small>The Talmud (<i>Maseches Menachos</i> 110a) states: Rabbi Isaac asked, "Why does it say (<i>Leviticus</i> 6:18; 7:1) This is the <i>law</i> of the sin-offering, this is the <i>law</i> of the guilt-offering? To teach us that when one <i>studies</i> the <i>law</i> of the sin-offering, it is considered as though he had actually brought it on the Altar, and when one <i>studies</i> the <i>law</i> of the guilt-offering, it is as though he actually brought it on the Altar."</small> <small>Rather than merely recite the following portions, study them and attempt to learn about the laws and significance of the various sacrifices.</small>
<small>(Exodus 30:17-21)</small><br>And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say: Make a copper laver and a copper base, for washing; and place it between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar, and put water in it. Aaron and his sons will wash from it, their hands and their feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">His right hand was held above his right foot, the left hand above the left foot and all were washed simultaneously.—Maseches Zevachim 59</i> Upon entering the Tent of Meeting they will wash with water that they not die, or whenever they approach the Altar to serve, to burn a fire-offering to Adonoy. They will wash their hands and feet that they not die; and this is for them a perpetual statute for him [Aaron], and his descendants for all their generations.
<small>The following Scripture section describes the removal of the ashes which had accumulated on the Altar from the daily burnt-offering of the previous afternoon. This removal was performed prior to the daily morning burnt-offering. The passage below also describes the ritual of maintaining the wood pyres which were always burning on the Altar.</small>
<small>(Leviticus 6:1)</small><br>And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say: Command Aaron and his sons to say, this is the law of the burnt-offering. This is the burnt-offering [which must remain] on its pyre, upon the Altar all night, until morning, and the fire of the Altar will be kept burning on it. The Kohein will don his linen garment, and linen breeches upon his flesh, and he will remove the ashes when the fire consumes the burnt-offering on the Altar; and he will place them beside the Altar. He will remove his garments and don other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to an undefiled place. The fire upon the altar will be kept burning, it may not be extinguished. And the Kohein will burn wood on it every morning, and arrange on it the burnt-offering, and burn on it the fats of the peace-offerings. A constant fire will be kept burning on the Altar, it may not be extinguished.
<small>The <i>Tamid</i>-offerings, two daily offerings of one lamb at a time, were offered once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The former was the first public-offering brought on the Altar each day. And the latter terminated the day's offerings. These animals were purchased from the annual half-shekel gifts of the people and were offered on behalf of the entire Jewish People. Before reading this passage we offer a brief prayer.</small>
<small>Some do not say the following prayer on Sabbath and Yom Tov.</small>
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to have compassion on us, to forgive us all our sins, [done unknowingly], to atone all our iniquities, [done knowingly], to pardon all our [malicious] transgressions, and may You build the Holy Temple quickly, in our days, that we may offer, before You, the daily burnt-offering to atone for us, as You wrote for us in Your Torah by the hand of Moses, Your servant, from the mouth of Your Reverence, as it is said:
<small>(Numbers 28:1-8)</small><br>And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say: Command the Children of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Kohanim, Levites and Israelites were to be present at the offering of the two daily public burnt-offerings.

These representatives were rotated each week.</i> and say to them: My offering, My food, to be consumed by My fires, a pleasing odor to Me, You shall be diligent to bring unto Me, at its fixed time. And you will say to them: This is the fire-offering that you will bring unto Adonoy: [male] lambs, in their first year, without blemish, two [of them] each day, as a constant burnt-offering. Offer one lamb in the morning, and the second lamb, offer in the afternoon. And a tenth of an <i>ephah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">One-tenth of an <i>ephah</i> is the equivalent of 43-⅕ eggs.</i> of fine flour as a meal-offering, mixed with oil of crushed [olives] measuring one-fourth of a <i>hin.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>hin</i> is a liquid measure containing 12 <i>logs</i>, of which each <i>log</i> is approximately 6 eggs.</i> [This is] a constant burnt-offering as offered at Mount Sinai for a pleasing odor, a fire-offering to Adonoy. And its libation will be a fourth of a <i>hin</i> for the one lamb; in the Holy<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">On the Altar.</i> [Sanctuary] you will pour out a drink-offering of strong wine to Adonoy. And the second lamb you will offer in the afternoon; as the meal-offering of the morning [together] with its libation, you shall offer a fire-offering of pleasing odor to Adonoy.
<small>(Leviticus 1:11)</small><br>And he will slaughter it on the north side of the Altar, before Adonoy; and Aaron's sons, the Kohanim, will sprinkle its blood all around the Altar.
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, that this recitation be important, acceptable and desirable before You, as if we sacrificed the daily burnt-offering at its proper time, in its proper place and according to its laws.
You are Adonoy, our God, before Whom our fathers burned the incense of spices when the Holy Temple was standing, as You commanded them by the hand of Moses Your prophet, as it is written in Your Torah:
<small>(Exodus 30:34-36)</small><br>And Adonoy said to Moses, Take for yourself spices— stacte, onycha, and galbanum—<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Galbanum has an offensive odor. The Torah includes it among the other spices to teach us to include even Jewish sinners among the rest of Jewry at our assemblies of fasting and prayers.—<i>Rashi</i></i> spices, and pure frankincense, [they] shall be in equal weights. You will make it into incense, a compound mixed by a compounder, salted,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word, <i>memulach</i> is rendered by Onkelos as mixed, to indicate that the spices should be well mixed together.—<i>Rashi</i></i> undefiled, and holy. You will pulverize some of it very fine, and place it before the [Ark of] Testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This incense was offered each day upon the Innermost Altar which is inside the Tent of Meeting.—<i>Rashi</i></i> in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it will be to you holy of holies." It is also written:
<small>(Exodus 30:7-8)</small><br>And Aaron shall burn upon it [the Altar] incense of spices every morning; when he cleans the lamps he will burn it. And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon, he will burn it; a constant incense-offering before Adonoy throughout your generations.
<small>(Maseches Kreisos 6a; Jerusalem Talmud, Maseches Yoma 4:5)</small><br>The Rabbis taught: How was the incense compounded? Three hundred and sixty-eight <i>manim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>maneh</i> is a weight; plural, <i>manim</i>.</i> were comprised therein, three hundred and sixty-five corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, one <i>maneh</i> for each day— half in the morning and half in the afternoon. From the three remaining <i>manim</i> the Kohein Gadol brought two handfuls [into the Holy of Holies] on Yom Kippur; [for which purpose] they were put back into the mortar on the eve of Yom Kippur, and ground [again] very thoroughly, in order to make them very fine. Eleven kinds of spices were used for it. They were: 1) balm, 2) onycha, 3) galbanum, 4) frankincense— by weight, seventy <i>maneh</i> of each; 5) myrrh, 6) cassia, 7) spikenard and 8) saffron— in weight sixteen <i>maneh</i> of each; 9) twelve <i>maneh</i> of costus, 10) three of aromatic bark, and 11) nine of cinnamon. [Also used in the incense compound were:] Nine <i>kabin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kab</i> is a sixth of a <i>se’ah</i>.</i> of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three <i>s'in</i> and three <i>kabin</i>— if he had no Cyprus wine, he could use strong white wine— a fourth of a <i>kab</i> of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of <i>maaleh ashan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This herb causes the smoke of the burning incense to ascend in a straight line.</i> Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, Jordan amber was added of a minute quantity, and if one added honey,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Included are various sweeteners such as dates and other fruits.</i> it (the incense) became unfit; and if one omitted<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The same is true if one were to add to the prescribed number of eleven spices.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The death penalty was given only if the Kohein Gadol actually entered the Holy of Holies with incense which was unfit. This was considered as an unwarranted entry into the Holy of Holies which carried the death decree.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree. the lye of Carshina was used for rubbing the onycha in order to refine its appearance. The Cyprus wine was used to soak the onycha to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10 This water came from a well named Raglayim.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i> was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Mei Raglayim</i> (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple. Others hold that the term “waters of Raglayim” actually refers to urine, which could have been used as a soaking agent were it not indecent to bring it into a sacred place.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i>
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Rabbi Nosson says, While [the Kohein] ground [the incense] he would say, <i>‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,'</i> because the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the sound of these specific words affects the spices.</i> is good for the spices. If half<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">184 <i>manim</i> instead of 368.</i> the quantity of incense was prepared it was acceptable, but if only a third or a fourth [of it was prepared] we have not heard<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we did not hear our teachers expound this question.</i> [whether it was acceptable."] Rabbi Yehuda said, This is the general rule: If [it was prepared with all its ingredients] in the correct proportion, it is acceptable even if only half was prepared; but if he left out any of its spices, he was liable for the death penalty.
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Bar Kappara says, Once in sixty or seventy years<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The exact number of years varied with the size of the hands of the High Priests over the years, for the surplus was what remained of these three <i>manim</i> from which he took two handfuls each Yom Kippur.</i> the accumulated surplus was sufficient to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense."] Bar Kappara also taught, If he would have put into it a minute quantity of honey, no one could have withstood [resisted] the scent. Why was no honey mixed with it? Because the Torah says, (<i>Leviticus</i> 2:11) For any leaven or honey, do not burn from them, [as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.
<i>Recite each of these verses three times:</i>
Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob, Selah! Adonoy of Hosts, fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver [us]! The King will answer us on the day we call.
You are my shelter; from distress You preserve me; with glad song of rescue, You envelop me, Selah! Let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem, as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Therefore let it be Your will Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, that the prayer of our lips be considered, and accepted and regarded favorably before You, as if we had offered the Daily offering at its appointed time, and stood in attendance at its service, as it has been said,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 14:3.</i> Let the offering of our lips replace bullocks. And it is said, And he will slaughter it on the north side of the Altar, before Adonoy; and Aaron's sons, the Kohanim, will sprinkle its blood all around the Altar. And it is said, This is the law of the burnt-offering, the meal-offering, the sin-offering, the guilt-offering, the inauguration-offerings and the peace-offerings.
<i>On Rosh Chodesh add:</i>
And on your Rosh Chodesh days you shall bring a burnt-offering to Adonoy. Two young bullocks, one ram, seven male yearling lambs without blemish. And three-tenths [of an <i>epha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Three-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> is a measure in volume equal to the displacement of:129-3/5 eggs.</i>] of fine flour for a meal-offering mixed with the [olive] oil, for each bullock; and two-tenths<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Two-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> is the equivalent of 86-⅖ eggs.</i> of fine flour for a meal-offering mixed with the [olive] oil, for the one ram.

<small>The following sequence of Mishnayos and the selection from <i>Sifra</i> "Rabbi Yishmael Says," were inserted after the Scriptural selections dealing with daily-offerings in order to give every Jew the opportunity to study/recite daily, the minimum of selections from Scripture, Mishnah, and Talmud. Even though <i>Sifra</i> is not actually a Talmudic tractate, it is a Tanaitic expansion of Mishnah. (See Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 50:1).</small>

The sin-offerings burned there did not have to be burned by a Kohen, but could be burned by an Israelite.</i>
<b>MISHNAH III</b> The communal and individual sin-offerings— these are the communal sin-offerings: The he-goats offered on Rosh Chodesh and on the Festivals are slaughtered on the north side, and their blood must be received in a sacred vessel, on the north side; their blood requires four applications [one] on each of the four corners.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Outer Altar.</i> How [was this done]? He [the Kohein] went up the ramp [of the Altar]<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The ramp led up to the Altar from its south side. It was 32 cubits long and 16 cubits wide, and provided the Kohanim with access to the ledge which ran around the Altar, and upon which they were able to stand while performing their service.</i> and turned to the ledge [bordering the Altar]; he came to the southeast corner, the northeast corner, the northwest corner, the southwest corner.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">At each of these corners, he would apply the blood.</i> He poured the rest of the blood at the southern base [of the Altar].

May it be Your will Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, if I have committed a sin which requires, the bringing of a sin-offering, that this recitation be acceptable before you as if I had brought a sin-offering.
<b>MISHNAH IV</b> The burnt-offering is one of the holiest offerings.

May it be Your will Adonoy, our God, and God our our fathers, if I have committed a sin which requires the bringing of a guilt-offering that this recitation be acceptable before You as if I had brought a guilt-offering.

The portions of the sin-offerings were however restricted to the male Kohanim. [These slaves were circumcised and were responsible for mitzvos, similar to those incumbent upon women.]</i>
May it be Your will as if I brought a thanksgiving-offering.
<b>MISHNAH VII</b> The peace-offerings are [also] of lesser sanctity. They are slaughtered anywhere in the Courtyard, and their blood requires two applications which are [like] four.

B'raita d'Rabi Yishmael

Rabbi Yishmael says: through thirteen methods the Torah is expounded: 1) A conclusion drawn from a minor or lenient law, to a major or more strict one. 2) A clarification based on identical words or terms in the Biblical text. 3) A principle derived from one Biblical text or from two Biblical texts. 4) A rule followed by a detail. 5) A detail followed by a rule. 6) A rule followed by a detail, which is in turn followed by a rule, may infer only what is similar to the detail. 7) When a general rule requires an explicit rule; when an explicit rule requires generalization. 8) Something included in a general rule, which was singled out to teach— was not singled out to teach about itself, but to teach (something new) concerning the rule as a whole. 9) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out in a case similar to its rule, —it was singled out to lessen not to increase the severity of the case. 10) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out in a case which is not similar to its rule, —it was singled out either to lessen or to increase the severity of the case. 11) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out for a new stipulation— does not revert to its rule unless Scripture restores it to its rule expressly. 12) A matter deduced from its context, or from a subsequent expression. 13) Also, two passages that contradict each other until a third passage reconciles them.
May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days: and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years.
<small>Kaddish is not the name generally given to this prayer in the Talmud. It is referred to there as "May His great Name...", because the congregational response beginning with these words is the heart of this prayer. Only in one minor tractate, (<i>Maseches Soferim</i> 16, 19, and 21) is it referred to as Kaddish. Composed primarily in Aramaic, the language spoken and understood by most Jews in the Second Temple period (See <i>Tosafos</i> to <i>Maseches Berachos</i> 3a), nevertheless, several Hebrew phrases, which were familiar even to the unschooled, were also incorporated in the prayer. This particular form of Kaddish d'Rabanan, is so named because of the insertion of the paragraph which begins with the words "Upon Israel and upon our Sages, etc." This Kaddish is recited following the study of Talmud or Midrash and invokes God's blessings on the Sages of Jewry, the transmitters of the Oral Torah.</small>
Exalted and sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These opening words refer to the fulfillment of God’s prophecy, through Ezekiel (38:23) “And I will thus exalt Myself and sanctify Myself; and I will be known in the eyes of the many nations, and they will know that I am Adonoy.”—<i>Levush, Siddur HaGra</i>. One should be very careful to emphasize the letter gimel (ג) when saying the word “Yisgadal (יִתְגַּדַּל),” in order that it not be heard as “Yis<i>k</i>adal (יִתְקַּדַל),” from the word קְדָל which means neck.—<i>Mishnah Berurah 56:2</i></i> be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">May His sovereignty be revealed.</i> bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach.

May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase, the heart of the Kaddish, is found almost verbatim in Daniel 2:20.</i>

Upon Israel, and upon our Sages, and upon their disciples, and upon all the disciples of their disciples, and upon all those who engage in Torah study in this land and in every land. May there be unto them and unto you abundant peace, favor, kindness, compassion, long life, ample sustenance and redemption from their Father Who is in heaven and on earth, —and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and a good life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.
He Who makes peace (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace) in His high heavens may He, in His mercy, make peace for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.

Hodu

<small>The following sequence of prayers until Yishtabach is called <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i> (verses of praise). These selected Scriptural passages were arranged by the Gaonim of the ninth century, in fulfillment of the Talmudic statement (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 32a), "A person should always praise God first and make his requests [offer his prayers] afterwards." Beginning with the following prayer, it is forbidden to interrupt your prayer with conversation until after the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>. You are permitted to answer Amein, respond to <i>Barechu, Kaddish</i> and to say <i>Kedushah</i> even though you are in the midst of <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i>. You are also permitted to say <i>Modim d'Rabbonon</i> and the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> together with the congregation. If you are concerned that the saying of <i>Kerias Shema</i> will not be within the proper time should you follow the regular order of prayers, you are permitted to recite the entire <i>Kerias Shema</i> during the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i>. The first 28 verses of this section are taken from 1 Chronicles 16:8-36, and the first 15 are almost identical with the first fifteen verses of Psalms 105. These prayers are mentioned in <i>Maseches Soferim.</i></small>

<small>Psalm 30, once used to inaugurate the Holy Temple, is used today to inaugurate our daily prayers, for the synagogue is a "Holy Temple in miniature" and our prayers take the place of the sacrifices. It is both a prayer for success and a declaration of thanksgiving.</small>
A Psalm, a song for the inauguration of the Temple, by David.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Solomon built the Temple. Why, then, is its inauguration attributed to David?

The downtrodden state of the Jewish people is actually part of their uplifting says the <i>Sfas Emes,</i> as it is said, “when I was brought low, He delivered me” (Psalms 116:6). “My downtrodden state was the cause of my salvation,” proclaims David, just as when one lowers a bucket (דלי) into a well in order to bring up the water.</i> and not let my foes rejoice over me. Adonoy, my God, I cried out to You, and You healed me. Adonoy, You have raised my soul from the lower world. You have kept me alive, lest I descend to the Pit.

Deliver us Adonoy, our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to Your holy Name— to be extolled in Your praise. Blessed is Adonoy, God of Israel from the world till the next world and all the people said: "Amen, Praise God." Let every soul praise God. Praise God.
To the Chief Musician: a Psalm with instrumental music, a song. [May] God favor us and bless us, [may He] cause His countenance to shine among us <i>Selah</i>; [So] that Your way become known on earth, [and] Your deliverance among all nations. Peoples will thank You, God, all the peoples will thank You. Nations will rejoice and sing when You judge the peoples justly, and lead the nations upon the earth <i>Selah</i>.

<small>Psalm 100 was recited in the Temple only on those days when thank-offerings were offered on the Altar. It is therefore omitted on Shabbos, on Yom Tov, on the day before Yom Kippur, on the day before Pesach, and also on the intermediate days of Pesach, when only obligatory-offerings were offered. Our Sages declare (<i>Midrash Rabbah Tzav,</i> 9) "In the future, even though all things on earth will be in such an ideal state that there will be no more cause for prayers and offerings, prayers of gratitude, and offerings of thanksgiving will nevertheless not cease." Ordinarily, when a person is saved from a fatal illness, is released from captivity, or returns from a risky journey, he pronounces the special blessing <i>Hagomeil</i>. Our Sages, instituted psalm 100 in our daily prayers as an expression of thanks for the many unrecognized miracles God performs in our behalf every day.</small>
A psalm of thanksgiving: Shout for joy to Adonoy, everyone on earth. Serve Adony with joy,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To serve God means to devote every moment of one's life to the execution of God's will.

<small>This prayer, mentioned in <i>Maseches Sof'rim</i> 17:11 is a collection of 18 verses from<i> Psalms, Chronicles,</i> and <i>Proverbs,</i> in which the Divine Name (הויה) is mentioned 18 times. Great care should be taken to pronounce the "Name" with the utmost concentration, keeping in mind that He is the Supreme Master of all that exists.</small>

<small>Rav S.R. Hirsch writes that the six concluding chapters of the Book of Psalms are the most important gift of David's Divinely-inspired hymns that Israel treasures so greatly. These six psalms, 145-150, are an essential component of our daily prayers. Our Sages attach much significance to Psalm 145 in particular, and stated: "Whoever recites ‘A praise by David' three times a day is assuredly worthy of a share in the world to come" (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 4b). When recited in prayer this psalm is always introduced with two verses from other Psalms (84:5 and 144:15). These verses contain the word fortunate three times, an allusion to this psalm being recited three times a day. These verses are so closely identified with Psalm 145 that it is commonly referred to as <i>Ashrei</i> (Fortunate).</small>
Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This verse referred to the Kohanim and the Levites who served (dwelt) in the Holy Temple (Your House); it is at all times applicable to scholars and devout men who study and pray in houses of worship and study.</i> may they continue to praise You, Selah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 84:5.</i> Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 144:15.</i> A praise by David!

Hirsch, David here declares, “I will dedicate myself to serve You and to fulfill Your will in loyal obedience,” for in serving God, man causes His Name to be blessed.</i> and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works, and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Not simply נפלאתיך—a report of Your wonders—but דברי נפלאתיך the “words"—the lessons that Your wonders teach.—<i>S.R.

Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult.

He makes heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them; He keeps His promises faithfully forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">He alone has always proven dependable and faithful, for there are no limits to His essence and to His power.—<i>Ibn Ezra, Radak</i></i> He performs justice for the oppressed; He gives bread to the hungry; Adonoy releases the imprisoned. Adonoy gives sight to the blind; Adonoy straightens the bent. Adonoy loves the righteous. Adonoy protects strangers; the orphan and widow He enables to stand firm; and the way of the wicked He thwarts. Adonoy will reign forever; your God, Zion, throughout all generations. Praise God.
<small>In this Psalm, David imparts the knowledge to sustain and uphold the Jewish People, during their bitter exile. He tells them of their special and enduring relationship with God and of their role as permanent messengers of the word of God to all mankind.</small>
Praise God! for it is good to sing to our God; for [His] praise is pleasant, befitting. The builder of Jerusalem is Adonoy; the banished ones of Israel He will gather. [He is] the Healer of the broken-hearted and [also] binds up their wounds.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Others render “their sorrows.” Both translations co-exist!

Adonoy causes the humble to stand firm; He casts down the wicked to the ground. Cry out to Adonoy in thanksgiving; sing to our God with the harp.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Each musical instrument has its unique function. In the times of King David, the harp was used to arouse those who slept. The psalmist may be indicating that the harp arouses the sleeping soul of man to recognition of the miraculous ways in which God shows His Divine Providence for us every day.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> [He] Who covers the heaven with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth; Who causes grass to grow upon the hills. Who gives the animal its fodder; [also] to the young ravens which call. Not the power of the horse does He desire, nor the thighs of man does He want.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">God does not delight in those who place their trust in the strength of horses or in their own strength.—<i>Tzelosa d'Avrohom</i></i> Adonoy wants those who fear Him, those who hope for His kindliness. Jerusalem, praise Adonoy; Zion, extol your God.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Psalmist addresses the dwellers in Jerusalem and Zion, not the city itself.—<i>Tzelosa d'Avrohom</i></i> For He has fortified the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children in your midst. He established peace at your border; with prime wheat He satisfies you. He dispatches His command earthward; His word races swiftly. He provides snow like fleece, He scatters frost like ashes. He hurls His ice like crumbs; who can withstand His cold? He dispatches His word and melts them; He blows His wind, they flow as water. He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His laws to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is the receiver and preserver of God's divine Law, the Torah, which includes <i>chukim, </i>statutes which confine the physical, sensual aspects of man within the bounds of moral purity, and also <i>mishpotim,</i> laws which govern communal life. Among the nations, law is determined by the views they hold at a given time and place concerning the needs of a society, and so their laws are based on expediency.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> He did not do so to any [other] nation; and of His laws they were not informed. Praise God.
<small>In this psalm, David sings of the moment when all the world will be imbued with the knowledge of God's all-embracing providence. All living creatures—from the infinite heights of heaven above (verses 1-7) down to the depths of the earth below (verses 7-12)—will join together in one great hymn of praise to their Creator, and acknowledge the uniqueness of Israel over all other nations.</small>

<small>The following selections are additions to the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah.</i> The custom of reciting them is mentioned as early as the Gaonic era, specifically by Rav Amram Gaon. The first four verses (1 Chronicles 29:10-13) relate David's blessing to God, when he presented the gold, silver, and jewels he amassed for the construction of the Holy Temple. It was a day of great rejoicing as, following David's example, the leaders and princes also presented generous gifts for the construction of the Temple. These verses were incorporated into our daily prayers because they speak so eloquently of God's majesty, and of the Divine providence which is the source of the power, riches, might, and honor of all human beings.</small>

And David blessed Adonoy in the presence of all the assembly; and David said, Blessed are You, Adonoy, God of Israel, our father,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">David singles out Jacob because he was the first Patriarch to mention building a house of God (Genesis 28:22), “Then shall this stone which I have set for a pillar be God's house.”—<i>Radak</i></i> forever and ever. Yours, Adonoy, is the greatness, the might, the glory the victory and the beauty,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">David thus renders unto God the greatness God has given him. His might in war, his victories in battle, and the majesty of his kingdom, are all due to God's providence.—<i>Iyun T'filah</i></i> for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours, Adonoy, is the kingdom and You are uplifted, [supreme] over all rulers. The riches and the honor come from You, and You rule over all; in Your hand are power and might, and [it is] in Your hand to bestow greatness and strength upon all. And now, our God, we give thanks to You and praise Your glorious Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I Chronicles 29:10-13.</i>
You alone are Adonoy;<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This is an affirmation of God's unity: “Adonoy is One.” The next six verses are taken from Nehemiah 9:6-11. They are the last words of praise found in Scripture.</i> You have made the skies, the skies of skies<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This denotes the highest of the seven heavens.</i> and all their hosts,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This signifies the sun, moon, and stars.</i> the earth and all that is upon it, the seas and all that is in them; and You give life to all of them, and the heavenly hosts<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">These are the angelic beings that worship Adonoy.</i> bow before You. You are Adonoy, the God Who chose Avrom, and brought him out of Ur Kasdim and established his name (as) Avrohom.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This was not a mere changing of names. Abraham was elevated and attained new stature as a patriarch by virtue of his new name.</i> And You found his heart faithful before You,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">This was demonstrated when he was ready to sacrifice Isaac.</i>
and You made the covenant with him<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In some congregations, וכרות is recited responsively on the day of a circumcision. Consequently, some <i>siddurim</i> indicate that a new paragraph begins here. But it is actually a continuation of the verse.</i> to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give to his seed; and You kept Your word, for You are righteous. And You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and their cry You heard at the Sea of Reeds. And You imposed signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for You knew that they acted malevolently against them;<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Them, i.e., the Jews in Egypt.</i> and (thus) You have made a name for Yourself, like this day.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The miracles and wonders of the Exodus have not and will not be forgotten. Each generation reaffirms its testimony to God's might against the Egyptians and thus the event remains as vivid and real as though it occurred today.</i> And the sea, You split before them, and they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers You hurled into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Nechemyah 9:6-11</i>
<small>In Temple times Shiras Hayam, the Song of the Sea, was sung by the Levites when the daily afternoon sacrifice was offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maseches Rosh Hashanah</i> 31a, mentions that the Ode was sung at <i>Minchah</i> on Shabbos.</i> After the destruction, the Jews of the Holy Land continued the tradition, reciting the Shira at the end of the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah.</i> The custom spread to Italy and from there to other Jewish communities. This daily recital is mentioned by Rav Saadya Gaon but not as an obligatory part of the service. Rambam calls it a "custom."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchos Tefillah</i> 7:13.</i> Subsequently adopted by all communities, reciting the Shira became an integral part of our daily prayers. Some hold that the Shira should be chanted aloud while standing. It should be sung with joy as at the time of the Exodus. <i>"Sheloh"</i> writes that reciting the Shira atones for sin, so that if one wishes to repent a serious sin, he should recite the Shira every day with great fervor. The <i>Zohar</i> says, "If one recites this song with elation and joy, he will be worthy to sing it in the next world. He will also be worthy to sing it when he greets the Messiah."</small>
On that day,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even though they had been freed a week earlier, they were insecure, fearing that the Egyptians would capture and re-enslave them. Only when God had drowned the Egyptians were the Israelites psychologically free.—<i>Seporno</i></i> Adonoy delivered Israel from the hand of Egypt, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. And Israel saw the great hand<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The use of the word “hand” or any physical attribute with regard to God is merely metaphorical, since God is in no way physical.</i> which Adonoy wielded against Egypt, and the people feared Adonoy, and they believed in Adonoy, and that Moses was His servant.
Then Moses and the Children of Israel sang this song to Adonoy, and they said: I will sing to Adonoy for He is most high;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">When people praise a mortal, they often declare undeserved praise. But God is so great that any praise we offer is insufficient.—<i>Rashi</i></i> the horse with its rider, He threw into the sea. The strength and retribution of God was the cause of my deliverance;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows Rashi's commentary.</i> this is my Almighty and I will glorify Him, God of my father and I will exalt Him. Adonoy is master of war Adonoy is His Name. Pharaoh's chariots and army, He hurled into the sea; and his elite officers were drowned in the Sea of Reeds. The deep waters covered them; they descended into the depths like stone. Your right hand Adonoy is adorned with power, Your right hand Adonoy crushes the enemy. And in Your great majesty, You destroyed Your opponents; You sent forth Your fury, it consumed them like straw.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is also translated, “You <i>will</i> send forth Your fury: it <i>will</i> consume them like straw.” According to the <i>Zohar,</i> it thus refers to the time of the Resurrection, when God will destroy all the wicked.</i> And with the wind from Your nostrils the waters were heaped up, flowing water stood erect like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The water became hard as stone and the Egyptians were hurled against it with great force.—<i>Rash i</i></i> The enemy (Pharaoh) said: I will pursue [them], I will overtake [them], I will divide the spoils; I will satisfy myself; I will unsheathe my sword, my hand will destroy them. You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Seporno</i> and others interpret the verse to read: “They, the mighty, sank like lead in the waters,” “mighty,” referring to the Egyptian officers rather than to the waters.</i> Who is like You among the mighty, Adonoy! who is like You? [You are] adorned in holiness, awesome in praise, performing wonders.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God is “awesome in praise” for we fear that all our praise will prove inadequate. In truth, it is impossible to praise God fully, and David therefore said (Psalms 65:2) “For You, silence is praise.”<i>—Rashi</i></i> You stretched out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them. You led in Your kindliness, the people whom You redeemed; You guided them with Your might to Your holy dwelling place. The peoples heard and trembled, pangs of fear gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Philistines had killed the Ephraimites thirty years earlier when they left Egypt by force. The Philistines were thus gripped with terror when they heard that Israel had escaped from Egypt.—<i>Rashi</i></i> Then the chieftains of Edom panicked, the mighty men of Moab were seized with trembling, all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Nations on all sides panicked: The Philistines to the west, the Edomites to the south, the Moabites to the east and the Canaanites to the north. The Philistines feared revenge. The Edomites panicked because they feared that Israel would now seek revenge for what Esau (Edom) had done to Jacob. The Moabites, the descendants of Lot, feared they would be punished because of the dispute between Lot and Abraham (Genesis 13:7). Canaan “melted away” because they realized that Israel was destined to take their land, and their astrologers told them that there was no way out.—<i>Rabbeinu Bachya</i></i> Terror and dread fall upon them; at the greatness of Your arm they were still as stone; until Your people cross over, Adonoy, until [they] cross over,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The two crossings are the respective crossings of the Arnon and the Jordan rivers before entering the Promised Land.—<i>Onkelos</i></i> —the people You have acquired. You will bring them and plant them<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Moses here prophesied that he would not be entering the Promised Land, and he therefore prayed that God should bring the Jews into His inheritance.— <i>Rashi</i></i> on the mountain of Your inheritance, the place for Your habitation which You, Adonoy, have made; the Sanctuary, my Master, [which] Your hands established.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">God's “habitat” on earth, the Holy Temple, is a parallel of the Holy Temple on <i>high</i>.—<i>Rashi</i></i> Adonoy will reign forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is not repeated in <i>Exodus.</i> But it is repeated in prayer to signify the end of the Ode, just as the last verse of Psalms 150 is repeated in the prayer whereas it is not repeated in the <i>Book of Psalms</i>.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Adonoy will reign forever and ever. Adonoy! His sovereignty is established forever and to all eternity.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is a paraphrase of the previous verse as found in <i>Targum Onkelos.</i></i> When Pharaoh's horses, with his chariots, and his horsemen, went into the sea, Adonoy turned back on them the waters of the sea; and the Children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 14:30-15:19.</i> For the kingship is Adonoy's and He rules over nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 22:29. The word “king” signifies one whose leadership is accepted freely by all his subjects. Therefore, in reference to Israel who willingly accept the Kingship of God, it says, “For the kingship is Adonoy's.” A “ruler,” however, is one who forcibly rules people, without their consent. Regarding the nations who do not willingly submit to Adonoy's Kingship, the Psalmist says, “And He <i>rules</i> over nations.”<i>—Vilna Gaon</i></i> And deliverers will go up to Mount Zion to judge Mount Esau, and the kingdom will be Adonoy's.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ovadyah 1:21.</i> And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Zecharyah 14:9. In the future, God will be recognized by all the nations of the world who will accept Him willingly as their King.</i>

Yishtabach

<small>Rabbeinu Alfasi (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 32) refers to <i>Baruch She'amar</i> as the opening blessing of the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah,</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> as the concluding blessing.</small>
Praised be Your Name forever,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Your praise is unlimited in terms of time; You will be praised forever.—<i>Ya'avetz</i></i> our King, Almighty the great and holy King in heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Your praise is unlimited in terms of place; You will be praised in heaven as well as on earth.—<i>Ya'avetz</i></i> and on earth. For to You it is fitting [to offer] Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, (forever,) song and praise, glorification and hymns, [to proclaim your] strength and dominion, victory, grandeur, and might, praise and glory, holiness and sovereignty, blessings and thanksgivings,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Fifteen words of praise and adoration are enumerated. Hebrew is remarkably rich in the vocabulary of adoration and worship. As Latin is the language of war and Greek of oratory, so is Hebrew the language of prayer.—<i>Midrash</i></i> to your great and holy name; and from the highest world to the lowest you are Almighty. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Almighty, King [Who is] great in [our] praise Almighty, of [to Whom we offer our] thanksgiving, Master of [Whom we praise for His] wonders,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These lines were translated according to the explanation of the <i>Tzelosa d'Avrohom.</i></i> creator of all souls master of all creatures the Selector of song-hymns, You are the only King, Almighty, Life of [all] the worlds.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i><br><small>In this Psalm, said during the Ten Days of Penitence, the Jewish soul sings of the Jewish spirit ascending from the depths of the deepest misery of all, the burden of sin and guilt.</small>
A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I have called to You, Adonoy. My Master, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If You God should take account of iniquities, my Master, who could survive? For with You is forgiveness, in order that You be feared. I hope for Adonoy, my soul hopes; and for His word, I wait. My soul [waits] for my Master more than the watchman [waits] for the morning, [more than] the watchman [waits] for the morning. Wait, Israel, upon Adonoy, for with Adonoy there is loving-kindness, and with Him there is much redemption. And He will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.
<small>The Half-Kaddish is recited by the Chazzan</small><br><small>Here, as elsewhere in the Liturgy, the Half-Kaddish marks the end of a distinct section of the prayers, in this case, the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah.</i> It is called the Half-Kaddish, the final three verses of the complete Kaddish having been omitted.</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

The Shema

<small>It has become a universally-accepted custom to recite <i>Barechu</i> before proceeding to the blessings of <i>Shema. Barechu,</i> like <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>Kedushah,</i> cannot be recited unless a quorum—a <i>minyan</i> of ten adult males—is present. <i>Barechu</i> is also said by one who is called upon to read from the Torah. The practice of saying <i>Barechu</i> is mentioned numerous times in the Talmud. It is even cited in the Mishna (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 49b) in the names of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael.</small>
<i>The Chazzan says:</i>
<b>Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.</b>
<i>The Congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</i>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever.
<small>The two blessings יוֹצֵר אוֹר "He Who forms light" and אַהֲבָה רַבָּה "Great love," are referred to as the blessings preceding Shema (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 11a). According to Rambam they were formulated by Ezra and his Court (<i>Laws of Shema</i> 1:7). You may not interrupt your prayers from this point on until after the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>. But you may answer "Amein" to the blessings of הָאֵל הַקָּדוֹשׁ "The holy Powerful One" and שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָּה "He Who heeds prayer;" say the thrice-repeated קָדוֹשׁ "Holy…" and בָּרוּךְ כְּבוֹד "Blessed is the glory…" of <i>Kedushah</i>; and answer <i>Barechu.</i> You may also answer אָמֵן יְהֵא שְׁמֵהּ רַבָּא "Amein, May His great Name," when you hear Kaddish." You may also answer Amein after the blessings of יוֹצֵר הַמְּאוֹרוֹת, "Who forms the luminaries," and הַבּוֹחֵר בְּעַמּוֹ יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּאַהֲבָה, "Who chooses His people Israel with love." For a more detailed exposition of these laws, see <i>Metsudah Kitzur Shulchan Aruch,</i> Vol. I, pp. 172-176.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Former<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Forming, יוצר, is the act of refining or modifying an original substance, whereas, creating, בורא, refers to creating the original substance from nothing. For example, when one shapes a wooden table, to make it round, he “forms” the wood, the original substance which was “created.” Similarly, God “forms the light” which is His act of modifying or limiting the darkness He created.—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> of light, Creator of darkness, Maker<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Making, עושה, is the act of completion, such as when one completes a table by painting it. Similarly, God's finishing touch of creation is “making peace,” the vessel that holds it all together, as stated in the Mishna, “God found no vessel to contain blessing other than peace.” לא מצא הקב״ה כלי מחזיק ברכה אלא השלום—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> of peace, Creator<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Isaiah 45:7, on which this blessing is based concludes with the words, “and creates evil.” In His original creation, God created the potential for evil, which He constantly limits and controls as the Former and Maker.—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> of all things.
He illuminates the earth [and provides light] for those who dwell on it with compassion;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">God causes light to appear in stages, gradually. This is an act of great compassion for if He made it appear all at once, we would be overwhelmed and blinded by its brightness.— <i>Avudraham</i></i> and in His goodness renews every day, continually,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God is not a far-off observer of a mechanism which He created and ignores, but a Living Ruler, Who guides the universe and continually maintains it.</i> the work of creation. How many are Your works, Adonoy; You made them all with wisdom, the earth is full of Your possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Lit., Your acquisitions: See Genesis 14:22.</i> The King Who alone is exalted from then,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., before Creation, See p. 9: God was King before all creatures were created.</i> Who is praised and glorified and uplifted, from the beginning of time.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after Creation. Ever since Creation, God has been praised and glorified by His creatures.</i> Eternal God, in Your abundant mercy, have compassion on us, Master, Who is our strength, Rock, Who is our stronghold Shield, of our deliverance, [Be] a stronghold for us. The blessed Almighty, great in knowledge, prepared and made the rays of the sun. [The] Good [One] created [everything] for the glory of His Name:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Isaiah 43:7: “All that is called by My Name, I have created for My glory.”<i>—Avudraham</i></i> the luminaries He set around His strength (His throne). The chiefs of His hosts are holy beings,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Holy beings” are angels. In Hebrew, the word for angels means messenger, and includes all the instruments of Divine purpose, whether in human form, or in the forces of nature.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> the exalters of Shadai<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A name of God (Genesis 17:1; 35:11; 43:14, etc.) which refers to His setting boundaries and limits throughout creation.</i> continually recount the glory of the Almighty and His holiness.

The rest are evidence of His astonishing wisdom and arouse the others to praise Him.</i>
Be blessed eternally our Former,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Some render צורנו “our Rock.” The Gaon of Vilna, however, maintains that it refers to God as our Creator, thus describing Him in the tri-epochal aspect of His Unity: past, present, and future. He <i>was</i> our Creator, He <i>is</i> our King, and He <i>will</i> be our Redeemer.</i> our King, and our Redeemer—Creator of holy beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">These are the Jewish People, who are sanctified in body and soul. The word Creator implies a creation of real substance—the Jewish People rather than angels.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> Praised be Your Name forever, our King, Who forms ministering angels; and Whose ministering angels all stand at the height of the Universe, and proclaim with reverence, in unison aloud the words of the living God, King of the Universe. All of them are beloved,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beloved</i>—there is no envy, jealousy or rivalry among them. <i>Pure</i>—they have no selfish or ulterior motives; they serve God with all their being.—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> all of them are pure, all of them are mighty; all are holy and all of them perform with awe and reverence the will of their Possessor. And they all open their mouths in holiness and purity, with song and music, and they bless, and praise, and glorify, and revere, and sanctify, and proclaim the sovereignty of—

And they all take upon themselves the yoke<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The yoke of Divine Sovereignty is borne willingly and joyfully by each creature as an emblem of his free service to God.—<i>S.R.

On the contrary, each says to the other, “You begin, because you are greater and more worthy than I.”—<i>Avos of R’ Nosson</i></i> to sanctify their Former in a spirit of serenity with clear speech and pleasantness,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The clear speech of the angels is the holy tongue (pure Hebrew).—<i>Ya'avetz</i></i> all exclaim Kedushah in unison, with awe, and reverently exclaim:
Holy, holy, holy is Adonoy of Hosts, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:3. <i>Targum Yonoson</i> paraphrases this verse: “Holy [is God] in the highest heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His almighty power; holy [is He] forever and for all eternity.” The Talmud, (<i>Masechcs Chulin</i> 91b) refers to this verse as the “Sanctification of the Angels.” According to <i>Avudraham</i> and <i>Ya'avetz;</i> this <i>Kedushah</i> has been inserted here to refute those who maintain that God relinquished His control over the heavenly bodies, and they are now able to function independently. We are therefore told that all the heavenly hosts proclaim God's sanctification and dominion over all the universe.</i>
And the Ofanim<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ofanim, Chayos haKodesh,</i> and <i>Serafim</i> are various classes of Angels. <i>Ofanim</i> denotes animated wheels as conceived in association with the Heavenly throne. (<i>Avudraham</i>); <i>Chayos</i> are those angels who exist eternally (<i>Ya'avetz;</i> some angels exist only for short times for specific functions.) <i>Serafim</i> indicate “beings of fire.”</i> and the holy Chayos, with a mighty sound rise toward the Serafim. Facing them, they offer praise and say,
Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from His place.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 3:12. According to the <i>Kuzari,</i> God's glory is a euphemism for God Himself. Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: God is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view set forth in the <i>Kuzari</i> is that “God's glory” includes the angels. His throne, His chariot, the firmament, and the spheres. These are called God's glory, similar to a king's retinue, which is his royal splendor.</i>
To the Blessed Almighty, they<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The angels.</i> offer pleasant melodies; to the King, the Almighty, [Who is] living and enduring, they utter hymns and make praises heard. For He alone, exalted and holy is the Performer of mighty deeds, Maker of new things; Master of battles, Sower of acts of righteousness,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Pinchos ben Ya'ir was given two measures of barley for safekeeping. The owner forgot about it for a number of years. Rabbi Pinchos ben Ya'ir planted the barley seed, and each year replanted the previous year's harvest until it grew to be a substantial crop. After seven years, the owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchos told him, “Come I will show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” God does the same with the good and righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive his reward, God returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated dividends.—<i>Midrash Rabba, </i>Deuteronomy 3:6</i> Causer of deliverance to sprout forth; Creator of cures. Awesome in praise, Master of wonders, He renews in His goodness, each day, continuously,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since the blessing began with the praise of God as the Former of light Who continually renews the creation, it concludes on the same note.</i> the work of creation, as it is said: "[Give thanks to Him] Who makes the great luminaries," for His kindness is everlasting."<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 136:7.</i> (and He fashioned the luminaries, bringing joy to the world He created) Shine a new light upon Zion,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">We pray that we will be worthy of enjoying the original light of creation, which God put aside for the righteous in the future world.—<i>Ya'avetz</i></i> and may we all soon be privileged to [enjoy] its brightness. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Former of the luminaries.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—<i>Kuzari</i></i>
<small>In the second of the blessings that precede <i>Shema</i> we praise God for His goodness in giving us His Torah, and pray for His help in the study of Torah. None of our petitions for the material goods of life approaches the fervor of this prayer for knowledge of the Torah and steadfastness in obeying it.</small>
[With] everlasting love You have loved us<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kuzari</i> writes, “When reciting the blessing ׳Unbounded Love’ אהבה רבה, one should bear in mind that God's Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of God's will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called “love.”</i> Adonoy, our God; [With] great and abundant pity<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">God bestowed His great and abundant pity on us after we sinned in making the golden calf. He not only pardoned us, but gave us the Second Tablets and ordained the construction of the Tabernacle (<i>Mishkan</i>) for His Divine Presence to dwell among us.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> have You pitied us. Our Father, our King! for the sake of your great Name and for the sake of our forefathers who trusted in You, and whom You taught statutes of life, carry out your will with a perfect heart, so too, be gracious to us and teach us. Our Father, merciful Father, Who acts with compassion have compassion on us and put into our hearts [comprehension] to understand and to be intellectually creative, to listen, to learn, and to teach, to preserve, to practice, and to fulfill<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">We <i>preserve</i> the Torah by not forgetting its teachings; we <i>practice</i> the commandments and we <i>fulfill</i> them by making them permanent parts of our lives.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> all the words of instruction in Your Torah with love. And enlighten our eyes in Your Torah, and cause our hearts to hold fast to Your commandments, and unify<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Make us single-hearted and undivided in our love and reverence of Your Name.

Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who chooses His people Israel with love.
<small>The recitation of Shema was part of the daily worship in the Holy Temple, and our Sages ordained that it be recited in the synagogue service, providing it a central place in the morning and evening prayers of each Jew. Its importance may be judged from the fact that the very first Mishnah in the Oral Torah opens with the question, "From what time may the evening Shema be read?"<br>In reading Shema, bear in mind that you are performing a Scriptural commandment. All three paragraphs should be read with <i>kavanah,</i> concentrated intention, on what you are saying. The entire Shema should be recited in awe and reverence as it proclaims the existence and unity of God; the Jews' complete dedication to God and His commandments; the belief in Divine justice; the remembrance of the Exodus and the selection of the Jews as God's Chosen People. These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָל֯־לְ֯בָבְךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.</small>
<i>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</i>
(Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Israel:</b> <b>Adonoy is our God,</b> <b>Adonoy is One.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שמע and last letter of אחד arc written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עד “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to God's oneness.—<i>Avudraham</i><br>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all of one's thoughts on God's oneness. The last word, אחד, “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that God, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Israel, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i>
<i>The following two lines are to be said silently:</i>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,׳ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Israel” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Jacob said, “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moses did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Jacob ordained it?” Thus, the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—<i>Maseches Pesachim</i> 56a.<br>When Moses went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise God by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say ברוך שם aloud.—<i>Midrash Rabba</i> to <i>Deuteronomy</i></i>
And you shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages (<i>Sifrei</i> to Deuteronomy 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to God's Law and make them instruments for His service.</i> and with all your soul<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved God with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.</i> and with all your possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to God and to Torah might entail.</i> And these words which I command you today,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The teachings of the Torah should be ever fresh in your minds, as though you received it <i>today</i>.—<i>Ibid.</i></i> shall be upon your heart.

And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:5-9. This paragraph contains 10 commandments: 1) accepting the “yoke” of heaven; 2) proclaiming the Unity of God; 3) loving God; 4) studying Torah (and you shall speak of them); 5) teaching your children; 6-7) reciting Shema in the evening and in the morning; 8-9) putting on the <i>tefillin</i> of the hand and head; 10) putting up <i>mezuzos</i> on the door-posts.</i>

And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda bar Chaviva said that this third section was added to <i>Shema</i> because of six important things contained therein: 1. the commandment of fringes, 2. mention of the Exodus, 3. the call to assume the yoke of God׳s commandments, 4. the warning against heretical concepts, 5. the warning against straying after sinful desires, and 6. the warning against idolatrous worship.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 12b</i> to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations; and they will place with the fringes of each corner a thread of blue. And it will be to you for fringes, and you will look upon it and you will remember all the commandments of Adonoy,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Meir says: “The blue thread of the fringes resembles the sea, the sea reflects the heavens, and heavens resemble the Throne of Glory” (<i>Sifrei</i>).

<small>You must be careful to connect the last words of Shema, ה' אֱלֺקֵיכֶם (Adonoy, your God), with the word אמת (is true) without pause or interruption so that these three words form one sentence, meaning "Adonoy your God is true" (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 13a).</small>
—is true—
<i>The chazan repeats:</i>
Adonoy, your God, is true.
<small>The following prayer, which culminates with גָאַל יִשְׂרָאַל, Who redeemed Israel, constitutes the "Blessing after Shema" mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 11a). It is also mentioned in <i>Maseches Tamid</i> (32b) as part of the morning service in the Temple.</small>
—and firm, certain and enduring, upright and faithful, beloved and cherished, desired and pleasant,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Jew declares his commitment to God, and states that His precepts are not forced upon him.

Thus we say in the following prayer: “For our fathers, for us, for our children and for our descendants—Your word is good and lasting—a Law that will never be abrogated.”—<i>Kuzari</i></i> His words are alive and enduring, faithful and desirable forever and to all eternity; for our fathers and for us, for our children and for our generations, and for all generations of the seed of Israel, Your servants.

Since we are not that righteous, God shields and delivers us even though we have no merit.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> of our fathers You have always been.

<small>Fundamentals of <i>Kuzari,</i> (Metsudah Publications, 1979) pages 269, 271, 273.<br>When reciting <i>Shemoneh Esrei,</i> you must adhere to these rules:<br>1. Before beginning the prayer, take three steps backwards and then return to your former position. Upon completing the prayer, take three steps backwards and return.<br>2. Keep your feet together.<br>3. Concentrate on the meaning of the words you are uttering. Remove all distracting thoughts and worries from your mind.<br>4. You may not interrupt <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> by talking, not even by answering Amein. If you should hear <i>Kedushah, Kaddish,</i> or <i>Barechu</i> while saying the <i>Shemoneh Esrei,</i> you should remain silent and listen to the Chazzan's words.<br>5. At the beginning and end of the first blessing, at the beginning and end of the blessing that begins: "We are thankful to You," (page 133) and ends with "The Beneficent is Your Name," (page 140) we half-kneel and bow in the following manner: At the word "Blessed," bend your knees; at the word "You," bend forward until the vertebrae of your spinal cord are loosened; at "Adonoy," return to your upright position in keeping with the verse, "Adonoy straightens the bent" (Psalms 146:8).<br>6. Each individual recites <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> in silence. Only the prayer leader, the <i>Chazzan,</i> ever recites it aloud, and then only after the entire congregation, himself included, has recited it silently.</small>

<b><small>THE VIRTUE OF OUR FOREFATHERS</small></b>

<small>If you forgot to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing, you should recite it. If you have already said "Blessed are You Adonoy," you must continue the prayers without saying "Remember."</small>
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God is a <i>helper</i> in all the fortunes of life by giving us the necessary energy and talents to succeed. He <i>delivers</i> us from both moral and physical suffering, and He <i>shields</i> us by keeping tragedy and evil influences from us.</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">These words complete the first blessing of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called “Avos” (Patriarchs). And here too we bend our knees and bow when saying, “Blessed are You.” The major theme of this section is to praise God as “the Great”, as manifested in the Divine protection and providence He gave to the Patriarchs, of whom Abraham was the first.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i>
<b><small>DIVINE MIGHT</small></b>
You are mighty forever,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">God's rule of the world is permanent and perpetual.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is the emphatic expression of our belief in the immortality of the soul.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> the Powerful One<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This passage begins the section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called “Gevuros” (Might) and its major theme is to praise God as “the Mighty One.” Who alone restores man to life, health, freedom, and well-being.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> to deliver us.
<i>From the Musaf of the first day of Pesach until the Musaf of Shemini Atzeres one should say:</i>
He causes the dew to descend.
<i>From the Musaf of </i>Shemini Atzeres<i> until the </i>Musaf<i> of the first day of Pesach you should say:</i>
Causer of the wind to blow and of the rain to fall.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God's might is as much manifested in causing the rain as it is in reviving the dead. In fact the Talmud (<i>Maseches Taanis</i> 7a) declares in the name of Rabbi Avohu: “The day when rain falls is greater than the day of the resurrection of the dead.” Rabbi Yochanan said, (<i>Ibid,</i> 2a): “There are three ׳keys’ which God retains in His own hands and does not entrust to any emissary: the key to rain, the key to childbirth, and the key to the resurrection of the dead.”</i>
<small>If you neglected to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים, "the Resurrector of the dead," you must say it at that time. If you reminded yourself after saying וְנֶאֱמָן אַתָּה "You are faithful," you must repeat it and then complete the blessing of מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים. If you became aware of your omission after starting the blessing אַתָּה קָדוֹשׁ "You are holy," even if you only said the word "You," say the Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If during the first thirty days after <i>Shemini Atzeres</i> you are in doubt whether you said it, you must assume that you didnot say it. After thirty days, however, since you have become accustomed to saying it, you may assume that you recited the proper phrase and you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei.</small>
Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The most extraordinary manifestation of God's might—to our perception—is when He restores the dead to life. <i>Avudraham</i> writes that the three following praises represent various examples of how God restores life to those who arc near death. When a person falls (either physically or morally) he is often near death; thus, when God supports the fallen he restores their lives. When a person is sick, he often faces death, so when God heals the sick He restores their lives. A person who is imprisoned—i.e., confined—is like dead; thus when God releases the imprisoned He restores their lives.</i> with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Just as God shows His faithfulness to the living, so too will He keep faith with the dead who lie in the dust. Others say that “Those who sleep in the dust” refers to the Patriarchs; God will remember the oath He made to them and keep His promises to them.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Deliverance will “grow” in stages rather than all at once.</i>
<i>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i>
Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy)
<small>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning "Remember us for life."</small>
And You are faithful<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">How remarkable is the Jew's conviction of God's faithfulness. When the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing of “Resurrector of the dead,” the Jew responds, “Amein” even though he has not seen God restore the dead to life; when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Redeemer of Israel,” he responds “Amein”, even though he has not yet been delivered; and when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Builder of Jerusalem,” he responds “Amein” even though Jerusalem has not yet been rebuilt.—<i>Midrash Tanchuma</i></i> to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.
<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei, the Kedushah is said here)</small>
<b>Kedushah</b>
<i>The Congregation says and the Chazzan repeats:</i>
We will hallow and revere You as [with] the sweet words of the company of the holy Seraphim<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Angels.</i> who thrice repeat "holy" unto You, as is written by the hand of Your prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:3.</i> And they called one to another, and said:

<small>If you mistakenly said, "the Almighty" instead of "the King," or if you are in doubt—if you realized your error after a lapse of time sufficient to utter a three word greeting (Shalom Aleichem Rebbe), or if you had already started the next blessing, you must say the Shmoneh Esrei from the beginning.

God holds out His hand to the erring sinner and leads him back to righteousness, as the Talmud (<i>Maseches Yoma</i> 38b) declares, הבא ליטהר מסיעין אותו. God desires penitence as it is written, “I do not desire the death of the wicked: but (rather) that the wicked return from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11).</i>
<b><small>PRAYER FOR PARDON</small></b>
Pardon<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Sin can only be pardoned after repentance. Hence, the order of these two petitions. Even if a person was the worst of sinners, his supplication (after repentance) makes him fit to receive Divine mercy and helps him attain it—<i>R’ Yosef Albo</i></i> us, our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed;<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Error, חטא, is the result of carelessness, ignorance, or weakness; sin, פשע, is a deliberate disregard of moral or religious duty.</i> for you are a good and forgiving almighty.

<small>* If you forgot to say this and became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you may say it at that time and conclude the blessing. If you became aware of your omission after saying the blessing, continue the prayers, and before concluding the 16th blessing שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָּה, "Who heeds prayer," say: וְתֵן טַל וּמָטָר לִבְרָכָה כִּי אַתָּה וגו' "bestow dew and rain for blessing, for you heed etc.". If you reminded yourself after concluding the blessing שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָּה, but before you started רְצֵה, "be pleased," you may say: "bestow dew and rain,"וְתֵן טַל וּמָטָר and then continue with רְצֵה . If you remembered after that you must go back and say the 9th blessing, בָּרֵךְ עָלֵינוּ, and continue from there. But if you became aware of your omission after concluding the entire Shemoneh Esrei [and taking three steps backwards] you must repeat the entire Shemoneh Esrei.</small>
<b><small>PRAYER FOR DELIVERANCE</small></b>
Sound the great <i>shofar</i> for our liberty,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The following six benedictions, beginning with this one, are prayers for the restoration of the spiritual-national life of the Jewish People.

<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King of Justice.
<small>If you mistakenly said, "King, Lover of righteousness and justice," instead of "the King of Justice" and became aware of your mistake within the time it takes to utter the three word greeting (Sholom Aleichem Rebbe), you should immediately say "the King of Justice." If you remembered after that interval, you may continue the Shemoneh Esrei since the word "King" was mentioned in the regular blessing.</small>
<b><small>PRAYER FOR DIVINE RETRIBUTION</small></b>
For informers let there be no hope<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This petition was added to the original Eighteen Benedictions.

<b><small>PRAYER FOR JERUSALEM</small></b>
And to Jerusalem,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The “pride of the righteous will be exalted” in the restored city of Jerusalem.

<b><small>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</small></b>
Be pleased,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The three concluding benedictions are known as the benedictions of thanksgiving. They consist of prayers for the re-establishment of God's service at Jerusalem; thanksgiving for God's daily wonders in our behalf; and a prayer for peace and prosperity.</i> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Israel and pay need to their prayer;<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous blessings the first person was used: “Heal us,” “Have mercy on us,” whereas here the third person is used: “Their prayer,” “Accept their prayer.” In order to achieve a level in which we will be a source of pleasure to God, we must possess greater merit than what we as individuals can claim. We therefore ask God to take pleasure in the entire people of Israel among whom there are pious and righteous individuals who possess great merit, and we ask Him to accept “their prayer” with love and satisfaction.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer “Be pleased” in a different form was recited by the <i>Kohanim</i> (priests) every day following the morning fire-offering.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 11b</i> of Israel; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Israel.
<i>On regular weekdays continue, "And may our eyes". On Rosh Chodesh and on Chol HaMoed, the following prayer is added:</i>
Our God and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of David, Your servant; the remembrance of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary; and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Israel, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for good life and peace on this day of:

the <i>Festival of Sukkos</i>
Remember us Adonoy, our God, on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for good life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
<small>If you forgot to say this at Shacharis, (the Morning Service) or at Mincha (the Afternoon Service), but realized your omission before saying מוֹדִים, "We are thankful," you should say it at that time and continue with מוֹדִים. If you became aware of your omission after saying "מוֹדִים" "We are thankful," but before concluding the Shemoneh Esrei [and taking three steps backwards], start again from רְצֵה, "Be pleased." If you had completed the Shemoneh Esrei and then remembered, you must repeat the entire Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If you are in doubt, follow the same procedure as above. If you had already said the Musaf prayer and recalled your omission, it is the opinion of some authorities, that the<i> Shemoneh Esrei</i> of <i>Shacharis</i> be repeated as a נְדָבָה, a free-will-offering of prayer, rather than an obligatory prayer.</small>
And may our eyes behold<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">We pray for the privilege of witnessing the visible revelation of the Divine Presence as it appeared to the prophets, to the pious, and to all who were delivered from Egypt.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> Your merciful return to Zion.

<b><small>THANKSGIVING</small></b>
<small>At the words, <i>We are thankful,</i> bend forward; at <i>Adonoy</i> return to an upright position.</small>
We are thankful to You<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Here you should bow in gratitude, as if standing before the Divine Presence, and say, “We are thankful to You.” The Jews always bowed when they perceived the Divine Presence..—<i>Kuzari</i></i> that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, the Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Here we thank God for returning our souls each morning, after having “entrusted” them to Him all night.—<i>Eitz Yosef</i></i> and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase concludes the earlier declaration, “We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise ... evening, morning, and noon .”—<i>Iyun Tefillalh</i></i> (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; for we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> and says, "Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion", the congregation responds by saying "Amein" and then the following prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer was ordained by Rav and his colleagues. It is an abstract of several prayers recited by various Rabbis [<i>=Rabanan</i>], and for this reason it is called <i>Modim D'Rabanan.</i></i>)</small>

Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due.
<small>(On Chanukah and Purim the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, "וְעַל כֻּלָּם, and for all the foregoing.")</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances, for the wonders for the consolations and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
<i>On Chanukah:</i>
In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to rationally conceived laws. S.R. Hirsch comments: The Greeks knew that the key to the Jewish religion is the Torah. If Torah were forgotten, the decline of ritual observance would be inevitable and rapid. Thus, they concentrated first on causing Torah to be forgotten, knowing that the deterioration of religious observance would swiftly follow.</i> and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy, stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.
<i>On Purim:</i>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The usual procedure of those times was that all the wealth of executed people reverted to the monarch. In contrast to the norm, Haman decreed that Jewish possessions would be free for all to enjoy. He did this to provide added incentive to the populace who might have hesitated to kill Jews if they had nothing to gain.</i>— And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows.
And for all the foregoing blessed, exalted and extolled your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</i>
Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.
<small>If you forget to say this, you need not go back and repeat it. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise and bless Your great Name with sincerity forever; for You are goodness— the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever— the benevolent Almighty. Blessed are You, Adonoy, The Beneficent is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise.
<b>Birkas Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In Leviticus 9:22, we find that after he completed the Divine offering, Aaron lifted up his hands and blessed the people. In a like manner, his descendants, the <i>Kohanim,</i> uttered the priestly blessing after performing the Temple Service. In our days, on the occasions when the <i>kohanim</i> recite the priestly blessings, they do so immediately after the “We are thankful” prayer which terminates the <i>Avodah</i> (Service) section of the <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> When <i>Kohanim</i> do not recite the blessings, the blessings are mentioned by the <i>Chazzan</i> in his repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>.—<i>Avudraham</i></i></b>
<small>To be said by the Chazzan</small>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing of the Torah, written by the hand of Moses, Your servant, pronounced from the mouth of Aaron and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people; as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i> paraphrases this blessing with the words יכבש כעסו, “May He withhold His anger.”</i>
<i>After Birkas Kohanim the congregation says:</i>
Mighty One on high who dwells in might, You are peace and Your Name is peace. May it be Your will that You grant us and all of Your people, the House of Israel life and blessing for a safeguard to peace.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR PEACE</small></b>
Grant peace,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>Birkas Kohanim</i> concludes with a blessing for peace, this concluding blessing is a restatement of the last benediction in the form of a congregational prayer.—<i>Pesher Dovor</i></i> goodness, and blessing, life favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Israel, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">One of the most important <i>mitzvos</i> of the “Torah of Life” is the mitzvah of doing kindness.

Tachanun

<small>On Rosh Chodesh, Chol HaMoed, and Chanukah, Hallel is recited. On Fast Days (Monday—Thursday—Monday, Tenth of Teves, Fast of Esther, Seventeenth of Tamuz) <i>Selichos</i> are recited. On days when <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted (see below) the chazzan continues with Half Kaddish. (14 and 15 Adar Rishon in a leap year); the entire month of Nissan; Pesach Sheini (14 Iyar); Lag BaOmer; 1-8 Sivan; 9 and 15 Av; and 29 Elul. When <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted on these days, it is also omitted at the preceding Mincha (afternoon service). <i>Tachanun</i> is also omitted in the presence of a bridegroom, in the house of a mourner during the week of mourning, and on the occasion of a circumcision if the father, the <i>sandak</i> or the <i>mohel</i> is present.</small>
<small>The worshipper recites the <i>Tachanun</i> in a sitting position, while resting his brow on his arm. During the morning service, when the hand-<i>tefillin</i> is on the left arm, he leans his brow on his right arm, but at the Mincha service he leans his brow on his left arm. This "falling on one's face" symbolizes complete submission to God and the committing of our destinies into His hands. It is mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Maseches Megillah</i> 22b), and originates with Moses, who "Fell down before God" (Deuteronomy 9:18) and was followed by Joshua, who "Fell on the earth upon his face before the Ark of God" (Joshua 7:6)</small>
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, We are righteous and have not sinned. But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other's possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; we have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
You are Almighty, Slow to anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made know to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah: In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] When Adonoy descended in the cloud. Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] And He stood with him there. Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] And He proclaimed in the Name, Adonoy And there it is said:
<i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, and Acquitter of those who repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:5-7.</i>
And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i> Pardon us, our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed.

<small>The following supplication is recited while resting your brow on your arm.</small>
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">David had sinned by counting the Jews. And his heart was crushed with remorse when the prophet Gad, at God's command, offered him a choice of three punishments: seven years of famine, or three months of defeat in war, or three days of pestilence. David chose the last of these three, explaining that he preferred to trust in God's compassion rather than be at man's mercy. Indeed, the pestilence lasted only half a day instead of three.</i> for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall."
Merciful and gracious One, I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications.
Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In this psalm (6:2-11) David willingly accepts Divine punishment. He asks only that it not be inflicted on him at once in a sudden, unbearable burst of fury. Rather, he pleads, that it be meted out gradually so that he can withstand the suffering.—<i>Radak</i></i> nor chastise me with Your rage.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rebuke is offered with kind words, while chastisement, is often accompanied by harsh punishment.—<i>Malbim</i></i> Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, heal me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, [too,] is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since all physical illness stems from blemishes and sins of the soul, the Talmud (<i>Maseches Nedarim</i> 41a) states that a person does not recover from his illness until all of his sins are forgiven, as it says, “Who forgives all your sins. Who heals all your ailments” (Psalms 103:3). David first requests that God free his soul by forgiving his sins; only then can his shattered body be healed.—<i>Imros Tehoros</i></i> deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">During the twenty-two years the Holy Spirit departed from him, David shed a cupful of tears and drank it every single day.—<i>Yalkut</i> (<i>Samuel </i>165)</i> My eye is dimmed from anger,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">David was angry because his enemies rejoiced over his illness.—<i>Radak</i></i> it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Weeping is the eloquence of sorrow, and our tears are liquid prayers.</i> Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Prayer seeks spiritual purification and proper understanding.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> Ashamed and utterly terrified<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">My enemies, who hoped for my death, will be ashamed and terrified when they see that my health has been restored.—<i>Radak</i></i> will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When they witness my recovery, they will regret their animosity and seek peace with me. At that moment they will be ashamed to face me.—<i>Radak</i></i>

Avinu Malkeinu

<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> is recited here during <i>Shacharis</i>—the morning service, and <i>Mincha</i>—the afternoon service. It is also said by some congregations on public Fast Days. The number of petitions in this prayer varies with custom, but in our rite, <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> consists of 44 petitions. Since many of them are similar to the petitions of <i>Shemoneh Esrei, Avinu Malkeinu</i> is never recited on Shabbos, when the petitions of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> are also omitted. This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (<i>Maseches Taanis</i> 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered. Rabbi Akiva stepped down after him and exclaimed, "Our Father, our King, we have no king except You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake have mercy on us," and rain fell.</small>
Our Father, our King!<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as God's slaves (Leviticus 25:42), and as His children (Deuteronomy 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King Contrary to the view that God, the Father, is so full of love for His children, that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that God the King, must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to God—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!</i> we have sinned before You.
Our Father our King! we have no King except You.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Despite our physical banishment and spiritual estrangement—the result of our sins—we still have none other than God to guide our lives and to shape our destiny.</i>
Our Father, our King! deal with us [kindly] for the sake of Your Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 36.</i>
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, say:</i>
Our Father, our King! renew for us a good year.
<i>On public fast-days, say:</i>
Our Father, our King! bless us with a good year.
Our Father, our King! annul all harsh decrees concerning us.
Our Father, our King! annul the designs of those who hate us.
Our Father, our King! thwart the plans of our enemies.
Our Father, Our King! rid us of every oppressor and adversary.
Our Father, Our King! seal the mouths of our adversaries and accusers.
Our Father, Our King! remove pestilence, sword, famine, captivity, destruction, [the burden of] iniquity and religious persecution from the members of Your covenant.
Our Father, Our King! withhold the plague from Your inheritance.
Our Father, Our King! forgive and pardon all our iniquities.
Our Father, Our King! blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes.
Our Father, Our King! erase in Your abundant mercy all records of our liabilities.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Having just asked that our sins be forgiven and that our transgressions be removed from before His eyes, what are we asking for now? Our earlier pleas were for forgiveness of those sins we committed ourselves. But there are sins for which we are held accountable even though we do not commit them ourselves. One possibility is, having watched while others sin, when we may have been able to prevent it. (Chazal say כל ישראל ערבין זה לזה. A guarantor is one who countersigns a debt note, undertaking to pay if the borrower defaults. Thus we ask God to erase all our notes of obligation whether as borrower or guarantor. In all instances, He is the Extender of credit.) Thus we beseech God to erase the records of our guilt in those instances.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i>
Our Father, Our King! bring us back in wholehearted<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Many repent out of their fear of God. Others repent out of their love for Him. We beseech God to bring us back in “wholehearted” repentance motivated by love, the most perfect form of penitence.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> repentance before You.
Our Father, Our King! send complete<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">We beseech God to heal both the spiritually ill as well as the physically ill. We ask, therefore, for a “complete” healing for the sick among us.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> healing to the sick among Your people.
Our Father, Our King! tear up the evil [parts] of our sentence.
Our Father, Our King! remember us favorably before You.

For Monday & Thursday

<i>The following prayers are added on Mondays and Thursday. On other days, continue "Guardian of Israel. . .":</i>
<small>This group of somber plaints, known as the "long <i>Vehu Rachum</i>" is recited in the morning service on Mondays and Thursdays, except on days when <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted. The origin of these seven prayers is shrouded in legend. It has been suggested that they were composed during the terrible persecutions at the hands of the Goths in seventh-century Spain. It has been said, "Whoever can read this ‘long <i>Vehu Rachum</i>' prayer without emotion has lost all feeling for what is great and noble." Despite all the repetition in these cries for forgiveness, mercy, help, and protection, the effect is not tiring; because here it is not merely an individual soul, but the soul of an entire people that utters these laments and supplications, that gives voice to this woe of nearly two thousand years. Moses ascended Mount Sinai to receive the Second Tablets on the fifth day of the week, and he returned to the people on the second day of the week, bringing them the new tablets as a security for the Divine covenant and as confirmation of God's atonement for their transgression. Ever since, the second and fifth day of each week, Monday and Thursday, have been days of summons to the Jewish people to assemble anew before God and to reaffirm their sincere "return" to the Law of God. Our regular service is therefore augmented on these days by these additional supplications.</small>
And He, the merciful One, will atone iniquity, and will not destroy, He frequently withdraws His anger, and does not arouse all His rage.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 78:38.</i> You, Adonoy, do not withhold Your mercy from us; may Your kindness and truth always protect us.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 40:12 (basis).</i> Deliver us, Adonoy, our God, and gather us from among the nations to give thanks to Your holy Name to be extolled in Your praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 106:47.</i> If You, God, should preserve iniquities,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Were it not for the grace of God, any sin a person committed would deprive him of the right to continued existence.

We, too, are sustained by our trust that God will eventually lead us to salvation as He led Jacob to a pinnacle of joy and happiness.—<i>S.R.

Torah Reading

<small>The following paragraph is said on Mondays and Thursdays except on Rosh Chodesh, the eve of Pesach, Tishah b'Av, Chanukah, the 14th and 15th Adar and Adar Sheni (Purim and Purim Katan), the eve of Yom Kippur, and it is also omitted in the house of a mourner. This prayer is recited while standing, as it includes a form of viduy (<i>confession</i>) which must be said while standing. On Mondays and Thursdays, as we are about to open the Ark to take out the Seifer Torah for public reading, we realize that we have transgressed much that is written in the Torah and are unworthy even to take it into our hands. Aware of our inadequacy and unworthiness, we utter the words, "Almighty who is slow to anger etc....", appealing to Him for forgiveness.</small>

<small>Moses and the Elders with him ordained that the Torah be read in public on Shabbos, Monday and Thursday mornings. The Talmud (<i>Maseches Baba Kama</i> 82), notes that Ezra later instituted that three men should be called up to read a total of at least ten verses from the Torah. He also enacted that the Torah be read at the Shabbos Mincha (afternoon) service. When the Torah is removed from the Ark, great care is taken to honor it. It is escorted by as many people as possible from the moment it is taken out of the Ark until it is placed on the reading table. We embrace and kiss the Torah during the procession and refrain from idle chatter. While the Torah is being read, you must be silent and listen to each word.</small>
<i>When the Holy Ark is opened, the following is said:</i>
Whenever the Ark traveled, Moses would say: "Rise, Adonoy and let Your enemies be scattered, and those who hate You, flee before You." For from Zion will go forth the Torah, and the word of Adonoy from Jerusalem. Blessed is He Who gave the Torah to His people Israel in His holiness.
<small>The following prayer is taken from the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshas Vayakhail</i>), the basic text of Kabbalah which was written by the Mishnaic sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The <i>Zohar</i> states, "When the Torah is taken out to be read before the congregation, the heavenly gates of mercy are opened, and the Divine love is aroused; therefore one should say the following prayer.</small>
Blessed is the Name of the Master of the universe. Blessed is Your crown and Your place. May Your good will [be] with Your people Israel forever. The redemption of Your right hand show Your people in Your Holy Temple. Bestow on us Your excellent light, and accept our prayer with compassion. May it be Your will to prolong our lives in well-being. Let me be counted among the righteous, so that You will have compassion on me and protect me and all that is mine, and all that belongs to Your people, Israel. You are He Who nourishes all and maintains all; You are He Who rules over all; You are He Who rules over kings, and the kingdom is Yours. I am a servant of the Holy One, blessed is He, I bow before Him and before the honor of His Torah at all times. Not in man do I put my trust, nor do I rely on any angel; but only in the God of heaven, Who is the true God, Whose Torah is truth, Whose prophets are true, and Who performs many deeds of goodness and truth. In Him I put my trust and to His holy, honored Name I utter praises. May it be Your will to open my heart to Torah, and to fulfill the desires of my heart, and of the heart of Your people Israel, for goodness, for life, and for peace.
<i>The Chazzan says:</i>
<b>Declare the greatness of Adonoy, with me.</b> <b>and let us exalt His Name together.</b>
<i>The Congregation responds:</i>
Yours, Adonoy, is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory, and the beauty, for everything in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours, Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers.

<small>Rav says, (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 54) that four are obligated to offer thanks: persons who have safely completed a sea or land journey, or who have recovered from a serious illness, or have been released from captivity. One who is obligated to recite the blessing of thanksgiving should do so at the Torah-scroll after the blessing that follows the Torah reading. It is proper not to delay the recital of the blessing for more than three days.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who bestows goodness upon the guilty, Who has bestowed every goodness upon me.
<i>The congregation responds:</i>
He Who has bestowed goodness upon you, may He bestow every goodness upon you, forever.
<b>Blessing by the father of a Bar Mitzvah</b>
<i>The following blessing is said by the father of a Bar Mitzvah, after the lad has been called to the Torah and has recited the blessing following the reading:</i>

Once they have reached this level, even though they are <i>not yet thirteen years of age,</i> the father is no longer responsible for their sins.<br>Why then is this Beracha recited at the time of Bar Mitzvah? The <i>Dover Meisharim</i>, cites sources stating that on the contrary, children sometimes perish because of their fathers׳ sins. The fathers, in turn, are punished for causing the untimely deaths of their young children. Thus when they reach thirteen and are no longer liable for their <i>fathers’ sins,</i> the fathers too are released from the punishment they could have received for causing their children to perish. The Beracha is therefore recited at the Bar Mitzvah when the son becomes fully independent of his father.</i> of this [boy].
<i>When the reading of the Torah is concluded, the Half Kaddish is recited by the Reader. The Torah is then raised so that the congregation can see the script, and the congregation exclaims:</i>
This is the Torah which Moses placed before the children of Israel at Adonoy's command by the hand of Moses.
It is a tree of life to those who grasp to it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Long life is at its right, at its left, riches and honor. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it.
<i>On those Mondays and Thursdays when Tachanun is said, before returning the Torah to the Ark, the Chazzan recites:</i>
May it be the will of our Father in heaven to establish the House of our lives<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy Temple.</i> and restore His Divine Presence to our midst, speedily in our days, and let us say Amein.

May it be the will of our Father in heaven to preserve among us the sages of Israel, them, their wives, their sons and their daughters, their disciples, and the disciples of their disciples, wherever they live; and let us say Amein.
May it be the will of our Father in heaven that we may hear and receive good tidings [of] deliverance and consolation; may He gather our dispersed from the four corners of the earth; and let us say Amein.

Ashrei

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; Fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak, and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways, and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small>Psalm 20 is omitted on the following days: Rosh Chodesh, the day before Yom Kippur, Chanukah, both days of Purim, the day before Passover, the intermediate days of the Festivals (Chol HaMoed), and Tisha b'Av. It is also omitted when prayers are recited in the house of a mourner, the entire month of Nisssan, Pesach Sheni (14th of Iyar) Lag-b'omer, from Rosh Codesh Sivan through the twelfth of the month i.e., 5 days after Shavuoth, the Fifteenth of av, from Erev Yom Kippur until the end of Tishre, the Fifteenth of Shevat, when there is a circumcision in the Synagogue, or when a bride groom during the seven days of his wedding celebration is present.</small>
<small>According to Rabbi S.R. Hirsch, this psalm is addressed to David by the people of Israel. It is a testimonial of trust that the people have in the Divinely-appointed king, who is accustomed to victory and triumph. At the same time, it proclaims the eternal truth that the victories which our king wins for our people are to be attributed not to his bravery, nor to his sword, nor to his soldiers, but solely to his relationship with God, His Sanctuary, and His Law.</small>

May He grant you what your heart desires, and fulfill all your plans. We will sing at Your deliverance, and in the Name of our God, raise our banners; May Adonoy fulfill all your wishes. Now I know that Adonoy has delivered His anointed one, He will answer him from His holy heavens with the mighty deliverance of His right hand. Some [rely] upon chariots and some upon horses, but as for us, upon the Name of Adonoy, our God, we call. They have bowed down and fallen, but we have risen and stand firm. Adonoy, deliver [us], the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small>This portion, known as <i>Kedushas d'Sidra,</i> was introduced at the conclusion of the morning service to accomodate those who came to the synagogue too late to hear the <i>Kedushah</i> in <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> The Talmud (<i>Maseches Sotah</i> 49a) declares that the world is preserved solely by virtue of this <i>Kedushah,</i> and by the virtue of our answering, "May His great Name," which is part of the <i>Kaddish</i> recited following the study of the Aggadah. Because of its importance, a vernacular translation in Aramaic was added, so that even those ignorant of Hebrew would understand the sacred words.</small>
The Redeemer shall come to Zion and to those of Jacob who repent from sin, says Adonoy. As for Me, this is My covenant with them, said Adonoy: My spirit which is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your children, nor from the mouth of your children's children, said Adonoy— from now to eternity.

Beit Yaakov

<small>On days in which Tachanun is not said, "A prayer of David," is omitted, and we begin "House of Jacob". On days in which "Almighty who is slow to anger," is not said, continue with the Psalm for the appropriate day.</small>
A prayer of David. Incline Your ear Adonay, and answer me, for poor and needy am I. Preserve my soul for I am devoted, deliver Your servant, my God, who trusts in You. Be gracious to me my Master, for to You I cry out all the day. Make glad the soul of Your servant, for, to You, my Master, I lift up my soul. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You. Give ear, Adonoy, to my prayer, and listen to the voice of my supplications. In the day of my distress I call out to You, for You will answer me. There is none like You among gods, my Master, and there is nothing like Your works. All nations which You have made will come and bow down before You, my Master, and they will give honor to Your Name. For You are great and do wondrous things, You alone God. Teach me, Adonoy, Your way that I may walk in Your truth; let me be of one heart to fear Your Name. I will thank You, my Master, my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Your Name, forever. For Your kindness has been great toward me, and You have rescued my soul from the lowest depths of the grave. God, the insolent have risen up against me, and a company of violent men have sought my soul, and they have not set [the fear of] You before them. But You, my Master, are the Almighty Who is Merciful and Gracious, Slow to Anger and Full of Kindness and Truth. Turn to me and be gracious to me, give Your strength to Your servant, and deliver the son of Your handmaid. Give me a sign of Your kindness, that my enemies may see it and be ashamed, for You, Adonoy, have helped me and comforted me.
House of Jacob, Come let us walk in the light of Adonoy. For all the nations walk in the name of its god, but we walk in the Name of Adonoy, our God, forever. May Adonoy, our God, be with us as He was with our fathers, may He not forsake us nor abandon us, that He may turn our hearts to Him, to walk in all His ways, to preserve His commandments, His statutes, and His precepts, which He commanded our fathers. May these words of mine [with] which I have prayed before Adonoy, be near to Adonoy, our God by day and night; that He provide the needs of his servant and the needs of His people Israel each day. In order that it become known to all the peoples of the earth that Adonoy is God— there is nothing else.
A Song of Ascents of David. Had it not been for Adonoy Who was for us, let Israel now say. Had it not been for Adonoy Who was for us, when men rose up against us. They would have then swallowed us alive, when their wrath blazed against us. The waters would have then swept us away, affliction would have passed over our soul. Then over our soul would have gone the impetuous waters. Blessed is Adonoy, Who did not give us as prey to their teeth. Our soul escaped as a bird out of the fowler's snare; the snare is broken and we escaped. Our help is in the Name of Adonoy, Maker of heaven and earth.

<i>On Monday:</i>
Today is the second day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple:
A song, a psalm by the sons of Korach.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">On the second day, psalm 48, “Adonoy is great and highly extolled,” was sung by the Levites because on the second day of creation God separated the heavenly and earthly parts of the universe and ruled over both.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i> 31a</i> Adonoy is great and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Beautiful in its panoramic vista, the joy of all the earth is Mount Zion, on the northern extremities (of Jerusalem);<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem is the source of all the joy in the world. Joy radiates from Jerusalem to the rest of the world because it is the center of the universe, both in terms of geography and history. The Temple era is the midpoint of the generations—of the generations which preceded the Temple, and of those which followed its destruction. The generations before the Temple were uplifted and imbued with the hopes of its realization; the later generations are drawn to its light by recalling its radiant glory and by anticipating its rebuilding. We mention Jerusalem at every joyous occasion to emphasize that it is the true source of joy.—<i>Sfas Emes</i><br><i>Tziyun</i> is the Hebrew word for a monument, a memorial for someone who has died. When it is spelled “<i>Tziyon,</i> it refers to the site of God's Sanctuary, a timeless memorial for the preservation of truth in the midst of mankind. Even though the Temple has been destroyed, the mountain symbolically reminds man of the presence of the true God.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> the city of the great King.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentators say that the great king refers to David, rather than to God.</i> God, in its palaces, has become known as a Stronghold.

They saw and were astounded,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When the kings, who assembled to attack Jerusalem, witnessed the wondrous deeds which God performed in His victorious battle against their armies, they were astounded and terrified.—<i>Radak</i></i> they panicked and fled in haste. Trembling siezed them there, like the pangs of a woman in labor. With an east wind You smashed the ships of Tarshish. As we heard, so we saw in the city of Adonoy of hosts, in the city of our God; may God establish it for eternity, <i>Selah.</i> We hoped, God, for Your lovingkindness in the midst of Your Sanctuary. As Your Name, God, so is Your praise—<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">We testify that Your wondrous deeds match the praise and exalted names which the Prophets used to describe Your might.—<i>Radak</i></i> to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.

How long will you judge lawlessly and show partiality to the wicked forever? Render justice to the lowly and the orphan, deal righteously with the poor and destitute. Rescue the lowly and the needy, save them from the hand of the wicked.

<i>On Wednesday:</i>
Today is the fourth day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple:
Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 94, “Almighty of vengeance” was sung on the fourth day because God created the sun and the moon on the fourth day, and He will punish those who worship them.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i></i> Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself. Arise Judge of the earth, repay the arrogant their just reward. How long shall the wicked— Adonoy— how long shall the wicked exult? They express, they speak with arrogance; all the evildoers are boastful. Adonoy, they crush Your people and Your heritage they oppress. The widow and stranger they kill, and orphans they murder. And they say, "God does not see, the God of Jacob is not concerned." Consider, [you] stupid [ones] among the people,— and you fools when will you become wise? He Who implanted the ear, does He not hear? He Who formed the eye, does He not see? He Who chastises nations, does He not reprove— He that teaches man knowledge? Adonoy knows the thoughts of men, that they are vanity. Fortunate is the man whom You chastise, God, and whom You instruct from Your Torah. To grant him tranquility from days of evil, until the pit is dug for the wicked. for Adonoy will not abandon His people and His inheritance, He will not forsake. For justice shall return unto righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it. Who will rise up for me against the wicked, who will stand up for me against the evildoers? Had Adonoy not been my help, in an instant my soul would have dwelt in the silent grave. If [Whenever] I said, my foot has slipped, Your kindliness, Adonoy upheld me. When (worrisome) thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations soothe my soul. Can a tribunal of evil have accord with You— [a tribunal] that makes iniquity into law? They gang up against the life of the righteous, and blood of the innocent they condemn. Adonoy has been my stronghold, my God the Rock of my refuge. He turns their violence against them, and with their own wickedness destroys them; Adonoy, my God, destroys them.

To Him Who grants victory—<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 81 was designated for the fifth day “Because God created the birds and fish on that day.” These creatures bring joy to the world and when people observe the vast variety of the bird and fish species, they are awed by God's creativity. They are thus inspired to sing joyously to God.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i> 31a</i> upon the Gittis,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Gittis was a musical instrument that was manufactured in the town of Gat.</i> a psalm of Assaf: Sing joyously to God, our strength, shout for joy to the God of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Meiri associates the word הריעו with תרועה, sounding the <i>shofar.</i> Thus the verse reads, “Sound the <i>shofar</i> to the God of Jacob.”</i> Take up the hymn, sound the drum, the pleasant harp and the lute.

Your throne stands firm from of old, You are from eternity. The rivers have raised—Adonoy— the rivers have raised their voice, the rivers raise their raging waves. More than the roar of many waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea, mighty on high are You "Adonoy." Your testimonies are extremely faithful; holiness is becoming to Your House, Adonoy,—for the length of days.

Blessed is Adonoy, the God of Israel for all eternity, and all the people said: "Amen" Praise God. Blessed is Adonoy from Zion, Who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise God.

L'David Hashem

<small>The following psalm (27) is recited at the conclusion of services, morning and evenings, from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres. Others say only until Hoasha'na Rabbah. The psalm voices our prayer that God will be our light on Rosh Hashana enabling us to repel the darkness of sin through true repentance, and that He will be our salvation on Yom Kippur, through His compassionate atonement of our sins.</small>
By David: Adonoy is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? Adonoy is the strength<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rav S.R.

<small>It is customary to recite this psalm (49) in the house of a mourner during the week of mourning, following the morning and evening services. On weekdays when <i>Tachanun</i> is not said Psalm 16 (page 218) is substituted. This psalm, the final hymn of the psalms set down by the sons of Korach has significance for all mankind. Its message is that man must utilize all his material and physical resources to enhance his spiritual existence so that when his soul survives the body's brief stay on earth it can ascend to immortality. If man fails to recognize his purpose in life and instead regards the acquisition of material wealth the primary aim of life, he forfeits his hope of immortality, and his existence will not continue beyond the grave.—<i>S.R.

In this manner, they seek to fulfill their yearning for immortality.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> their names throughout the lands.

This is their way— their folly remains with them, and [yet] their descendants take pleasure in their speech, <i>Selah.</i> Like sheep—they are destined for the grave; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall dominate them at morning, their form will be consumed in the grave; [it will not remain] their dwelling-place. But God will redeem my soul from the [grasp of] the grave, for He will take me [to Himself] <i>Selah.</i> Fear not when a man grows rich, when the glory of his house is increased. For when he dies, he shall carry nothing away, his glory will not descend after him. Because while he lived, he blessed his soul.

There is none like our God. There is none like our Master. There is none like our King. There is none like our Deliverer. Who is like our God? Who is like our Master? Who is like our King? Who is like our Deliverer? Let us thank our God. Let us thank our Master. Let us thank our King. Let us thank our deliverer. Blessed is our God. Blesed is our Master. Blessed is our King. Blessed is our Deliverer. You are our God. You are our Master. You are our King. You are our Deliverer. You will deliver us You will arise and have mercy on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come
you are He, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers before whom our fathers burned the incenese offering. The composition of the incense consisted of balm, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense— by weight, seventy maneh of each; myrrh, cassia, spikenard and saffron by weight— sixteen maneh of each; twelve maneh of costus, three maneh of aromatic bark, and nine maneh of cinnamon. [Also used in compounding the incense were:] Nine kabin of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three s'in and three kabin— if he had no Cyprus wine, he could used strong white wine— a fourth of a kab of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of maaleh ashan. Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, Add a minute quantity of Jordan amber. If one added honey, the incense became unfit; and if one omitted any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty.
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree. the lye of Carshina was used for rubbing the onycha in order to refine its appearance. The Cyprus wine was used to soak the onycha to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10 This water came from a well named Raglayim.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i> was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Mei Raglayim</i> (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple. Others hold that the term “waters of Raglayim” actually refers to urine, which could have been used as a soaking agent were it not indecent to bring it into a sacred place.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i>
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Rabbi Nosson says, While [the Kohein] ground [the incense] he would say, <i>‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,'</i> because the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the sound of these specific words affects the spices.</i> is good for the spices. If half<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">184 <i>manim</i> instead of 368.</i> the quantity of incense was prepared it was acceptable, but if only a third or a fourth [of it was prepared] we have not heard<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we did not hear our teachers expound this question.</i> [whether it was acceptable."] Rabbi Yehuda said, This is the general rule: If [it was prepared with all its ingredients] in the correct proportion, it is acceptable even if only half was prepared; but if he left out any of its spices, he was liable for the death penalty.
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Bar Kappara says, Once in sixty or seventy years<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The exact number of years varied with the size of the hands of the High Priests over the years, for the surplus was what remained of these three <i>manim</i> from which he took two handfuls each Yom Kippur.</i> the accumulated surplus was sufficient to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense."] Bar Kappara also taught, If he would have put into it a minute quantity of honey, no one could have withstood [resisted] the scent. Why was no honey mixed with it? Because the Torah says, (<i>Leviticus</i> 2:11) For any leaven or honey, do not burn from them, [as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.
<i>Recite each of these verses three times:</i>
Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob, Selah! Adonoy of Hosts, fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver [us]! The King will answer us on the day we call.
You are my shelter; from distress You preserve me; with glad song of rescue, You envelop me, Selah! Let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem, as in the days of old and in earlier years.
It was taught in the school of Elijah; Whoever studies halachos every day, he is assured of life in the World-to-Come, for it is said, The ways (halichos) of the world are His." Do not read halichos, but halachos:
Rabbi Eliezer said on behalf of Rabbi Chanina: the disciples of the wise increase peace in the world, for it is said: ‘and all your children will be disciples of Adonoy's [Torah]; and great will be the peace of your children.' Do not read banayich [your children] but read bonayich [your builders]. Great is the peace of those who love Your Torah, and they will have no stumbling block [misfortune]. Let there be peace within your moats, serenity within your palaces. For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will say: ‘peace be with you.' For the sake of the House of Adonoy, our God, I will seek [pray for] your good.
<small>Mourners say the following Kaddish d'Rabanan</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach. In your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
Upon Israel, and upon our Sages, and upon their disciples, and upon all the disciples of their disciples, and upon all those who engage in Torah study in this land and in every land. May there be unto them and unto you abundant peace, favor, kindness, compassion, long life, ample sustenance and redemption from their Father Who is in heaven and on earth, —and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and a good life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.
He Who makes peace (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace) in His high heavens may He, in His mercy, make peace for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.

Aleinu

<small><i>Kol Bo</i> writes that Joshua authored this prayer when he captured Jericho. Taken from the Musaf service of Rosh Hashana, it serves as the closing prayer of all the daily services. As ruled by <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 133), it is said while standing.</small>
It is our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: And You shall know this day and take into Your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 4:39.</i>
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See page 00, note 00.</i> And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: Adonoy will reign forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 15:18.</i> And it is said: And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zecharyah 14:9.</i>
Do not fear sudden terror nor the destruction of the wicked when it comes take counsel together but it will be foiled speak the word and it will not stand for God is with us. To Your old age I am [with You], to Your older years I will sustain You, I have made You, and I will carry You, I will sustain You and save You.
<small>Although the Kaddish contains no reference to the dead, it has been recited by mourners for many centuries. The tradition of the mourner's Kaddish began with the following incident: Once, while walking, Rabbi Akiva met a man who had died some time before and was suffering the torments of Purgatory. He pleaded with Rabbi Akiva to go to his home town and teach his son to recite the Kaddish and Borechu, for this would save him from the terrible punishments. Rabbi Akiva and his Court then instituted the practice of mourners reciting the Kaddish, for until then it had been limited to the Chazzan's reciting it only after the services or after a sermon (See <i>Tana D'vei Eliyahu Zuta,</i> 17: <i>Zohar Parshas Noach</i>).</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.
He Who makes peace (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace) in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amen.

Thirteen Principles

<small>Many great medieval scholars formulated articles of faith, among them Rav Saadya Gaon, Rav Yehuda Halevi, Rabbeinu Bachya. Maimonides, the foremost of them all, formulated thirteen principles that have attained wide recognition and enduring fame.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In a fascinating work, <i>Rosh Amana,</i> Don Isaac Abarbanel enumerates all the attacks on each and all of Maimonides’ principles, adding his own incisive questions to those of his predecessors, and then proceeds to vindicate Maimonides’ principles, and their precise formulation.</i> The thirteen principles fall into three groups: The first five declare the existence of God as the Creator, One, incorporeal, eternal and alone worthy of man's worship. The next four deal with the Divine revelation of the Torah, the authenticity of prophecy, particularly that of Moses, and the immutability of the Torah. The last four deal with God in history, reward and punishment, belief in the coming of Messiah, and the resurrection of the dead.</small>
1. I believe with complete faith that the Creator, blessed is His Name, is the Creator and Guide of all created things, and He alone has made, does make, and will make all things.
2. I believe with complete faith that the Creator, blessed is His Name, is unique, and there is no uniqueness like His in any manner; and that He alone is our God, Who was, is, and will ever be.
3. I believe with complete faith that the Creator, blessed is His Name, is not corporeal, and that He is beyond all corporeal concepts, and there is nothing at all comparable to Him.
4. I believe with complete faith that the Creator, blessed is His Name, is First and Last.
5. I believe with complete faith that the Creator, blessed is His Name, is the only One to Whom it is proper to pray, and to no being beside Him is it proper to pray.
6. I believe with complete faith that all the words of the prophets are true.
7. I believe with complete faith that the prophecy of our teacher, Moses, may he rest in peace, was true, and that he was the father of all prophets, —of those who preceded him, and of those who followed him.
8. I believe with complete faith that the entire Torah which is now in our possession, is the very one that was given to our teacher Moses, may he rest in peace.
9. I believe with complete faith that this Torah will not be exchanged, and that no additional Torah [will be given] by the Creator, blessed is His Name.
10. I believe with complete faith that the Creator, blessed is His Name, knows all the deeds of men and all their thoughts, as it is said,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 33:15.</i> He Who forms all their hearts as one, Who comprehends all their deeds.
11. I believe with complete faith that the Creator, blessed is His Name, rewards those who keep His commandments, and punishes those who transgress His commandments.
12. I believe with complete faith in the coming of the Messiah and even though he may tarry, nevertheless, I yearn every day for his coming.
13. I believe with complete faith that there will be a resurrection of the dead at a time that pleases the Creator, blessed is His Name, and His Name will be exalted forever and to all eternity.
"For Your salvation I await, O Lord" (Genesis 49:18); I await, O Lord, for Your salvation; O Lord, for you Your salvation I await. "For Your salvation I await, O Lord" (Targum Onkelos Genesis 49:18); I await, O Lord, for Your salvation; O Lord, for you Your salvation I await. (The first sentence is in Hebrew, while the second is in Aramaic.)

Chapter of Fear of God

<small>Deuteronomy 10:12-11:9</small><br>And now Israel, what does Adonoy, your God, require of you, but to fear Adonoy, your God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him and to serve Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul. To keep the commandments of Adonoy and His decrees, which I command you this day. Behold, the heaven and the highest of heavens belong to Adonoy, your God, the earth and all that is in it. Yet only in your fathers did Adonoy delight, to love them, and He chose their offspring after them, even you among all the peoples as [it is] this day. Circumcise the barrier of your heart, and be stiffnecked no longer. For Adonoy, your God, is God of all powers and the Master of all masters, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, Who has no regard for personages and takes no bribes. Who does justice for the orphan and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing. You must love the stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. You must fear Adonoy, your God, serve Him, cleave to Him, and swear by His Name. He is your praise, and He is your God, Who did with you all these great and awesome things that your eyes have seen. With seventy people your fathers descended to Egypt, and now Adonoy, your God, has made you as abundant as the stars of heaven. [Therefore] you shall love Adonoy, your God, and keep His trust, His decrees, His statutes, and His commandments all the days. And you should know this day, that it is not with your children who have not known and who did not experience the chastisement of Adonoy, your God, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm. His signs and His deeds that He performed in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all his land. And what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how He made the water of the Sea of Reeds drown them as they pursued you, and Adonoy destroyed them to this very day. And what He did for you in the wilderness, until you came into this place. And what He did unto Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav, son of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them, and their households, their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel. But your eyes have seen all the great deeds of Adonoy, that He performed. You should [therefore] keep all the commandments which I command you this day, so you will be strong, and go in and possess the land, to which you are passing over to possess it. And in order to prolong your days upon the land Adonoy swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring; a land flowing with milk and honey.
<small>The following prayer is omitted on Shabbos and Yom Tov</small>
May it be Your will Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, to implant Your love and fear of You in my heart and in the heart of all Israel, Your people, to fear Your Great, Mighty and Awesome Name with all our heart and with all our soul, for You are great and Your Name is awesome. Amein. <i>Selah.</i>

Chapter of Repentance

<small>Deuteronomy 30:1-11</small><br>And it will come to pass when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, that you will take it to heart in the midst of all the nations to which Adonoy, your God, has driven you. Then you will return unto Adonoy, your God, and obey His voice according to everything that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul. And then Adonoy, your God, will return your captivity and have compassion upon you; and He will return and gather you from among all the peoples where Adonoy, your God, has scattered you. Even if your scattered ones will be dispersed unto the outermost parts of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God, will gather you, and from there, He will take you. And Adonoy, your God, will bring you into the land which your forefathers possessed, and you will possess it; and He will do good to you and increase you even more than your fathers. Adonoy, your God, will circumcise your heart, and the hearts of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live. Then Adonoy, your God, will set all these curses upon your enemies, and upon those who hate you, who have pursued you. But you will repent and listen to the voice of Adonoy, and perform all His commandments that I command you this day. And Adonoy, your God, will cause you to prosper in all your activities, in the fruit of your womb, in the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your soil, for good; for Adonoy will rejoice over you for goodness as He rejoiced over your fathers. For you will then obey the voice of Adonoy, your God, to observe His commandments and His decrees that are written in this Seifer Torah; for you will then return to Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul.
<small>(The following prayer is not recited on Shabbos and Yom Tov.)</small>
May it be Your will Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, to construct a passage beneath Your Throne of Glory in order to bring back in perfect repentance all the transgressors of Your people, the House of Israel. And among them, bring me back unto You in perfect repentance, for Your right hand is outstretched to receive those who repent, for You desire repentance. Amein. <i>Selah.</i>

Chapter of Manna

<small>According to the Jerusalem Talmud, one who recites this Torah chapter every day is assured that he will never lack for food. The prayer preceding the Torah chapter should not be recited on Shabbos or Yom Tov.</small>
May it be Your will Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, to grant livelihood for all Your people, the House of Israel, and may my livelihood and the livelihood of my household be included among them. May it be granted to us with tranquility and not with suffering, with honor and not with disgrace, legally and not illegally, so that we will be able to serve You and study Your Torah. Grant it to us now as You sustained our ancestors in the wilderness, in a desolate and arid land.
<small>Exodus 16:4-36</small><br>And Adonoy said to Moses, "See, I will make bread rain down from heaven for you; and the people will go out and gather it for each day['s needs], so that I may test them to see if they will live according to My Torah or not. On the sixth day, they shall prepare what they bring [home], and it will be twice as much as they gather every day." Then Moses and Aaron said to all the Children of Israel, "When evening comes you will know that it was Adonoy Who brought you out of Egypt. And in the morning you will see the glory of Adonoy, since He has heard your complaints against Adonoy. But we—what are we that you should complain against us?"
And Moses said, "When Adonoy gives us meat to eat in the evening and a satisfying meal of bread in the morning, Adonoy will have heard your complaints, which you are addressing to Him. What are we? Your complaints are not against us, but against Adonoy." Then Moses said to Aaron, "Tell the entire community of the Children of Israel, ‘Come near before Adonoy, for He has heard your complaints.'" When Adonoy spoke to the entire community of the Children of Israel, they turned toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Adonoy appeared in the cloud.
Adonoy spoke to Moses saying, "I have heard the complaints of the Children of Israel; speak to them, saying, ‘In the afternoon you will eat meat, and in the morning you will have your fill of bread; and you will know that I am Adonoy, your God.'" And it was in the evening that flocks of quail rose and covered the encampment; and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the encampment.
The layer of dew evaporated, and behold on the surface of the wilderness were thin flakes, as fine as frost on the ground. The Children of Israel saw it and said to one another, "What is this?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "This is the bread that Adonoy is giving you to eat." "This is what Adonoy has commanded: Every man shall take as much as he needs for food, an <i>omer</i> per person; according to the number of your souls let each man take for the individuals in his tent." The Children of Israel did so; they gathered it, some more, some less. But when then they measured it with an <i>omer,</i> the one who took more did not have extra, and the one who took less was not lacking. Each one had gathered according to his required nourishment. Moses said to them, "Let no one leave any of it over until morning." But some did not listen to Moses and left part of it over until the morning. It turned wormy and became putrid; and Moses was angry at them; they gathered it each morning, every man according to what he needed. The sun then became hot and it melted.
On the sixth day [of the week] they gathered a double portion of food, two <i>omers</i> for each person. All the leaders of the community came and reported it to Moses. He said to them, "This is what Adonoy has [already] spoken: tomorrow is a day of rest, Adonoy's holy Shabbos. Bake what you want to bake, and cook what you want to cook and whatever is left over, put away carefully until morning. They put it away until morning as Moses commanded, and it did not become putrid, and there were no worms in it. Then Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is Adonoy's Shabbos. Today you will not find [manna] in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but the seventh day is Shabbos; there will be no [manna] on that day." But it happened on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather [manna] but they found nothing.
Adonoy said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and My teachings? Look, Adonoy has given you the Shabbos; that is why on the sixth day He gave you food for two days. Every man must remain in his place; no man may leave his designated place on the seventh day." So the people rested on the seventh day. The House of Israel named the food <i>manna.</i> It was like white coriander seed and it tasted like dough kneaded with honey. Moses said, "This is what Adonoy has commanded, ‘Fill an <i>omer</i> measure with it as a keepsake for your generations, so they will see the food with which I fed you in the wilderness when I took you out of Egypt." Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and place an <i>omer</i> full of manna in it, and place it before Adonoy as a keepsake for your generations." As Adonoy commanded Moses, so did Aaron place it before the Testimony as a keepsake. The Children of Israel ate the manna for forty years until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan. The <i>omer</i> is one-tenth of a <i>ephah.</i>

Three hundred and sixty-eight <i>manim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>maneh</i> is a weight; plural, <i>manim</i>.</i> were comprised therein, three hundred and sixty-five corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, one <i>maneh</i> for each day— half in the morning and half in the afternoon. From the three remaining <i>manim</i> the Kohein Gadol brought two handfuls [into the Holy of Holies] on Yom Kippur; [for which purpose] they were put back into the mortar on the eve of Yom Kippur, and ground [again] very thoroughly, in order to make them very fine. Eleven kinds of spices were used for it. They were: 1) balm, 2) onycha, 3) galbanum, 4) frankincense— by weight, seventy <i>maneh</i> of each; 5) myrrh, 6) cassia, 7) spikenard and 8) saffron— in weight sixteen <i>maneh</i> of each; 9) twelve <i>maneh</i> of costus, 10) three of aromatic bark, and 11) nine of cinnamon. [Also used in the incense compound were:] Nine <i>kabin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kab</i> is a sixth of a <i>se’ah</i>.</i> of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three <i>s'in</i> and three <i>kabin</i>— if he had no Cyprus wine, he could use strong white wine— a fourth of a <i>kab</i> of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of <i>maaleh ashan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This herb causes the smoke of the burning incense to ascend in a straight line.</i> Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, Jordan amber was added of a minute quantity, and if one added honey,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Included are various sweeteners such as dates and other fruits.</i> it (the incense) became unfit; and if one omitted<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The same is true if one were to add to the prescribed number of eleven spices.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The death penalty was given only if the Kohein Gadol actually entered the Holy of Holies with incense which was unfit. This was considered as an unwarranted entry into the Holy of Holies which carried the death decree.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree. the lye of Carshina was used for rubbing the onycha in order to refine its appearance. The Cyprus wine was used to soak the onycha to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10 This water came from a well named Raglayim.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i> was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Mei Raglayim</i> (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple. Others hold that the term “waters of Raglayim” actually refers to urine, which could have been used as a soaking agent were it not indecent to bring it into a sacred place.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i>
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Rabbi Nosson says, While [the Kohein] ground [the incense] he would say, <i>‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,'</i> because the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the sound of these specific words affects the spices.</i> is good for the spices. If half<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">184 <i>manim</i> instead of 368.</i> the quantity of incense was prepared it was acceptable, but if only a third or a fourth [of it was prepared] we have not heard<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we did not hear our teachers expound this question.</i> [whether it was acceptable."] Rabbi Yehuda said, This is the general rule: If [it was prepared with all its ingredients] in the correct proportion, it is acceptable even if only half was prepared; but if he left out any of its spices, he was liable for the death penalty.
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Bar Kappara says, Once in sixty or seventy years<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The exact number of years varied with the size of the hands of the High Priests over the years, for the surplus was what remained of these three <i>manim</i> from which he took two handfuls each Yom Kippur.</i> the accumulated surplus was sufficient to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense."] Bar Kappara also taught, If he would have put into it a minute quantity of honey, no one could have withstood [resisted] the scent. Why was no honey mixed with it? Because the Torah says, (<i>Leviticus</i> 2:11) For any leaven or honey, do not burn from them, [as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.
<i>Recite each of these verses three times:</i>
Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob, Selah! Adonoy of Hosts, fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver [us]! The King will answer us on the day we call.
You are my shelter; from distress You preserve me; with glad song of rescue, You envelop me, Selah! Let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem, as in the days of old and in earlier years.
<i>The following is the prayer of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah:</i>
Please, by the force of Your great right hand, release the bound one. 
Accept the prayer of Your people; strengthen us, purify us, Awesome One! 
Please! Mighty One, those who seek Your Unity, preserve them like the pupil [of Your eye]. 
Bless them, purify them, have compassion on them; Your benevolent righteousness [may You] always bestow upon them. 
Mighty, Holy One, in Your abundant goodness, lead Your community. 
Unique One, Exalted, turn to Your people who are mindful of Your holiness. 
Accept our prayer and hear our cry, [You] Who knows hidden thoughts. 
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.
Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works, and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak, and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him, He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now forever. Praise God.
<small>The Chazzan recites the following half-Kaddish</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach. In your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Torah Reading for Fast Day



Amidah

When I proclaim Adonoy's Name attribute greatness to our God. My Master, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.
<b>THE VIRTUE OF OUR FOREFATHERS</b>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children's children, for the sake of His Name, with love.
<small>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</small>
Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God.)
<small>If you forgot to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing, you should recite it. If you have already said "Blessed are You Adonoy," you must continue the prayers without saying "Remember."</small>
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Abraham.
<b><small>DIVINE MIGHT</small></b>
You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the Powerful One to deliver us.
<small>From the Musaf of the first day of Pesach until the Musaf of Shemini Atzeres you should say:</small>
He causes the dew to descend.
<small>From the Musaf of Shemini Atzeres until the Musaf of the first day of Pesach you should say:</small>
Causer of the wind to blow and of the rain to fall.
<small>If you neglected to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים, "the Resurrector of the dead," you must say it at that time. If you reminded yourself after saying וְנֶאֱמָן אַתָּה "You are faithful," you must repeat it and then complete the blessing of מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים. If you became aware of your omission after starting the blessing אַתָּה קָדוֹשׁ "You are holy," even if you only said the word "You," say the Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If during the first thirty days after <i>Shemini Atzeres</i> you are in doubt whether you said it, you must assume that you didnot say it. After thirty days, however, since you have become accustomed to saying it, you may assume that you recited the proper phrase and you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei.</small>
Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth.
<small>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</small>
Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy.)
<small>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning "Remember us for life."</small>
And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.
<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei, the Kedushah is said here)</small>
<b>Kedushah</b>
<small>The Congregation says and the Chazzan repeats:</small>
We will hallow and revere You as [with] the sweet words of the company of the holy Seraphim who thrice repeat “holy” unto You, as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And they called one to another, and said:
<small>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</small>
‘Holy, holy, holy, is Adonoy of Hosts, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.'”
<small>The Chazzan says:</small>
Facing them, they offer praise and say:
<small>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</small>
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from its place”
<small>The Chazzan says:</small>
And in Your Holy Words it is written:
<small>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</small>
“Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Zion, throughout all generations! Praise God.”
<b><small>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</small></b>
You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. For a great and Almighty King— great and holy—are You.
 Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Almighty, the Holy One.
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence:</small>
 Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One.
<small>If you mistakenly said, "the Almighty" instead of "the King," or if you are in doubt—if you realized your error after a lapse of time sufficient to utter a three word greeting (Shalom Aleichem Rebbe), or if you had already started the next blessing, you must say the Shmoneh Esrei from the beginning. If you became aware of your error before that, you should immediately say "the King the Holy One" and continue your prayers.</small>
<b><small>PRAYER FOR UNDERSTANDING</small></b>
You favor man with perception and teach mankind understanding. Grant us from Your wisdom, understanding and knowledge. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Grantor of perception.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR PENITENCE</small></b>
Cause us to return, our Father, to Your Torah and bring us near, our King, to Your service; and bring us back in whole-hearted repentance before You Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who desires penitence.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR PARDON</small></b>
Pardon us, our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed; for you are a good and forgiving almighty. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Gracious One, Who pardons abundantly.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR REDEMPTION</small></b>
Look, please, upon our affliction, and defend our cause: and redeem us speedily with complete redemption for the sake of Your Name; because You are a Mighty Redeemer. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Redeemer of Israel.
<small>(On Fast Days, the Chazzan says “Answer us” and concludes, “Blessed are . . . Who responds at times of trouble.”)</small>
Answer us, Adonoy, answer us on the day of our fasting, for we are in great trouble. Do not regard our wickedness, do not conceal Your countenance from us, and do not be unmindful of our supplication. Please be near to our cry, let Your loving kindness console us. Even before we call unto You, answer us, as it is said: “And it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 65:24.</i> while they are yet speaking, I will hear. For You, Adonoy, are the One Who answers in time of trouble, Who redeems and rescues in all times of trouble and distress. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who answers His people Israel in time of trouble.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR HEALING</small></b>
Heal us, Adonoy, and we will be healed, deliver us and we will be delivered; for You are our praise. Grant a cure and healing to all our sickness and to all our pain and to all our affliction because You are the Almighty, King, Who is a faithful and merciful Healer. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Healer of the sick of His people Israel.

Restore our judges as before and our counselors as at first. Remove from us sorrow and sighing, and reign over us quickly You, Adonoy, alone with kindness and compassion; and make us righteous with righteousness and justice,
 Blessed are You, Adonoy, King, Lover of righteousness and justice.
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence:</small>
 Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King of Justice.
<small>If you mistakenly said, "King, Lover of righteousness and justice," instead of "the King of Justice" and became aware of your mistake within the time it takes to utter the three word greeting (Sholom Aleichem Rebbe), you should immediately say "the King of Justice." If you remembered after that interval, you may continue the Shemoneh Esrei since the word "King" was mentioned in the regular blessing.</small>
<b><small>PRAYER FOR DIVINE RETRIBUTION</small></b>
For informers let there be no hope and may all wickedness instantly perish may all Your enemies be swiftly cut off, and the insolent may You quickly uproot, crush, rout, disgrace, humble and subdue speedily in our days. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Crusher of enemies and Subduer of the insolent.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR THE RIGHTEOUS SCHOLARS</small></b>
Upon the righteous, upon the pious, upon the elders of the remnant of Your people the House of Israel, upon the remnant of their scholars, upon the true proselytes, and upon us, may Your mercy be aroused, Adonoy our God. Grant bountiful reward to all who trust in Your Name in truth; and place our lot among them, and may we never be put to shame, for in You we have put our trust, and on Your great compassion we truly rely. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Support and Trust of the righteous.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR JERUSALEM</small></b>
And to Jerusalem, Your city, return in mercy, and dwell therein as You have spoken; and rebuild it soon, in our days, as an everlasting structure, and the throne of David, Your servant may You speedily establish therein.
<small><i>During Mincha services on the Ninth of Av, the following petition is added here:</i></small>
<small>Adonoy, our God, console the mourners of Zion<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Zion” is the spiritual sanctuary, while “Jerusalem” is the Jewish commonwealth which was to flourish around Zion.—<i>S.R.

Mourning because she is bereft of her children, ruined of her dwellings, despised in contrast to her former glory, desolate without inhabitants, she sits alone with her head covered like a barren woman who never gave birth. Legions<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Roman forces were called “legions.”</i> have devoured her, idolaters have deprived her of her inheritance; they have put Your people Israel to the sword and have wantonly murdered the pious ones of the Most High. Therefore, Zion weeps bitterly, and Jerusalem raises her voice, “My heart, my heart [grieves] for their slain, my innards, my innards, [ache] for their slain. For you, Adonoy, set her afire, and with fire You will ultimately rebuild her, as it is said, “I will be to her, says Adonoy, a wall of fire around [her], and I shall be for glory in her midst.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Zecharyah 2:9.</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, Consoler of Zion and Builder of Jerusalem.</small>

<b><small>PRAYER FOR ACCEPTANCE</small></b>

<small><i>On Fast days during Mincha, the following petition is added here:</i></small>
<small>Answer us, Adonoy, answer us on the day of our fasting, for we are in great trouble. Do not regard our wickedness, do not conceal Your countenance from us, and do not be unmindful of our supplication. Please be near to our cry, let Your loving kindness console us. Even before we call unto You, answer us, as it is said: “And it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 65:24.</i> while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Israel.
<small>On Rosh Chodesh and on Chol HaMoed, the following prayer is added:</small>
Our God and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Mashiach the son of David, Your servant; the remembrance of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary; and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Israel, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for good life and peace on this day of:

In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
<small>If you forgot to say this at Shacharis, (the Morning Service) or at Mincha (the Afternoon Service), but realized your omission before saying מוֹדִים, "We are thankful," you should say it at that time and continue with מוֹדִים. If you became aware of your omission after saying "מוֹדִים" "We are thankful," but before concluding the Shemoneh Esrei [and taking three steps backwards], start again from רְצֵה, "Be pleased." If you had completed the Shemoneh Esrei and then remembered, you must repeat the entire Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If you are in doubt, follow the same procedure as above. If you had already said the Musaf prayer and recalled your omission, it is the opinion of some authorities, that the<i> Shemoneh Esrei</i> of <i>Shacharis</i> be repeated as a נְדָבָה, a free-will-offering of prayer, rather than an obligatory prayer.</small>
And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Zion. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<i>At the words, </i>We are thankful, <i>bend forward; at </i>Adonoy <i>return to an upright position.</i>
We are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock, Rock of our lives, the Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; for we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion”, the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due.
<small> (On Chanukah and Purim the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, “ וְעַל כֻּלָּם , and for all the foregoing.”)</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances, for the wonders for the consolations and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
<small>On Chanukah:</small>
In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy, stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.
<small>On Purim:</small>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth— And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows.
And for all the foregoing blessed, exalted and extolled your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever.
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</small>
Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.
<small>If you forgot to say this, see page 000.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise and bless Your great Name with sincerity forever; for You are goodness— the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever— the benevolent Almighty. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise.
<small>Birkas Kohanim is said by the Chazzan on public fast-days:</small>
<b>Birkas Kohanim</b>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing of the Torah, written by the hand of Moses, Your servant, pronounced from the mouth of Aaron and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people; as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace.
<small>After Birkas Kohanim the congregation says:</small>
Mighty One on high who dwells in might, You are peace and Your Name is peace. May it be Your will that You grant us and all of Your people, the House of Israel life and blessing for a safeguard to peace.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR PEACE</small></b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing, life favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Israel, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your sight to bless us and to bless Your people Israel, at all times and at every moment with Your peace (with much strength and peace).
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</small>
In the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, good decrees, salvations and condolences, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Israel for a good life and peace.
<small>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who blesses His people Israel with peace.
May they be acceptable the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart, before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. (May it it be Your will Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers, that no person be envious of me and that I not be envious of others, that I not be brought to anger this day, and that I not cause Your anger; and save me from the evil inclination, and help me be humble and any modest. Our King and our Father, unify Your Name in Your world, rebuild Your city, establish Your house and perfect your sanctuary. Gather our exiles, redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation). Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your Torah. Act for the sake of Your holiness. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.
May they be acceptable—the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart—before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Israel and say Amein.
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Tachanun

<small>On days when <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted (see below) the chazzan continues with Kaddish. (14 and 15 Adar Rishon in a leap year); the entire month of Nissan; Pesach Sheini (14 Iyar); Lag BaOmer; 1-8 Sivan; 9 and 15 Av; and 29 Elul. When <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted on these days, it is also omitted at the preceding Mincha (afternoon service). <i>Tachanun</i> is also omitted in the presence of a bridegroom, in the house of a mourner during the week of mourning, and on the occasion of a circumcision if the father, the <i>sandak</i> or the <i>mohel</i> is present. The worshipper recites the <i>Tachanun</i> in a sitting position, while resting his brow on his arm. During the morning service, when the hand-<i>tefillin</i> is on the left arm, he leans his brow on his right arm, but at the Mincha service he leans his brow on his left arm. This "falling on one's face" symbolizes complete submission to God and the committing of our destinies into His hands. It is mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Maseches Megillah</i> 22b), and originates with Moses, who "Fell down before God" (Deuteronomy 9:18) and was followed by Joshua, who "Fell on the earth upon his face before the Ark of God" (Joshua 7:6)</small> 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, We are righteous and have not sined. But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other's possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; we have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
You are Almighty, Slow to anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made know to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah: In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] When Adonoy descended in the cloud. Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] And He stood with him there. Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] And He proclaimed in the Name, Adonoy And there it is said:
<i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, and Acquitter of those who repent. And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance. Pardon us, our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.
<small>The following supplication is recited while resting your brow on your arm.</small>
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One, I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications.
Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, heal me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, [too,] is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, "Hear Israel."
Guardian of the unique nation, guard the remnant of the unique people, and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, and conciliated by supplications, be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation, for there is none else to help. Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds, deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and good life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.
He Who makes peace (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace) in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.
It is our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into Your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”
Do not fear sudden terror nor the destruction of the wicked when it comes. Take counsel together and it will be foiled speak the word and it will not stand for God is with us. To your old age I am [with you], to your older years I will sustain you, I have made you, and I will carry you, I will sustain you and save you.
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and good life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.
He Who makes peace (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace) in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amen.
<small>The following is recited here by some congregations from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres. Others recite it at the end of the Maariv (Evening) Service.</small>
By David: Adonoy is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? Adonoy is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? When evildoers approach me to devour my flesh— my tormentors and my foes they stumble and fall. If an army should encamp against me, my heart would not fear; if war were to rise against me, in this I trust. One thing I request of Adonoy, [only] that shall I seek, that I may dwell in the House of Adonoy all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Adonoy, and to meditate in His Sanctuary. For He will hide me in His Tabernacle on the day of distress, He will conceal me in the shelter of His Tent, upon a rock He will lift me. And now my head is raised high above my enemies around me; and I will offer in His Tent, sacrifices accompanied by trumpets of joy; I will sing and chant to Adonoy. Adonoy, hear my voice when I call; be gracious to me and answer me. Of You, my heart has said, “Seek My Presence”; Your Presence, Adonoy I will seek. Conceal not Your Presence from me, do not turn away Your servant in anger. You have been my help; neither cast me off nor abandon me, God of my deliverance. When my father and mother abandon me, Adonoy will gather me up. Adonoy, teach me Your way, and lead me in the path of uprightness, because of my watchers. Do not deliver me to the will of my tormentors, for false witnesses have risen against me, who breathe violence. Had I not believed that I would see the goodness of Adonoy in the land of living. Hope to Adonoy, be strong and He will give you courage; and hope to Adonoy.
<small>Mourner's Kaddish is said here:</small>
<small>It is customary to recite this psalm (49) in the house of a mourner during the week of mourning, following the morning and evening services. On weekdays when <i>Tachanun</i> is not said Psalm 16 (page 218) is substituted. This psalm, the final hymn of the psalms set down by the sons of Korach has significance for all mankind. Its message is that man must utilize all his material and physical resources to enhance his spiritual existence so that when his soul survives the body's brief stay on earth it can ascend to immortality. If man fails to recognize his purpose in life and instead regards the acquisition of material wealth the primary aim of life, he forfeits his hope of immortality, and his existence will not continue beyond the grave.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></small>
To Him Who grants victory, a psalm by the sons of Korach. Hear this all peoples, listen all inhabitants of the decaying world! Sons of Adam and sons of men,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate <i>b'nei adam,</i> “Men of low degree” or “Men without pedigree,” and <i>b'nei ish,</i> “Men of high degree” who can trace their ancestry to men of distinction.</i> rich and poor together. My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. I will incline my ear to a parable, I will begin to solve, to the accompaniment of a harp, my riddle.

This is their way— their folly remains with them, and [yet] their descendants take pleasure in their speech, <i>Selah.</i> Like sheep—they are destined for the grave; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall dominate them at morning, their form will be consumed in the grave; [it will not remain] their dwelling-place.

Avinu Malkeinu

<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> is recited here during <i>Shacharis</i>—the morning service, and <i>Mincha</i>—the afternoon service. It is also said by some congregations on public Fast Days. The number of petitions in this prayer varies with custom, but in our rite, <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> consists of 44 petitions. Since many of them are similar to the petitions of <i>Shemoneh Esrei, Avinu Malkeinu</i> is never recited on Shabbos, when the petitions of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> are also omitted. This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (<i>Maseches Taanis</i> 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered. Rabbi Akiva stepped down after him and exclaimed, "Our Father, our King, we have no king except You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake have mercy on us," and rain fell.</small>
Our Father, our King!<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as God's slaves (Leviticus 25:42), and as His children (Deuteronomy 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King Contrary to the view that God, the Father, is so full of love for His children, that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that God the King, must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to God—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!</i> we have sinned before You.
Our Father our King! we have no King except You.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Despite our physical banishment and spiritual estrangement—the result of our sins—we still have none other than God to guide our lives and to shape our destiny.</i>
Our Father, our King! deal with us [kindly] for the sake of Your Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 36.</i>
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, say:</i>
Our Father, our King! renew for us a good year.
<i>On public fast-days, say:</i>
Our Father, our King! bless us with a good year.
Our Father, our King! annul all harsh decrees concerning us.
Our Father, our King! annul the designs of those who hate us.
Our Father, our King! thwart the plans of our enemies.
Our Father, Our King! rid us of every oppressor and adversary.
Our Father, Our King! seal the mouths of our adversaries and accusers.
Our Father, Our King! remove pestilence, sword, famine, captivity, destruction, [the burden of] iniquity and religious persecution from the members of Your covenant.
Our Father, Our King! withhold the plague from Your inheritance.
Our Father, Our King! forgive and pardon all our iniquities.
Our Father, Our King! blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes.
Our Father, Our King! erase in Your abundant mercy all records of our liabilities.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Having just asked that our sins be forgiven and that our transgressions be removed from before His eyes, what are we asking for now? Our earlier pleas were for forgiveness of those sins we committed ourselves. But there are sins for which we are held accountable even though we do not commit them ourselves. One possibility is, having watched while others sin, when we may have been able to prevent it. (Chazal say כל ישראל ערבין זה לזה. A guarantor is one who countersigns a debt note, undertaking to pay if the borrower defaults. Thus we ask God to erase all our notes of obligation whether as borrower or guarantor. In all instances, He is the Extender of credit.) Thus we beseech God to erase the records of our guilt in those instances.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i>
Our Father, Our King! bring us back in wholehearted<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Many repent out of their fear of God. Others repent out of their love for Him. We beseech God to bring us back in “wholehearted” repentance motivated by love, the most perfect form of penitence.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> repentance before You.
Our Father, Our King! send complete<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">We beseech God to heal both the spiritually ill as well as the physically ill. We ask, therefore, for a “complete” healing for the sick among us.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> healing to the sick among Your people.

Weekday Maariv

The Shema

<small>Unlike the morning <i>Shacharis</i> and afternoon <i>Mincha</i> services which correspond to the two daily communal sacrifices (<i>Tamid</i>), offered in the Temple, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, the evening <i>Maariv</i> service has no counterpart in the Temple service, since sacrifices were never brought at night in the Temple. The <i>Maariv</i> service was instituted to correspond to the Temple ritual of keeping on the altar the unconsumed parts of sacrifices that had been offered earlier in the day. These parts were kept on the altar at night so that they could be completely consumed by its fire. This ritual was applicable only if there actually were uncon- sumed parts of offerings. Although the <i>Maariv</i> service was instituted to correspond to this ritual, and may therefore seem to be non-obligatory (see <i>Maseches Berachos</i> 27b), Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi and all the other codifiers have ruled that <i>Maariv</i> has been accepted and hallowed by custom, and is therefore an obligatory service. The <i>Shema</i> is preceded by two blessings and followed by two other blessings.</small>
And He, the Merciful One, atones iniquity; and does not destroy. He frequently withdraws His anger and does not arouse all His rage.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 78:38. This verse consists of thirteen Hebrew words. It recalls the “thirteen attributes of Divine mercy” (Exodus 34:67). In the evening when man pauses from the rush of his daily activities, he is conscious of having sinned during the day, and thus begins his prayer with this appeal for Divine mercy.—<i>Machzor Vitry</i><br>Midrash Tanchuma (<i>Pinchos</i> 13) notes that the morning sacrifice (תמיד של שחר) atoned for sins committed during the night, while the afternoon sacrifice (תמיד של בין הערבים) atoned for sins committed during the day. Since the evening service does not represent Temple sacrifice, it became customary to recite this verse because it mentions that God “atones iniquity.”—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Adonoy, deliver [us!] The King will answer us on the day we call.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 20:10.</i>
<small>The <i>Chazzan</i> says:</small>
Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</small>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, With His word He brings on evenings, with wisdom He opens the gates<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These are the gates of sunrise and sunset through which God, in His infinite wisdom, has divided life on earth into two complementary halves.—<i>Rabbi S.R. Hirsch</i></i> (of heaven); and with understanding changes<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He alternates the three daily periods—evening, morning, and afternoon.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> the times and alternates the seasons, and arranges the stars in their watches,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The stars appear as watchmen appointed by God to stand guard over the sleeping world below. He also appointed them their places in definite orbits, according to His will, and for purposes known to Him alone.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> in the sky, according to His will. He creates day and night, He rolls the light away from before darkness, and darkness from before light; He causes day to pass and brings night, and separates between day and night; Adonoy of Hosts<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">His Name, ה’ צבאות, means “He Who takes all the infinite variety of hosts and creatures and unites them to act and interact as parts of one unified Universe.”—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> is His Name. The Almighty, [Who is] living and enduring will always reign over us forever and ever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who brings on evening.
[With] An everlasting love<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer is an abbreviated form of the אהבה רבה prayer in the morning service. It thanks God for the sacred gift of Divine Revelation that He granted Israel. It declares that Torah alone is the eternal heritage of the Jewish people and that all other goods and gifts of life are transitory.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> You loved the House of Israel, Your people. Torah and commandments, statutes and laws, You taught us. Therefore, Adonoy, our God, when we lie down and when we rise, we will discuss Your statutes, and rejoice in the words of the teachings of Your Torah and in Your commandments forever. For they are our life and they lengthen our days, and on them we will meditate day and night. [May] Your love never be removed from us Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who loves His people Israel.
<small>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</small>
(Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Israel:</b> <b>Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.</b>
<small>The following three lines are to be said silently:</small>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.
And you shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your possessions. And these words which I command you today, shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them sharply to your children. And you shall discuss them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways.
And it will be— if you vigilantly obey My commandments which I command you this day, to love Adonoy your God, and serve Him with your entire hearts and with your entire souls— that I will give rain for your land in its proper time, the early (autumn) rain and the late (spring) rain; and you will harvest your grain and your wine and your oil. And I will put grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. Beware lest your hearts be swayed and you turn astray, and you worship alien gods and bow to them. And Adonoy's fury will blaze among you, and He will close off the heavens and there will be no rain and the earth will not yield its produce; and you will perish swiftly from the good land which Adonoy gives you. Place these words of Mine upon your hearts and upon your souls,— and bind them for a sign upon your hands, and they shall be for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes. And you shall teach them to your sons, to speak them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways. In order that your days be prolonged, and the days of your children, upon the land which Adonoy swore to your fathers to give them [for as long] as the heavens are above the earth.
And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations; and they will place with the fringes of each corner a thread of blue. And it will be to you for fringes, and you will look upon it and you will remember all the commandments of Adonoy, and you will perform them; and you will not turn aside after your hearts and after your eyes which cause you to go astray. In order that you will remember and perform all My commandments; and you will be holy unto your God.

<small>The following prayer was originally a compilation of eighteen verses instituted during the Gaonic era as a substitute for the <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> According to Avudraham, the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> was omitted because of decrees issued against the Jews that banned them from participating in the Evening Service. These eighteen verses, adopted in place of the <i>Shemoneh Esrei,</i> have remained a part of the <i>Maariv</i> service. Some Halachic commentaries maintain that these verses should not be included in <i>Maariv,</i> because they constitute an interruption between the final blessing after Shema and the <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i></small>

<small>If you forgot to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing, you should recite it. If you have already said "Blessed are You Adonoy," you must continue the prayers without saying "Remember."</small>
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God is a <i>helper</i> in all the fortunes of life by giving us the necessary energy and talents to succeed.

<i>From the Musaf of the first day of Pesach until the Musaf of Shemini Atzeres one should say:</i>

Causer of the wind to blow and of the rain to fall.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God's might is as much manifested in causing the rain as it is in reviving the dead. In fact the Talmud (<i>Maseches Taanis</i> 7a) declares in the name of Rabbi Avohu: “The day when rain falls is greater than the day of the resurrection of the dead.” Rabbi Yochanan said, (<i>Ibid,</i> 2a): “There are three ׳keys’ which God retains in His own hands and does not entrust to any emissary: the key to rain, the key to childbirth, and the key to the resurrection of the dead.”</i>
<small>If you neglected to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים, "the Resurrector of the dead," you must say it at that time. If you reminded yourself after saying וְנֶאֱמָן אַתָּה "You are faithful," you must repeat it and then complete the blessing of מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים. If you became aware of your omission after starting the blessing אַתָּה קָדוֹשׁ "You are holy," even if you only said the word "You," say the Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If during the first thirty days after <i>Shemini Atzeres</i> you are in doubt whether you said it, you must assume that you didnot say it. After thirty days, however, since you have become accustomed to saying it, you may assume that you recited the proper phrase and you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei.</small>
Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The most extraordinary manifestation of God's might—to our perception—is when He restores the dead to life. <i>Avudraham</i> writes that the three following praises represent various examples of how God restores life to those who arc near death. When a person falls (either physically or morally) he is often near death; thus, when God supports the fallen he restores their lives. When a person is sick, he often faces death, so when God heals the sick He restores their lives. A person who is imprisoned—i.e., confined—is like dead; thus when God releases the imprisoned He restores their lives.</i> with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Just as God shows His faithfulness to the living, so too will He keep faith with the dead who lie in the dust. Others say that “Those who sleep in the dust” refers to the Patriarchs; God will remember the oath He made to them and keep His promises to them.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Deliverance will “grow” in stages rather than all at once.</i>

<small>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning "Remember us for life."</small>
And You are faithful<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">How remarkable is the Jew's conviction of God's faithfulness. When the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing of “Resurrector of the dead,” the Jew responds, “Amein” even though he has not seen God restore the dead to life; when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Redeemer of Israel,” he responds “Amein”, even though he has not yet been delivered; and when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Builder of Jerusalem,” he responds “Amein” even though Jerusalem has not yet been rebuilt.—<i>Midrash Tanchuma</i></i> to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.

Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Almighty, the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This blessing completes the section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called <i>Kedushah</i> (Holiness) which emphasizes that God is indeed awesome.</i>
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One.
<small>If you mistakenly said, "the Almighty" instead of "the King," or if you are in doubt—if you realized your error after a lapse of time sufficient to utter a three word greeting (Shalom Aleichem Rebbe), or if you had already started the next blessing, you must say the Shmoneh Esrei from the beginning.

<b><small>PRAYER FOR UNDERSTANDING</small></b>
You favor man with perception<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing “You favor man with perception” begins the group of thirteen petitions which make up the “intermediate” section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> The first six petitions (blessings 4-9) are for our individual needs and well-being: understanding, repentance, forgiveness of sins, deliverance from trouble, from illness, and from want. Though these six petitions are of a personal nature, they voice the needs of all mankind. Note that the worshipper prays for his spiritual needs—knowledge, repentance, and forgiveness before he prays for his physical wants.</i> and teach mankind understanding.

God desires penitence as it is written, “I do not desire the death of the wicked: but (rather) that the wicked return from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11).</i>
<b><small>PRAYER FOR PARDON</small></b>
Pardon<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Sin can only be pardoned after repentance. Hence, the order of these two petitions.

Hence in this blessing we plead for the reconstruction of Jerusalem, as it is stated, “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may they who love You have peace” (Psalms 122:6)<i>—Maseches Megillah</i> 17b</i> Your city, return in mercy, and dwell therein as You have spoken; and rebuild it soon, in our days, as an everlasting structure, and the throne of David, Your servant may You speedily establish therein. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Builder of Jerusalem.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR SALVATION</small></b>
The sprout of David,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer for the Messiah, descendant of David, follows the prayer for Jerusalem, following the sequence of Hosea's prophecy (3:5), “Afterward, the Children of Israel will return to Jerusalem and seek Adonoy their God, and David their King “—<i>Masechcs Megillah</i> 18a</i> Your servant, speedily cause to flourish and exalt his power with Your deliverance, For Your deliverance we hope all day. and watch for Your deliverance. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who causes to sprout the power of salvation.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR ACCEPTANCE</small></b>
Merciful Father Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The last of the intermediate benedictions petitions God to answer all our preceding prayers.</i> spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers compassionately and willingly, for You are Almighty Who hears prayers and supplications; and from Your Presence, our King, do not turn us away empty-handed,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">At this point, the worshiper may add any private petition, and ask God's help for himself, for his household, or for his community.</i> be gracious and answer us and hear our prayer* for You hear the prayers of every mouth of Your people, Israel, with compassion. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who hears prayers.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</small></b>
Be pleased,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The three concluding benedictions are known as the benedictions of thanksgiving. They consist of prayers for the re-establishment of God's service at Jerusalem; thanksgiving for God's daily wonders in our behalf; and a prayer for peace and prosperity.</i> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Israel and pay need to their prayer;<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous blessings the first person was used: “Heal us,” “Have mercy on us,” whereas here the third person is used: “Their prayer,” “Accept their prayer.” In order to achieve a level in which we will be a source of pleasure to God, we must possess greater merit than what we as individuals can claim. We therefore ask God to take pleasure in the entire people of Israel among whom there are pious and righteous individuals who possess great merit, and we ask Him to accept “their prayer” with love and satisfaction.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer “Be pleased” in a different form was recited by the <i>Kohanim</i> (priests) every day following the morning fire-offering.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 11b</i> of Israel; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Israel.
<i>On regular weekdays continue, "And may our eyes". On Rosh Chodesh and on Chol HaMoed, the following prayer is added:</i>
Our God and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of David, Your servant; the remembrance of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary; and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Israel, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for good life and peace on this day of:
<i>Rosh Chodesh</i>
the <i>Festival of Matzos</i>
the <i>Festival of Sukkos</i>
Remember us Adonoy, our God, on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for good life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
And may our eyes behold<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">We pray for the privilege of witnessing the visible revelation of the Divine Presence as it appeared to the prophets, to the pious, and to all who were delivered from Egypt.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> Your merciful return to Zion. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
<b><small>THANKSGIVING</small></b>
<small>At the words, <i>We are thankful,</i> bend forward; at <i>Adonoy</i> return to an upright position.</small>
We are thankful to You<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Here you should bow in gratitude, as if standing before the Divine Presence, and say, “We are thankful to You.” The Jews always bowed when they perceived the Divine Presence..—<i>Kuzari</i></i> that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, the Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Here we thank God for returning our souls each morning, after having “entrusted” them to Him all night.—<i>Eitz Yosef</i></i> and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase concludes the earlier declaration, “We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise ... evening, morning, and noon .”—<i>Iyun Tefillalh</i></i> (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; for we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(On Chanukah and Purim the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, "וְעַל כֻּלָּם, and for all the foregoing.")</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances, for the wonders for the consolations and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
<i>On Chanukah:</i>
In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to rationally conceived laws. S.R. Hirsch comments: The Greeks knew that the key to the Jewish religion is the Torah. If Torah were forgotten, the decline of ritual observance would be inevitable and rapid. Thus, they concentrated first on causing Torah to be forgotten, knowing that the deterioration of religious observance would swiftly follow.</i> and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy, stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.
<i>On Purim:</i>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The usual procedure of those times was that all the wealth of executed people reverted to the monarch. In contrast to the norm, Haman decreed that Jewish possessions would be free for all to enjoy. He did this to provide added incentive to the populace who might have hesitated to kill Jews if they had nothing to gain.</i>— And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows.
And for all the foregoing blessed, exalted and extolled your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</i>
Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.
<small>If you forget to say this, you need not go back and repeat it. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise and bless Your great Name with sincerity forever; for You are goodness— the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever— the benevolent Almighty. Blessed are You, Adonoy, The Beneficent is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise.
<b><small>PRAYER FOR PEACE</small></b>
Grant peace,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>Birkas Kohanim</i> concludes with a blessing for peace, this concluding blessing is a restatement of the last benediction in the form of a congregational prayer.—<i>Pesher Dovor</i></i> goodness, and blessing, life favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Israel, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">One of the most important <i>mitzvos</i> of the “Torah of Life” is the mitzvah of doing kindness. But it is incomplete unless there is a love of kindliness in the heart which precedes the act of kindliness.—<i>Pesher Dovor</i></i> righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your sight to bless us and to bless Your people Israel, at all times and at every moment with Your peace (with much strength and peace).
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</i>
In the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, good decrees, salvations and condolences, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Israel for a good life and peace.
<small>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who blesses His people Israel with peace.
May they be acceptable the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart, before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer was the personal meditation of Mar the son of Ravina, which he recited after he completed his prayers (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 17a), and it is therefore expressed in the singular. The Jew prays that his mouth, his tongue, and his lips, which have just served as the instruments for his communion with God, will not forfeit any of their moral purity in his dealings with his fellow men<i>—Yaavetz</i></i> and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">May I have an open, receptive and understanding mind and spirit in the study of Torah. When it comes to <i>mitzvos,</i> let my soul know no indifference, indolence, or passivity. Let me demonstrate zealous and vigorous endeavor in all things pertaining to Your <i>mitzvos</i>.—<i>Etz Yosef; S.R. Hirsch</i></i> And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. (May it be Your will Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers, that no person be envious of me and that I not be envious of others, that I not be brought to anger this day, and that I not cause Your anger; and save me from the evil inclination, and help me be humble and any modest. Our King and our Father, unify Your Name in Your world, rebuild Your city, establish Your house and perfect your sanctuary. Gather our exiles, redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation). Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your Torah. Act for the sake of Your holiness. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May they be acceptable the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart, before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Israel and say Amein.
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem as in the days of old and in earlier years.

<small>In Israel, most who follow Nusach Sefard say Psalm 121:</small>
A Song of Ascents. I will lift my eyes to the mountains: from where will my help come? My help comes from Adonoy, Maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot slip, He will not slumber—your Guardian. Behold, He does not slumber nor does He sleep—the Guardian of Israel! Adonoy is your Guardian, Adonoy is your shelter at your right hand. By day the sun will not smite you, nor the moon at night. Adonoy will guard you from all evil; He will preserve your soul. Adonoy will guard your going and coming, from now and forever.

He Who makes peace (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace) in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amen.
<i>Chazzan:</i> Blessed Adonoy, who is blessed.
<i>Congregation:</i> Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed, forever and ever.
It is our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the Seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And you shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”
Do not fear sudden terror nor the destruction of the wicked when it comes. Take counsel together and it will be foiled speak the word and it will not stand for God is with us. To your old age I am [with you], to your older years I will sustain you, I have made you, and I will carry you, I will sustain you and save you.
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.

Motzaei Shabbat

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach. In your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May the pleasantness of my Master our God be upon us, and the work of our hands established for us, and the work of our hands—establish it.
He who dwells in the shelter of the Supreme One, under the protection of Shadai he will abide. I say of Adonoy, [He is] my refuge and my stronghold, my God in Whom I trust. For He will save you from the snare-trap, from destructive pestilence. With His wings He will cover you and beneath His wings, you will find refuge; His truth is a shield, a full shield. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day. The pestilence that prowls in darkness, nor the deadly plague that ravages at noon. A thousand will fall at your [left] side, and ten thousand at your [right] side but it shall not come near you. Only with your eyes will you behold and see the punishment of the wicked. For you [have proclaimed]: “Adonoy is my refuge,” the Supreme One you have made your dwelling. No evil shall befall you, and no plague shall come near your tent. For His angels He will command on your behalf— to guard you in all your ways. They will carry you upon their hands, lest you hurt your foot on a rock. You will tread upon lion and snake, you will trample young lion and serpent. Because he clings to Me with desire, I will save him; I will strengthen him, for he knows My Name. When he calls upon Me, I will answer him; I am with him in distress, I will free him and honor him. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance.
And You, Holy One, are enthroned upon the praises of Israel. And [the angels] call one to another and say:
“Holy, holy, holy is Adonoy of Hosts: the fullness of all the earth is His glory.”
And they receive [sanction] one from another, and say, “Holy in the highest heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His mighty power; holy forever and to all eternity— is Adonoy of Hosts; the whole earth is filled with the radiance of His glory.”
And a wind lifted me; and I heard behind me the sound of a great rushing;
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from His place.”
“And a wind lifted me and I heard behind me a sound of a great rushing of those who uttered praises and said, “Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from the place, the abode of His Divine Presence.” Adonoy will reign forever and ever. Adonoy, His kingdom is established forever and to all eternity. Adonoy, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever as the intention of the hearts of Your people, and direct their hearts to You. And He, the merciful One, atons iniquity and does ot destroy; He frequently withdraws His anger and does not arouse all His rage. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You. Your righteousness is everlasting and Your Torah is truth. You will grant truth to Jacob kindliness to Abraham, as You have sworn to our fathers from the days of old. Blessed is my Master day by day; He loads us, the Almighty Who is our deliverance, forever. Adonoy of Hosts is with us a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob, <i>selah.</i> Adonoy of Hosts, fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver [us]; the King will answer us on the day we call. Blessed is He, our God, Who created us for His glory, and set us apart from those who go astray; and gave us the Torah of truth, and eternal life He implanted within us. May He open our heart to His Torah, and instill in our heart love and awe of Him, to do His will and serve Him with a perfect heart, so that we shall not labor in vain nor bring forth that which causes dismay. May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, that we keep Your statutes in this world, and [thus] be privileged to live and behold, and to inherit the goodness and blessing of the Messianic days and in the life of the World to Come. In order that my soul sing to You and not be stilled; Adonoy, my God, forever will I thank You. Blessed is the man who trusts in Adonoy, so that Adonoy is his security. Trust in Adonoy until the end of days, for in God, Adonoy, is the strength of the worlds. Those who know your Name will trust in You, for You have never forsaken those who seek You, Adonoy. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it.
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.

Sefirat HaOmer

<small>The Omer is counted from the second night of Pesach until the night before Shavuos. The counting of forty-nine days (seven weeks) between the Festival of Pesach and Shavuos (the Feast of Weeks), connects the exodus from Egypt with the festival of the giving of the Torah. Just as one who awaits a most intimate friend on a certain day counts the days in eager anticipation of his arrival, so do we count the days from our liberation till the day we receive the Torah, which is the culmination and fulfillment of our freedom. It is proper to count the Omer at the beginning of the night, usually after the Maariv Service, and the Omer should be counted while standing.</small>

I am prepared and ready to perform the affirmative command to count the Omer, as is written in the Torah: “And you shall count for yourselves, from the day after the day of rest, from the day you bring the <i>omer</i> as the wave-offering, seven complete weeks shall there be; until the day following the seventh week shall you count fifty days; and you shall bring a new meal-offering unto Adonoy.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to count the Omer. May the pleasantness of my Master our God be upon us, and the work of our hands established for us, and the work of our hands—establish it.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to count the Omer.

















































The Merciful One, may He return for us the service of the Beis Hamikdash in its place speedily in our days, Amein, <i>Selah.</i>
To Him, Who grants victory:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 67 is recited because the seven verses which follow the introductory verse contain 49 words corresponding to the seven weeks (49 days) that link Pesach to the giving of the Torah on Shavuos.</i> a psalm with instrumental music, a song. [May] God favor us and bless us, [may He] cause His countenance to shine among us forever; [so] that Your way become known on earth, [and] Your deliverance among all nations. Peoples will thank You, God, all the peoples will thank You. Nations will rejoice and sing when You judge the peoples justly, and lead the nations upon the earth forever. Peoples will thank You, God, all the peoples will thank You. The earth will have yielded its produce; God, our God, will have blessed us. God will bless us, and they will fear Him— all [men even from] the ends of the earth.
Please, by the force of Your great right hand, release the bound one.
Accept the prayer of Your people; strengthen us, purify us, awesome One!
Please mighty One— those who seek Your unity— preserve them like the apple [of Your eye.]
Bless them, purify them, have mercy on them; Your benevolent righteousness [may You] always bestow upon them.
Mighty, Holy One in Your abundant goodness lead Your community.
Unique One, Exalted, turn to Your people who are mindful of Your holiness.
Accept our prayer and hear our cry, [You] Who knows hidden thoughts.
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious Kingdom is forever and ever.
Master of the universe, You commanded us through the hands of Your servant, Moses, to count the Omer in order to purify us from our evil and defilement. As You have written in Your Torah: And you shall count for yourselves, from the day after the day of rest, from the day you bring the <i>omer</i> as the wave-offering, seven complete weeks, shall there be; until the day following the seventh week shall you count fifty days, in order to cleanse the souls of Your people Israel from their impurities. 
Therefore, may it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, that in the merit of the Omer which I counted today, may any defect I have caused be rectified. May I be purified and sanctified with sublime holiness, and thereby may abundant bounty be bestowed upon all the worlds. May it rectify our being, our spirit and our souls from every baseness and defect, and may it purify us and sanctify us with Your sublime holiness. Amen, Selah.

Kiddush Levanah






Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who with His utterance created the heavens, and with the breath of His mouth, all their host. Law and season did He give them, that they not deviate from their set function. They are glad and rejoice to do the will of their Creator — the Worker of truth whose work is true. The moon He directed to renew itself — a crown of glory to those who are borne from the womb, who are destined to be renewed just like it, and to glorify their Creator for the name of His glorious kingdom. Blessed are You, Lord, Renewer of the months.

Bedtime Shema

Master of the universe! I hearby forgive anyone who has angered me, or sinned against me, either physically or financially, against my honor or anything that is mine, whether accidentally or intentionally, inadvertently or deliberately, by speech or by deed, in this incarnation or in any other any Israelite [is forgiven], may no man be punished on my account. May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers, that I shall sin no more nor repeat my sins, neither shall I again anger You nor do what is wrong in Your eyes. The sins I have committed, erase in your abounding mercies, but not through suffering or severe illnesses. May they be acceptable the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart, before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who causes the fetters of sleep to fall upon my eyes, and slumber upon my eyelids. And illuminates the pupil of the eye. May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers to make me lie down in peace, and to raise me (again) to good life and peace, and grant me my portion in Your Torah, make us accustomed to do Your commands, and let us not become accustomed to sin, Do not bring us into the grasp of sin, Do not cause us to be tested, or brought to disgrace. May I be ruled by the Good Inclination and let me not be ruled over by the Evil Inclination. Protect me from Satan, from an evil mishap and from illnesses. Let my thoughts not terrify me— nor evil dreams or evil fancies (disturb me), and may my bed be perfect before You.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word “bed” is used here figuratively for one’s future generations. See Rashi to Genesis 47:31; It was said of our forefather Jacob that “his bed was perfect: indicating that all his offspring were pure and steadfast.—<i>Iyun T’filoh</i></i> And light up my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death, Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who illuminates the whole world with His glory.

Rabbi Akiva said: How fortunate are you, Israel; before Whom are you purified, and Who purifies you? It is your Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “And I will sprinkle purifying water upon you, and you shall be purified” (Ezekiel 36:25). And it says: “The ritual bath of Israel is God” (Jeremiah 17:13). Just as a ritual bath purifies the impure, so too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, purifies Israel.

Marriage Blessings





<small>The following berachos are said under the marriage canopy</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe Who creates the fruit of the vine.

Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding forbidden sexual relationships and forbade to us betrothed women, and permitted to us [those women] who are married to us by means of the <i>chupah</i> and consecration. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who sanctified His people Israel through the <i>chupah</i> and consecration.
<small>Both the groom and the bride drink from the cup. The groom then consecrates his bride to him with a ring, in the presence of two appropriate witnesses, and says:</small>
<b>You are hereby consecrated to me with this ring according to the rite of Moses and Israel.</b>
<small>The kesubah (marriage contract) is read, after which the groom presents it to the bride. A second cup of wine is poured, and the following "Seven Berachos" are recited.</small>

Sheva Berachot

Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who gladdens the groom with the bride.

Circumcision


<i>Upon the arrival of the child, all those present at the service rise and say:</i>
Blessed is he that comes!










<i>The Mohel takes the child, and placing it upon a designated seat which is called the Throne of Elijah and he says:</i>
This is the Throne of Elijah, may he be remembered for good.

For Your deliverance I have hoped, Adonoy. I have longed for Your deliverance, Adonoy; and I have fulfilled Your commandments. Elijah, messenger of the circumcision! Behold, yours is now before you, stand at my right hand and support me. I have longed for Your deliverance. I am happy with Your word like one who finds great gain. Great is the peace of those who love Your Torah, and there is no stumbling for them. Fortunate is he whom You choose and bring near, that he may dwell in Your courts.
<i>All those present respond:</i>
May we be satisfied with the goodness of Your House, the holy place of Your Sanctuary.
<i>Before the Mohel performs the circumcision, the father of the child says:</i>
Behold, I am prepared and ready to fulfill the positive commandment commanded me by the Creator, blessed is He, to circumcise my son.
<i>The Mohel takes the child and proclaims:</i>
The Holy One, blessed is He, said to our father, Abraham, Walk before me and be perfect. Behold, I am prepared and ready to fulfill the positive commandment that the Creator, blessed is He, commanded us to circumcise.

<i>The Mohel places the child upon the knees of the Sandek, and before performing the actual circumcision, he says:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us concerning the circumcision.
<i>As the Mohel performs the act of circumcision the father of the child says:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us to bring him into the covenant of our father, Abraham.

<i>All those present proclaim:</i>
Amein! Even as he has entered into the covenant, so may he enter into the [study of] Torah, chupah [the nuptial canopy], and good deeds.
<i>One of the distinguished relatives or guests is given the honor of reciting the following Berachos:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who creates the fruit of the vine.
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified [Isaac] the beloved one, from birth, and set Your statute in his flesh, and sealed his offspring with the sign of the holy covenant. Therefore, on this account, living Almighty, our Portion, our Rock, give the command to rescue the beloved soul within our flesh from destruction, for the sake of His covenant that He has set in our flesh. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Maker of the covenant.
Our God and God of our fathers, preserve this child to his father and his mother, and let his name be called in Israel (the child's Hebrew name) son of (father's Hebrew name). May his father rejoice in his offspring and may his mother exult in the fruit of her womb; as it is written: Let your father and your mother rejoice, and let her who gave birth to you exult.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 23:25.</i> And it is said: And I passed by you and saw you staggering in your blood, ‘and I said to you, In your blood live!' ‘And I said to you, in your blood live!'<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 16:6.</i> And it is said: He remembered His covenant forever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations. Which He made as a treaty with Abraham, and which was His oath to Isaac. And He established it for Jacob as a statute, for Israel as an everlasting covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 105:8-10.</i> And it is said: Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 21:4.</i> Thank Adonoy for He is good, for His kindness endures forever. Thank Adonoy, for He is good, for His kindness endures forever. This little child— (child's Hebrew name) son of (father's Hebrew name) may he become great. Even as he entered into the covenant, so may he enter into the [study of] Torah, chupah [the nuptial canopy] and good deeds.
<i>The person who recited the Berachos drinks some wine, and the Mohel blesses the child:</i>
He who blessed our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, may He bless this tender, circumcised child (child's Hebrew name) son of (father's Hebrew name) and grant him a complete recovery, because he has entered into the covenant. And even as he has entered into the covenant, so may he enter into the [study of] Torah, chupah [the nuptial canopy] and good deeds. And let us [all] say Amein.
<i>The Mohel and the father of the child recite this prayer:</i>
Master of the Universe, may it be Your will that he be considered and regarded favorably, and accepted before You, as though I had offered him before the Throne of Your Glory. And May You in Your abundant mercy send through Your holy angels a holy and pure soul to my son (Child's Hebrew name) son of (father's Hebrew name) who was now circumcised for Your great Name. And may his heart be as open as the Temple entrance, to be receptive to Your holy Torah, to learn it, to teach it, to observe it and to perform [its commandments). Grant him long days, years, a life of fear of sin, a life of richness and honor, a life in which You will fulfill the wishes of his heart for good. Amein, may it so be Your will.

Redeeming Firstborn

<small>The first born male child must be redeemed on the thirty-first day of his birth. If, however, the father is a Kohein or a Levite, or the mother a daughter of a Kohein or a Levite, they are exempt from the duty of redemption. Should the thirty-first day fall on a Shabbos or Yom Tov, the service is postponed until the next day.</small>
<i>The father, presenting his child to the Kohein, makes the following declaration:</i>
This, my first born son, is the first issue of his mother's womb, and the Holy One, blessed is He has commanded to redeem him, as it is said: And those that are to be redeemed of them, from a month old shall you redeem them, according to your estimation, for the money of five silver shekalim, of the shekel of the Sanctuary which is equal to twenty <i>geirah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:16.</i> And it is said: Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever opens the womb among the Children of Israel, both of man and of beast is Mine.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 13:2.</i>
<i>The father then places before the Kohein silver dollars in the amount of fiveshekalim which is equal to five silver dollars, or according to some Poskim seven silver dollars, and the Kohein asks:</i>
Which do you prefer, to give me your firstborn son who is the first issue of his mother's womb, or would you rather redeem him for five shekalim, as you are required to do by the Torah?
<i>The father replies:</i>
I wish to redeem my son and here is the value of his redemption which I am required to give according to the Torah.
<i>While holding the silver dollars, the father says these two Berachos:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the redemption of the [firstborn] son.
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who has kept us alive and sustained us and brought us to this time.
<i>The Kohein accepts the silver dollars, and holding it over the head of the child, says:</i>
This is instead of that, this is in exchange for that, this is pardoned for that. May this child enter into life, into the [study of] Torah, chupah [the nuptial canopy] and good deeds. Amein.
<i>The Kohein places his right hand upon the head of the child and blesses him:</i>
May God make you as Ephraim and Menashe. Adonoy bless you and guard you. Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you. Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace. Adonoy is your guardian; Adonoy is your shelter at your right hand. For length of days and years of life and peace, will He add to you. Adonoy will guard you from all evil, He will preserve your soul.

<small>The Kohein hands the child to the father. The Kohein then takes a cup of wine and says:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who creates the fruit of the vine.

Birchat HaMazon

Birchat HaMazon

<i>Psalm 137 is recited before </i>Birkas Hamazon<i> on weekdays in memory of the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash:</i>
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and we also wept, when we remembered Zion. Upon the willows in its midst, we hung our harps. For there our captors demanded of us words of song, and our tormentors asked of us [with] mirth; Sing to us from the song[s] of Zion. How shall we sing the song of Adonoy on alien soil? If I ever forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget [its movement]. May my tongue cleave to my palate, if I remember you not; if I set not Jerusalem above my highest joy. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, Raze it, raze it to its very foundation. Daughter of Babylon, you are the annihilated one; fortunate is he who will repay you for all you have done to us. Fortunate is he who will take and dash your little ones against the rock.
<i>Psalm 126 is recited on Shabbos, Yom Tov and other festive occasions such as weddings, circumcisions or redemption of the first born.</i>

The fourth blessing “Who is good and beneficent to all” was composed by Rabban Gamliel the Elder and his court in Yavneh in gratitude to God for preserving the bodies of the victims of the Roman massacre at Betar, and for being enabled to bring them to proper burial.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 48b</i>
<small><b>SECOND BERACHA</b></small>
We thank You, Adonoy, our God, for Your parceling out as a heritage to our fathers, a land<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The land is mentioned even before the Exodus from Egypt because God demonstrated His extraordinary concern for the Jewish people at the very beginning of their history; first by the promise He gave to the Patriarchs concerning the Land of Israel and then, with the fulfillment of that promise, once He redeemed them from Egypt to enter the Land.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> which is desirable, good, and spacious; for Your bringing us out, Adonoy, our God, from the land of Egypt, and redeeming us from the house of bondage; for Your covenant which You sealed in our flesh; for Your Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Torah” refers to laws which are comprehensible to the human intellect; it is therefore <i>taught.</i> “Statutes” (חֻקִים) are beyond human understanding and are therefore merely <i>made known</i> to man, for man cannot comprehend them. <i>Eyun Tefilloh</i></i> which You taught us; for Your statutes which You made known to us; for the life, favor, and kindness which You granted us; and for the provision of food with which You nourish and maintain us constantly, every day, at all times and in every hour.
<i>On regular weekdays, continue, "For everything". On Chanukah and Purim add עַל הַנִּסִּים.

If you reminded yourself before concluding the second blessing עַל הָאָרֶץ וְעַל הַמָּזוֹן, you may repeat it at that time and continue with the Birkas Hamazon.</i>
[We thank You] for the miracles for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances, for the wonders for the consolations and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
<i>On Chanukah:</i>
In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy, stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.
<i>On Purim:</i>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows.
For everything Adonoy, our God, We thank You and bless You. Blessed be Your Name through the mouth of all the living, constantly, forever, as it is written: When You have eaten and are satisfied, You will bless Adonoy, your God, for the good land which He has given to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 8:10</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, for the land and for the food.

Have compassion, Adonoy, our God, on Israel, Your people, on Jerusalem, Your city, on Zion, the dwelling place of Your glory, on the kingship of the house of David, Your anointed; and on the great and holy House upon which Your Name is called. Our God, our Father tend us, nourish us,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">“Tend us” by providing the basic necessities of life such as bread and water; “nourish” us with an enriched diet including foods such as fruits and vegetables.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> maintain us, sustain us, relieve us<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">“Maintain us” with food and shelter; “sustain us” by providing our needs on a regular basis, not on a feast or famine cycle; and “relieve us” by giving us ample means to live comfortably.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> and grant us relief Adonoy, our God, speedily from all our troubles. Adonoy, our God—may we never be in need of the gifts of men nor of their loans, but only of Your hand which is full, open, holy and generous, so that we may not be shamed nor humiliated<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">May we not be “ashamed” in this world due to poverty and may we not be “humiliated” in the World-to-Come, because of our transgressions.

<i>On regular weekdays, continue, "Rebuild". On Shabbos add:</i>
May it please You, to strengthen us Adonoy, our God, through Your commandments, and through the commandment of the seventh day, this great and holy Sabbath. For this day is great and holy before You, to refrain from work on it and to rest on it with love, as ordained by Your will. And by Your will, grant us repose Adonoy, our God, that there be no distress, sorrow, or sighing on the day of our rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Even though prayers for personal needs are not recited on Shabbos, this particular prayer does contain such a request, because it is so closely interwoven with the commandment to rest on Shabbos. Since we are commanded to make Shabbos a day of sacred rest, we ask that our repose not be desecrated by distress or misfortune.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Show us Adonoy, our God, the consolation of Zion, Your city, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary, for You are the Master of deliverance and the Master of consolation.
<i>On Rosh Chodesh and Yom Tov add:</i>
Our God and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of David, Your servant; the remembrance of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary; and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Israel, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for good life and peace on this day of:

Remember us Adonoy, our God, on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for good life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.

Eruv Tavshilin


<small>When Yom Tov occurs on Thursday and Friday, an eiruv tavshilin must be prepared on the preceding Wednesday. The head of the family should take bread or matzoh and an item of cooked food such as meat or fish, put them on a plate and say the following berachah:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the mitzvah of <i>eiruv.</i>
By means of this <i>eiruv</i> it will be permissible for us to bake, cook, keep dishes warm,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">﻿“Keeping dishes warm” means that we are permitted to place cooked foods on a covered stove in order to preserve their heat. An example of this is the traditional Cholent. Kindling of light refers to the transferral of fire from an existing fire.</i> to kindle a light (from an existing flame), and to prepare and do all our necessities on the Festival for the needs of Shabbos, for us and for all Jews<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rav of the community usually includes the community in his eiruv. This can be done however by anyone. It is done by handing over the cooked food to another person through whom he grants a share of the food (of the eiruv) to the entire community. This person raises the eiruv a tefach (handsbreadth) and returns it to the one making the eiruv.</i> who live in this city.<br><br><small>The food of the eiruv should be eaten at one of the Shabbos meals.</small>

By means of this <i>eiruv</i> it will be permissible for me to walk from this place two thousand <i>amos</i> in each direction.”<br><small><small>You may place one <i>eiruv</i> for many Shabbosos, but you should put it in a safe place, so that it will not be lost or spoiled.</small></small>
<small>On Shabbos and Yom Tov, you are forbidden to go more than 2,000 <i>amos</i> from the place you were at the onset of Shabbos. If you need to walk farther than the Shabbos <i>techum</i> or boundary, you must place an <i>eiruvei techumin</i> (a boundary <i>eiruv</i>) before Shabbos or Yom Tov.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the mitzvah of <i>eiruv.</i>
“By means of this <i>eiruv</i> it will be permissible for me to walk from this place two thousand <i>amos</i> in each direction.”
<small>Two or more Jews who share a courtyard or hall, each of them living in his own apartment, are forbidden on Shabbos to carry from their apartment into the courtyard or hall, or from the courtyard or hall into their apartment. It is therefore considered a mitzvah for them to make an <i>eiruvei chatzeiros.</i></small>
<small>The procedure is as follows. Erev Shabbos, one of the tenants takes a whole loaf of bread and confers a share of it to all tenants of the courtyard by handing it to another tenant and saying in whatever language he understands:</small><br><br>“Take this loaf of bread and acquire it on behalf of all the Jews who live in this courtyard.”
<small>This person then takes the loaf and raises it one <i>tefach.</i> The one who is making the <i>eiruv</i> takes it from him and recites the following berachah:</small>

Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the mitzvah of <i>eiruv.</i>
“By means of this <i>eiruv</i> it will be permissible for us to take out and to bring in from the houses into the courtyard and from the courtyard into the houses and from one house into another, for all the Jews who live in the houses of the courtyard.”

Shabbat Candle Lighting

<small>The <i>berachah</i> for all mitzvos must be recited before doing the mitzvah. This rule, however, does not apply to the lighting of the Shabbos candles. By lighting the candles, the woman thereby ushers in the Shabbos. Since the recitation of the <i>berachah </i> is considered to be the beginning of the act of candle lighting, she has thereby ushered in the Shabbos and may no longer light the candles. Therefore, she should first light the candles, and in order that the <i>berachah</i> precede the actual mitzvah, she should cover her face with her hands in order not to see the candles, then recite the <i>berachah</i>, remove her hands and look at the candles. In this manner, it is as if she has recited the <i>berachah</i> before lighting the candles.</small><br><small>It is customary for the husband to prepare the candles and wicks before Shabbos.</small>

Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Shabbos light.

Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Yom Tov light.

Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Shabbos light and Yom Tov light.















May it be the will before the Lord, our God and the God of our forefathers ,that he forgives me (and my husband and my children and my father and my mother) and all my kin. And that he give us and all Israel good and long lives. And that he memorializes us for good and blessing. And that he redeems us with a redemption of salvation and mercy, and that he blesses us great blessings. And that he supplies our houses. And that his spirit dwells among us. And that I merit to raise wise and perspicacious children and grandchildren; God-lovers, Lord-worshipers, honest men, holy progeny connected to God, and that illumine the world with Torah and good deeds and all the work of the Creator. Please hear my plea at this time. By the merit of Sarah and Rebecca and Rachel and Leah our matriarchs. And make effulgent our lamps, that they not extinguish ever, and make effulgent your countenance, that we are saved. Amen.

Shabbat Eve Mincha

Song of Songs

<small>Shir Hashirim, the Song of Songs, which is traditionally read in the syna- gogue on Shabbos Chol Hamoed Pesach, is one of the most remarkable books in the sacred Scriptures. On the face of it, it appears nothing more than an oriental love song. If that literal interpretation is accepted, there is no place for it in Holy Writ, and in fact it was not included without a controversy. It was only due to the strenuous advocacy of Rabbi Akiva that all doubts as to its propriety were dis- pelled. “Heaven forbid!” he said. “There could never be any doubt about the sanctity of Shir Hashirim. If the rest of the Writings are holy, then Shir Hashirim is the holy of holies.” (Mishnah, Yedayim 3:5) He saw in it, the passionate yearning which subsists between God and Israel, a love which “Many waters cannot quench, neither can the rivers drown” (8:7).</small><br><small>Thus, Shir Hashirim is read on the Festival of Pesach as an expression of our love of God Who brought us out of bondage and took us as His beloved people. It also expresses our belief that His love for our Patriarchs was the Divine motivation for our redemption and our selection as His cherished nation.</small>










<small>When time does not permit the recitition of the entire Shir Hashirim, this abridged version may be said:</small>

Mincha


Give thanks to Adonoy, for He is good, for His kindness endures forever. Let those redeemed by Adonoy say it, those He redeemed from the adversary's hand. And from the lands He gathered them, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Targum paraphrases: the southern sea.</i> They wandered in the wilderness, in a path of desolation; an inhabited city they did not find. Hungry, also thirsty their soul fainted within them. Then they cried out to Adonoy in their distress; from their anguish He rescued them. And He led them in a straight path, that they might go to an inhabited city. Let them thank Adonoy for His kindness, and for His wonders to the children of man. For He satisfied the longing soul, and the hungry soul He filled with good. Those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, bound in affliction and iron.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to those who are shackled and chained and locked in the darkness of dungeons or prisons.</i> For they defied the words of the Almighty, and the counsel of the Most High they scorned. And He humbled their heart with hard labor, they stumbled and there was none to help. Then they cried out to Adonoy in their distress; from their anguish He delivered them. He brought them out from darkness and from the shadow of death, and their shackles He broke. Let them thank Adonoy for His kindness, and for His wonders to the children of man. For He has broken the gates of bronze, and the bars of iron He has cut asunder. They are fools— because of the way of their transgression and their iniquities, they cause their own affliction. Their soul abhors all food, and they drew near to the gates of death. Then they cried out to Adonoy in their distress; from their anguish He delivered them. He sends His word and heals them, and delivers them from their destruction. Let them thank Adonoy for His kindness, and for His wonders to the children of man. And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with singing. Those who go down to the sea in ships, that do work in mighty waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bodies of water with swift currents require increased efforts to keep the ship on course.</i> They saw the works of Adonoy, and His wonders in the deep. He spoke and raised the stormwind, and lifted up its waves. They rise to the heavens, they descend to the depths, their soul melts away because of trouble. They reel and stagger like a drunkard, and all their skills are swallowed up [useless]. Then they cried out to Adonoy in their distress, from their anguish He rescued them. He turned the storm into calmness, and their waves were stilled. They rejoiced because the waves were quieted, and He led them to their desired border. Let them thank Adonoy for His kindness, and for His wonders to the children of man. Let them exalt Him in an assembly of people,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From this verse, the Talmud learns the Blessing of Thanksgiving (בִּרְכַת הַגוֹמֵל) must be recited in the presence of ten men who constitute a קָהָל , an assembly. —[ Berachos 54b ]</i> and at a sitting of elders, praise Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">From these words the Talmud learns that at least two of the ten men in the quorum, must be elders, Torah scholars.</i> He turns rivers into a wilderness, and springs of water into an arid place. A fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. He turns a wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into springs of water. And He made the hungry settle there, and they established an inhabited city. And they sowed fields and planted vineyards, which yielded fruit for harvest. And He blessed them and they multiplied greatly, and their cattle, He did not diminish. And they were reduced in numbers and brought low, from oppression, calamity, and sorrow. He pours contempt upon nobles, and causes them to wander in the wasteland where there is no path. And He lifted up the needy from affliction, and he established families like a flock. The upright will see it and rejoice, and all iniquity will shut its mouth. Whoever is wise, let him note these things, and they will understand the kindnesses of Adonoy....
Beloved of the soul, merciful Father, draw Your servant to Your will. [Then] Your servant will run like a deer; he will bow before Your splendor. To him, Your affections will be sweeter than the drippings of the honeycomb and all [other pleasant] tastes.
Splendid, Beautiful, Radiance of the world, my soul is lovesick for You. I beseech You, Almighty, please, heal her by showing her the pleasantness of Your radiance. Then she will be strengthened and healed and she will have everlasting joy.
Ancient One—let Your mercy be aroused, and please have pity upon Your beloved child; for it is long that I have yearned to behold soon the glory of Your strength. These my heart has desired, please have pity and do not conceal Yourself.
Reveal Yourself, please and spread over me, my Beloved, the shelter of Your peace, let the earth be illuminated from Your glory, we will exult and rejoice in You. Hasten, show [us Your] love, for the time has come, and be gracious unto us as in days of old.


Amidah









































<small> You are the Lord God who nourishes, sustains and supports [everything] – ‘from the horns of the ram to the eggs of lice.’ Provide me with my portion of bread,’ and let my nourishment be found – for me and all of the members of my household – before I need them; easily and not painfully; permissibly and not illegitimately; respectably and not shamefully, for life and peace, from the bounty of blessing and from the bounty of the highest blessing so that I may do Your will and be occupied with Your Torah and fulfill Your commandments. And do not make me require the gifts of flesh and blood. Rather, fulfill with me the verse in which it is written (Psalms 155:16), “Open Your hand and satisfy the desire of all.” And it is written (Psalms 55:23), “Cast your burden on the Lord and He will support you.” </small>

For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">‘Are there any other gods?’ asks the Midrash, and answers by citing verse 5 of the next Psalm, ‘All the gods of the nations are idols.’</i> For in His hands are the depths<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Metsudas Dovid offers another translation: ‘In His hands are the hidden things of the earth,’ referring to things which require much study and thought in order to be understood.</i> of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His; For the sea is His, and He made it, and the dry land, His hands formed. Come, let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. For He is our God and we are the people of His pasture, and the flock of His hand, [even] today<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible for us to reach this high level and to be accepted as His flock even this very day, if we would hearken to His voice.—Dover Sholom</i> if you will heed His voice. Do not harden your heart as at Merivah, as on the day of Massah<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Jews complained and murmured at the lack of water during their wanderings in the wilderness (Exodus 17:1-17; Numbers 20:1-13).</i> in the desert. When your fathers tested Me,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The words from here till the end of the Psalm, are the actual words of the Divine Presence that emanated from the throat of Moses, שְׁכִינָה מְדַבֶּרֶת מִתּוֹךְ גְרוֹנוֹ שֶׁל משֶׁה — Eyun Tfiloh </i> they tried Me, though they had seen My work. Forty years I quarreled with that generation; and I said, “They are a people of erring hearts, and they did not know my ways.” Therefore I swore in My anger, “They shall not enter My resting place.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy Land is described as the land of rest (Deuteronomy 12:9).</i>
Sing to Adonoy a new song<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Israel will sing a new song of praise to God in the future, when He gathers us together from our exile. This new song will be in addition to those we now sing.—Radak According to our Sages, every time a ‘new song’ is mentioned, it refers to future events. Fresh mercies and deliverance demand fresh expressions of thanksgiving and homage.</i> Sing to Adonoy all the [inhabitants of] earth. Sing to Adonoy, bless His Name, proclaim His deliverance from day to day. Recount His glory among the nations, His wonders among all the peoples. For Adonoy is great and most extolled; He is awesome above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols, whereas Adonoy made the heavens. Beauty and splendor are before Him, strength and glory are in His Sanctuary. Ascribe to Adonoy—families of peoples— —ascribe to Adonoy honor and might! Ascribe to Adonoy the honor due His Name, bring an offering and come to His courtyards. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Yosef understands this as the holy splendor of God’s Sanctuary. Tzelosa D’Avraham sees it as the splendor and mode of worship before God, as compared with secular or frivolous manifestations of beauty and splendor.</i> of holiness; tremble before Him all (peoples of) the earth! Declare among the nations, “Adonoy reigns!” for He established the world so that it cannot be moved, He will judge the peoples with uprightness. The heavens will rejoice, the earth will exult,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Simcha (rejoicing) describes one’s feeling at a new experience of happiness, whereas gila (exultation) describes the feeling one experiences over an ongoing situation of joy. Since there is nothing new on the earth (Koheleth) it is said that the earth will exult (gila) but the heavens will rejoice (simcha) because there is always something new in the heavens.—Gaon of Vilna</i> the sea and its fullness will roar. The field and all that is in it will jubilate, then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy. Before Adonoy when He comes— when He comes to judge the earth; He will judge mankind with justice, and peoples with His truth.
When Adonoy is [universally accepted as] King<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages say that this will occur after the annihilation of Amalek. At that time God’s Name and His throne will be complete. See Exodus 10.</i> the earth will exult; the multitudes of islands<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Those who live on these islands will rejoice.—Etz Yosef</i> will rejoice. Clouds and dense darkness surround Him;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">These clouds and darkness will envelop and destroy the wicked, after which God’s justice and righteousness will be apparent. Others say that this is an allusion to the mystery of God’s ways, but that His kingdom is founded on righteousness.—Radak</i> righteousness and justice are the foundations of His throne. Fire will go before Him to surround<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">God will surround them with fire so there will be no escape for them.—Radak</i> and burn His antagonists. His lightning illuminates the inhabited world, the earth sees and trembles.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The future revelation of God’s kingdom is described in terms similar to those of the revelation at Mount Sinai.</i> The mountains<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">‘Mountains’ refers to the kings of the world—Etz Yosef</i> melt like wax before Adonoy, before the Master of all the earth. The heavens will declare His righteousness and all the peoples will behold His glory. Humiliated will be all who serve graven images, who are proud of idols; before Him all gods will bow. Zion will hear and rejoice, and the daughters [cities] of Judah will exult because of Your judgments, Adonoy. For You, Adonoy, are most high over all the earth; You are greatly exalted above all gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Yosef understands ‘gods’ to refer to the sun, moon, stars, etc.</i> Lovers of Adonoy, hate evil! He preserves the souls of His pious ones; from the hand of the wicked, He saves them. Light is sown<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Light is sown for the righteous in this world but the harvest of that light awaits the future world.—Radak Others say that the light may be hidden like the seed in the earth, but it is sure to spring forth.</i> for the righteous, and for the upright in heart—joy. Rejoice, righteous ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Shevet Musar says that the righteous ones will not merely rejoice in their personal salvation and deliverance but they will actually rejoice in God, Whose kingdom will be revealed and complete.</i> in Adonoy, and give thanks to His holy Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Lit: His holy mention.</i>
A Psalm. Sing to Adonoy, a new song<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This Psalm, like the previous ones, refers to the future when God will render final judgment on the world and its inhabitants.</i> for He has performed wonders; His right hand effected deliverance for Him [as did] His holy arm. Adonoy has made known<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This will be made known through His prophets.—Etz Yosef</i> His deliverance, before the eyes of the nations He has revealed His justice. He remembered His kindliness and faithfulness<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">God will remember the kindness He promised to Israel, because of His faithfulness. —Etz Yosef</i> to the House of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the deliverance of our God. Raise your voice unto Adonoy all [inhabitants of] the earth! burst forth into exultation, sing, and play music! Play to Adonoy with a harp, with harp and the sound of music. With trumpets and the sound of the <i>shofar</i> raise your voices before the King, Adonoy. The sea and its fullness, will roar with joy! [also] the world and those who dwell therein. Rivers will clap hands, together, mountains will sing. Before Adonoy when He comes to judge the earth; He will judge mankind with righteousness and peoples with uprightness.
When Adonoy is [universally accepted as] King, peoples will tremble;<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Radak notes that Psalm 97 states that, ‘When Adonoy is (universally accepted as) King, the earth will exult.’ He explains that the people will tremble during the destruction of Gog of Magog, and only after his downfall will the earth rejoice.</i> [Before Him Who is] enthroned on Cherubim,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the golden Cherubim atop the Ark in which Moses placed the two tablets of the Law. See Exodus 25:18-22</i> the earth will quake. Adonoy, is great in Zion,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">God’s greatness will be revealed in Zion, for there He will bring all the nations to judgement.—Radak Others quote Rabbi Chanina who says that only when God returns His Schechina (Holy Presence) to Zion will His greatness be recognized. Etz Yosef understands the verse as follows: ‘God, Whose dwelling is in Zion, is great and exalted above all peoples.’</i> and is high above all the peoples. They will pay homage to Your Name, [saying], great and awesome, It is holy. The might of the King is [evidenced in] His love of justice,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The translation of this verse follows Ibn Ezra.</i> You have established uprightness, justice and charity amid Jacob You have instituted. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> ‘Footstool’ is an allusion to the Holy Temple.</i> holy is He.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate, ‘Holy is it,’ referring to the Holy Temple.</i> Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who invoke His Name, called to Adonoy, and He answered them. In a pillar of cloud He spoke to them<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra understands this as a reference to Moses and Aaron alone, because God did not speak to Samuel from a pillar of cloud.</i> ; they preserved His testimonies and the statute which He gave them. Adonoy, our God, You answered them; You were a forgiving God to them, [yet] You took vengeance for their misdeeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"> Moses and Aaron were punished for their role in the incident of the waters of Merivah and were not permitted to enter the Holy Land. Samuel who declared, ‘I am the Seer,’ was punished when he mistakenly thought to anoint David’s brother Eliav as king. (1 Samuel 9).</i> Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain; for Adonoy, our God, is holy.

<small>It is customary to stand during the recitation of the following psalm.</small>
A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Adonoy— you sons of the mighty<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> According to Targum, ‘sons of the mighty’ refers to the angels who are called upon to give praise to God. The Sages say that ‘the mighty’ refers to the Patriarchs who were mighty in their faith of God and steadfast in carrying out His will. Thus ‘sons of the mighty’ refers to all Jewry.</i> — ascribe to Adonoy glory and might. Ascribe to Adonoy the glory due His Name, prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Yosef says that this refers to the Bais haMikdash.</i> Adonoy's voice is upon the waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">God’s voice was heard when He split the Sea of Reeds after the exodus from Egypt.—Etz Yosef</i> Almighty of glory thunders, Adonoy is upon [the] many waters. The voice of Adonoy is in power, the voice of Adonoy is in beauty.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows S.R. Hirsch. Others translate ‘Adonoy’s voice is with power, Adonoy’s voice is with beauty.’</i> The voice of Adonoy breaks cedars, Adonoy shatters the cedars of Lebanon.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The Psalmist refers to a forest in the Holy Land where there is an abundance of tall cedar trees.—Radak</i> He makes them leap like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like unicorns. The voice of Adonoy hews out flames of fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">When God spoke at Sinai, His commandments came forth like a flame in the form of visible letters and words. These letters penetrated the tablets of stone and engraved themselves on them.—Rashi According to Radak the verse describes how God’s wrath will pour down upon His enemies like a bolt of fiery lightning.</i> The voice of Adonoy makes the desert tremble, Adonoy makes tremble the desert of Kadesh. The voice of Adonoy causes hinds to calve,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The birth canal of the hind is very narrow and it is often impossible for the offspring to pass through. God’s voice in the thunder frightens the hind and causes it to have such strong contractions that the canal expands and the offspring is born.—Rashi</i> and strips the forests bare; and in His Sanctuary all proclaim [His] glory. Adonoy sat enthroned (even) at the flood<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Even in the face of the total corruption of mankind at the time of the flood, God sat unchanged and unshaken upon the throne of His Sovereignty.—S.R. Hirsch</i> Adonoy is enthroned as King forever. Adonoy will give strength to His people; Adonoy will bless His people with peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">After the coming of the Messiah there will be an end to all wars and conflicts.—Radak</i>

Accept the prayer of Your people; strengthen us, purify us, Awesome One!
Please! Mighty One, those who seek Your Unity,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Those who study holy Torah which promulgates Your Unity.—Etz Yosef</i> preserve them like the pupil [of Your eye].

Unique One, Exalted, turn to Your people who are mindful of Your holiness.
Accept our prayer and hear our cry, [You] Who knows hidden thoughts.

<small>This poem was written by Rabbi Solomon Halevy Alkabetz, whose name שְׁלֹמֹה הַלֵוִי is spelled out by the first letter of each stanza. In this poem, the bridegroom (Israel) calls to his Beloved Friend (God) asking that He join him in welcoming his bride (the Sabbath). The concept of welcoming the Sabbath goes back to Talmudic times. Rabbi Chanina robed himself and stood at sunset on the eve of the Sabbath and exclaimed, “Come! Let us go forth to welcome the Sabbath Queen.” Rabbi Yanai garbed himself in festive attire on Sabbath eve and exclaimed; “Come bride, Come bride” (<i>Shabbos</i> 119a).</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
“Preserve” and “Remember”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">“Preserve” and “Remember” refers to the discrepancy between the two texts of the fourth commandment. Exodus (20:8) reads, “Remember the Sabbath day,” while Deuteronomy (5:12) reads, “Preserve the Sabbath day.” The Talmud (Shavuos 20b) explains that both words, שָׁמוֹר and זָכוֹר were miraculously pronounced by God simultaneously.</i> in a single utterance the One Almighty caused us to hear; Adonoy is One, and His Name is One; for fame, for glory, and for praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">These words revert back to the first lines of this stanza: “The One Almighty God caused us to hear for our fame, for our glory, and for our praise.” This thought is based on the verse in Deuteronomy 28:18,19, “Keep the commandments, and He will make you high above all nations—in praise, in name, and in glory.”—Iyun Tefilah</i>
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
To greet the Sabbath, come let us go for it is the source of blessing; from the very beginning, of old, it was appointed; last in creation, first in [God's] thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is based on the Midrashic illustration of the architect who prepares the plans for the entire structure before beginning the construction. Analogously, the Sabbath is the end-purpose of God’s creation, for which everything else was made.</i>
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
<small>On Yom Tov and Chol Hamoed skip to יָמִין וּשְׂמֹאל</small>
Sanctuary of the King, royal city, arise, come forth from the upheaval; too long have you dwelt in the valley of weeping; He will show you abundant pity.
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
Shake the dust off yourself, arise, dress up in your garments of glory, my people; through the son of Yishai the Bethlehemite,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Messiah is a descendant of David, the son of Yishai of Bethlehem.</i> draw near to my soul and redeem it.
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
Wake up! wake up! for your light has come, arise and shine. Awaken! awaken! utter a song, The glory of Adonoy is revealed upon you.
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
Feel not ashamed or humiliated why are you bowed down, why do you moan? In you will take refuge the poor of my people;<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"> Others translate “The afflicted of my people will take refuge in you.”</i> and the city will be rebuilt on its ancient site.
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
They will be ravaged, those who ravaged you, and they will be cast far off, all who devour you. Your God will rejoice over you as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride.
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
Right and left you will spread out. and Adonoy, you will praise;<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows Iyun Tefilah. Others translate, “will you revere.”</i> through the man descended from Peretz<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Peretz was the son of Judah from whom David was descended.</i> we will rejoice and exult.
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
<small>The chazzan and congregation turn to face the entrance while reciting this verse. While saying the words בּוֹאִי כַלָּה , Come Bride<i> bow and turn back, to signify that the Sabbath is entering.</i></small>
Come in peace, crown of her husband,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The husband is Israel; and the Sabbath is Israel’s crowning glory.</i> come with song, (rejoicing) and good cheer; amidst the faithful of the treasured people. Come Bride, come Bride, come Bride, Shabbos Queen!
<small>Refrain:</small> Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride, let us welcome the Sabbath.
A Psalm, a song for the Shabbos day. It is good to thank<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to God. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. These pursuits lead him to serve God and to praise Him.—Radak</i> Adonoy, and sing praise to Your Name, Most High. To relate Your kindliness in the morning, and Your faithfulness in the nights.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">We will proclaim His kindliness in the morning of redemption. And while yet in the darkness of exile we proclaim our belief in His faithfulness.—Rashi</i> Upon a ten-stringed instrument and lute, in meditation upon the harp. For You have given me joy, Adonoy, with Your deeds, at the work of Your hands<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath day of rest affords me the opportunity to observe and appreciate the greatness of Your work.—Radak</i> I sing joyously. How great are Your works, Adonoy; how infinitely profound are Your thoughts.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">God’s ‘works’ are the visible creation, while His ‘thoughts’ are the Divine purpose behind each created thing.—Seporno</i> An empty-headed man cannot know, nor does a fool understand this: When the wicked bloom like grass, and all the evildoers blossom— it is so that they may be destroyed forever. But You will remain on high forever Adonoy. For behold, Your enemies, Adonoy; For behold, Your enemies shall perish; dispersed shall be all evildoers. You uplifted my horn<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate, ‘You have increased my might like that of the wild ram.’</i> like that of a unicorn; I am saturated with fresh oil. My eye has seen [the defeat of] those who spy on me; of the wicked who rise against me, my ears have heard [that they are doomed]. The righteous will blossom like a date palm, like a cedar<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The palm and the cedar both enjoy a long life span and flourish during all seasons. Thus they symbolize the lasting happiness of the righteous in contrast to the short prosperity of the wicked.</i> in Lebanon, he will grow tall. Planted in the House of Adonoy, in the courtyards of our God they will blossom. They will still be fruitful in old age; they will be full of sap and freshness. To declare that Adonoy is upright; He is my Stronghold; in Whom there is no injustice.
Adonoy had begun His reign He has clothed Himself with majesty;<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">On the sixth day, the Levites sang Psalm 93, ‘Adonoy is King, He has clothed Himself in majesty,’ because He completed the work of creating and reigned over all His creatures.—Rosh Hashana 31a</i> Adonoy has clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength. He has firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved. Your throne stands firm from of old, You are from eternity. The rivers have raised—Adonoy— the rivers have raised their voice, the rivers raise their raging waves. More than the sound of many waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea Mighty on high, are You, Adonoy. Your testimonies are extremely faithful, holiness is becoming to Your House, Adonoy—for the length of days....

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and good life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein. He Who makes peace (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace) in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Israel, and say, Amein.

Shabbat Eve Maariv

Shabbat Eve Maariv

<small>On Shabbos, before Borechu, the following selection from the Zohar is said.</small>
Just as they [the six upper sefirot] unite above at "One," so too She [the Shekhina] unites below in the mystery of "One," to be with them above, one corresponding to another. The Holy Blessed One, who is one, does not sit on His glorious throne above until she is made in the mystery of "One," like him, to be one in one. And here is clarified the matter of "YHWH is One and His Name is One" (Zechariah 14:9).

<small>When one is praying without a minyan, continue with the following:</small>

<small>The Chazzan <i>says:</i></small> Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</small> Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever.

Shema & Blessings

Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, With His word He brings on evenings, with wisdom He opens the gates<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These are the gates of sunrise and sunset through which God, in His infinite wisdom, has divided life on earth into two complementary halves.—Rabbi S.R. Hirsch</i> (of heaven); and with understanding changes<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He alternates the three daily periods—evening, morning, and afternoon.—Avudraham</i> the times and alternates the seasons, and arranges the stars in their watches,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The stars appear as watchmen appointed by God to stand guard over the sleeping world below. He also appointed them their places in definite orbits according to His will and for purposes known to Him alone.—S.R. Hirsch</i> in the sky, according to His will. He creates day and night, He rolls the light away from before darkness, and darkness from before light; He causes day to pass and brings night, and separates between day and night; Adonoy of Hosts<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">His Name ה' צְבָאוֹת means “He Who takes all the infinite variety of hosts and creatures and unites them to act and interact as parts of one unified Universe.”— S.R.

[With] An everlasting love<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer is an abbreviated form of the אַהֲבָה רַבָּה prayer in the morning service. It thanks God for the sacred gift of Divine Revelation that He granted Israel. It declares that Torah alone is the eternal heritage of the Jewish people and that all other goods and gifts of life are transitory.— S.R. Hirsch </i> You loved the House of Israel, Your people. Torah and commandments, statutes and laws, You taught us. Therefore, Adonoy, our God, when we lie down and when we rise, we will discuss Your statutes, and rejoice in the words of the teachings of Your Torah and in Your commandments forever. For they are our life and they lengthen our days, and on them we will meditate day and night. [May] Your love never be removed from us Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who loves His people Israel.
<small>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</small> (Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Israel: Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.</b>
<small>The following line is to be said silently</small> Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.
And you shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your possessions. And these words which I command you today, shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them sharply to your children. And you shall discuss them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways.
And it will be— if you vigilantly obey My commandments which I command you this day, to love Adonoy your God, and serve Him with your entire hearts and with your entire souls— that I will give rain for your land in its proper time, the early (autumn) rain and the late (spring) rain; and you will harvest your grain and your wine and your oil. And I will put grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. Beware lest your hearts be swayed and you turn astray, and you worship alien gods and bow to them. And Adonoy's fury will blaze among you, and He will close off the heavens and there will be no rain and the earth will not yield its produce; and you will perish swiftly from the good land which Adonoy gives you. Place these words of Mine upon your hearts and upon your souls,— and bind them for a sign upon your hands, and they shall be for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes. And you shall teach them to your sons, to speak them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways. In order that your days be prolonged, and the days of your children, upon the land which Adonoy swore to your fathers to give them [for as long] as the heavens are above the earth.
And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations; and they will place with the fringes of each corner a thread of blue. And it will be to you for fringes, and you will look upon it and you will remember all the commandments of Adonoy, and you will perform them; and you will not turn aside after your hearts and after your eyes which cause you to go astray. In order that you will remember and perform all My commandments; and you will be holy unto your God. I am Adonoy, your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am Adonoy, your God—

They will rejoice in Your Kingship yhose who preserve the Shabbos and call it a delight The people who sanctify the seventh [day] will all be satisfied and delighted from Your goodness. And in the seventh [day], You took pleasure and made it holy. “Most desirable of days,” You called it, in commemoration of the work of the [world's] beginning.
Our God, and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest, sanctify us with Your commandments and give us our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, and purify our hearts to serve You in truth. And give us as our inheritance, Adonoy our God, in love and in pleasure Your holy Shabbos; and may all Israel rest thereon— the sanctifiers of Your Name. Blessed are You Adonoy, Sanctifier of Shabbos.
Be pleased, Adonoy, our God, with Your people Israel and pay heed to their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Israel; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Israel.
<small>On Rosh Chodesh and on Chol HaMoed, the following prayer is added:</small>
Our God and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Mashiach the son of David, Your servant; the remembrance of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary; and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Israel, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for good life and peace on this day of:
Rosh Chodesh
the <i>Festival of Matzos</i>
the <i>Festival of Sukkos</i>
Remember us Adonoy, our God, on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for good life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Zion. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
We are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Our Rock, Rock of our lives, the Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to (You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; for we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(On Shabbos Chanukah the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, “ וְעַל כֻּלָּם , and for all the foregoing.”)</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances, for the wonders for the consolations and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy, stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name....

And for all the foregoing blessed, exalted and extolled your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever.
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</small> Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise and bless Your great Name with sincerity forever; for You are goodness— the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever— the benevolent Almighty. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise.
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing, life favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Israel, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your sight to bless us and to bless Your people Israel, at all times and at every moment with Your peace (with much strength and peace).
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</small> In the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, good decrees, salvations and condolences, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Israel for a good life and peace.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who blesses His people Israel with peace.
May they be acceptable the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart, before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention.

(May it it be Your will Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers, that no person be envious of me and that I not be envious of others, that I not be brought to anger this day, and that I not cause Your anger; and save me from the evil inclination, and help me be humble and any modest. Our King and our Father, unify Your Name in Your world, rebuild Your city, establish Your house and perfect your sanctuary. Gather our exiles, redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).
Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your Torah. Act for the sake of Your holiness. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.
May they be acceptable— the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart—before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Israel and say Amein.
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years.
And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem as in the days of old and in earlier years.

<small>The Chazzan<i> says:</i></small> Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</small> Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever.

It is our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into Your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. <b>May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.</b> Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and good life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein. He Who makes peace (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace) in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Israel, and say, Amein.

Blessing the Children

<small>It has become a widely accepted custom for parents to bless their children on the eve of Shabbos. The placing of both hands upon the child's head when giving the blessing, symbolizes that the blessing is bestowed with fullness of spirit and heart.</small>
<small>For a boy:</small>
May God make you like Ephraim and Menashe.
May Adonoy bless you and guard you. May Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you. May Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace.
<small>For a girl:</small>
May God make you like Sorah, Rivkah, Rochel and Leah.
May Adonoy bless you and guard you. May Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you. May Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace.

Shalom Aleichem

<small>Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Yehudah said: “Two angels accompany a man on the eve of Shabbos from the synagogue to his home, one good angel and one evil angel.” When the person arrives home to find the lights burning, the table set, and the bed made, the good angel exclaims, “May it be God's will that it be so next Shabbos.” But if not so, if the the house is dark and in disorder, the evil angel exclaims, “May it be God's will that it be so next Shabbos.” The good angel is compelled to answer Amein.—<i>Maseches Shabbos</i> 119b. The custom of singing <i>Sholom Aleichem</i>, peace upon you, upon returning from the synagogue is based on the above Talmudic teaching. Since every Jew is accompanied home by these two angels, it is fitting that he welcome them into his home. Obviously, one should prepare for Shabbos in such manner to evoke the angels' best wishes.</small>

Shabbat Eve Kiddush

<small>The fourth of the Ten Commandments bids us “ זָכוֹר אֶת יוֹם הַשַׁבָּת לְקַדְשׁוֹ ”, Remember the Shabbos day,<i> Lekadsho</i> to keep it holy (<i> Exodus</i> 20:8). The word also implies<i> to sanctify it.</i> Jewish law therefore requires us to sanctify the Shabbos at its beginning—and at its conclusion—with an oral declaration. Thus we have the mitzvah of<i> Kiddush</i> upon the arrival of the Shabbos and<i> Havdala</i> at its conclusion. Most halachic authorities agree that the Scriptural command to proclaim the sanctity of the Shabbos is fulfilled by reciting the middle blessing of the Friday night <i>Shemoneh Esreh.</i> The command to recite the <i>Kiddush</i> at home, over wine, is rabbinic. In Babylonia it was customary to recite<i> Kiddush</i> over wine in the synagogue at the end of the Friday night service for the travelers who remained in the synagogue to eat and sleep. (<i> Pesachim</i> 101a, see<i> Tosofos</i> s.v. דְאָכְלוּ)<br>In many synagogues in the diaspora it is still customary to recite this <i>Kiddush.</i> But in Eretz Yisroel, the custom was never instituted, and so to this day, <i>Kiddush</i> is not recited there on Friday night. It is forbidden to eat on Friday night without first reciting <i>Kiddush,</i> to be followed <i>immediately</i> by the meal. When <i>Kiddush</i> is said over wine, the <i>challa</i> loaves must be covered. When wine is not available on Friday night, it is permissible to recite <i>Kiddush</i> over two whole <i>challa</i> loaves; in such an instance, the <i>challa</i> need not be covered. When reciting <i>Kiddush</i> over bread, you must wash your hands and say the berachah <i>“Al netilas yodayim”</i> before reciting the <i>Kiddush.</i> Halachic opinions differ as to whether <i>Kiddush</i> should be said while standing or while seated at the table. Both practices are widespread and one should follow family tradition or the tradition of one's teachers in this matter.</small>

the sixth day.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The words יוֹם הַשִּׁשִּׁי , the sixth day, are actually the last two words of the biblical verse that immediately precedes וַיְכֻלּוּ , which is the beginning of Kiddush.

Because these two words are part of a verse, the Sages incorporated the preceding words, וַיְהִי עֶרֶב וַיְהִי בקֶר and there was morning and there was evening, to form a complete sentence. These words however, are said quietly as they do not relate to the Kiddush. </i> And the heavens and the earth were completed and [so were] all their hosts.

<small>Each person should receive some wine from the Kiddush cup. Everybody then wash their hands and recite the berachah על נטילת ידים and the head of the household says the berachah for bread over two vhallohs,, and fivess a piecr of the challah to each preson.</small>

Shabbat Morning Services

Pesukei D'Zimrah

<small>The following sequence of prayers until Yishtabach (p. 94) is called <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i> (verses of praise). These selected Scriptural passages were arranged by the Gaonim of the ninth century, in fulfillment of the Talmudic statement (<i>MasechesBerachos</i> 32a), “A person should always praise God first and make his requests [offer his prayers] afterwards.” Beginning with <i>Baruch She'amar</i> (p. 80), it is forbidden to interrupt your prayer with conversation until after the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> (p. 132). You are permitted to answer <i>Amein,</i> respond to <i>Barechu, Kaddish</i> and to say <i>Kedushah</i> even though you have passed <i>Baruch She'amar.</i> You are also permitted to say <i>Modim d'Rabbonon</i> and the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> together with the congregation. If you are concerned that the saying of <i>Kerias Shema</i> will not be within the proper time should you follow the regular order of prayers, you are permitted to recite the entire <i>Kerias Shema</i> during the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i>. The first 28 verses of this section are taken from <i>1 Chronicles</i> 16:8-36, and the first 15 are almost identical with the first fifteen verses of Psalms 105. These prayers are mentioned in <i>Maseches Soferim.</i></small>

A Psalm, a song for the inauguration of the Temple, by David.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was Solomon who built the Temple, why is its inauguration attributed to David?

<small>It is customary to stand while reciting the following paragraph.</small>
Adonoy is King, Adonoy was King Adonoy will be King forever and ever.
Adonoy is King, Adonoy was King Adonoy will be King forever and ever.
And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.
Deliver us Adonoy, our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to Your holy Name— to be extolled in Your praise. Blessed is Adonoy, God of Israel from the world till the next world and all the people said: “Amen, Praise God.” Let every soul praise God. Praise God.
<small>In this psalm, David sings the praises of the Torah. The Kuzari notes that even though the skies “proclaim God's glory” and the Psalmist describes the sun so glowingly, David nevertheless concludes that in comparison to the Torah they are insignificant.</small><br>To the Chief Musician, a Psalm of David. The skies recount the glory of the Almighty, and His handiwork is related by the firmament.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> שָׁמַיִם , skies, refers to the heavenly regions beyond earth’s atmosphere, where the stars and planets orbit. רָקִיעַ , firmament, refers to the earth’s atmosphere where clouds form, and precipitation takes place. The verb לְסַפֵּר means to recount something which occurred in the past. Thus the stars and planets in the שָׁמַיִם recount the fact that long ago God created a glorious universe. The רָקִיעַ , on the other hand, relates that God’s handiwork is evidenced in the constant formation of clouds and in the precipitation of rain. The firmament enables man to recognize the constant renewal of God’s providence.— Malbim </i> Day to day makes speech flow,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Daily renewal of the activities of creation, beginning with sunrise, stir mankind to proclaim God’s praises.—Rashi</i> and night to night expresses wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Night after night the sun sets beneath the horizon only to rise and set again the following day. This unchanging pattern is evidence of the Divine wisdom implanted in God’s creation.—Rashi</i> There is no speech, and there are no words; their voice is never heard.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Though the heavens have no means of verbal communication, the soul of man, with its sensitivity and perception, can understand their message clearly.—Ibn Ezra</i> Throughout the earth, their line extends, and to the edge of the inhabited world their words, for the sun He has set a tent in their midst.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">God provided the sun a permanent residence in the heavens. David describes this point to which the sun returns daily as its ‘tent’—its residence in the sky.—Metsudas Yehoshua</i> And it [the sun] is like a groom departing his bridal chamber,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">When the groom steps out of the bridal chamber, everyone rushes to greet him with great joy. Analogously, when the sun rises each day, all of creation rejoices.—Radak</i> happy as a warrior to run on course.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">A warrior is happy for the opportunity to go into battle because he has confidence in his skill and strength. Similarly, the sun rejoices knowing it will serve its Creator’s goals by running its course.—Metsudas Dovid.</i> From one end of the skies is its rising and its circuit is to their [other] end; there is no escaping its heat. The Torah of Adonoy, is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Adonoy, is trustworthy, making wise the simple [man]. The precepts of Adonoy, are upright, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of Adonoy, is lucid, enlightening the eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Every command of God is flawless, lighting the way for those who walk in His way. Those who ignore His commands stumble in darkness.— Radak</i> The fear of Adonoy, is pure, it endures forever; the judgments of Adonoy, are true, they are righteous in unison.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">They are all in total harmony. There is no contradiction between them.—Ibn Ezra</i> More desirable than gold, even more than quantities of fine gold;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"> פָּז is the purest form of refined gold.</i> and sweeter than honey, or the drippings of honeycombs.

May they be acceptable— the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart before You, Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
<small>In this psalm, David expresses the joy of the righteous in the Divine Providence of God in every aspect of the world and in the affairs of man. For the righteous see the “laws of nature” only as an external cloak, concealing the true supervision of God. They see <i>through</i> the laws of nature and perceive the Divine order and providence of the Creator.</small><br>Joyfully exult in Adonoy, [you] righteous ones, for the upright, praise is fitting. Thank Adonoy with the harp, with the ten-stringed lyre sing to Him. Sing Him a new song, play skillfully with jubilation. For upright is the word of Adonoy and all His deeds [are done] with faithfulness. He loves righteousness and justice the kindliness of Adonoy fills the earth. By the word of God, the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth, all their hosts. He gathers like a mound the waters of the sea, He places in vaults the deep waters. Fear Adonoy, all the earth, of Him, be in dread all dwellers of the inhabited world. For He spoke and it became; He commanded and it stood. Adonoy annuls the counsel of nations, He disrupts the intention of peoples. The counsel of Adonoy will stand forever, the thoughts of His heart throughout all generations. Fortunate is the nation for whom Adonoy is their God, the people He chose as His heritage. From the heavens, Adonoy looks [down], He sees all mankind. From His dwelling place, He watches intently all the inhabitants of the earth. He forms their hearts all together;<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud (Sanhedrin 37a) states: When a man mints many coins from the same mold, they are all exactly alike, but God formed all of mankind from Adam and no two men look exactly alike. The Sages in Berachos 58a add: just as no two faces are alike, so are no two personalities alike. Thus even though God made them all together, each has his own unique personality.</i> He perceives all their doings. A king is not saved by a great army; a mighty man is not rescued with [his] great strength. A horse is deceptive [assurance] for deliverance, and with its great strength it provides no escape. Behold, the eye of Adonoy is on those who fear Him, on those who wait for His kindliness. To rescue their soul from death, and to keep them alive during famine. Our soul yearned for Adonoy, our help and our shield is He. For in Him our heart will rejoice, for in His holy Name we trust, May Your kindliness, Adonoy, be upon us, as we have waited for You.
<small>This psalm is based entirely on an event that took place in David's personal life as related in <i>1 Samuel</i> 21:11-16. Forced to flee from Saul, he took refuge among the Philistines, where he was recognized as the slayer of Goliath. In order to escape death at the hands of his foes, David pretended to be an imbecile, and was sent away unharmed by King Avimelech.</small><br>Of David, When he acted insane in the presence of Avimelech and he [Avimelech] drove him away, and he [David] left. I will bless Adonoy at all times constantly is His praise in my mouth. In Adonoy does my soul take pride,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">David is proud that he is worthy of uttering God’s Name.</i> the humble will hear [this] and rejoice. Declare the greatness of Adonoy with me, and let us exalt His Name together. I sought Adonoy and He responded to me; and from all my fears He saved me. [Those who] look to Him are enlightened and their faces are never darkened [humiliated]. This poor man<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">David describes himself as a helpless indigent waiting for God’s compassion.—Radak</i> called and Adonoy heard; and from all his troubles, He delivered him. The angel of Adonoy encamps around those who fear Him and sets them free. Taste and see that Adonoy is good;<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Seporno says that taste refers to the senses whereas see refers to the intellect.</i> fortunate is the man who takes refuge in Him. Fear Adonoy, [you] His holy ones, for there is no deprivation for those who fear Him. Young lions feel want and hunger, but those who seek Adonoy will not lack any good thing. Come children, listen to me, fear of Adonoy will I teach you. Who is the man who desires life,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">David does not say הֶחָפֵץ בַּחַיִּים ‘he who takes pleasure in life’ but הֶחָפֵץ חַיִּים , ‘he who desires life,’ whose only goal is life; that is, he desires to attain such a level of existence as can truly be called life. — S.R. Hirsch </i> and loves days that he may see good? Guard your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceitfully. Turn from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of Adonoy are toward the righteous, and His ears [are open] to their cry. The face<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The expression פְּנֵי ה' , Face of God, describes Divine anger. See Leviticus 20:5, וֵשַׂמְתִּי אֲנִי אֶת פָּנַי בָּאִישׁ הַהוּא , “And I will set my Face against that man.”</i> of Adonoy is set against evildoers to excise from earth, their memory. They<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">They refers to the righteous ones (Rashi) and to the the repentant sinners (Ibn Ezra).</i> cry out and Adonoy hears and from all their troubles, He saves them. Adonoy is close to the broken-hearted and those crushed in spirit, He delivers. Many evils befall a righteous man, and from all of them, Adonoy saves him. He preserves all his bones, not one of them is broken. The cause of death of the wicked is evil; and the haters of the righteous are doomed. Adonoy liberates the soul of His servants, and none are doomed who take refuge in Him.
<small>According to our Sages, Psalms 90 through 101, were said by Moses. According to <i>Radak</i>, David actually found this psalm in its written form and knowing it to be the prayer of Moses, included it in his book of psalms. It speaks of the frailty of man and the brevity of his life and asks for God's compassion and favor despite his wrongdoings.</small><br>A prayer of Moses, the man of God: My Master a dwelling[-place] have You been for us in every generation. Before the mountains were born, and You brought forth the earth and the inhabited world; from world to world<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">From before this world to the next world You are Almighty.</i> You are Almighty.

<small>This Psalm, composed by Moses on the day the Tabernacle was completed, is a source of inspiration to all who seek the Almighty as their refuge and fortress.</small><br>He who dwells in the shelter of the Supreme One, under the protection of Shadai he will abide. I say of Adonoy, [He is] my refuge and my stronghold, my God in Whom I trust. For He will save you from the snare-trap, from destructive pestilence. With His wings He will cover you and beneath His wings, you will find refuge; His truth is a shield, a full shield. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day. The pestilence that prowls in darkness, nor the deadly plague that ravages at noon. A thousand will fall at your [left] side, and ten thousand at your [right] side but it<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">‘It’ refers to ‘arrow,’ pestilence,’ and ‘plague’ of the previous verse.</i> shall not come near you. Only<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">You will only see the destruction but you will not be harmed by it.</i> with your eyes will you behold and see the punishment of the wicked. For you [have proclaimed]: “Adonoy is my refuge,” the Supreme One you have made your dwelling. No evil shall befall you, and no plague shall come near your tent. For His angels He will command on your behalf— to guard you in all your ways. They will carry you upon their hands, lest you hurt your foot on a rock. You will tread upon lion and snake, you will trample young lion and serpent. Because he clings to Me with desire, I will save him; I will strengthen him, for he knows My Name. When he calls upon Me, I will answer him; I am with him in distress, I will free him and honor him. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance.
A Psalm. Sing to Adonoy, a new song<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">God will remember the kindness He promised to Israel, because of His faithfulness.— Etz Yosef</i> for He has performed wonders; His right hand effected deliverance for Him [as did] His holy arm.

Raise your voice unto Adonoy all [inhabitants of] the earth! burst forth into exultation, sing, and play music! Play to Adonoy with a harp, with harp and the sound of music. With trumpets and the sound of the<i> shofar</i> raise your voices before the King, Adonoy. The sea and its fullness, will roar with joy! [also] the world and those who dwell therein. Rivers will clap hands, together, mountains will sing. Before Adonoy when He comes to judge the earth; He will judge mankind with righteousness and peoples with uprightness.
A Song of Ascents. I will lift my eyes to the mountains: from where will my help come? My help comes from Adonoy, Maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot slip, He will not slumber—your Guardian. Behold, He does not slumber nor does He sleep—the Guardian of Israel! Adonoy is your Guardian, Adonoy is your shelter at your right hand. By day the sun will not smite you, nor the moon at night. Adonoy will guard you from all evil; He will preserve your soul. Adonoy will guard your going and coming, from now and forever.
A Song of Ascents of David. I rejoiced when they said to me, “To the House of Adonoy let us go.” Our feet stood within your gates, Jerusalem. Jerusalem which is built as a city that fosters togetherness. There the tribes went up, the tribes of God, as a testimony of Israel; to give thanks to the Name of Adonoy. For there, were set thrones for judgment, thrones of the House of David. Inquire after the peace of Jerusalem; may those who love you enjoy serenity. Peace be within your walls, serenity within your palaces. For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will say, “Peace be with you.” For the sake of the House of Adonoy our God, I will seek your good.
A Song of Ascents. To You I will lift my eyes, [to You] Who dwells in heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants [look] toward the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden [look] toward the hand of her mistress; so our eyes [look] toward Adonoy our God until he is gracious to us. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are fully satiated with humiliation. Our soul is fully satiated with the scorning of those who are at ease, with the humiliation of the arrogant oppressors.
A Song of Ascents of David. “Had it not been for Adonoy Who was for us,” let Israel now say. “Had it not been for Adonoy Who was for us, when men rose up against us. They would have then swallowed us alive, when their wrath blazed against us. The waters would have then swept us away, affliction would have passed over our soul. Then over our soul would have gone the impetuous waters. Blessed is Adonoy, Who did not give us as prey to their teeth. Our soul escaped as a bird out of the fowler's snare; the snare is broken and we escaped. Our help is in the Name of Adonoy, Maker of heaven and earth.”
<small>In this psalm, David praises God for choosing the people of Isreal as His treasured people. He also speaks of those who will ultimately be worthy of serving Him, in the rebuilt House of God, in the Messianic era.</small><br>Praise God, Praise the Name of Adonoy, Praise [Him], servants of Adonoy. [You] who stand in the House of Adonoy, in the courtyards of the House of our God. Praise God, for Adonoy is good, sing to His Name which is pleasant. For God chose Jacob to be His, Israel for His treasure. For I know that Adonoy is great, our Master [is greater] than all gods. All that was desired by Adonoy, He has done in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths. He causes clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; lightning for the rain He makes; He brings forth winds from His vaults. He struck down the firstborn of Egypt both man and beast. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of Egypt, upon Pharaoh and upon all his servants. For He smote many nations, and slew mighty kings: Sichon, King of the Amorites, and Og, King of the Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan. And He gave their lands as an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel, His people. Adonoy is Your Name forever, Adonoy is Your mention for generations. For Adonoy judges His people,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">According to Seporno, the verse is translated, ‘When Adonoy judges on behalf of His people, referring to the judgement of all who oppressed the Jewish people.</i> and upon His servants will He relent.

<small>The Talmud (<i> Pesachim</i> 118a) calls this<i> psalm</i> הַלֵל הַגָדוֹל,<i> the great praise,</i> because it describes how God, enthroned on high, sustains every living creature. The first twenty four verses call on us to thank God, the Master of the Universe, Who created it, redeemed us from Egypt, caused us to inherit the lands of Sichon and Og, and delivered us from our enemies. The twenty-fifth verse, נוֹתֵן לֶחֶם לְכָל בָּשָׂר,<i> He gives food to all flesh,</i> is viewed as the climax of the entire<i> psalm</i> . Feeding every creature, day in and day out, is the greatest manifestation of God's provident kindliness. Though He rules in supreme splendor, God is close to the needs of every creature.</small><br>Thank Adonoy for He is good, for His kindliness endures forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This refrain is repeated in all twenty-six verses of the Psalm. We thereby declare that each act of kindliness for which we thank God is not of a temporary nature, lasting merely a day or a year. The effect of His kindliness endures forever, and we continually reap the benefits of every act of Divine kindliness.—Sfas Emes</i>

The<i> Taz</i> (Orach Chaim 51:1) states that this prayer was instituted by the “Men of the Great Assembly.” The blessing contains eighty-seven words suggesting the numerical value of פָּז<i> poz,</i> refined gold.</small>

A Psalm, a song for the Shabbos day. It is good to thank<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to God. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. These pursuits lead him to serve God and to praise Him.—Radak</i> Adonoy, and sing praise to Your Name, Most High. To relate Your kindliness in the morning, and Your faithfulness in the nights.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">We will proclaim His kindliness in the morning of redemption.

How great are Your works, Adonoy; how infinitely profound are Your thoughts.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">God’s ‘works’ are the visible creation, while His ‘thoughts’ are the Divine purpose behind each created thing.—Seporno</i> An empty-headed man cannot know, nor does a fool understand this: When the wicked bloom like grass, and all the evildoers blossom— it is so that they may be destroyed forever. But You will remain on high forever Adonoy. For behold, Your enemies, Adonoy; For behold, Your enemies shall perish; dispersed shall be all evildoers. You uplifted my horn<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate, ‘You have increased my might like that of the wild ram.’</i> like that of a unicorn; I am saturated with fresh oil.

To declare that Adonoy is upright; He is my Stronghold; in Whom there is no injustice.
Adonoy had begun His reign He has clothed Himself with majesty;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">On the sixth day, the Levites sang Psalm 93, ‘Adonoy is King, He has clothed Himself in majesty,’ because He completed the work of creating and reigned over all His creatures.—Rosh Hashana 31a</i> Adonoy has clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength. He has firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved. Your throne stands firm from of old, You are from eternity. The rivers have raised—Adonoy— the rivers have raised their voice, the rivers raise their raging waves. More than the sound of many waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea Mighty on high, are You, Adonoy. Your testimonies are extremely faithful, holiness is becoming to Your House, Adonoy—for the length of days.

Adonoy is gracious and merciful,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">He is gracious in bestowing reward and merciful in punishment.—Siach Yitzchok</i> slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works.

Praise God! for it is good to sing to our God; for [His] praise is pleasant, befitting. The builder of Jerusalem is Adonoy; the banished ones of Israel He will gather. [He is] the Healer of the broken-hearted and [also] binds up their wounds.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Others render “their sorrows.” Both translations co-exist!

Who gives the animal its fodder; [also] to the young ravens which call. Not the power of the horse does He desire, nor the thighs of man does He want.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">God does not delight in those who place their trust in the strength of horses or in their own strength.—Tzelosa d’Avrohom</i> Adonoy wants those who fear Him, those who hope for His kindliness. Jerusalem, praise Adonoy; Zion, extol your God.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The Psalmist addresses the dwellers in Jerusalem and Zion, not the city itself.—Tzelosa d’Avrohom</i> For He has fortified the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children in your midst. He established peace at your border; with prime wheat He satisfies you. He dispatches His command earthward; His word races swiftly. He provides snow like fleece, He scatters frost like ashes. He hurls His ice like crumbs; who can withstand His cold? He dispatches His word and melts them; He blows His wind, they flow as water. He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His laws to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is the receiver and preserver of God’s divine Law, the Torah, which includes chukim, statutes which confine the physical, sensual aspects of man within the bounds of moral purity, and also mishpotim, laws which govern communal life. Among the nations, law is determined by the views they hold at a given time and place concerning the needs of a society, and so their laws are based on expediency.—S.R. Hirsch</i> He did not do so to any [other] nation; and of His laws they were not informed. Praise God.
Praise God. Praise Adonoy from the sky; Praise Him in the heights! Praise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His hosts! Praise Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all the stars of light.

The sun never violates its mandate to serve by day or the moon by night. According to Ibn Ezra, the verse might also be translated “He issued a decree which will not pass away,” for God’s decree is permanent and immutable.</i> Praise Adonoy from the earth, sea-monsters and all [that dwell in] the depths. Fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormwind, [all] fulfilling His word. The mountains and all the hills, fruit trees and all cedars. Wild beasts and all animals, creeping things and winged fowl.

<small>The custom of reciting the following additions to <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i> is men- tioned as early as the Gaonic era, specifically by Rav Amram Gaon. These verses were incorporated into our daily prayers because they speak so eloquently of God's majesty, and of the Divine providence which is the source of the power, riches, might, and honor of all human beings. The first four verses (<i>1 Chronicles</i> 29:10-13) relate David's blessing to God, when he presented the gold, silver, and jewels he amassed for the construction of the Holy Temple. It was a day of great rejoicing as, following David's example, the leaders and princes also presented generous gifts for the construction of the Temple.</small>

The Moabites, the descendants of Lot, feared they would be punished because of the dispute between Lot and Abraham (Genesis 13:7).

<small>The Mishna, (<i> Maseches Pesachim</i> 117b) refers to the following prayer as בִּרְכַּת הַשִּׁיר ,<i> the blessing of song.</i> Some commentaries suggest that it is so named because it forms a lengthy song that concludes with the blessing of יִשְׁתַּבַּח on page 000. On weekdays, when there is not sufficient time to concentrate adequately on our prayers, we merely recite the concluding blessing of יִשְׁתַּבַּח , but on Sabbaths and Festivals we recite the prayer in its entirety.</small>
The soul of every living thing shall bless Your Name, Adonoy, our God; and the spirit of all flesh shall glorify and exalt Your mention, our King, continually.

Iyun Tefiloh says that בְּרִיוֹת , created beings, refers to everything God created during the six days of creation, whereas תּוֹלָדוֹת refers to those things that come forth, i.e., were “born” from the original created things.

[You are] Almighty in the power of Your might; Great in the honor of Your Name, Powerful for ever and awesome through Your awesome deeds;

the King Who sits on a throne [that is] exalted and uplifted.
<small>On Shabbos, the Chazzan begins here:</small>
He Who dwells in eternity, exalted and holy is His Name. And it is written: “Joyfully exult in God, [you] righteous ones, for the upright, praise is fitting.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 33:1.</i> Through the mouth of the upright, You are exalted, and with the lips of the righteous You are blessed; and by the tongue of the pious, You are sanctified; and in the midst of the holy, You are extolled.

<small>In this Psalm, said during the Ten Days of Penitence, the Jewish soul sings of the Jewish spirit ascending from the depths of the deepest misery of all, the burden of sin and guilt.</small>
A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I have called to You, Adonoy. My Master, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If You God should take account of iniquities, my Master, who could survive? For with You is forgiveness, in order that You be feared. I hope for Adonoy, my soul hopes; and for His word, I wait. My soul [waits] for my Master more than the watchman [waits] for the morning, [more than] the watchman [waits] for the morning. Wait, Israel, upon Adonoy, for with Adonoy there is loving-kindness, and with Him there is much redemption. And He will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.
<small>The Half-Kaddish is recited by the Chazzan</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
<small>The Chazzan<i> says:</i></small> Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.


<small>The Congregation responds and the Chazzan<i> repeats:</i></small> Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever.

Shema & Blessings

<small>The two blessings יוֹצֵר אוֹר “He Who forms light” and אַהֲבָה רַבָּה “Great love,” are referred to as the blessings preceding Shema (<i> Maseches Berachos</i> 11a). According to Rambam they were formulated by Ezra and his Court (<i> Laws of Shema</i> 1:7).</small> <small>You may not interrupt your prayers from this point on until after the<i> Shemoneh Esrei</i> . But you may answer “Amein” to the blessings of הָאֵל הַקָּדוֹשׁ “The Holy Powerful One” and שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָה “He Who heeds prayer;” say the thrice-repeated קָדוֹשׁ “Holy . . .” and בָּרוּךְ כְּבוֹד “Blessed is the glory . . .” of Kedusha; and answer Barechu. You may also answer אָמֵן יְהֵא שְׁמֵהּ רַבָּא “Amein, May His great Name,” when you hear Kaddish.” You may also answer Amein after the blessings of יוֹצֵר הַמְּאוֹרוֹת , “Who forms the luminaries,” and הָבּוֹחֵר בְּעַמוֹ יִשׂרָאֵל בְּאַהֲבָה , “Who chooses His people Israel with love.”</small> <small>For a more detailed exposition of these laws, see <i>Metsudah Kitzur Shulchan Aruch,</i> Vol. I, pp. 172-176.</small>

<small>The recitation of Shema was part of the daily worship in the Holy Temple, and our Sages ordained that it be recited in the synagogue service, providing it a central place in the morning and evening prayers of each Jew. Its importance may be judged from the fact that the very first Mishnah in the Oral Torah opens with the question, “From what time may the evening Shema be read?”</small><br><small>In reading Shema, bear in mind that you are performing a Scriptural commandment. All three paragraphs should be read with<i> kavanah,</i> concentrated intention, on what you are saying. The entire Shema should be recited in awe and reverence as it proclaims the existence and unity of God; the Jews' complete dedication to God and His commandments; the belief in Divine justice; the remembrance of the Exodus and the selection of the Jews as God's Chosen People. These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָלּ־לְּבָבְ֒ךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.</small>
<small>The following three words should be said when praying without aminyan:</small><br>(Almighty, faithful King)
 Hear, Israel: Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שְׁמַע and last letter of אֶחָד are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עֵד “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to God’s unity.— Avudraham Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on God’s unity. The last word, אֶחָד “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that God, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Israel, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i>
<small>The following line is to be said silently</small><br>Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Israel” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Jacob said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moses did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Jacob ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a. When Moses went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise God by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם aloud.— Midrash Rabba to Deuteronomy </i>

Moses will rejoice<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Why did our Sages institute three different forms for the Sabbath Shemoneh Esrei: in Maariv אַתָּה קִדַשְׁתָּ , in Shacharis יִשְׂמַח משֶה , and in Mincha אַתּה אֶחָד , whereas on Festivals all three services have the identical Shemoneh Esrei? Our Sages ordained these three separate forms to signify three kinds of Sabbath—the Sabbath of creation, the Sabbath on which the Torah was given at Sinai, and the Sabbath of the World to Come. Thus at Maariv, we say “ אַתָּה קִדַשְׁתָּ , You have sanctified the Seventh day—the climax of making heaven and earth” commemorating the Sabbath of creation. At Shacharis, we say, “ יִשְׂמַח משֶה Moses will rejoice in the gift . . . when he stood before You on Mount Sinai”—to commemorate the giving of the Torah. And at Mincha we say, “ אַתָּה אֶחָד , You are One,” to remind us of the Sabbath of the World-to-Come where indeed it will be revealed to all that He is One.— Siach Yitzchok Moses “Will” rejoice—the future tense is used to indicate that after the resurrection of the dead, in the World-to-Come, Moses will rejoice triply with all aspects of the Sabbath.—Metzudas Yehoshua</i> with the gift<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath is not a burden but a מַתָּנָה , a gift, God’s most precious and blessed gift.</i> that was his portion, for a faithful servant You called him.

“And the Children of Israel shall preserve the Sabbath, to maintain the Sabbath for their generations as an everlasting covenant. Between Me and between the Children of Israel, it is a sign for all time that in six days Adonoy made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He abstained from work, and rested.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 31:16, 17.</i>
And You, Adonoy, our God, did not give it<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath.</i> to the nations of the lands; nor did You give it as an inheritance our King, to worshippers of idols, nor in its<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath’s rest.</i> rest do the uncircumcised dwell. For only to Israel, Your people, did You give it in love— to the seed of Jacob whom You chose.
They shall rejoice in Your kingship— those who preserve the Sabbath and call it a delight. The people who sanctify the seventh [day] will all be satisfied and delighted from Your goodness. And in the seventh [day], You took pleasure and You hallowed it. “Most desirable of days,” You called it— a commemoration of the work of creation.
Our God, and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest, sanctify us with Your commandments and give us our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, and purify our hearts to serve You in truth. And give us as our inheritance, Adonoy our God, in love and in pleasure Your holy Sabbath; and may Israel rest thereon— the sanctifiers of Your Name— Blessed are You Adonoy, Sanctifier of the Sabbath.
Be pleased, Adonoy, our God, with Your people Israel and their prayer, and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Israel; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Israel.

Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due.
<small>On Chanukah the following prayer is added.</small>

[We thank You] for the miracles for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances, and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons. When the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified Name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.

And for all the foregoing blessed, exalted and extolled your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever.
<small>(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, add:</small> Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.)
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise and bless Your great Name with sincerity forever; for You are goodness— the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever— the benevolent Almighty. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise.

My God, guard my tongue from evil<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer was the personal meditation of Mar the son of Ravina, which he recited after he completed his prayers (Maseches Berachos 17a), and it is therefore expressed in the singular. The Jew prays that his mouth, his tongue, and his lips, which have just served as the instruments for his communion with God, will not forfeit any of their moral purity in his dealings with his fellow men.—Yaavetz This prayer is based on the verse, “Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech” (Psalms 34:14). Even though good and evil depend on man’s will, he nevertheless prays for God’s help in controlling himself, so as to permit no insult to provoke his wrath, and to remain calm and silent even in the face of a curse.—Avudraham</i> and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">May I have an open, receptive and understanding mind and spirit in the study of Torah. When it comes to mitzvos, let my soul know no indifference, indolence, or passivity. Let me demonstrate zealous and vigorous endeavor in all things pertaining to Your mitzvos.—Etz Yosef; S.R. Hirsch</i> And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. 

(May it it be Your will Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers, that no person be envious of me and that I not be envious of others, that I not be brought to anger this day, and that I not cause Your anger; and save me from the evil inclination, and help me be humble and any modest. Our King and our Father, unify Your Name in Your world, rebuild Your city, establish Your house and perfect your sanctuary. Gather our exiles, redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).

Today is the holy Sabbath on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple:
A psalm, a song for the Sabbath day. It is good to thank<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to God. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life.

To relate Your kindliness in the morning, and Your faithfulness in the nights.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">We will proclaim His kindliness in the morning of redemption.

<small>The following psalm (27) is recited at the conclusion of services, morning and evenings, from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres. Others say only until Hoasha'na Rabbah.

Thanksgiving Blessing

<small>Rav says, (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 54) that four are obligated to offer thanks: persons who have safely completed a sea or land journey, or who have recovered from a serious illness, or have been released from captivity. One who is obligated to recite the blessing of thanksgiving should do so at the Torah-scroll, after the blessing following the Torah reading is said.</small>

Hagbahah

<small>When the reading of the Torah is concluded, the Half Kaddish is recited by the Reader. The Maftir is read and then the Torah is raised so that the congregation can see the script, and the congregation exclaims:</small>
This is the Torah which Moses placed before the children of Israel. at Adonoy's command by the hand of Moses. It is a tree of life to those who grasp to it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Long life is at its right, at its left, riches and honor. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it.

Haftarah Blessings

<small><i> The Haftarah,</i> a selected reading from the Prophets, usually contains some reference to the text or theme of the Sidrah, the Torah Reading, which precedes it. According to<i> Avudraham,</i> the recitation of the<i> Haftarah,</i> was instituted during the period of persecution preceding the revolt of the Maccabees, when the actual Torah reading was prohibited. Readings from the Prophets were then substituted in order to review some of the teachings contained in the Torah itself. The word הַפְטָרָה is derived from the root פטר , which means to discharge or conclude. By reading the Haftarah, we conclude the reading of the Torah.</small><br><small>Berachah recited before the reading of the Haftarah:</small>

According to the Sages אֵין שְׁנֵי נְבִיאִים מִתְנַבְאִין בְּסִגְנוֹן אֶחָד , each prophet has a style, peculiar to him alone, hence a prophet requires the gift of eloquence. God chooses as His prophets only such men whose words are נֶאֶמָרִים בֶּאֶמֶת , spoken in truth.— S. R. Hirsch </i> which were spoken in truth. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who chooses the Torah and Moses, His servant, and Israel, His people, and the prophets of truth and righteousness.

Upon his throne, no stranger<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">“Stranger” in this context means anyone not of the seed of David.</i> shall sit, and others will no longer inherit his honor.

<small>Following the readings from the Torah and the Prophets, (the Divine laws and knowledge handed to us in <i>writing,</i>) we proceed to prayers for the survival, support and welfare of the men who perpetuate these laws by teaching and studying the <i>Oral Law</i>. The Babylonian Talmud, the <i>Oral Law</i> was organized in its present form in Babylonia, consequently the first two prayers were composed there in Aramaic, the language used and understood by most Jews.</small> <small>The following three prayers are said only on Sabbath, they are not said on Yom Tov that occurs on weekdays.</small> <small>According to Mishna Berurah 101:19 one who prays without a minyan should not say any of the following prayers, but rather begin <i>Father of Compassion</i> on page 000.</small>
May there arise deliverance from Heaven— favor, kindliness, compassion, long life, ample sustenance, Heavenly assistance, physical health, good vision,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate נְהוֹרָה מַעַלְיָא as “higher (or true) enlightenment.”</i> and living, thriving children, children who will not interrupt nor desist from studying the words of the Torah— For our masters, and our sages, the holy fellowships, in the land of Israel and in Babylonia.

May there arise deliverance from Heaven— favor, kindliness, compassion, long life, ample sustenance, Heavenly assistance, physical health, good vision, and living, thriving children, children who will not interrupt nor desist from studying the words of Torah— for this entire holy congregation, adults, and children, infants and women.

He Who blessed our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, will bless this entire holy congregation together with all the holy congregations, them, their wives and their sons and their daughters, and all that belong to them. Whoever dedicates synagogues for prayer, and whoever enters them to pray, and whoever donates lamps for lighting, wine for Kiddush and Havdalah, food for wayfarers, charity for the poor; and whoever occupies himself with the needs of the community— in a faithful manner— The Holy One, blessed is He, will pay them their reward, remove from them all sickness, heal their entire body, pardon all their iniquities, and send blessing, and success upon all the work of their hands, together with all of Israel, their brethren, and let us say, Amein.

Blessing of New Month

<small> The following prayer יְהִי רָצוֹן, composed by Rav, head of the Babylonian yeshiva at Sura, is mentioned in the Talmud, (Maseches Berachos 16b), but not as a prayer specifically ordained for blessing the new month. It was actually a daily prayer that Rav recited <i> each</i> day after the regular service.</small> <small>The יְהִי רָצוֹן was adapted by Ashkenazi Jews as a prayer for the coming of the new month by adding the words: שֶׁתְּחַדֵשׁ עָלֵינוּ אֶת הַחוֹדֶשׁ הַזֶּה לְטוֹבָה וְלִבְרָכָה but Sephardic Jews omit the entire prayer as it is not mentioned either by <i> Rambam</i> or <i> Avudraham.</i></small>
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to renew this [coming] month for us for goodness and blessing. Grant us long life—a life of peace, a life of goodness, a life of blessing, a life of sustenance, a life of bodily vigor, a life in which there is fear of Heaven and fear of sin a life in which there is no shame or disgrace, a life of prosperity and honor, a life in which there will be love of Torah and fear of Heaven, a life [in which] will be fulfilled the wishes of our hearts for goodness. Amein, Selah.
<small>The following prayer, is the actual blessing of the month. The Chazzan takes the Torah in his hands and declares:</small>
He Who performed miracles for our fathers, and redeemed them from slavery to freedom, may He redeem us soon and gather our dispersed from the four corners of the earth; united in friendship is all of Israel! And let us say, Amein.
The new month of (<i>name the month</i>), which will be on (<i>name the day or days</i>) will come to us and all Israel for goodness.
May He renew it, the Holy One, blessed is He, for us and for all His people, the House of Israel, for goodness and blessing for happiness and for rejoicing, for deliverance and for consolation, for plentiful sustenance, and support, for good life and for peace, for good tidings, and for good news, for rain at the proper time, for total recovery, and for early redemption, and let us say, Amein.

Prayer for Deceased

<i>Yizkor may be recited following the Torah reading.</i>
<small>In memory of a father:</small>
May God remember the soul of my father, my teacher, (Mention his Hebrew name and that of his father) son of who has gone to his world, because I pledge [without vowing] to donate charity for his sake In this merit, may his soul be bound up in the bond of life, with the souls of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, Sarah, Rivkah, Rachel, and Leah, and with the other righteous men and women who are in the Gan Eden (Paradise) and let us say Amein.

Av HaRachamim

<small>According to <i>Shaar Ephraim,</i> this prayer was composed during the persecutions of 1075 and 1095 when thousands of Jews were killed in sanctification of God's Name.</small> <small>אַב הָרַחֲמִים is said every Shabbos except: when the new moon is blessed, on Rosh Chodesh, on Yom Tov, on Chanukah or Purim, when there is a bridegroom, or when one whose son is to be circumcised on that day is present in the congrega- tion. Between Pesach and Shavuous, אַב הָרַחֲמִים is said in many congregations even on the Shabossos when the new month is blessed.</small>
 Father of compassion, Who dwells on high, in His profound mercy, He will be compassionately mindful of the pious, the upright, and the blameless ones; the holy communities who gave their lives for the sanctification of the Divine Name. They were beloved and pleasant in their lifetime, and in their death are not parted [from Him].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">2 Samuel 1:23.</i> They were swifter than eagles and stronger than lions to do the will of their Possessor and the desire of their Rock. Our God will recall them favorably together with the other righteous of all time. And will avenge the blood of His servants that has been shed. As it is written in the Torah of Moses, the man of God, “Sing [you] nations, [the praise] of His people, for the blood of His servants will He avenge, and vengeance will He repay to His foes; and His land will be atoned [with the atonement] of His people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:43, see Rashi.</i> And by the hands of Your servants, the Prophets, it is written saying: “I will cleanse them<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">God will forgive the nations for their wrongdoings but He will not forgive them for shedding Jewish blood.</i> [but] for their blood,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Their blood refers to Jewish blood.</i> I will not cleanse them, and Adonoy [still] dwells in Zion.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Joel 4:21.</i> And in the Holy Writings, it is said, “Why should the nations say, ‘Where is their God?'

When God takes His vengeance, Israel will be vindicated and hold its head high with pride.</i> 
Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways, and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<i>The Chazzan takes the Torah and says:</i>
They will praise the Name of Adonoy for His Name alone is exalted.
<i>The congregation then says:</i> His majesty is over the earth and the skies. He will raise the might of His people, [which is] praise for all His pious ones, for the Children of Israel, the people near to Him. Praise God.
<i>On Shabbos say:</i>
A Psalm to David. Ascribe to Adonoy—you sons of the mighty— ascribe to Adonoy glory and might. Ascribe to Adonoy the glory due His Name, prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness. Adonoy's voice is upon the waters. Almighty of glory thunders, Adonoy is upon [the] many waters. The voice of Adonoy is in power, the voice of Adonoy is in beauty. The voice of Adonoy breaks cedars, Adonoy shatters the cedars of Lebanon. He makes them leap like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like unicorns. The voice of Adonoy hews out flames of fire. The voice of Adonoy makes the desert tremble, Adonoy makes the desert of Kadesh tremble. The voice of Adonoy causes hinds to calve, and strips the forests bare; and in His Sanctuary all proclaim [His] glory. Adonoy sat enthroned (even) at the flood, Adonoy is enthroned as King forever. Adonoy will give strength to His people; Adonoy will bless His people with peace.
<i>When Yom Tov occurs on a weekday, continue:</i>
A Psalm of David: the earth is Adonoy's and the fullness thereof, the inhabited world and those who dwell in it. For He founded it upon the seas, and established it upon rivers. Who may ascend the mountain of Adonoy, and who may stand in the place of His holiness? The clean of hands and the pure of heart, who has not borne My soul in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully. He will bear Adonoy's blessing and righteousness from the God of his deliverance. This is the generation of those who seek Him, the seekers of Your Presence, [God of] Jacob, selah. Lift up your heads, gates, and be uplifted [you] entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is this King of Glory? Adonoy, strong and mighty; Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle. Lift up your heads, gates, and lift up, entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is He, this King of Glory? Adonoy of hosts, He is the King of Glory, <i>selah.</i>
<i>As the Torah is returned to the Ark the following is said:</i>
And when it rested, he would say: Return, Adonoy, to the myriads and thousands of Israel. Arise, Adonoy unto Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your strength. Let Your priests clothe themselves in righteousness, and let Your devoted ones sing in joy. For the sake of David, Your servant, do not reject Your anointed. For I have given you good instruction, do not forsake My Torah. It is a tree of life to those who grasp it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return; renew our days as of old.
<i>The Chazzan recites the Half-Kaddish:</i>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will, and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach. in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Shabbos Shuva:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Musaf

My Master, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children's children, for the sake of His Name, with love.
<small>(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, add:</small> Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God.)
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Abraham.
You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the powerful One to deliver us.
<small>From the Musaf<i>of the first day of Pesach until the</i>Musaf<i> of Shemini Atzeres you should say:</i></small> He causes the dew to descend. <small>(From the Musaf<i>of Shemini Atzeres until the </i>Musaf<i> of the first day of Pesach you should say:</i></small> Causer of the wind to blow and of the rain to fall.)
Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth.
<small>(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, add:</small> Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy.)
And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.
<b>Kedushah</b>
<small>When praying silently, continue “You are holy,”.</small>
<small>The Congregation says and the Chazzan repeats:</small><br>A crown is given to You Adonoy, our God by the angels on high and by Your people who assemble below: all of them together thrice repeat “holy” unto You as is said by way of Your prophet, “And they called one to another, and said:
<small>Congregation and Chazzan:</small><br>‘Holy, holy, holy, is Adonoy of hosts, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.’” His glory fills the world, His ministering angels ask one another—“Where is the place of His glory?” Facing them, they offer praise and say:
<small>Congregation and Chazzan:</small><br>“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from His place.” From His place, He will turn in compassion, and favor the people who proclaim the Oneness of His Name; evening and morning, each day, continually, twice each day, with love, they recite “Shema.”
<small>Congregation and Chazzan:</small><br>“Hear Israel, Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.” He is our God, He is our Father, He is our King, He is our Deliverer, He will deliver us and redeem us again and He will let us hear in His mercy a second time in the presence of all the living saying: Behold, I have redeemed you from this final [exile] as from the first, to be your God.
“I am Adonoy, your God.” And among Your holy words it is written: <small>Congregation and Chazzan:</small> “Adonoy will reign forever, your God, Zion, throughout all generations! Praise God.”
<small>The Chazzan concludes:</small><br>From generation to generation we will declare Your greatness, and to all eternity, we will sanctify Your holiness, and Your praise, our God, will not depart from our mouths forever and ever; because You are the Almighty Who is King; Great, and Holy. Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Almighty, <small><i>Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur the Chazzan continues:</i> the King,</small>  the Holy One.
<b>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</b><br>You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. because You are the Almighty Who is King; Great, and Holy. Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Almighty,  <small><i>Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur the Chazzan continues:</i> the King,</small>  the Holy One. the Holy One.
<small>When Rosh Chodesh occurs on Shabbos:</small>
You formed Your world of old, You completed Your work on the seventh day. You chose us from among all people. You loved us and took pleasure in us, and exalted us above all tongues and sanctified us with Your commandments. You drew us near, our King, to Your service; and Your great and holy Name have You pronounced upon us.
And You, gave us Adonoy our God, with love Sabbaths for rest and Rosh Chodesh days for atonement. But because we sinned before You— we and our fathers— our city was destroyed, and our Holy Temple was laid waste, and our honor was banished; and glory was removed from the house of our life. And we are [therefore] unable to fulfill our obligations in Your Chosen House, in the great and holy house upon which Your Name was called, because of the [violent] hand that was sent to [attack] Your Sanctuary.
May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to bring us up in joy to our land and to plant us within our borders, and there we will offer before You our obligatory sacrifices— daily-offerings in their sequence, and Musaf-offerings according to their laws. And the Musaf-offerings of this Sabbath day, and this Rosh Chodesh day, we will offer and bring near before You with love, according to the command of Your will, as You wrote for us in Your Torah, through the hands of Moses, Your servant, from the mouth of Your glory as it is said:
“And on the Sabbath day the offering is: two male yearling lambs without blemish; two tenths [of an <i>epha</i>] of fine flour for a meal-offering mixed with the [olive] oil, and its libation. This is the burnt-offering for every Sabbath in addition to the daily burnt-offering and its libation.”
This is the sacrifice of Shabbos and the sacrifice of today, as it is said:
“And on your Rosh Chodesh days you shall bring a burnt-offering to Adonoy two young bullocks, one ram, seven male yearling lambs without blemish. And their meal-offering and libations as prescribed: three tenths of an [<i>epha</i>] of fine flour for each bullock, two tenths for the ram, and one tenth for each lamb, and wine according to each libation; and a he-goat for atonement, and the two daily burnt-offerings according to their law.”
They shall rejoice in Your kingship— those who preserve the Sabbath and call it a delight. The people who sanctify the seventh day they will all be satisfied and delighted from Your goodness. And in the seventh day—You took pleasure and You hallowed it. “Most desirable of days,” You called it—a commemoration of the work of creation.
Our God and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest and renew for us on this Sabbath day this new month for goodness and for blessing, for happiness and for rejoicing, for deliverance and for consolation, for maintenance and for sustenance, for life and for peace, for forgiveness of sins and for pardon of iniquities; <small>(on a leap year add:</small> and for atonement of transgression). And may this month be the end and finish of all our troubles, the beginning and prelude of the redemption of our souls, for Your people, Israel have You chosen from among all nations, and Sabbaths, have You made known to them, and the statutes of Rosh Chodesh days, You established for them. Blessed are You Sanctifier of the Sabbath, and Israel and Rosh Chodesh days.
<small>On Shabbos-Rosh Chodesh continue “Be pleased,”.</small>
<small>On a regular Shabbos, say:</small><br>You instituted the Sabbath and took pleasure in its offerings. You commanded its explanatory laws<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the oral tradition which explains the details of the Sabbath laws—the types of work permitted or forbidden on the Sabbath.</i> together with the sequential order of its drink-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Others interpret נְסָכֶיהָ as refering to the “Shewbreads”.

Then from [before] Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to some commentators, this refers to the basic laws of the Sabbath which were given to the Jews at Marah, before they came to Sinai.</i> they were commanded with the precepts concerning its proper observance and You commanded us, Adonoy our God [at Sinai]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The laws of the Sabbath-offering were given at Sinai.</i> to offer on it [the Sabbath] the Musaf sacrifice of the Sabbath, according to its laws. May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to bring us up<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Based on Biblical sources, our Sages have stated that the land of Israel is elevated above all the surrounding lands.</i> in joy to our land, and to plant us within our borders. There we will offer before You our mandatory sacrifices—the daily-offerings in their sequence, and the Musaf-offerings according to their laws. And the Musaf of this Sabbath Day, we will offer and bring near before You with love, according to the command of Your will; as You wrote for us in Your Torah, through the hands of Moses, Your servant, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said:
“On the Sabbath day [the offering is]: two male yearling lambs without blemish; two tenths [of an <i>ephah</i>] of fine flour for a meal-offering mixed with the [olive] oil, and its libation. This is the burnt-offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the daily burnt-offering and its libation.”
They shall rejoice in Your kingship—those who preserve the Sabbath and call it a delight. The people who sanctify the seventh day will all be satisfied and delighted from Your goodness. And in the seventh day—You took pleasure and You hallowed it. “Most desirable of days,” You called it— a commemoration of the work of creation.
Our God, and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest, sanctify us with Your commandments and give us our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, and purify our hearts to serve You in truth. And give us as our inheritance, Adonoy our God, in love and in pleasure Your holy Sabbath; and may all Israel rest thereon—the sanctifiers of Your Name—Blessed are You Adonoy, Sanctifier of the Sabbath.
Be pleased, Adonoy, our God, with Your people Israel and their prayer, and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Israel; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Israel.
And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Zion. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
We are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, the Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand. And for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You.

<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion”, the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due.
<small>On Chanukah the following prayer is added.</small>

[We thank You] for the miracles for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances, and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons. When the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified Name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.
<i>On Shabbat Purim Meshulash:</i> In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth53— And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows.
And for all the foregoing blessed, exalted and extolled your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever.
<small>(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, add:</small> Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.)
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise and bless Your great Name with sincerity forever; for You are goodness— the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever— the benevolent Almighty. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise.
<b>Birkas Kohanim</b><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In Leviticus 9:22, we find that after he completed the Divine offering, Aaron lifted up his hands and blessed the people. In like manner, his descendants, the kohanim, uttered the priestly blessing after performing the Temple Service. In our days on the occasions when the kohanim recite the priestly blessings, they do so immediately after the “We are thankful” prayer which terminates the Avodah (Service) section of the Shemoneh Esrei. When kohanim do not say the blessings, the blessings are mentioned by the Chazzan in his repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei.—Avudraham</i>

My God, guard my tongue from evil<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer was the personal meditation of Mar the son of Ravina, which he recited after he completed his prayers (Maseches Berachos 17a), and it is therefore expressed in the singular. The Jew prays that his mouth, his tongue, and his lips, which have just served as the instruments for his communion with God, will not forfeit any of their moral purity in his dealings with his fellow men.—Yaavetz This prayer is based on the verse, “Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech” (Psalms 34:14). Even though good and evil depend on man’s will, he nevertheless prays for God’s help in controlling himself, so as to permit no insult to provoke his wrath, and to remain calm and silent even in the face of a curse.—Avudraham</i> and my lips from speaking deceitfully.

Hope to Adonoy; be strong and He will give you courage and hope to Adonoy. There is none holy like Adonoy for there is none beside You and thee is no stronghold like our God. For who is a god other than Adonoy and who is a stronghold beside our God.
There is none like our God. There is none like our Master. There is none like our King. There is none like our Deliverer. Who is like our God? Who is like our Master? Who is like our King? Who is like our Deliverer? Let us thank our God. Let us thank our Master. Let us thank our King. Let us thank our deliverer. Blessed is our God. Blesed is our Master. Blessed is our King. Blessed is our Deliverer. You are our God. You are our Master. You are our King. You are our Deliverer. You are He, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers before whom our fathers burned the incenese offering.
The composition of the incense consisted of balm, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense— by weight, seventy maneh of each; myrrh, cassia, spikenard and saffron by weight— sixteen maneh of each; twelve maneh of costus, three maneh of aromatic bark, and nine maneh of cinnamon. [Also used in compounding the incense were:] Nine kabin of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three s'in and three kabin— if he had no Cyprus wine, he could used strong white wine— a fourth of a kab of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of maaleh ashan. Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, Add a minute quantity of Jordan amber. If one added honey, the incense became unfit; and if one omitted any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree. the lye of Carshina was used for rubbing the onycha in order to refine its appearance. The Cyprus wine was used to soak the onycha to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10 This water came from a well named Raglayim.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i> was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Mei Raglayim</i> (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple.

It was taught in the school of Elijah; Whoever studies halachos every day, he is assured of life in the World-to-Come, for it is said, The ways (halichos) of the world are His." Do not read halichos, but halachos:
Rabbi Eliezer said on behalf of Rabbi Chanina: the disciples of the wise increase peace in the world, for it is said: ‘and all your children will be disciples of Adonoy's [Torah]; and great will be the peace of your children.' Do not read banayich [your children] but read bonayich [your builders]. Great is the peace of those who love Your Torah, and they will have no stumbling block [misfortune]. Let there be peace within your moats, serenity within your palaces. For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will say: ‘peace be with you.' For the sake of the House of Adonoy, our God, I will seek [pray for] your good.

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach.

Upon Israel, and upon our Sages, and upon their disciples, and upon all the disciples of their disciples, and upon all those who engage in Torah study in this land and in every land.

<small>The Chazzan<i> says:</i></small> Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</small> Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever.
It is our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into Your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. <b>May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.</b> Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and good life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein. He Who makes peace (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace) in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Israel, and say, Amein.




































I shall make pleasant songs, and weave verses; Because for You my soul longs.
My soul desires to be in Your hand’s shade; To know all of Your deepest mysteries.
When I speak of Your glory; My heart yearns for Your love.
Therefore I will speak reverently of You; And Your name I will honor in songs of love.
I will recount Your glory, though I have not seen You; I describe You though I have not known You.
In Your prophet's writings, in Your servants' speech; You depicted the beauty of Your glorious splendor.
Your greatness and might; They portrayed in accordance with Your actions.
They depicted you, though You are not as they depicted; They characterized you according to Your doings.
They allegorized you in many visions; Behold, You are one in all depictions.
They saw in You old age and youth; They represented Your hair as both whitened and black.
Old age on the day of judgment, youth on the day of battle; Like a man of war who has many talents.
Like one who wears the helmet of redemption on His head; His right arm and holy left arm bring redemption.
His head is full of the dew of light; His locks with the drops of the night.
He beautifies Himself through me, because He desires me; And He shall be for me a crown of beauty.
His head is like pure gold; On His forehead is inscribed His honored holy name.
For grace, honor, and splendid beauty; His people have made themselves His crown.
The locks of his head are as in youth; His locks are black curls.
The place of justice, His splendid beauty; May He elevate it above his greatest joy.
May His chosen people be a crown of beauty in His hand; may the gloriously beautiful people be a royal diadem.
He carried them like a load, He wore them as a crown; He honored them beyond the worth He saw in them.
His splendor is on me, and my splendor is on Him; He is close to me when I call to him.
White and red, His garments are red; He trod the winepress when He came from Edom.
He showed His tefillin-knot to the humble one; the picture of God was before his eyes.
He desires His people, He glorifies the humble ones; He who sits glorified by their praises.

Take my many songs to Yourself; And may my hymn come be close to You.
May my praise be a crown to Your head; May my prayer be set before You like incense.
May this pauper's song be as valued in Your eyes; As the song sung over Your sacrifices.
May my blessing go up to the Provider; the Creator, the Begetter, Just and Mighty.
May You nod your head to my blessing; May You accept it like the finest spices.
May my contemplation be sweet to You, For my soul yearns for You.
Yours, Lord, is the greatness and the power and the splendor and the triumph and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and on land is Yours. Your, Lord, is the sovereignty and the rule over every king. Who can recount the heroic acts of the Lord, who can do justice to all His praise?




Master of the Universe Who reigned before any creature was created. At the time when all was made by His will, then was His Name proclaimed King. And after all things shall cease to be the Awesome One will reign alone. He was, He is, and He shall be in glory. He is One, and there is no second to compare to Him, to associate [with Him]. Without beginning, without end, power and dominion are His. He is my God and my ever-living Redeemer, the Rock of my destiny in times of distress. He is my flag<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is to Him that I rally and through Him that I am identified.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> and my refuge; He is the portion of my cup on the day I call.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He answers me.</i> Into His hand I entrust my spirit [both] when I sleep and when I awaken. And with my spirit my body [too], Adonoy is with me, I shall not fear.

You shall take fine flour and bake twelve loaves, each individual loaf shall be two tenths [of an <i>ephah</i>]. You shall place them in two stacks, six in each stack on the Pure Table, before Adonoy. You shall put pure frankincense on [each] stack and it shall be as a memorial portion for the bread, as a fire-offering, to Adonoy. On each and every <i>Shabbos</i> he shall arrange them before Adonoy, continually, from Bnei Yisroel as an eternal covenant. It shall belong to Aharon and to his sons and they shall eat it in a sacred place, for it is most holy for him from among the fire-offerings of Adonoy, as an everlasting statute.

<small>(Exodus 30:17-21)</small><br>And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say: Make a copper laver and a copper base, for washing; and place it between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar, and put water in it. Aaron and his sons will wash from it, their hands and their feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">His right hand was held above his right foot, the left hand above the left foot and all were washed simultaneously.—Maseches Zevachim 59</i> Upon entering the Tent of Meeting they will wash with water that they not die, or whenever they approach the Altar to serve, to burn a fire-offering to Adonoy. They will wash their hands and feet that they not die; and this is for them a perpetual statute for him [Aaron], and his descendants for all their generations.
<small>(Numbers 28:1-8)</small><br>And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say: Command the Children of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Kohanim, Levites and Israelites were to be present at the offering of the two daily public burnt-offerings. The Sages instituted the program of <i>Ma’amodos</i>, under which representatives of all 12 tribes were always present when these sacrifices were offered. These representatives were rotated each week.</i> and say to them: My offering, My food, to be consumed by My fires, a pleasing odor to Me, You shall be diligent to bring unto Me, at its fixed time. And you will say to them: This is the fire-offering that you will bring unto Adonoy: [male] lambs, in their first year, without blemish, two [of them] each day, as a constant burnt-offering. Offer one lamb in the morning, and the second lamb, offer in the afternoon. And a tenth of an <i>ephah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">One-tenth of an <i>ephah</i> is the equivalent of 43-⅕ eggs.</i> of fine flour as a meal-offering, mixed with oil of crushed [olives] measuring one-fourth of a <i>hin.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>hin</i> is a liquid measure containing 12 <i>logs</i>, of which each <i>log</i> is approximately 6 eggs.</i> [This is] a constant burnt-offering as offered at Mount Sinai for a pleasing odor, a fire-offering to Adonoy. And its libation will be a fourth of a <i>hin</i> for the one lamb; in the Holy<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">On the Altar.</i> [Sanctuary] you will pour out a drink-offering of strong wine to Adonoy. And the second lamb you will offer in the afternoon; as the meal-offering of the morning [together] with its libation, you shall offer a fire-offering of pleasing odor to Adonoy.
<small>(Leviticus 1:11)</small><br>And he will slaughter it on the north side of the Altar, before Adonoy; and Aaron's sons, the Kohanim, will sprinkle its blood all around the Altar.
You are Adonoy, our God, before Whom our fathers burned the incense of spices when the Holy Temple was standing, as You commanded them by the hand of Moses Your prophet, as it is written in Your Torah:
<small>(Exodus 30:34-36)</small><br>And Adonoy said to Moses, Take for yourself spices— stacte, onycha, and galbanum—<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Galbanum has an offensive odor. The Torah includes it among the other spices to teach us to include even Jewish sinners among the rest of Jewry at our assemblies of fasting and prayers.—<i>Rashi</i></i> spices, and pure frankincense, [they] shall be in equal weights. You will make it into incense, a compound mixed by a compounder, salted,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word, <i>memulach</i> is rendered by Onkelos as mixed, to indicate that the spices should be well mixed together.—<i>Rashi</i></i> undefiled, and holy. You will pulverize some of it very fine, and place it before the [Ark of] Testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This incense was offered each day upon the Innermost Altar which is inside the Tent of Meeting.—<i>Rashi</i></i> in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it will be to you holy of holies." It is also written:
<small>(Exodus 30:7-8)</small><br>And Aaron shall burn upon it [the Altar] incense of spices every morning; when he cleans the lamps he will burn it. And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon, he will burn it; a constant incense-offering before Adonoy throughout your generations.
<small>(Maseches Kreisos 6a; Jerusalem Talmud, Maseches Yoma 4:5)</small><br>The Rabbis taught: How was the incense compounded? Three hundred and sixty-eight <i>manim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>maneh</i> is a weight; plural, <i>manim</i>.</i> were comprised therein, three hundred and sixty-five corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, one <i>maneh</i> for each day— half in the morning and half in the afternoon. From the three remaining <i>manim</i> the Kohein Gadol brought two handfuls [into the Holy of Holies] on Yom Kippur; [for which purpose] they were put back into the mortar on the eve of Yom Kippur, and ground [again] very thoroughly, in order to make them very fine. Eleven kinds of spices were used for it. They were: 1) balm, 2) onycha, 3) galbanum, 4) frankincense— by weight, seventy <i>maneh</i> of each; 5) myrrh, 6) cassia, 7) spikenard and 8) saffron— in weight sixteen <i>maneh</i> of each; 9) twelve <i>maneh</i> of costus, 10) three of aromatic bark, and 11) nine of cinnamon. [Also used in the incense compound were:] Nine <i>kabin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kab</i> is a sixth of a <i>se’ah</i>.</i> of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three <i>s'in</i> and three <i>kabin</i>— if he had no Cyprus wine, he could use strong white wine— a fourth of a <i>kab</i> of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of <i>maaleh ashan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This herb causes the smoke of the burning incense to ascend in a straight line.</i> Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, Jordan amber was added of a minute quantity, and if one added honey,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Included are various sweeteners such as dates and other fruits.</i> it (the incense) became unfit; and if one omitted<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The same is true if one were to add to the prescribed number of eleven spices.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The death penalty was given only if the Kohein Gadol actually entered the Holy of Holies with incense which was unfit. This was considered as an unwarranted entry into the Holy of Holies which carried the death decree.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree. the lye of Carshina was used for rubbing the onycha in order to refine its appearance. The Cyprus wine was used to soak the onycha to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10 This water came from a well named Raglayim.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i> was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Mei Raglayim</i> (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple. Others hold that the term “waters of Raglayim” actually refers to urine, which could have been used as a soaking agent were it not indecent to bring it into a sacred place.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i>
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Rabbi Nosson says, While [the Kohein] ground [the incense] he would say, <i>‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,'</i> because the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the sound of these specific words affects the spices.</i> is good for the spices. If half<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">184 <i>manim</i> instead of 368.</i> the quantity of incense was prepared it was acceptable, but if only a third or a fourth [of it was prepared] we have not heard<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we did not hear our teachers expound this question.</i> [whether it was acceptable."] Rabbi Yehuda said, This is the general rule: If [it was prepared with all its ingredients] in the correct proportion, it is acceptable even if only half was prepared; but if he left out any of its spices, he was liable for the death penalty.
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Bar Kappara says, Once in sixty or seventy years<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The exact number of years varied with the size of the hands of the High Priests over the years, for the surplus was what remained of these three <i>manim</i> from which he took two handfuls each Yom Kippur.</i> the accumulated surplus was sufficient to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense."] Bar Kappara also taught, If he would have put into it a minute quantity of honey, no one could have withstood [resisted] the scent. Why was no honey mixed with it? Because the Torah says, (<i>Leviticus</i> 2:11) For any leaven or honey, do not burn from them, [as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.
<i>Recite each of these verses three times:</i>

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent.

The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.

<b>Blessing by the father of a Bar Mitzvah</b>
<i>The following blessing is said by the father of a Bar Mitzvah, after the lad has been called to the Torah and has recited the blessing following the reading:</i>
Blessed (are You) who has released me from the punishment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The father is liable for the sins of his children only until they have been taught and trained to perform and observe the mitzvos. Once they have reached this level, even though they are <i>not yet thirteen years of age,</i> the father is no longer responsible for their sins.<br>Why then is this Beracha recited at the time of Bar Mitzvah? The <i>Dover Meisharim</i>, cites sources stating that on the contrary, children sometimes perish because of their fathers׳ sins. The fathers, in turn, are punished for causing the untimely deaths of their young children. Thus when they reach thirteen and are no longer liable for their <i>fathers’ sins,</i> the fathers too are released from the punishment they could have received for causing their children to perish. The Beracha is therefore recited at the Bar Mitzvah when the son becomes fully independent of his father.</i> of this [boy].
<i>When the reading of the Torah is concluded, the Half Kaddish is recited by the Reader. The Torah is then raised so that the congregation can see the script, and the congregation exclaims:</i>
This is the Torah which Moses placed before the children of Israel. at Adonoy's command by the hand of Moses. It is a tree of life to those who grasp to it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Long life is at its right, at its left, riches and honor. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it.
Praise God. I will thank Adonoy with all my heart, in the council of the upright and in the congregation. Great are the works of Adonoy; available to all who desire them. Beauty and splendor is His work, and His righteousness endures forever. He made a memorial for His wonders, gracious and merciful is Adonoy. He gave food to those who fear Him; He is ever mindful of His covenant. The power of His works He has declared to His people, to give them the inheritance of the nations. The works of His hands are truth and justice, faithful are all His precepts. They are established forever, for eternity; they are achieved in truth and uprightness. Redemption He sent to His people, He commanded His covenant for eternity; holy and awe-inspiring is His Name. The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Adonoy, good understanding to all who perform [His commandments], His praise endures forever.
<b>Psalm 112</b><br><small>This Psalm lauds the man who truly fears God and whose utmost desire is to fulfill His commandments.</small><br>Praise God. Fortunate is the man who fears Adonoy; His commandments, he greatly desires. Mighty upon the earth will be his seed, a generation of the upright who will be blessed. Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever. He causes to shine in the darkness a light for the upright [for He is] gracious, compassionate and righteous. Good is the man who is gracious and lends, who conducts his affairs with justice. For he will never be moved, as an everlasting remembrance will the righteous remain. He will not fear evil tidings, steadfast is his heart, trusting in Adonoy; His heart is steadfast, he will not fear, even before he sees his adversaries' [downfall] [Widely distributed charity] he dispersed to the needy; his righteousness endures forever, his horn will be exalted with honor. The wicked will see it and be angered, he will gnash his teeth and melt away; the desire of the wicked will perish.
<small>The Chazzan takes the Torah and says:</small> They will praise the Name of Adonoy for His Name alone is exalted. 
<small>The congregation then says:</small> His majesty is over the earth and the skies. He will raise the might of His people, [which is] praise for all His pious ones, for the children of Israel, the people near to Him.
 Praise God. A psalm of David: the earth is Adonoy's and the fullness thereof, the inhabited world and those who dwell in it. For He founded it upon the seas, and established it upon rivers. Who may ascend the mountain of Adonoy, and who may stand in the place of His holiness? The clean of hands and the pure of heart, who has not borne My soul in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully. He will bear Adonoy's blessing and righteousness from the God of his deliverance. This is the generation of those who seek Him, the seekers of Your Presence, [God of] Jacob, <i>selah.</i> Lift up your heads, gates, and be uplifted [you] entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is this King of Glory? Adonoy, strong and mighty; Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle. Lift up your heads, gates, and lift up, entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is He, this King of Glory? Adonoy of hosts, He is the King of Glory, <i>selah.</i>
<small>As the Torah is returned to the Ark the following is said:</small> And when it rested, he would say: Return, Adonoy, to the myriads and thousands of Israel. Arise, Adonoy unto Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your strength. Let Your priests clothe themselves in righteousness, and let Your devoted ones sing in joy. For the sake of David, Your servant, do not reject Your anointed. For I have given you good instruction, do not forsake My Torah. It is a tree of life to those who grasp it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace. Cause us to return to you, Adonoy, and we shall return; renew our days as of old.
<small>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above) all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

For Your sake, our Redeemer, please save;
for Your sake, our Seeker, please save!
<b>The nation, guarded like the pupil [of the eye],</b> contemplates the doctrine that restores the soul, studies the laws of Shabbat, interprets the carrying of Shabbat, which establishes two thousand (ells) as the perimeter of Shabbat. And [beyond this], it prevents its feet on account of the Shabbat. It fulfills, "remember," and "guard," on the Shabbat. It hurries to make haste [for] the coming of the Shabbat. It busies itself [with] everything, from the six [days] for the Shabbat, sits and waits until the end of Shabbat. It calls Shabbat, glory and delight; it changes clothing and covering on the Shabbat; food and drink does it prepare for the Shabbat, enjoying pleasant foods for the Shabbat. Three meals does it fulfill on Shabbat, upon two loaves does it break [bread] on Shabbat. It designates four domains on Shabbat. It kindles [lights for] the commandment of lighting the candle on Shabbat. It sanctifies the holiness (kiddush) of the day on Shabbat, prays the song of seven (paragraphs) on Shabbat. It reads seven from the doctrine on Shabbat, let it inherit the day that is completely Shabbat. Please save!

<b>Foundation stone,</b> chosen house, threshing floor of Ornan, hidden sanctuary, Mount Moriah, Mount of He is Seen, palace of Your splendor, residence of David, goodly ridge, beautifully placed, joy of all the earth, most beautiful bride, resting place of justice, place of Your dwelling, tranquil habitation, complete sukkah, pilgrimage of the tribes, precious corner, excellent Zion, holy of holies, inlaid with love, dwelling place of Your glory - please save! Hill of magnificence, please save!
Yours is an arm endowed with might; Your hand is strong; Your right arm, exalted (Psalms 89:14).
<b>The nation - 'I am a wall,'</b> bright as the sun, exiled and turned away, compared to a date palm, the one killed for You and considered like sheep for slaughter; scattered among its angerers, hugging and clinging to You, seeking Your yoke, alone to unify You, trampled in the exile, studying Your awe, pulled of cheek, given to be paupers, bearing Your burden, ship in a storm, redeemed of Tuviah (Moses), holy sheep, congregations of Jacob, marked with Your name - roar, "Please save!" [They are] dependent upon You, please save!
You will give truth to Jacob, kindness to Abraham (Micah 7:20). 
<b>The Master who brings salvation</b> - without You there is no salvation, mighty One and great in saving, 'I  became indigent and He will bring me salvation,' the saving God who rescues and brings salvation - bring salvation to those who cry to You; bring salvation to those that wait for You, to satiate your sheep, to give produce bountifully, make every shrub grow, and bring salvation. Do not do bad to the valley - sweeten the delicacies and bring salvation, to carry the clouds, to move the rains. Restrain the clouds, open the hand and satiate - satiate Your thirsty ones. Bring salvation to those that call to You, bring salvation to the ones You pity, bring salvation to the ones who seek You, please save! Bring salvation to Your blameless ones, please save!
In your right arm are pleasures for evermore (Psalms 16:11).
<b>Man and beast</b> - flesh and spirit and soul; tendon, bone and membrane; appearance and image and mesh; 'majesty compared to a breath' - 'and he is like the beasts that perish' - radiance, form and stature. [Effect] the renewal of the face of the ground, the planting of desolate trees, wine-presses and grain, vineyards and sycamores for marked ground, strong rains for healing - invigorating the despoiled - raising plants, strengthening delicacies, establishing flowers, raining [on] vegetation, flowing cold waters, dressing drops, raising drink - please save. [It is] suspended over emptiness, please save. 
O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Your name throughout the earth, You who have covered the heavens with Your splendor (Psalms 8:2).
<b>The ground from malediction,</b> beasts from miscarriage, the threshing floor from locusts and food from confusion; olive trees from shedding, wheat from grasshoppers, fare from insects, wine vats from locusts, vineyards from worms, aftergrowth from grasshoppers, delights from locusts, life from confusion, satiation from insects, flocks from poverty, cows from blight, sheep from destruction, harvest from curse, plentitude from gauntness, stalks from parchedness - please save! The produce from locusts, please save!
The Lord is beneficent in all His ways and faithful in all His works (Psalms 145:17).
<b> For the sake of the great one thrown into the heart of the fire,</b> for the sake of the son bound upon woods and fire, for the sake of the strong one who fought with a prince of fire, for the sake of the formations that You led with a pyre and a cloud of fire, for the sake of the one who was brought up to the heights and went up like the angels of fire, for the sake of the one who was for You like an assistant among the angels of fire, for the sake of the gift of the statements that were given in fire, for the sake of that which was covered by curtains and a cloud of fire, for the sake of the ceremony of the mountain upon which You came down in fire, for the sake of the friendship of the House that You loved beyond the Heavens of fire, for the sake of the one who yearned until the setting of the fire, for the sake of the one who took a pan of fire and removed the anger of fire, for the sake of the one zealous with a great zealotry of fire, for the sake of the one who waved his hand and came down stones of fire, for the sake of the one who made the nursing lamb be consumed with fire, for the sake of the one who stood in the threshing floor and was answered with fire, for the sake of the one who prayed in the courtyard and down came the fire, for the sake of the messenger that arose and was carried up by a chariot and horses of fire, for the sake of the holy ones that were flung into the fire, for the sake of the one who saw myriads and myriads and rivers of fire, for the sake of the desolation of Your city that was burnt down with fire - please save! For the sake of of the offspring of the clans of Judah who You will make like a brazier of fire, please save!
<b>Yours,</b> Lord, are greatness, might, splendor, triumph, and majesty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours] ; to You, Lord, belong kingship and preeminence above all (I Chronicles 29:11). And the Lord shall be king over all the earth; on that day the Lord shall be One, and his name One (Zechariah 14:9). And it is written in Your Torah, saying (Deuteronomy 6:4), "Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One" - blessed be the Name of His glorious kingdom forever and ever.

<i>The prayer leader says Kaddish Titkabal. And then he puts down the lulav from his hand and they take the Hoshanot and pound them. One should pound the willow specifically on earth, as explained in the holy Zohar. And there should be five willow branches - no more and no less. And he should only pound them five times - no more and no less.</i>
<i>And after pounding the willow, he should say this supplication:</i>
<b>May it be</b> Your will in front of You, Lord G0d, and God of our fathers, who chooses good prophets and their customs - that you accept our prayers and our circles (<i>hakafot</i>) with mercy and desire. And remember for us the merit of Your seven pure ones, and remove the iron curtain that separates between You and us. And pay heed to our prayers and make good the sealing for us - suspend the earth over the emptiness - and seal us in the book of goodly life. And upon this day, give to Your mighty Presence five restrictions (<i>gevurot</i>) sweetened by the pounding of the willow, the custom of Your holy prophets; and arouse love among them and let them be kissed with the kisses of Your mouth, which sweetens all the restrictions and all of the judgements. And shine upon Your mighty Presence with the name (<i>Yod hay vav</i>), which is dew of lights, Your dew. And from there, bring the flow to Your servant who is praying (x, the son/daughter of y) in front of You (forgiveness), that You will lengthen his/her days and forgive him/her for all of his/her sins, iniquities and rebellions; and stretch forth Your right arm and Your hand to accept me with full repentance in front of You. And open Your goodly storehouse, to satiate water for the parched soul, as it is written (Deuteronomy 28:12), "The Lord will open for you His goodly storehouse, the heavens, to provide rain for your land in its season and to bless all your undertakings." Amen.

Simchat Torah

Hakafot

<b>Hakafot for Simchat Torah</b>
<i>The custom is to take out all of the Torah scrolls in the ark, both in the evening service and in the morning service. At night, the custom is that, after we circle the platform seven times with the Torah scrolls, we return the Torah scrolls to the ark and leave one Torah scroll out. And three men read from it in the section of Zot HaBerakha. The custom during the day is to add many readers. And we are also accustomed to call all of the children to the Torah scroll. But it is fitting that an adult recite the blessing over the Torah and that the children listen and fulfill [the practice in that way]. And we read the section of, "May the angel who redeems, etc."</i>
<i>The prayer leader says each verse and the congregation repeats the verse each time.</i>
<b>It has been clearly demonstrated to you</b> that the Lord alone is God; there is none beside Him (Deuteronomy 4:35). Who alone works great marvels, His steadfast love is eternal (Psalms 136:4). There is none like You among the gods, O Lord, and there are no deeds like Yours (Psalms 86:8). May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in His works (Psalms 104:31). Let the name of the Lord be blessed now and forever (Psalms 113:2). May the Lord our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; may He never abandon us or forsake us (I Kings 8:57). Declare, "Deliver us, O God, our deliverer, and gather us and save us from the nations, to acclaim Your holy name, to glory in Your praise" (I Chronicles 16:35). [The Lord reigns, the Lord has reigned,] The Lord will reign for ever and ever (Exodus 15:18). May the Lord grant strength to His people; may the Lord bestow on His people wellbeing (Psalms 29:11). <i>We open the ark.</i> When the Ark was to set out, Moses would say, "Advance, O Lord; may Your enemies be scattered, and may Your foes flee before You (Numbers 10:35). Advance, O Lord to Your resting-place, You and Your mighty Ark! Your priests are clothed in triumph; Your loyal ones sing for joy. For the sake of Your servant David do not reject Your anointed one (Psalms 132:8-10). In that day they shall say, "This is our God; we trusted in Him, and He delivered us, this is the Lord, in whom we trusted; let us rejoice and exult in His deliverance" (Isaiah 25:9). Your kingship is an eternal kingship; Your dominion is for all generations (Psalms 145:13).  For instruction shall come forth from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem (Isaiah 2:3). 
[Father of mercy,] May it please You to make Zion prosper; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (Psalms 51:20). For we have trusted only in You, King; high and elevated God, Master of the worlds.
<i>These supplications were taken from the book, Avodat Hakodesh:</i>
<b>For the sake of</b> the unification of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Divine Presence - with fear and with love - to unify the name <i>yod hay</i> with <i>vav hay</i> with a complete unification: Behold we are coming to fulfill the commandment of the custom of holy Israel, to circle seven times around the platform with the Torah scroll upon it, and to add to the joy of the Torah, to rectify its root in the lofty place. And may it be Your will in front of You, that from the power of these circles, You will knock down the wall of iron that separates between You and us. And may we be surrounded by Torah and commandments from inside and out; and may we cling to You and to Your Torah always - we, our seed and the seed of our seed. May the pleasantness of my Master, our God, be upon us, and the work of our hands established for us, and the work of our hands - establish it.
<i>We take out every Torah scroll in the ark and circle the platform seven times and say:</i>
<b>Circle 1:</b>
<b>Please,</b> Lord, please bring salvation. Please, Lord, please bring success. Please, Lord, answer us on the day of our calling out. God of the spirits, please bring salvation. Examiner of the hearts, please bring success. Strong Redeemer, answer us on the day of our calling out.
<b>For the leader.</b> A psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God, the sky proclaims His handiwork. Day to day makes utterance, night to night speaks out. There is no utterance, there are no words, whose sound goes unheard. Their voice carries throughout the earth, their words to the end of the world; He placed in them a tent for the sun. It is like a groom coming forth from the chamber, like a hero, eager to run his course. Its rising-place is at one end of heaven, and its circuit reaches the other; nothing escapes its heat. The teaching of the Lord is perfect, renewing life (Psalms 19:1-8). A psalm of David. Ascribe to the Lord, O divine beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength. Ascribe to the Lord the glory of His name; bow down to the Lord, majestic in holiness. The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the Lord, over the mighty waters (Psalm 29:1-3). For the leader; with instrumental music. A psalm. A song. May God be gracious to us and bless us; may He show us favor, Selah (Psalm 67:1-2). Please, by the force of Your great right arm, release the bound one. For I have said, "The world is built by love" (Psalms 89:3).
<b>Beloved of the soul,</b> merciful Father, draw Your servant to Your will. [Then] Your servant will run like a deer; he will bow before Your splendor. To him, Your affections will be sweeter than the drippings of the honeycomb and all [other pleasant] tastes.
Splendid, Beautiful, Radiance of the world, my soul is lovesick for You. I beseech You, Almighty, please, heal her by showing her the pleasantness of Your radiance. Then she will be strengthened and healed and she will have everlasting joy.
Ancient One—let Your mercy be aroused and please have pity upon Your beloved child; for it is long that I have yearned to behold soon the glory of Your strength. These my heart has desired, please have pity and do not conceal Yourself.
Reveal Yourself, please and spread over me, my Beloved, the shelter of Your peace, let the earth be illuminated from Your glory, we will exult and rejoice in You. Hasten, show [us Your] love, for the time has come, and be gracious unto us as in days of old.

In the beginning of Your primordial Torah was Your hidden wisdom inscribed. It came from nothing and was concealed. The beginning of wisdom (<i>chokhmah</i>) is awe of the Lord.
Wide rivers are the streams of faith; a man of understanding draws these deep waters. Their offshoots are the fifty gates of understanding (<i>binah</i>). The faithful ones are guarded by the Lord.
Great God, all eyes are towards You. Great of kindness, Your kindness (<i>chesed</i>) is great beyond the heavens. God of Abraham, remember [it] to Your servants. The kindnesses of the Lord do I mention, the praises of the Lord.
The One above, magnificent with power and might (<i>gevurah</i>), He brings out light from that which has no substitute. Awe of Isaac, light up our judgment. You are always mighty, Lord.
Who is a power like you, to do great deeds? Strength of Jacob, Splendor (<i>tiferet</i>) of Israel, Hearer of prayers - for the Lord is a listener to the destitute.
Lord, let the merit of the fathers protect us. Eternal (<i>netzach</i>) One of Israel, redeem us from our troubles; and draw us up and bring us out of the pit of our exile, to orchestrate the work of the House of the Lord.

And in the way that our father, Abraham, suppressed his mercy to do Your will with a full heart; so too, let Your mercy suppress Your anger - and let Your mercy roll over Your traits. And may You act towards us, Lord our God, with the trait of kindness and bring us in beyond the letter of law. And with Your great kindness, turn away Your fierce anger from Your people, from Your city, from Your land and from Your inheritance; annul all of the harsh and bad decrees from upon us; and decree good decrees upon us, according to Your great mercy.

And we are Your people and the flock that You tend; we shall glorify You forever; for all time we shall tell Your praises (Psalms 79:13). Give ear, O shepherd of Israel who leads Joseph like a flock; appear, You who are enthroned on the cherubim (Psalms 80:2).

Nations will exult and shout for joy, for You rule the peoples with equity, You guide the nations of the earth, Selah (Psalms 67:5).

And they will offer to You their sacrifices, and they will abandon their idols, and they will be humiliated with their graven images, and they will turn with unanimous accord to worship You. And they will fear You—as long as the sun is upon them—those who seek Your Presence, and they will realize the power of Your Kingship, and they will teach—those who have gone astray—understanding [of God]. And they will speak of Your might, and they will uplift You, causing You to be uplifted above all, and they will fervently beseech Your Presence, and crown You with a crown of glory.

And the kingdom will be the Lord's and He will be King over all of the world; on that day the Lord will be one and His name shall be One (Zechariah 14:9). And do [it] for the sake of King David, peace be upon him, who was sealed with the trait of kingship; and have Your Divine Presence dwell upon us. May the Lord our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; may He never abandon us or forsake us (I Kings 8:57). (The next five verses begin with the Hebrew letters that spell out the word, kingship - <i>MaLKhUT</i>:) With praises I call upon the Lord; from my foes I will be saved (Psalms 18:4). Forever, O Lord, Your word stands in the heavens (Psalms 119:89). For Your kindness toward me is great; You have saved me from the depths of Sheol (Psalms 86:13). But I am like a thriving olive tree in God’s house; I trust in the kindness of God forever and ever (Psalms 52:10). You have heard the entreaty of the lowly, O Lord; may You make their hearts firm, may You incline Your ear (Psalms 10:17). 
<b>Master of the world,</b> behold we are coming with fear and love and great joy to thank You for Your having sanctified us with Your commandments and choosing us from all of the nations, [for having] loved us and desired us; and You gave us Your holy Torah - the written Torah and the oral Torah - and You brought us near to [do] Your service. What are we, what are our lives, that You have done many and great kindnesses like these with us? And now Lord, our God, we thank You and praise Your splendid name. Yet, great is our distress when we bring to our minds all that we have been negligent from being occupied with Your holy Torah; and everything that we have blemished in our study - whether on account of learning in order to become famous, whether on account of our not learning in purity and awe as the discipline of what to do, whether because we have not toiled to understand something clearly [to] extract the rule and the depth of the law, whether because of that which we have 'plucked salt-wort from wormwood' (interrupted our studies unnecessarily) or whether because we have not supported and strengthened the knees of the rabbis that are fatigued and we have not invigorated weak knees. And like this and like that have we blemished the twenty two letters of Your Torah, erred in study and in instruction and have not acted according to the procedure of the Torah scholar. And something else [distresses us] - that which sparks of our Torah and our [performance of the] commandments have fallen into 'broken pits,' and 'captives were taken from it.' 
<b>About it all,</b> we are ashamed and embarrassed - and our soul will hiddenly cry; fear and trembling will come to us and terror will cover us. And so now, we shamefacedly repent and regret and want to make our will to be like Your will. May it be Your will in front of You, Lord God, and God of our fathers - merciful and compassionate God, the One who is Good and does good - that You accept our intentions. For you are One that examines the hearts; and You have known that our will is to do Your will and to be occupied with Your holy Torah, as the discipline of what to do. And You promised us through Your servants, the sages of Israel, "If one comes to purify, they assist him" (Yoma 38b). And so, please let Your mercy be aroused and 'see that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.' And the air of the land of the nations, the absence of purity and the power of the exile of the body and the spirit have been what have spoiled us; as our enemy - our evil impulse - has triumphed and done what it plotted to do, to push us away from Your Torah and Your service.
And so we have no redeemer and savior besides You. The soul is Yours and the body is Your work, have pity on Your labor. And from the power of the seven circles that we have encircled the platform with the Torah scroll upon it, and have rejoiced for the glory of Your Torah, may You be filled with mercy for us: Bring us back, our Father, to Your Torah; and bring us near, our King, to Your service. And let the judgements be sweetened, let Your mercy suppress Your anger - and let Your mercy roll over Your traits. And bring out the light from all of the sparks of our Torah and our [performance of the] commandments, and let everything return to its initial strength, and 'none be kept banished.' And merit us to be occupied with Torah for its own sake - to bring to the light, all parts of the orchard (<i>PaRDeS</i>, the letters of which form the acrostic of the different modes of Torah study) of our Torah which belong to our spirits, our essences and our souls; the questions, the arguments, the true resolutions and the original legal constructs for the truth of the Torah. And in Your great mercy, merit us to [have] holy seed - wise and pious sons, 'the seed of men' and of healthy constellation (fortune). And let there not be found any blemish or any defect in us or in our seed. And may You, in Your mercy, give us power, health, sufficient ability and strength and vigor in our limbs, tendons and bodies to uphold the watch. And may no irritations or pain befall us; and may we be happy, good and healthy for Your service; and rescue us from all evil. God, and God of our fathers, reign over the whole world in Your glory, and be exalted over all the land in Your preciousness; and appear in the beauty of Your magnificent power over all the residents of Your inhabited planet. And every work (referring to <i>assiyah</i>, the world of building) shall know that You made it, and every form (referring to <i>yitzirah</i>, the world of formation) shall know that You formed it. And every one that has a soul (referring to <i>briah</i>, the world of creation) in its face will say, "The Lord, God of Israel (referring to <i>atsilut</i>, the world of emanation), is King 'and His kingdom rules over all.'" Sanctify us with Your commandments, grant that our portion be in Your Torah, satisfy us from Your bounty, gladden our souls with Your salvation and purify our hearts to serve You in truth. And do not push us away because of any creature in the world, lengthen our days with goodness and our years with pleasantness. And fill our years, eighty years; add to us length of days and years of life for Your service. And shelter us in the shade of Your wings. And rescue us and all the members of our household from all harsh and evil decrees. And initiate a good new year upon us; and let us be still and serene, fertile and flourishing in Your service and in Your awe. For with You is the source of life; in Your light will we see light (Psalms 36:10). Let Your kindness be upon us, O Lord, as we have hoped in You (Psalms 33:22). Show us, O Lord, Your kindness; grant us Your deliverance (Psalms 85:8). But I trust in Your kindness, my heart will exult in Your deliverance; I will sing to the Lord, for He has done good to me (Psalms 13:6). Behold the God who gives me triumph; I am confident, unafraid; for Lord, the Lord is my Strength and Might, and He has been my Deliverance (Psalms 12:2). 
<b>Be glad and rejoice</b> on Simchat Torah, and give honor to the Torah. For its merchandise is better than any merchandise; more precious than fine gold and pearls.
Let us be gleeful and let us be glad about 'this Torah'; for it is our strength and light.
I will praise it, my God, I will rejoice in it and I will place my hope in it. I will laud it in the council of the people close to Him.
Let us be gleeful and let us be glad about 'this Torah'; for it is our strength and light.
I will sing Your righteous deeds with a full heart, and I will recount Your praise. With gladness bring us back to Your House, upon Your kindness and upon Your truth.
Let us be gleeful and let us be glad about 'this Torah'; for it is our strength and light.
<b>The angels gathered</b> - this one to that, this one to greet that one - and said this one to that one, "Who is this and what is this, holding on to the face of the throne - His cloud is draped over him - who has ascended Above, who has ascended Above, and brought down its mighty stronghold."
They gathered:
"Moses ascended Above, Moses ascended Above, Moses ascended Above; and he brought down its mighty stronghold."
They gathered:
"I will be gleeful and be glad on Simchat Torah."
<b>Let the sprout (of David) surely come</b> on Simchat Torah. The Torah is a tree of life; it is life for all, since with You is the source of life. 
Abraham rejoiced on Simchat Torah; Isaac rejoiced on Simchat Torah; Jacob rejoiced on Simchat Torah; Moses and Aaron rejoiced on Simchat Torah; Elijah, Samuel, David and Solomon rejoiced on Simchat Torah; The Torah is a tree of life; it is life for all, since with You is the source of life. 
<b>Fortunate are you</b> Israel, fortunate are you Israel, fortunate are you Israel - for God chose you and bequeathed you the Torah, 'from the desert (a different version: from Sinai), a present.'
<i>The prayer leader:</i> Praise the name of the Lord with me, for His name alone is exalted.
<i>The congregation:</i> His majesty is upon the earth and the heavens.
He has exalted the horn of His people for the glory of all His faithful ones, Israel, the people close to Him. Hallelujah. (Psalms 148:13-14)
<i>And we bring back all of the Torah scrolls to the ark.</i>
<i>In the Land of Israel on the night of Shemini Atzeret - and outside the Land, on the night of Simchat Torah - we leave one Torah scroll out, and the prayer leader says, "Shema Yisrael; Exalt; And may He help." And some have the custom to call up five men [to read] from Parashat Zot HaBerakha, until [the section that begins with the word,] Meoneh.</i>

[We thank You] for the miracles for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances, for the wonders for the consolations and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows. (And You did miracles and wonders, and we thank Your great name.)

In the day of dread, I call upon You. Let me not be oppressed by the insolent— those who forsake the precious Torah. Render to them their just deserts; sit [in judgement] to scrutinize [their deeds]. May the sentence of the wicked and corrupt be carried out in full. Those who intend to make us forget Your holy and revered Name and make us familiar with idolatrous names— that are despicable and vulgar; through their methods the best of our people have been destroyed. Spare the remnant from being crushed as [olives] in an oilpress. As they tear beasts of prey, so they learned to devour man, as it is said: they cast lots for us as if we were ownerless property in the wilderness. We were almost utterly consumed, and nothing would have been left of us, were it not for Your mercy, O Master, Who rules with kindness Who dares murmur at Your ways, to argue against them? who dares gird himself to dispute You? We have turned away [from Your mitzvos] and have been scattered like the wind. The enemy’s bloody sword was drawn; but with You is justice and Your hand is uppermost. Let the tyrant not say: “I have prevailed,” nor let Judah’s enemies exult at my fall: Proclaim— for those who were sold for naught— the year of release. May the wicked seeking to extend their rule be turned back and cut down. Your bill of sale preceded theirs and yet the creditors demand payment. To postpone Your lien [is the intent] of the many harsh rulers. The border marks of Your boundary, they seek to uproot. The grain [Israel] which You sanctified, has been devoured— both grain ears and chaff. Let judgement for their evil come on them and reveal their guilt. According to their misdeeds be harsh and bring devastation upon them. For the portion of their cups, rain upon them fiery coals; return to them sevenfold. Avenge Your covenant and destroy them. To the city of Your beautiful Palace, lead us. Make a path through the sea for the redeemed congregation to pass. In You is our hope, and You, our Almighty Creator, comfort us; may Your kindliness be upon us.
