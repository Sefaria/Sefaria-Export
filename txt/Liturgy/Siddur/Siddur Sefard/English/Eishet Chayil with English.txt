Eishet Chayil

A woman of valour who can find? for her price is far above rubies. 
The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, and he hath no lack of gain. 
She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life. 
She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly​ with her hands. 
She is like the merchant-​ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 
She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth food to her household​​​​, and a portion to her maidens. 
She considere​th a field, and buyeth it; with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.​ 
She girdeth her loins with strength,​ and maketh strong her arms. 
She perceivet​h that her merchandi​se is good; her lamp goeth not out by night. 
She layeth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. 
She stretchet​h out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 
She is not afraid of the snow for her household​​​​; for all her household​​​​ are clothed with scarlet. 
She maketh for herself coverlets​; her clothing is fine linen and purple. 
Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
She maketh linen garments and selleth them; and deliveret​h girdles unto the merchant.​ 
Strength and dignity are her clothing;​ and she laugheth at the time to come. 
She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and the law of kindness is on her tongue. 
She looketh well to the ways of her household​​​​, and eateth not the bread of idleness.​ 
Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her: 
'Many daughters​ have done valiantly​, but thou excellest​ them all.' 
Grace is deceitful​, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 
Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her works praise her in the gates.
