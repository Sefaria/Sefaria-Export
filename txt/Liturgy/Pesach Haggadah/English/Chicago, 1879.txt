SANCTIFICATION FOR THE PASSOVER.
<small><i>ON SABBATH EVE BEGIN HERE</i></small>
(On the sixth day), and the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because thereon he rested from all his work, which God created and made.
&lt;small&lt;i&gt;On any other night of the week begin here.
Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God! King of the Universe, creator of the fruit of the vine.
Blessed art thou, O Lord our God! King of the Universe, who hath chosen us from among all people, and didst exalt us above all nations, and didst sanctify us with thy commandments: and with love hast thou given us, O Lord, our God !<small>(<i>On saturday say</i> sabbath for rest, and)</small>solemn clays for joy; festivals, and seasons for gladness, <small>(the Sabbath-day and)<small> this day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the season of our freedom: a holy convocation, a memorial of the departure from Egypt: for thou hast chosen and sanctified us above an people: and <small>(the Sabbath and)</small> holy festivals hast thou caused us to inherit with <small>(love and favor]</small> joy and gladness.</small></small>
Blessed art thou O Lord! who sanetifieth <small>(the Sabbath and)</small> Israel, and the seasons.
<small><i>On Conclusion of the Sabbath say,-</i></small>
Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God! King of the Universe, creator of the radiance of the fire.<br>Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God! King of the Universe, who hath made a distinction between holy and not holy, between light and darkness; between Israel and other nations; between the seventh-day and the six working days. Thou didst also discriminate between the sanctity of the Sabbath-day, and the sanctity of other holy days, and consecratest the Sabbathday in preference to the six working days; thou also separatest thy people Israel, and didst sanctify them with thy holiness. 
Blessed art thou, O Lord! who maketh a distinction between holy and holy.
Blessed art thou O Lord! who sanetifieth Israel, and the seasons.

RELATION OF PASSOVER
<small><i>The master of the house then breaks the middle cake, and he lay one half by; till after supper, for</i></small>

Magid

Ha Lachma Anya


<small><i>The whole Company at the table, they wave the dish with the three cakes and they says loud.</i></small>
Lo! this is as the bread of affliction, which our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt; let all those who are hungry, enter, and eat thereof; and all who are necessitous, come, and celebrate the Passover. At the present time we are here, but the next year we hope to be in the land of Israel. at the present we are subjecteth to our passion, but the next year we hope to be free of these.

Four Questions

<small><i>Fill the cup with wine the second time, then the youngest of the company asks:-</i></small>
Wherefore is this night distinguished from an other nights? On all the other nights we may eat either leavened or unleavened bread,but on this night only unleavened bread; on all the other nights we may eat any specie of herbs, but on this night only bitter herbs; on all the other nights we not dip even once,but on this night twice: on all the other nights we eat and drink either sitting or leaning, but on this night we all lean.

We Were Slaves in Egypt

<small><i>The whole company answer, and the cakes shall be uncovered.</i></small>
Because we were slaves unto Pharaoh in Egypt, and the Eternal, our God, brought us forth from thence, with a mighty hand, and an outstreched arm: and if the Most holy, blessed be He! had not brought forth our ancestors from Egypt, we, and our children, and our children's children, had still continued in bondage to the Pharaohs in Egypt; therefore, although we were all wise, all of us, men of understanding and experience, all of us having knowledge in the law, it, nevertheless, is incumbent upon us to discourse of the departure from Egypt; and all those who largly discourse of the departure from Egypt; are praisworthy.

Story of the Five Rabbis

And thus is related of Rabbi Eleazar, Rabbi Joshua, Rabbi Elazer, the son of Azaria, Rabbi Akeeba, and Rabbi Tarphon, that they once met (on the night of Passover) in BRAK and continued discoursing of the departure from Egypt, all that night, till their disciples came, and said: "instructors, it is time to read the morning שמע."
Rabbi Elazar, the son of Azariah, said, "verily, I am as a man of seventy years of age, and have hitherto not been able to prove that the relation of the departure from Egypl, ought to be related at night, till expounded by the son of Zoma; after this manner ti's said,* that mayest remember the day of thy going forth from the land of Egypt, ALL the days of thy life." From whence he observed, that the expression of the days of thy life, signifies the days only; but ALL the days of thy life, denotes the nights also. But the sages say, the days of thy life, denotes this time only; but ALL the days of thy life, denotes even at the time of the Messiah.

The Four Sons

Blessed be the Omnipresent; blessed is he, blessed is he who hath given the law to his people Israel, blessed be he: the law instruct us of four children of different dispositions, viz., the wise, the wicked, the simple, and he who hath not capacity to inquire.
The wise son thus expresses himself : what mean those testimonies, statutes, and judgements, which the Lord our God has commanded us? Then shalt thou instruct him in all the laws of the Passover; also, that we must not have a dessert after the passover lamb.
The wicked son expresses himself thus: what mean you by this service? By expression you, it is clear, he does not include himself; and as he hath withdrawn himself from the collective body of the nation, it is proper, that thou retort on him, and therefore answer him thus: this is done because of that, which the Eternal did for me, when I went from Egypt: did for me, but not for him; for had he been there, he would not have been thought worthy to be redeemed.
The simple son artlessly asks, what is this? Then shalt thou answer him; for with a strong hand the Eternal brought us out of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
But as for him, who hath not capacity to enquire, thou must begin to discourse: as ti's said, and thou shalt shew thy son on that day, saying, this is done because of that which the Eternal did for me, when I went forth from Egypt.

Yechol Me'rosh Chodesh

Possibly you may think that you are bound to explain this from the first day of the month Nissan ; therefore it is said on that day; yet, as it says, on that day it might he inferred that it must be whilst it is day, but as it is said, that is done because of that, &amp;c. from which it is to be inferred at no other time but when the unleavened cake, and bitter herbs, are placed before thee.

In the Beginning Our Fathers Were Idol Worshipers

Idolaters were our ancestors in the ancient, but at present the Lord brought us near to his service: as it is said, and Joshua said unto all the people, thus said the Eternal the God of Israel, your ancestors dwelt on the other side of the river (Euphrates) in old time, Terah the father of Abraham and Nachor ; and served other gods.
And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac; and I gave unto Isaac : Jacob and Esau; and I gave unto Esau mount Seir for his possession: but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
Blessed be he, who strictly preserveth his promise unto Israel; blessed be the Most Holy, who premediated the end of the captivity, that he might perform what he had promised to our father Abraham, between the parts* as is said; and he said unto Abraham, know for certain, that thy seed shall be strangers in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years. But also that nation whom they shall serve, will I judge; and they shall afterwards go forth with great substance.
<small><i>Cover the cakes and lift up the cup of the wine and say:</i></small>
And it is this same promise which hath been the support of our ancestors, and of us also: for not one only hath risen against us, but in every generation there are some who rise up against us, to anihilate us ; but the Most Holy, blessed be he, hath delivered us out of their hand.

First Fruits Declaration

<small><i>Set the cup on the table and uncover the cakes again.</i></small>
Search, and inquire, what Laban, the Syrian, intended to do to our father Jacob , for Pharaoh decreed the destruction of the males only; but Laban intended to root out the whole; as is said: a Syrian had thought to anihilate my father, and he went down into Egypt sojourned there with few persons, and there became a great, mighty and populous nation.
and sojourned there: by which we are taught that he did not go down to settle there, but only to sojourn: as is said: and they (Joseph's Brethren) said unto Pharaoh: to sojourn in the land we are come: for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan : now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
With a few persons; as it is said: with three-score and ten souls thy ancestors went down into Egypt; and now the Lord, thy God, hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
And he there became a nation; by which we are informed, that the children of Israel were distinguished, even in Egypt as a peculiar nation. Great and mighty; as it is said: and the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied and waxed exeeding mighty, and the land was full with them.
And populous; as it is said: I have caused thee to multiply as the fegetation of the field, and thou becamest considerable and great, and adorned with many beauties; thy breasts are fashioned, and thy hair grown, yet thou art naked and bare.
And the Egyptians ill treated us, afflicted us and laid heavy bondage upon us. And the Egyptians ill-treated us, as it is said: lo, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, if it chance to be a war they might also go over to our enemies, fight against us, and so get them out of the land.
And they afflicted us; as it is said: and they set over them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens, and they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, even Pethom and Raamses.
And they laid heavy bondage upon us, as is said: and the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with rigour.

And we cried unto the Eternal, the God of our ancestors; the Lord heard our voice, and observed our affliction, our labor, and our oppression.
And we cried unto the Lord, the God of our ancestors; as is said: and it came to pass in course of time, that the King of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed by reason of their bondage; and they cried and their cry ascended unto God, by reason of their bondage.
And the Eternal heard our voice; as it is said : and God heard their groaning, and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and with Jacob.
And he saw our affliction; this denotes their being denied the company of their wives, to prevent the propagation; as is said: and God looketh upon the children of Israel, and had knowledge of their oppression.
And our grievousness: this denotes the destrucion of the male children; as it is said: every son that is born, ye shall cast into the river, but every daughter ye shall save alive.
And our oppression ; this denotes fatigue; as it is said: and I havə also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians harras them.
And the Eternal brought us forth from Egypt, with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm; with terror, and with signs and wonders.
And the Lord brought us forth from Egypt ; not by means of an angel, nor by means of a seraph, nor by means of a messenger: but the Most Holy, blessed be he, by himself, with his glory; as it is said: and I will pass through the land of Egypt this night; and I will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both of man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgements; I am the Lord.
And I will pass through the land of Egypt, I myself, and not an angel; and l will smite all the first-born: I myself and no seraph; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgement ; I myself, and not a messenger; I am the Lord! I am הוא and no other.
With a strong hand. This denotes the murrain, as is said: behold, the hand of the Lord will be upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon thy horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep; a very grievous murrain.
And with an outstretched arm, this denotes the sword, as is said: and a drawn sword, in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem.
And with great terror; this denotes the appearance of the Divine Presence; as is said: or hath God assayed to go and take unto him a nation from the midst of another nation, by proofs; signs, and wonders; by war and mighty hand; by an outstretched arm, and great terror according to all that the Eternal, your God, did for you in Egypt, before your eyes.
And with signs, this denotes the miracles which were performed with the rod; as is said: and thou shalt take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.
And with wonders; this denotes the plague of the blood; as is said: and I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, 

The Ten Plagues

<small><i>*By every plague dip your Finger in the cup of the wine and drop on the floor to show that the Egyptians were plagued with God's finger.</i></small>
*blood and fire and pillars of smoke.

It may also be explained thus: with a strong hand, denotes two plagues. With an outstretched arm, two plagues. With great terror, two plagues. With signs, two plagues, and with wonders, two plagues.
Thus are the ten plagues, which the Most Holy, blessed be he, brought on the Egyptians in Egypt, viz.,

BLOOD,
FROGS,
VERMIN,
A MIXTURE NOXIOUS BEAST,
MURRAIN,
BOILS,
HAIL,
LOCUSTS,
DARKNESS,
and SLAYING THE FIRST-BORN. 
Rabbi Jehudah formed the initials to serve for an index, thus: דצ"ך עד"ש ברח"ב.
Rabbi Jose, the Galilian, said: from whence art thou authorized to assert that the Egyptians were afflicted with TEN plagues in Egypt, and upon the sea they were smitten with FIFTY, plagues? To which he answeres : in Egypt, it says: and the magicians said unto Pharaoh, this is the FINGER of God; but at the sea it says, and Israel saw the mighty HAND, wherewith the Lord smote the Egptians, and the people feard the Lord, and believed in the Lord and in his servant Moses. Now, if by the finger they were smitten with ten plagues, hence, it is deducible that in Egypt they were smitten with ten plagues, and at the sea they were smitten with fifty plagues. 
Rabbi Eliezer said : from whence can it be proved that every plague, which the Most Holy, blessed be he, brought upon the Egyptians, in Egypt, consisted of four different plagues?- answer. From what it is said: he sent forth against them, the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble; also by sending evil angels among them. Now WRATH is one, INDIGNATION two, TROUBLE three, and SENDING EVIL ANGELS four. Hence it is deducible, that in Egypt they were smitten with FORTY plagues, and at the sea they were smitten with Two HUNDRED plagues. 
Rabbi Ekeba said: from whence can it be proved that every plague, which the Most Holy, blessed be he, brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt, consisted of FIVE plagues? - answer. From what it is said: he sent forth against them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble; also, by sending evil angels among them. Now, the FIERCENESS OF HIS ANGER is one, WRATH two, INDIGNATION three, TROUBLE four, and SENDING EVIL ANGELS five. Hence, it is deducible, that in Egypt they were smitten with FIFTY plagues, and at the sea they were smitten with TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY plagues.

Dayenu

What abundant favors hath the Omnipresent conferred on us, 
For if he had but brought us from Egypt, and had not inflicted justice upon the Egyptians, it would have been sufficient. 
if he had inflicted justice upon them, and had not executed judgement upon their gods, it would have been sufficient.
If he had executed judgement upon their gods, and had not slain their first-born, it would have been sufficient. 
If he had slain their first-born, and had not given us their wealth it would have been sufficient. 
If he had given us their wealth, and had not divided the sea for us, it would have been sufficient. 
If he had divided the sea for us, and not caused us to pass through on dry land, it would have been sufficient. 
If he had caused us to pass on dry land, and had not plunged our oppressors in the midst thereof, it would have been sufficient. 
If he had plunged our oppressors therein, and had not supplied us with necessaries in the wilderness forty years, it would have been sufficient. 
If he had supplied us with necessaries in the wilderness forty years, and had not fed us with manna, it would have been sufficient. 
If he had fed us with manna, and had not given us the Sabbath, it would have been sufficient. 
If he had given us the Sabbath, and had not brought us near to mount Sinai, it would have been sufficient. 
If he had brought us near to mount Sinai, and had not given us his law, it would have been sufficient. 
If he had given us his law, and had not brought us to the land of Israel, it would have been sufficient, 
If he had brought us to the land of Israel, and had not built the temple, it would have been sufficient. 
How much then are we indebted for the manifold favors the Omnipresent conferred on us? He brought us forth from Egypt; executed judgement on the Egyptians and on their gods; slew their first-born; gave us their wealth: divided the sea for us ; caused us to pass through on dry land; plunged our oppressors in the midst thereof; supplied us with necessaries in the wilderness forty years; gave us manna to eat; gave us the Sabbath; brought us near to mount Sinai; gave us the law; brought us into the land of Isrsel ; and built the chosen holy temple for us to make atonoment for all our sins. 

Rabban Gamliel's Three Things

Rabban Gamliel saith, that whosoever doth not make mention of the three things used all the Passover, hath not done his duty ; and these are they: the pashal lamb, the unleavened eake, and the bitter herb.
The pashal lamb, which our ancestors ate during the existence of the holy temple, what did it denote? It denoted that the Most Holy, blessed be he, passed over our fathers' houses in Egypt; as is said: and ye shall say, it is the Lord's Passover, because he passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, but delivered our houses. And the people bowd their heads and worshipped.
<small><i>Take hold of the cake in the dish and say.</i></small>
These unleavened cakes, what for do we eat them? Because there was not sufficient time for the dough of our ancestors to leaven because the Holy Supreme King of kings, blessed is he, appeared unto them and redeemed them; as is said: and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough, which they brought out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry; neither had they made any provision for themselves.
<small><i>Take hold of the bitter herb and say.</i><small></small></small>
This bitter herb, what for we do eat it? Because the Egyptians embittered the lives of our ancestors in Egypt; as is said: and they embittered their lives with cruel bondage, in mortar and brick, and in all manner of labor in the field; all their labor was imposed upon them with rigour.
Therefore is incumbent on every Israelite in every generation, to look upon himself as he had actually gone forth from Egypt; as is said: and thou shalt declare unto thy son, on that day, saying: this is done because of that, which the Eternal did for me, when I went forth from Egypt. It was not our ancestors only that the Most Holy, blessed be he, redeemed from Egypt, but us also did he redeemed with them; as is said: and he brought us from thence, that he might bring us to the land which he swore unto our ancestors.

First Half of Hallel

<small><i>Cover the cakes and lift up the cup of the wine and say:</i><small></small></small>
We therefore are incumbent to thank, praise, ador glorify, bless, exalt, and reverence him who wrought all the miracles for our ancestros and for us: for he brought us forth from bondage to freedom, from sorrow to joy, from mourning into holy days, from darkness to great light, and from servitude to redemption: and therefore let us say a new song Hallelujah,
Prise ye the Lord! Prise O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord! Blessed be the name of the Lord' from henceforth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun, until the going down thereof, shall the Lord's name be praised. High above all nations is the Lord, his glory is above all the heavens. Who is like unto the Lord, our God? he dwelleth on high, yet condescendeth to view the things transacted in heaven, and on earth. He riseth the poor from the dust, and exalteth the needy from the dunghilll, that he may set with the princes of his people. He enlivens the house of childless woman: she becomes a joyful mother of children. Hallelujah.
When Israel went forth from Egypt, even the house of Jacob from a barbarous people, Judah became his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. The sea beheld it, and fled: the Jordan retreated, mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like labms. What aild thee O sea, that thou didst flee? Thou Jordan, that thou didst retreat ? Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills like lambs? It was for the presence of the Lord! quake thou earth for the presence of the God of Jacob, who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint stone into a fountain of water.

Sovereign of the Universe who hast redeemed us and our ancestors, from Egypt; and caust us to attain this night, to eat thereon unleavened cakes and bitter herbs; O Eternal, our God! and the God of our ancestors, mayest cause us to attain other solemn and festivals, which approach us: that we may rejoice in the building of thy city, and exult in thy service: and we may eat there of the sacrifices and pashal lambs, whose blood shall be sprinkled on the side of thine altar, that they be acceptable: then will we give thanks unto thee with a new song for our deliverance and for the redemption of our soul. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who redeemeth Israel. 

Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God! King of the Universe, creator of the fruit of the wine.

<small><i>It is the custom that he who says grace,says:</i></small>
"gentlemen, let us say grace,"
<small><i>and they answer:</i></small>
Blessed be the name of the Lord from henceforth and for evermore.
<small><i>who say grace, says:</i></small>

<small><i>the other answer:</i><small></small></small>

<small><i>And the grace sayer repeats:</i><small></small></small>
Blessed be <small>(<i>by ten</i> our God,)<small> of whose bounty we have been satisfied, and of his goodness we live.</small></small>

Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God! King of the Universe. who feedeth the whole world with his goodnes, grace, kindness. and mercy, he giveth food to every creature for his mercy endureth for ever. And as through his abundant goodness has never been deficient toward us, so may we never be in want of sustenance for ever and ever: for the sake of his great name, for he is the God who feedeth and sustaineth all, and dealeth beneficiently with all and provideth food for all the creatures that he hath created. Blessed art thou, O Lord! who giveth food unto all. 
We will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, our God! for having caused our ancestors to inherit that desirable, good, and ample land; and because thou hast brought us forth from the land of Egypt, and redeemed us from the house of bondage; and for thy covenant which thou hast sealed in our flesh : for the law which thou hast taught us, and for thy statutes which thou hast made known unto us; and for the life, kindness and mercy, which thou hast graciously bestowed upon us, and for the food wherewith thou dost feed and sustain us, continually; every day and hour.
And for all these things O Lord, our God! will we give thanks unto thee, and praise thee; blessed be thy name continually, in the mouth of every creature for ever and ever; as it is written: when thou hast eaten, and art satisfied, then shalt thou bless the Lord, thy God, for the good land which he hath given thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord! for the gift of the land and for the food. 
O Lord, our God! we beseech thee, have compassion on thy people Israel, on Jerusalem, thy city, on Zion, the residence of thy glory, and on the great and holy house of David, thine anointed; and on the great and holy house, which is called by thy name. Thou art our God, Father, Pastor, and Feeder; our maintainer, supporter, and Enlarger. Enlarge us speedily from all our troubles; and suffer us not, O Lord, our God! to stand in need of the gifts of mankind, nor their loan; but let us depen on thy full, open, holy, and extensive hand; so that we may not be put to shame nor ever be confounded.
<small><i>(On Sabbath).</i></small>
Be pleased, O Lord, our God! to grant us rest in thy commandments, of the seventh day, even this great and holy Sabbath; for this day is great and holy in thy presence, thereon to rest, and be at ease, in love, according to the precept of thy will, and in thy good will, suffer no trouble, sorrow, or affliction to affect us in our day of rest; and show us, O Lord, our God! the consolation of Zion, thy city, and the structure of Jerusalem thy holy city; for thou art the Lord Of salvation, and the Lord of consolation. 
Our God, and the God of our fathers, mayest thou be pleased to grant, that our memorial, and the memorial of our fathers, the memorial of the Messiah, the son of David thy servant, and the memorial of Jerusalem, thy holy city, and the memorial of all thy people, the house of Israel, may ascend, arrive. aproach, be seen, accepted; heard visited, and remembered in thy presence, for the obtaining a happy delivering with favor, grace, and mercy, to life, and peace, on this day of the feast of unleavened cakes.

May he, who is most merciful, be adored throughout all generations, be eternally glorified amidst us; and be honred amongst us, to all eternity. May he, who is most merciful, maintain us with honor. May he, who is most merciful, break the yoke of captivity from off our neck, and lead us securely to our land.

May he, who maketh peace in his high heavens bestow peace on us, and all Israel, and say ye Amen. Fear the Lord, ye his saints, for there is no want to those who fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but who seek the Lord shall not want any good. Praise ye the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Thou openest thy hand and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. Blessed is the man who will trust in the Lord, and the God-hood will be his trust. May the Lord give strength to his people, may the Lord bless his people with peace.

O pour out thy wrath upon the heathen who know thee not, and upon the kingdoms who invoke not thy name; for they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his beautiful dwelling. Pour out thy indignation upon them, and cause thy firce anger to overtake them. Pursue them in wrath and destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord.

Hallel

Second Half of Hallel

<small><i>Fill the fourth cup, and finish the Hallel.</i></small>
Not for our sake, O Eternal! not for our sake, but unto thy name give glory, for thy kindness and truth's sake. Wherefore should the heathens say, where is now their God? But our God is in heaven, and hath made whatsoever he pleased. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of man's hands. Mouths they have but they speak not: eyes have they but see not: they have ears, but hear not: they nave nostrils, but smell not: hands, but feel not : feet, but walk not; neither is utterance in their throat. These who make them, shall become like them: so shall all those who trust in them.Israel trust thou in the Eternal! he is your Help and Shield. O house of Aaron, trust in the Eternal! he is your Help and Shield. Ye who revere the Lord, trust in the Lord! he is your Help and Shield. The Lord who hath ever been mindful of us, will bless us ; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaroun. He will bless those who fear the Lord, both small and great may the Lord increase you more and more, you and your children. Ye are blessed of the Lord, who made heaven and earth. The heavens are heavens of the Lord; but the earth he given to the children of man. The dead praise not the Lord, nor they who descend in the silent grave. But we will praise the Lord, from henceforth and for evermore. Hallelujah. 
I am glad that the Lord hath heard my voice, and my supplications, He has inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I seek him as long as my days. Should the cords of death encompass me and the pangs of the grave seize me, trouble and sorrow overtake me. Then I call upon the name of the Lord, O Lord! I beseech thee, deliver my soul. The Lord is gracious and rightous: yea, our God is merciful. The Eternal preserveth the simple; I was brought low, and he saved me. Return unto thy rest, o my soul! for the Lord will deal bountifuly with thee. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eye from tears, and my feet from falling. I yet will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living. I believe, and therefore I declare; I proclaim it, that when I was greatly afflicted. In my haste I said all men are liars.
What shall I render unto the Lord, for all his benefits towards me. I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the presence of his people. Grievous in the sight of the Lord, is the death at his pious servants, O Lord! I am thy servant, the servant son of thine handmaide; thou hast loosed my bonds. Unto thee will I sacrifice a offer of thanksgiving and will invoke the name of him. I will pay my vows unto the Lord, now, in the presence of all his people. In the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee O Jerusalem, Hallelujah.
Praise the Lord, all ye nations; praise him, all ye people. For great is his merciful kindness toward us; and the truth of him endureth for ever. Hallelujah.<br>O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: because his mercey endureth for ever.<br>Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 
<br>Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy e. f. e. 
<br>Let them now that fear the Lord say, that his mercy e. f. e. 

In distress I call upon the God, and the God answered we with enlargement. As the Lord is for me, I will not fear, what ean man do unto me? The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore I shall see my desire on those who hate me. It is better to trust in the Lord, than to rely on man. It is better to trust in the Lord, than to rely on princes. All nations compassed me about, but in the name of the Lord will I cut them off. They surrounded me; yea, they compassed me about, but in the name of the Lord will I cut them off. They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the Eternal will I cut them off. Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall, but the Eternal supported me. The Eternal is my strength and song; he is become my salvation. The voice of song and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous; the right hand of the Eternal hath done valiantly. The right hand of the Eternal is exalted, the right hand of the Lord hath done valiantly. I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the God. He hath indeed chastised me, but he hath not given me over unto death. Open the gates of righteousness for me, that I may enter through them, to praise the Lord, This is the gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter.
I will praise thee, for thou hast answered me, and I become my help. The stone, which the builders rejected, is become the corner head-stone. This is from the Lord: it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day, which the Lord hath appointed, we will rejoice, and be glad thereon
O Lord! save us now, we beseech thee. O Lord &amp;c.<br> O Lord! send now prosperity, we beseech thee. O Lord &amp;O. 

Blessed be he who cometh in the name of the Eternal; blessed are ye from the house of the Lord. God is Lord: and it is who hath granted us light; therefore, bring the sacrifice bound with cords, to the horns of the altar. Thou art my God, and I will praise thee. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
All shall praise thee, O Eternal! for all thy works. And thy pious servants, with the righteous, who perform thy will, and thy people, the house of Israel, with joiful-song shall give thanks, bless, praise, glorify, extol, reverence, sanctify, and acknowledge thy kingly name, O our King! for to thee it is proper to offer thanksgiving, and pleasant to sing praise to thy name; for thou art God from everlasting to everlasting.

The breath of all living bless thy name, O Lord, our God! the spirit: of all flesh, continually glorify and extol thy memorial, o our King! thou art from eternity to eternity; besides thee we acknowledge neither king, redeemer or saviour; thou redeemlest, deliverest, maintainest, and hast compassion over us, in all times of trouble and distress; we have no king but thee. Thou art God of the first, and of the last, God of all creatures; Lord of all production; thou art adored with many manner of praise; who governeth the universe with tenderness, and his creatures with mercy. Lo! the Lord neither slumbereth nor sleepeth, but rouseth those who sleep: awakeneth those who slumber; causeth the dumb to speak; looseth those that are bound: supporteth the fallen; raiseth those who are bowed down: and therefore thee alone do we worship.
Were our mouth filled with melodious song as the sea is with water; our tongues loudly as its roaring billows; our lips with praise, like the wide extended firmament: our eyes with sparkling brightness like the sun and moon: our hands, as the eagles wings, and our feet swift as the hinds; we, nevertheless, are incapable of rendering sufficient thanks unto thee O Lord our God! and the God of our fathers or to bless thy name, for one of the innumerable benefits which thou hast conferred upon us and our ancestors. For thou, O Lord, our God didst redeem us from Egypt, and released us from the house of bondage; in time of famine didst thou sustain us: and in plenty provide for us. Thou didst deliver us from the sword; save us from the pestilence and from many sore diseases.
Hitherto thy tender mercies have supported us, and thy kindness hath not forsaken us. O Lord, our God! thou wilt not forsake us in future. Therefore the members which thou hast branched out in us, the spirit and soul which thou hast breathed out in our nostrils, and the tongue which thou hast placed in our mouth; lo they shall worship, bless, praise, glorify, extol, reverence, sanctify and sing unth thy name, our King; every mouth shall adore thee, and every tongue shall praise thee, every knee shall band, every rational being shall worship thee: every heart shall fear thee: the inward part and reins shall sing praise unto thy name: as it is written. All my bones shall say O Lord! who is like unto thee? who delivereth the weak from one of superior strength, the poor and needy from his oppressor. Who is like unto thee? who is equal unto thee? who is compared unto thee? great, mighty and tremendous God! possesor of heaven and earth. We will praise, adore, glorify and bless thy name: so saith David. Bless the Lord O my soul, and all that is within me, his holy name. O God! who art migty in thy strength, who art great by thy glorious name! mighty for ever! tremendous by thy faithful acts Thou art the King who sitteth on the high and exalted throne.Inhabiting eternity, most exalted, and most holy is his name; and it is written: rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous, for the just, praise is comely. With the mouth of the upright shalt thou be extolled, and with the lips of the righteous shalt thou he blessed, sanctified with the tongue of the pious; and in the midst of the saints shalt thou be praised.
 
  

And in the congregations of many thousands of thy people, the house of Israel, shall thy name, O our King! be glorified in song, throughout all generations; for such is the duty of every created being, towards thee, O Lord, our God! and the God of our fathers, to praise, extol, glorify, exalt, bless, magnify, and adore thee, with all the songs and praises of thy servant David, the son of Jesse, thine anointed.
Thy name shall be praised for ever, almighty great and holy King, in heaven and on earth; for unto thee, O Lord, our Godl and the God of our fathers, is proper, song and praise, hymn and psalm, strength and dominion; victory, power and greatness, adoration and glory; holiness and majesty; blessing and thanksgiving, from now and for evermore. Blessed art thou, O Lord Almighty King, great with praises, Almighty to be adored, Lord of wonders, who hast accepted songs of psalmody, King, Almighty, who lives eternally. 

Fourth Cup of Wine

Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God ! King of the Universe, Creator of the fruit of the wine.
<small><i>Drink the fourth cup of wine, and say the Grace after drinking of Wine,</i></small>
Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God ! King of the Universe, for the wine, and the fruits of the wine, and for the increase of the field, and for the desirable good and ample land, which thou hast pleased to cause our ancestors to inherit, to eat of the fruit thereof, and to be satisfied of the goodness thereof. Have compassion, O Eternal our God! on thy people Israel: on Jerusalem thy city: on Zion the tabernacle of thy glory, on thine altar and on thy temple. O rebuild Jerusalem the holy city in our days, and lead us up thereon: and cause us to rejoice therein that we may eat of the fruit thereof and be satisfied with its goodness, and bless thee in holiness and purity, (and be pleased to grant us rest on this Sabbath-day.]) and cause us to rejoice on this day of the feast of the unleavened Cakes ; for thou, O Lord! art good and beneficient to all: we, therefore will thank thee, for the land, and for the fruit of the wine.
Blessed art thou, O Lord ! for the land, and for the fruit of the wine.
