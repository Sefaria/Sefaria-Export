Selichot Nusach Polin

First Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.

Chapter 3

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Benjamin ben Zarach</i></small>
Our God, and God of our fathers!
How can we open our mouths before You, O’ One Who dwells in the heavens; in what manner can we pour out our words of prayer? We have rejected Your upright and honest ways, [instead] we cling to abominations, and acts of corruption.
We have adhered to false and misleading concepts, we have been stubborn and brazen; You were angered at us, [the Temple,] our secure abode, You destroyed and the pleasing aroma of sacrifices ceased.
Banished and uprooted are the priests, the anointed ones, who knew how to arrange burnt-offerings and other sacrifices [on the Altar]; You warned us many times through the prophets, Your messengers; we did not take heed or listen to those who admonished us.
From then and even till now we have been scattered [among the nations,] we have been killed, slaughtered and butchered. We are a bare remnant [among the nations] who tear at us like painful thorns; our eyes fail with disappointment for we have found no relief.
Those who enslave Your people, who bow down to false gods— why do they succeed morning till night? They rise against You saying with scorn: “Shattered ones [Israel,] in whom do you trust?”
You Who live eternally, holy One! See the humiliation of those who groan, they rely on You, and to You they cleave. With the awesome might of Your right hand, deliver them for eternity— for in Your abundant mercy, we trust.
<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rav Sadyah Gaon 892–942</i></small>
For in Your abundant mercy we trust, and on Your righteousness, we rely, and for Your pardon, we hope, and for Your deliverance, we yearn. You are a King Who loves righteousness from of old, Who passes over the iniquities of His people, and removes the sins of those who fear Him. You made a covenant with the Patriarchs, and will keep [Your] oath with their descendants. You are He Who descended in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai, and disclosed the ways of Your goodness to Moses, Your servant. The ways of Your kindliness, You revealed to him; and You made known to him that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness, and full of beneficence, guiding the entire world with the quality of mercy. And so it is written: “And He said: ‘I will cause to pass all My goodness before you, and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy in your presence; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate.’”
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 4

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Shlomo ben Yehuda, HaBavli</i></small>
Our God, and God of our fathers!
There is none that offers righteous prayer, the best of men is like a briar-thorn; to seek compassion on those who are crushed— no one [worthy] can be found.
The blameless and pure man has vanished, the pious man has disappeared and the righteous has been trampled; thus a generation impoverished in good deeds is held to account for its iniquities, for there is none to direct its ways.
Our sins have caused [God’s] wrath to be kindled, [even against the righteous] who offered, as members of Your household to pray and intercede for us; and thus, who is there, great or small, that is able to offer confession and prayer to the Holy One Who is ever awake?
I tremble and fear to offer prayer on behalf of the congregation to Him Who searches and probes [hearts;] deficient in virtue and full of sin, how can I find favor with my supplication?
You are good to those who call upon You with all their soul, You bear their burden and sustain them; expand Your precious kindness upon me, and give ear to my voice with Your love.
[Regard me] as one who is of worthy character and completely proficient in prayer, as one who is mature and fluent and not as a boor, consider my broken heart before You, and let me not be ashamed; for the sake of my relief, remember Your mercy— let it not be concealed.
Numerous are our needs, but they cannot be expressed because of our short-sightedness and rebellious spirit; but all is revealed to You Who has formed us from clay, [our] guide, shepherd, shelter and protector.
We are left like a single tree on a mountain in our solitude, our glory has turned to rubbish and refuse, answer us and sustain us in our servitude, add to Your counted ones [Israel] by seeking out those who are lost from us.
Those who are inflicted with pain by the rods of Your chastisement, are scattered, dispersed and pawned among the nations; protect them in Your shelter from strife and punishment, for to behold Your glory is their hope and desire.
[God,] Whose powerful voice hews flames of fire, Who decrees both good and its opposite, Your beloved ones knock [at Your door] with a sorrowful voice; accept their offer of prayer, and dwell among them.
They persevere in fasting [in order] to humble their hearts, their multitude—from the wrath of judgement conceal them in Your chamber; they beseech You in quiet prayer, lips whispering, withhold not their desire.
Your Name O God is glorified by Your desire to grant life, we remain in good life because of You, for the fountain of life flows from You; look to us, and answer us, and enlighten our eyes.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses], and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.

Chapter 5

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Shlomo ben Yehudah HaBavli</i></small>
Our God, and God of our fathers!
May our fervent prayers come before You, may Your ear be attentive to our supplication, hear our justification, Adonoy, and listen to our song, for You look at our righteous deeds, and overlook the complaints against us.
We are disgraced, ashamed to raise our heads, for the sweet aroma of our good name we have polluted, we have corrupted righteousness, and the Written and Oral Torah, we have misrepresented, we therefore hide our faces in the ground.
Distress and anguish seize us from all sides, we are like sheep adrift without shelter, if we turn to the right, the axe cuts us down, to the left, there is dread lest we fall prey to those who hunt us.
May Your ever-seeing eyes be opened to behold our affliction and distress from our prolonged suffering; may our mourning be turned into exultation, our chastisement to favour, turn about our misfortune, befitting Your ways of uprightness.
We have been subjected to captivity and plunder, we, our kings and our priests to disgrace; from glorious heights and [Your] mighty love, we have been hurled to the earth in desolation and scorn.
We did not seek Your Presence— to offer supplication, nor did we seek understanding of Your truth, because of the stench of our iniquity; we were destined for the same end as Sodom, for we diminished the sound of Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally “mill”. The study of Torah is likened to the grinding of a mill which operates day and night.</i> we were almost destroyed, but for Your grace.
You spared the remnant [of the First Temple,] You established and fenced in [the Second,] and You gathered us therein; we were cast away because of the sin<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to <span>שִנֽאַת חִנָם</span>, unwarranted hatred, which was the cause for the destruction of the Second Temple.</i> which equals the three sins<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The three sins of idolatry, adultery, and murder were the cause for the destruction of the First Temple.</i> which You despise; the Temple of Your yearning, You trampled because of us (our sins).
We have acted corruptly and treacherously, thus we were driven from one yoke to another;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">From exile to exile.</i> remember Your promise never to abhor us, gather Your scattered ones and rule over them.
After all that has befallen us, we know that Your judgements are righteous, and we alone caused our disgrace, for even to this day we have not changed, and we appear before You with great guilt.
This lowly people, held in shame and contempt, pushed about, swept aside, given as plunder exile and captivity tested and refined them; turn about in Your kindness to pardon and heal them.
Through Your mercy, shown many times, may we find deliverance in You— fulfill Your promise of “I will deliver them;”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 1:7.</i> let them come from afar in droves, some from the north, and some in ships from Kittim.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 24:24.</i>
They are Yours, Your servants and Your people, cherish them as in the days of old— Your sweet ones [Israel], draw us that we may follow You; put us among those inscribed in Your Book, for we all yearn to fear Your Name.
May this small people increase a thousandfold, O our Beloved, and may this youth grow into a mighty nation in our borders; with all Your ways of righteousness, have compassion on us, turn back from Your fierce anger and comfort us.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

<small><span>בְּמוֹצָאֵי מְנוּחָה</span></small>
After the departure of the Sabbath, we approach You [in prayer,] incline Your ear from on high, You Who are enthroned upon praises, [and] hear our cry and our prayer!
Raise Your mighty, right hand to act valiently [against our accusers;] for the sake of [Isaac] the righteous one, who was bound [on the altar,] and in whose stead a ram was slain— shield his descendants as they cry to You while it is yet night, [and] hear our cry and our prayer!
Turn to those who seek You when they seek Your Presence, be accessible to them from Your Heavenly Abode, and to the cry of their supplication close not Your ear; [and] hear our cry and our prayer!
They tremble and quake at the day of Your coming [to judge them,] they are panic-struck— as a woman giving birth the first time, from the burning wrath You carry; O’ please, wipe away their filth that they may praise Your wonders, [and] hear our cry and our prayer!
You are the Creator of all that is formed, You prepared from of old, a remedy to save them from distress, by bestowing undeserved grace upon them from Your hidden treasure. Hear our cry and our prayer!
Exalted One, if the sins of Your congregation are great, strengthen them, we pray from the treasure stored in Your abode; Your community [implores You] to grant them undeserving grace as they approach You. Hear our cry and our prayer!
Turn to our sufferings and not to our sins, justify those who cry out to You; [God] who performs wonders, listen to their supplication, God, Adonoy of Hosts. Hear our cry and our prayer!
Be pleased [and accept their pleadings as they stand [before You] at night, regard [their prayers] with favor as the offering of burnt-offerings; show them Your miracles He Who does great things. Hear our cry and our prayer!
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Chapter 7

Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 8

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost.
Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.

And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.

Chapter 10

<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us for we have been brought very low. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and good life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amein.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Second Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 3

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Shlomo ben Yehuda, HaBavli</i></small>
Our God, and God of our fathers!
Even if our iniquities are great and magnified, if their testimony against us is strong like woven strands of rope, creating a separation between us; let Your ways of compassion not be withheld from us.
You affirmed to govern with kindliness, and You have always been, from of old. Remember Your community that You acquired; take pity on the remnant of those [Israel] whom You called Your first born.
You carried us [up high] to the city [Jerusalem] and implanted us there. You caused us to dwell [in the city] built of strong and mighty stones. Abruptly You cast us down to a place [where our enemies] [attack us] like serpents. Bring forth the relief that we await.
The many [evil] episodes and dreadful panic have caused my soul to abhor life. [My life has become] loathsome as dirt. Support our bodies, dragged to the ground. Awaken, why do You slumber?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See previous note.</i> You are our [only] hope!
Open [Your eyes,] remove our shackles, call to Your imprisoned ones with affection. Hurry, shorten their sentence of oppression; gather Your dispersed ones, Your scattered flock; when they see [Your deliverance,] the mouths of the unjust will close [in shame].
Preserve the oath of kindness, and the stipulation You made with the perfect one [Jacob], with [Isaac], whose ashes are on the Altar, and with the builder of the Altar [Abraham], all of whom were mighty in their trust in You. Command Your peace with us that we be not disgraced; turn about and change the evil time for good.
Jacob [the nation of Israel] is small and poor. We are known to be ill, despised and worthless. Grant them life and kindness; be their stronghold and tower. And even now, let Your power of deliverance be magnified.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.

Chapter 4


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Your ways are not like those of man,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Who cannot always fulfill his will.</i> where, then, is Your vengeance<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">But since You can, why don’t You take revenge from our enemies.</i> and Your enduring counsel? The daughter [Israel] whom You chose to serve You in Your cherished House— is now dominated by [strange] masters and she is unable to cleave unto You.
She groans [saying]: “I am betrothed to my beloved— but the abhorred oppressor— how he has trampled upon me.” The sentence of death, she accepts on herself, though she is exiled [from her land] and coerced by the nations.
The mother<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Congregation of Israel.</i> is sent away—not divorced, the son, like a lost orphan—is sent off. She, who was likened to a closed-in garden,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Israel, who was protected by its Divine faith, has now been abandoned.</i> has become abandoned like wild grass, and the foundation that was sealed is now trodden and polluted.
Formerly Your wrath lasted but a moment, but now the reverse is true. The [priests who wore the] holy crowns, are now cast into the streets. She, who was beloved of God, was beautiful as “Keren Hafuch” [Job’s daughter, Job 42:14] is now forsaken, and regarded as one [a harlot] with painted eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God considers our love to be insincere.</i>
She, who was of pleasing appearance, has become blackened by hard labor, her sore festers without healing. The day of vengeance—its path is yet closed; the day of redemption— the window is yet sealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The time of redemption is concealed from our view.</i>
Our endurance is weakened by the burden;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Of exile.</i> crippled and lame are the survivors of death. Without rest, they stray and wander, they labor and strive, while others reap.
The horn [pride of Israel] was planted in the rich, fertile land [of Israel]. Why has it become trampled like thistles for the furnace? The Guardian above, who never sleeps, why does He let His plant be trampled by the bulls of Bashan [Israel’s enemies].
What profits the vine when it is cut down? What benefit is it to the spreading vine when it is uprooted? She [Israel], who is engraved on God’s palm,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Isaiah 49:16.</i> and upon His T’filin, why has God’s love for her been withdrawn?
The task of the nations requires minimal effort,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They are required to observe only the seven Noachide laws.</i> but the payment of their wages increases. She [Israel] yearns for Your attention, but her waiting time is prolonged. Each occurrence of trouble is followed immediately by another.
The holy first offerings of the grain heaps<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is referred to as God’s first fruits.</i> are scattered like chaff to the ends of the earth, driven by the wind like leaves of the forest. They flee in panic, as pursued by the sword.
Those ninety eight curses [described in the Torah, Deut. 28] and those not described are fulfilled in us. Have mercy, gather us from these [four] corners. Then will they say among the nations: “Adonoy has done great things for them.”
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them.
Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

Chapter 5


Messengers of mercy, angels of the Most High! beseech the Presence of the Almighty with words of virtue [concerning Israel]. Perhaps, He will spare this poor and needy people. perhaps He will be compassionate.
Perhaps He will be compassionate with the remnant of Joseph,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Amos 5:16.</i> who are lowly and disgraced, torn to pieces, innocent captives, sold without compensation; they cry out in prayer seeking permission [to enter His Presence]. Perhaps [then] He will spare this poor and needy people, perhaps He will be compassionate.
Perhaps He will be compassionate toward those who are afflicted in chains, accustomed to beatings—enduring oppression, the subject of head-shaking among the nations; a byword among peoples, of anger and shame. Perhaps [then] He will spare this poor and needy people, perhaps He will be compassionate.
Perhaps He will be compassionate and see the affliction of His people, and listen to those who pray to Him; they gather to offer silent prayer amid their suffering, their eyes look to Him, hoping for favor. Perhaps [then] He will spare this poor and needy people, perhaps He will be compassionate.
Perhaps He will be compassionate toward those who say “Please pardon us,” who vigorously praise Him at all times, who band together in times of trouble to pour out supplications; in the Presence of their God, they pour out their weak hearts. Perhaps [then] He will spare this poor and needy people, perhaps He will be compassionate.
Perhaps He will be compassionate upon those who have been doubly smitten, swallowed by lions [enemies of Israel], even in the mouth of small lions smitten [by God] and punished for their conspicuous iniquities;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Lamentations 1:9—<span>טוּמֽאָתָה בְּשׁוּלֶיהָ</span></i> yet, she has not forgotten the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi to Habakuk 3:4—<span>חֶבְיוֹן עוּזוֹ</span>.</i> Perhaps [then] He will spare this poor and needy people, perhaps He will be compassionate.
Perhaps He will be compassionate upon those who hide their faces [in shame], who listen to their degradation and do not reply or argue; to Him Who is eternal they hope, and upon His deliverance they depend, for His mercy is never absolutely withheld. Perhaps [then] He will spare this poor and needy people, perhaps He will be compassionate.
Perhaps He will be compassionate to strengthen one, oppressed in poverty, release the captive from his land of captivity, remove his pain and heal his sickness, hear his cry and hasten the time of redemption. Perhaps [then] He will spare this poor and needy people, perhaps He will be compassionate.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Chapter 6

Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.

We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.

We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor. Act for the sake of Your teaching. Act for the sake of Your kingship. Act for the sake of Your eternity. Act for the sake of Your counsel. Act for the sake of Your strength. Act for the sake of Your magnificence. Act for the sake of Your righteousness. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your abundant mercy. Act for the sake of Your Divine Presence. Act for the sake of Your praise. Act for the sake of Your beloved ones, who repose in the dust. Act for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Act for the sake of Moses and Aaron. Act for the sake of David and Solomon. Act for the sake of Jerusalem, city of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Zion, Dwelling Place of Your honor. Act for the sake of the desolation of Your Habitation. Act for the sake of the destruction of Your Altar. Act for the sake of the blood of Your servants that was spilled. Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

Merciful One, answer us; Merciful One, have pity; Merciful One, redeem, Merciful One, save, Merciful One, have compassion on us, now, speedily, and very soon.
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Third Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 3


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Your people Israel set prayers [before You], for they are in distress and need deliverance; their adversaries add to the yoke [of exile], all this has befallen them, yet Your Name they bless.
Their illness and suffering is indescribable, they have been humiliated from their youth, and it has not been removed from them; Holy One, it is in Your hand to release the prisoner according to Your pure attribute [of mercy], unlike the attribute of man.
He is garbed in righteousness which adorns Him like a cloak [of royalty], from the wound itself, He prepares the cure; raise up Your congregation from its lowly fall with Your great strength and outstretched arm.
With Your love and compassion You uplifted and exalted [Your people Israel] [we beseech You therefore] to eradicate the counsel of the wicked and to annul their [evil] plans against us; inflict them with great turmoil, and let the cruel angel thrust them and throw them [into exile].
For the sake of Your honor, and Your holy Name, that is greatly extolled, perform awesome wonders [for us] lest [Your Name] be desecrated among nations; lead their advisors and men of power to total confusion, and do to them as they did to us.
Raise up the poor from the dust and the needy from the dunghills, Your community— let them not be destroyed and humiliated; if she has been casual regarding Your precepts and negligent [in their performance,] may all her transgressions be covered over by Your love.
They are most precious in Your Presence, Master of masters, regardless of their conduct they are called Your children. Let Your mercy go before them, God of the high and lowly before they are drowned in the wicked flood.
They desire Your nearness above all else, hasten for their sake to bring the deliverance that was prophesied. Holy One, let them be a sign of [Your] beneficence. Strong and mighty is their redeemer— Adonoy of Hosts.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Chapter 5


Israel, that is delivered by Adonoy with eternal deliverance, even this day may they be delivered [by decree] from Your mouth, You Who dwell on high! for You are magnanimous to pardon and the Lord of compassion.
At Your door they knock like poor and destitute [beggars]. To the outpourings of their heart— listen, O God, Who dwells in the heavens, for You are magnanimous to pardon and the Lord of compassion.
They are terrified from all [their] distress, from their slanderers and oppressors. We beseech You, do not forsake them, Adonoy, God of their fathers, for You are magnanimous to pardon and the Lord of compassion.
Let Your goodness await them on the day of chastisement, and from amidst [their] distress find for them redemption and relief, for You are magnanimous to pardon and the Lord of compassion.
Deliver them within sight of all, and let them not be ruled by the wicked. Destroy the tyranny of Seir [Esau] and his father-in-law [Ishmael], and let the deliverers go up to Zion, for You are magnanimous to pardon and the Lord of compassion.
Listen, O Master, to the voice of their cry and to Your throne in the heavens, let their prayers ascend, for You are magnanimous to pardon and the Lord of compassion.

Chapter 6

Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor. Act for the sake of Your teaching. Act for the sake of Your kingship. Act for the sake of Your eternity. Act for the sake of Your counsel. Act for the sake of Your strength. Act for the sake of Your magnificence. Act for the sake of Your righteousness. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your abundant mercy. Act for the sake of Your Divine Presence. Act for the sake of Your praise. Act for the sake of Your beloved ones, who repose in the dust. Act for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Act for the sake of Moses and Aaron. Act for the sake of David and Solomon. Act for the sake of Jerusalem, city of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Zion, Dwelling Place of Your honor. Act for the sake of the desolation of Your Habitation. Act for the sake of the destruction of Your Altar. Act for the sake of the blood of Your servants that was spilled. Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.

He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Fourth Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 3


Our God, and God of our fathers!
In the day of dread, I call upon You. Let me not be oppressed by the insolent— those who forsake the precious Torah. Render to them their just deserts; sit [in judgement] to scrutinize [their deeds]. May the sentence of the wicked and corrupt be carried out in full.
Those who intend to make us forget Your holy and revered Name and make us familiar with idolatrous names— that are despicable and vulgar; through their methods the best of our people have been destroyed. Spare the remnant from being crushed as [olives] in an oilpress.
As they tear beasts of prey, so they learned to devour man, as it is said:<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 19:3.</i> they cast lots for us as if we were ownerless property in the wilderness. We were almost utterly consumed, and nothing would have been left of us, were it not for Your mercy, O Master, Who rules with kindness
Who dares murmur at Your ways, to argue against them? who dares gird himself to dispute You? We have turned away [from Your mitzvos] and have been scattered like the wind. The enemy’s bloody sword was drawn; but with You is justice and Your hand is uppermost.
Let the tyrant not say: “I have prevailed,” nor let Judah’s enemies exult at my fall: Proclaim— for those who were sold for naught— the year of release. May the wicked seeking to extend their rule be turned back and cut down.
Your bill of sale<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">You acquired Israel as Your exclusive possession.</i> preceded theirs and yet the creditors<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Israel’s enemies.</i> demand payment. To postpone Your lien [is the intent] of the many harsh rulers. The border marks of Your boundary,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Mitzvos of the Torah are boundary marks dividing Israel from all other nations.</i> they seek to uproot. The grain [Israel] which You sanctified, has been devoured— both grain ears and chaff.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Both good and bad ones.</i>
Let judgement for their evil come on them and reveal their guilt. According to their misdeeds be harsh and bring devastation upon them. For the portion of their cups, rain upon them fiery coals; return to them sevenfold. Avenge Your covenant and destroy them.
To the city of Your beautiful Palace, lead us. Make a path through the sea for the redeemed congregation to pass. In You is our hope, and You, our Almighty Creator, comfort us; may Your kindliness be upon us.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”
Look down from the heavens and see, from the abode of Your holiness and glory. Where is Your vengeance and Your might? The multitude of Your compassion and mercy has been withheld from us. You split the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. If our iniquities testify against us, Adonoy, act [mercifully] for Your Name’s sake.
As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.

Chapter 4

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Gershom ben Yehudah (the Light of the Exile).</i></small>
Our God, and God of our fathers!
Where are all Your wonders— the great and awesome [wonders] of which our fathers told us, Adonoy of Hosts? When Israel went down to Egypt to slavery and toil, with cords of humanity, You drew them—<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob and his sons were drawn to Egypt to see Joseph.</i> not with chains.
Even those who enslaved them with hard labor, who decreed their males be cast in the river, You judged them measure for measure; You brought out the bannered hosts with a wealth of all desired gifts.
The sea and its waves were divided by Your strength, You dried up the Jordan and they crossed it on foot, You sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; kingdoms and nations were put into their hands.
They rejected the good ways and they were pursued by their oppressors, they cried to You and You heard them, and You appointed deliverers for them. When they lived in the land, they enjoyed all good things, they sinned and were exiled [to Babylon], You remembered to redeem after seventy years.
They joined themselves to falsehood and were left to be trampled, they were forced into exile by men of violence [the Romans], they were forced out of their land, and the time of their return is concealed; they live among the nations as bondsmen.
Strengthen the remnant that escaped, she [Israel] is weakened by the heavy and bitter catastrophe; still feeling the pain of the first calamity<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The destruction of the First Temple.</i> she was quickly struck a second below.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The destruction of the Second Temple.</i>
From day to day my trouble increases, each new day is worse than yesterday. I am weary of bearing the yoke of the oppressor who says: “Count out and bring heavy taxes.”
Your treasured people are hard pressed by the cruel enemy, she [the enemy] anticipated that they would exchange their faith in God for a faith in man. How long, Adonoy, shall I call [upon You] in distress? Answer me with Divine enlargement, for Your hand is not lacking.
If the gravity of our transgressions have created a barrier between You and us, if the curtain has shut out [our] prayer; Mighty God, beneath Your throne of glory, hollow out a passage, that our cry come before You, that it be accepted before Your glory.
Proclaim a year of favor to relieve me from grief, gather my scattered ones, and go before me, defend me Adonoy against those that strive against my soul; please save me, my holy God.
Break the teeth of the wicked with gravel, may they be childless, their wives widows, destroy them; [and] let their blood be spilled on the ground, let it be poured out; release those who are prepared to die<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For Your sake.</i> and betroth them in faithfulness.
Repair the breach of the tabernacle of David which is fallen, raise up the city which is lowered to the dust. Comfort her in captivity with double measure, brighten her light and lighten her darkness.
Build Your city as in the days of old, restore Your Altar, Temple, and Entrance Hall, then will Judah and Israel worship You there, —all of them, and Your Name will be magnified forever.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

Chapter 5


In the early morning, I call upon You Almighty, Who is praised; let the order of my prayer be sweet to You on this day when my heart exalts You; lighten my darkness and may it be bright as the morning. My King and my God, to You I pray.
My foes who anger You, humiliate Your people in their rage. I bear the fear of You despite the tumult of Your adversaries. Pour out Your wrath upon them and rage from Your Heavenly Dwelling; and be jealous, Almighty, for Your Name which has been profaned among the nations. My King and my God, to You I pray.
O living One, Who rides upon a swift cloud; if You place me on a scale, let my righteousness be as heavy as the sand of the sea, and my wickedness as light as a feather; and if my path has been crooked, and my sentence is [to be] as that of an ox who is stoned to death,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">An ox that killed a man was stoned to death.</i> then weigh me on the scale of grace, for I am a man, wounded with transgressions. My King and my God, to You I pray.
Restore the Holy Ark and its staves, and clothe Aaron in his [priestly] garments; and they<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael and Edom.</i> that hunt with snares shall eat the fruit of their labor, and each of those who rebelled, let tongues of flame consume their offspring, and let them both<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael and Edom.</i> be discarded as dung is thrown out. My King and my God, to You I pray.
Holy One, Who is above all masters, Who judges all His creatures, see how my quarrelsome adversary [Satan], speaks evil of me and lifts his spear against me, and his vengeful darts are cast at me. Let my soul be rescued [from him] O God who annuls and frustrates [evil] counsel. My King and my God, to You I pray.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

Chapter 6

Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.

We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor.

Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

Merciful One, answer us; Merciful One, have pity; Merciful One, redeem, Merciful One, save, Merciful One, have compassion on us, now, speedily, and very soon.
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Fifth Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 3


Our God, and God of our fathers!
I longed for You, I hoped for You, though I was in a distant land. With all my heart, I seek You; I call to You from the depths [of my being]. I am crushed with my longing for You as a stag longs for springs of water. I seek You and search for You [even] on the streets and in the markets.
Behold the time has come for You to relieve the distressed and do justice for the oppressed. Their vineyards, they [the enemy] destroyed; they have been plundered by the plunderers; they have been robbed and oppressed by those who crushed them.
Those who cling to You; those in whom You took delight as with tender infants, have been for many days oppressed and battered. They lack everything, they are destitute of [all] good. Lions<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to our enemies who are likened to lions.</i> gnash their teeth at them.
You have abhored, forsaken, and cast off those who cleave to You. You have annulled the covenant with the three [Patriarchs] who You desired. You have made us an object of repulsiveness. We are whipped and beaten; torn by maggots and devoured by locust.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to our enemies who are likened to locust and maggots.</i>
We are wounded, bruised, our limbs torn; we lack balm, and we are without ointment. Arise! help those who sigh and groan. Lift them from the dunghill and raise them from the dust.
The power is in Your hand to raise up the downtrodden. Your might is in the heavens and Your dominion is on earth. The righteous will acknowledge Your Name when You lift the head of those who have been purified seven times.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Israel has been purified in the fires of suffering in exile.</i>
Then all [nations] will say, those near and far, when You deliver those who yearn for You, those strengthened by Your mitzvos: “The Strong and Mighty One has fulfilled His promise to the rose of Sharon, the lily of the valley [Israel].”
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.

Our God, and God of our fathers!
Where is Your jealousy and where are Your mighty deeds, with which You worked awesome wonders for the descendants [of those] with whom You made a covenant?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Patriarchs.</i> We are driven away and cast out from our inheritance;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The land of Israel.</i> Adonoy, [our] God! We are ruled by masters besides You.
The anxiety of Your impoverished ones is exceedingly great; they bear the yoke of Your fear with their heart and soul and possessions. They are bowed down and humbled, exceedingly. Let Your compassion come swiftly toward us for we have been brought very low.
The sparkle in our faces has changed because of those who insult us each day, they gnash their teeth and say: “Behold this is the day.” Reveal the design of Your dominion, O fearful God, for we are slain for Your sake all the day long.
We yearn for the time of redemption and comfort, [meanwhile] we are covered with shame and wrapped with humiliation, oppressed and enslaved under the rule of every nation; and not one of us knows for how long.
King of kings! remember Your mercy of old, save those who guard Your unity from the smoking fire-brands. Cleanse the stains of their sin which are red as scarlet; remember not the sins of our ancestors.
Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate, my face is hidden [with shame] and my heart is appalled. The enemy who laid it waste condemn and let Your radiant countenance shine upon Your desolate Sanctuary.
[Israel] is the possession You acquired of old for the sake of Your glory, have compassion and do not destroy her, for she is the cause of Your praise; for thus have we been promised by [Moses] the faithful one of Your House, “For a merciful Almighty is Adonoy, your God; He will not weaken you and He will not destroy you.”
Remember the likeness of the perfect one<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob.</i> which is etched on Your throne;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to tradition, Jacob’s likeness is etched on the Heavenly Throne.</i> Illustrious One! From the stream of Your delights give his children to drink; bestow upon them deliverance, acquit them from iniquity, for You are He Who forgives iniquity, and remits transgression and acquits.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

Chapter 5


I have risen at dawn to thank You, God of my praise, I will sing to You in the morning and make known to You my sins; for this,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">My praise of You and my confession.</i> grant me as a reward for my endeavor, that my life be spared at my request, and my people at my petition.
In former days in Israel, when sacrifices were offered, though my sins were red as scarlet, they turned completely white.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Through the sin-offering.</i> Therefore, sleep escapes my eyes, and I lament the destruction [of the Temple]; and I have nought but my words and my prayer is my burnt-offering, that my life be spared at my request, and my people at my petition.
When the Altar still existed, and sacred offerings were slaughtered. Each man brought his offering and his sin was eradicated; but now there is no Priest, no sacrifice, no meal offering; [therefore] let my confession be my sacrifice and my prayer be my meal offering, that my life be spared at my request, and my people at my petition.
Behold, when there was a sacrificial service<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the Temple.</i> and the Priests served their turn, the sin-offering atoned, and the burnt-offering exonerated; [but now] there is neither sin nor burnt-offering, no fat and no liver-lobe; [instead] I pour out my prayer and present my supplication, that my life be spared at my request, and my people at my petition.
Behold, in the Holy Temple of old, when the zealous priests rose early, the pure ones stood to draw lots,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This was done in order to assign the priests to the various services.</i> but only new ones<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A priest could only perform the incense offering once in his lifetime because it enriched the one performing it.</i> offered the incense; but now there is no frankincense and no incense offering, and I am left blackened with sin; [therefore] when I confess my sins, let my confession be accepted as an offering, that my life be spared at my request, and my people at my petition.
See [O God] my Holy One, that my hurt is greater than my groaning, and there is none to stand by me, and I have no House of Rest [the Temple]; only in You [I trust] and mention Your Name. Strong Rock of my deliverance; remove my guilt, and then my righteousness will answer for me, spare my life as my request and my people as my petition.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

Chapter 6

Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor. Act for the sake of Your teaching. Act for the sake of Your kingship. Act for the sake of Your eternity. Act for the sake of Your counsel. Act for the sake of Your strength. Act for the sake of Your magnificence. Act for the sake of Your righteousness. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your abundant mercy. Act for the sake of Your Divine Presence. Act for the sake of Your praise. Act for the sake of Your beloved ones, who repose in the dust. Act for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Act for the sake of Moses and Aaron. Act for the sake of David and Solomon. Act for the sake of Jerusalem, city of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Zion, Dwelling Place of Your honor. Act for the sake of the desolation of Your Habitation. Act for the sake of the destruction of Your Altar. Act for the sake of the blood of Your servants that was spilled. Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

Merciful One, answer us; Merciful One, have pity; Merciful One, redeem, Merciful One, save, Merciful One, have compassion on us, now, speedily, and very soon.
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Sixth Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You. 

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”

Chapter 3


Our God, and God of our fathers!
We yearn for You as the stag for flowing streams; we long for the time of redemption, but [thus far] in vain. Distant, and remote, our release [from exile] seems unattainable, yet, we hope and wait and do not cease to trust.
Those who thirst after You, pour hope into their hearts, that they will yet appear before You in their beloved Temple amidst a throng [of worshippers] with a pillar of fire around them. Remove the uncircumcised and unclean, who are their enemies.
Let us cut them off and inherit them, they said and thought [this]; from the inheritance You granted them, they have driven Your people away, and each day, our destruction, they still seek; they tax us and rob us, further impoverishing Your poor ones.
They humiliate Your loved ones [Israel], calling them dogs. Stupid and disgusting are their razored shaven priests. They [Israel] however hear their reproach without retorting, they do not accept their religions but go to the scaffolds because of You.
And as for us, our suffering is before You; in the face of these things will You refrain and be silent at our affliction? Even in the shadow of death our eyes are turned to You.
We are called by Your Name, let it not be profaned, in You, all of Israel is praised. Even if our iniquities are so many that the world is filled with them, “I will blot out your transgressions,” were the words spoken by You. (Isaiah 43:25)
Regard our intentional sins as errors and do not punish us, beyond the letter of the law, deal with us. Because of Your everlasting truth, may our oppressors be disgraced; let the banner be raised, and the scattered of Israel be gathered.
Favor the daughters of my scattered ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> and accept their offerings; gather the dispersed of the tenth exile together with those of the previous nine exiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Before the destruction of the First Temple. See Abarbanel to the Book of Kings.</i> Let sin be drowned, and wickedness not be remembered, O You Who forgives iniquity and removes transgression.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses], and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

Chapter 6

Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.

We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor. Act for the sake of Your teaching. Act for the sake of Your kingship. Act for the sake of Your eternity. Act for the sake of Your counsel. Act for the sake of Your strength. Act for the sake of Your magnificence. Act for the sake of Your righteousness. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your abundant mercy. Act for the sake of Your Divine Presence. Act for the sake of Your praise. Act for the sake of Your beloved ones, who repose in the dust. Act for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Act for the sake of Moses and Aaron. Act for the sake of David and Solomon. Act for the sake of Jerusalem, city of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Zion, Dwelling Place of Your honor. Act for the sake of the desolation of Your Habitation. Act for the sake of the destruction of Your Altar. Act for the sake of the blood of Your servants that was spilled. Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Seventh Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Faint, exiled, and despised, I am pained and distressed, I am chased about and broken, I am filled and intoxicated with wormwood, I am oppressed by masters to whom I was sold for naught; yet, when my soul fainted within me, I remembered Adonoy.
I remembered Your kindness and love which were like a banner over me;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the banners of the tribes as they were encamped in the wilderness.</i> they removed my guilt and made me Your treasure. But now, Your flock [Israel] is left with only entreaty and prayer. May the poorest among men [Israel] rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
Your servants will exult and rejoice when You remember my walls;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem is the speaker.</i> to surround them with precious stones— when [will You do this]? My city is become a ruined heap forever, and my heights are laid low; and You, Adonoy, for how long?
When will You revive us, and bring us up from the abyss? O glorious One, loosen and remove the straps of our yoke, fill our storehouses with plenty, and prosper our endeavors; may Your kindness, Adonoy, be upon us.
May Your mercy be full upon us, as we seek You in distress. I stretch out my hands to You, I seek You from within [my heart], my soul thirsts after You in the night,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A metaphor for exile.</i> for I have desired You; Adonoy, put me not to shame when I call upon You.
I call upon You from the depth,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Of my heart.</i> I lift my eyes [to the heavens], I lift my hands to the heights, I let my fountain of tears spread out; O look at my virtuous deeds, blot out and remove my wickedness.

Give ear to my supplication, my Foster, my Creator, and my Pedagogue. To You are revealed and known my wishes and hopes— that my intentional sins be sunken,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In the depths of the sea.</i> and my unintentional ones be atoned.

May my meditations be regarded as pure, and my prayer correct. Hear, O God, forgive my unworthy and perverse deeds, strengthen those who praise You, and accept my words, and let the meditations of my heart be before You, my Rock and my Redeemer.

Deal charitably with Your people, Holy One [do it] for Your Name’s sake, for Your perfect ones have vanished, [the righteous] who appeased Your anger, also [the priests] who brought Your offerings; therefore, I have come now [with prayer].

Drown the sins of my youth, and let the sea turn them about;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Let them be turned to virtue through repentance.</i> exalt the righteousness of our ancestors, and let the prayers of the humble adorn You as a crown. And when You purify me as in a crucible, my accuser [Satan] will bewail, for my heart will be whole with You; therefore, I have come now [with prayer].

Gracious and Living One, be gracious to me, the sound of my cry is in my throat, answer me when You hear it. Increase Your forgiveness, inscribe me for life, let my righteousness testify for me. Give me my life as my request, and my people’s as my petition.
This is my Almighty, deliver me, and incline the scale in my favor; reveal Yourself from Your Dwelling, and grace Your storm-tossed nation; destroy my slanderer [Satan] let him not prove Your flock guilty, lest I witness misfortune— the destruction of my kin. Give me my life as my request, and my people’s as my petition.

Give me my life as my request, and my people’s as my petition.
Let my voice be as desirable as fat offerings offered in Zion; please turn to me for goodness and let me find grace [in Your eyes], for to whom shall I turn now that I am without support? I pray, forgive those who hope in You, and let them hear “I have forgiven.” Give me my life as my request, and my people’s as my petition.

Chapter 6

Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor.

Act for the sake of David and Solomon. Act for the sake of Jerusalem, city of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Zion, Dwelling Place of Your honor. Act for the sake of the desolation of Your Habitation. Act for the sake of the destruction of Your Altar. Act for the sake of the blood of Your servants that was spilled. Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Erev Rosh Hashana



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming if His Messiah in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. <b>Fortunate is the people that understand the call of the teruah, Adonoy, in the light of Your Presence they will walk. With trumpets and the sound of the shofar raise your voice before the King, Adonoy.</b> Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.

Chapter 3

<small><i>The following prayer was composed by Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac (</i>Rashi<i>).</i></small>
Adonoy, God of Hosts, Who is feared by the heavenly angels, You said, “Repent you stubborn children, come to Me with thanksgiving and praise, seek My Presence with tears and supplications.
Though the doors are closed to expressions of prayer, the gates are open to the penitent— even the windows, Your words stand firm for all time; Your ways of goodness are forever unchangeable.
Behold, we come before You like the poor and needy, the righteousness is Yours, and the iniquity is ours, we return to You with shameful faces, and at Your gates we moan like doves.
Remember us for a [good] proper life, cleanse our stains that they be pure and white, erase the sins of our youth, let them vanish like clouds; renew our days as the days of old.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Before we sinned.</i>
Remove [our] defilement and abolish [our] presumptuous sins, cleanse [us] sprinkle upon us the faithful [pure] waters. We know our wickedness, we are rebellious and as evil as thorns, our necks are as stiff as oaks.
The vineyard of our planting, is overgrown with weeds [sins] it is covered with nettles and thorns [evil] accustomed to doing evil, clinging to sun-deities, taking bribes, pursuing pay-offs.
We have quickly profaned the wedding-canopy<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai is compared to a wedding canopy.</i> since then we have been thrust backward and not forward, gone are the sacrifices of choice rams, the fragrance of the incense-offerings.
Gone are the captain(s) of fifty, the advisor(s), the man (men) of honor, the deputy [High Priest], the Annointed [High Priest], the Levites, and the Aaronites [sons of Aaron]. Behold! we stand impoverished and empty grieved in spirit, bitter as wormwood.
We remember You in our distress with an outpouring of prayers, in fear of Your judgement, we worry and groan; let righteousness spring forth for the faithful, Order the removal of our early iniquities.
Let the voice [of our prayer] that calls, put an end to those who contend with us, let it hush the accuser and silence the antagonists. Let our humble spirit, our subdued and broken hearts, be as acceptable to You as the fat of the sacrifice.
The oath You swore to the Patriarchs— fulfill unto their children, the cry of Your callers hear from heaven; prepare their hearts to fear You, may Your ear be attentive to the words of their supplication.
Return to raise Your people from destruction, let come swiftly to us Your former mercy, in their judgement, let Your favored ones be found innocent. They hope for Your lovingkindness, and depend on Your compassion.
For in Your abundant mercy we trust, and on Your righteousness, we rely, and for Your pardon, we hope, and for Your deliverance, we yearn. You are a King Who loves righteousness from of old, Who passes over the iniquities of His people, and removes the sins of those who fear Him. You made a covenant with the Patriarchs, and will keep [Your] oath with their descendants. You are He Who descended in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai, and disclosed the ways of Your goodness to Moses, Your servant. The ways of Your kindliness, You revealed to him; and You made known to him that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness, and full of beneficence, guiding the entire world with the quality of mercy. And so it is written: “And He said: ‘I will cause to pass all My goodness before you, and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy in your presence; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate.’”
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 4


Our God, and God of our fathers!
How can I open my mouth, and how can I lift my eyes, when in me there are no good deeds and in my hand there is no merit? I shout, I am like a drunkard, and like one overcome with wine. I am like a warrior without weapons:
The humble heart trembles, for gone is [the righteous one] appointed to intercede on our behalf; and who is left to open his mouth— the fool, and one who lacks perception. His transgression is concealed in him, and his iniquity is imprisoned within him, he is a sinner and full of rebelliousness, a captive of the despicable [evil inclination].
Filled with distraction is this humiliated heart of him who comes to entreat You, the straight path he has distorted, [and] he despises admonition, [for] he has become twisted and crooked. His knee is weak because of his guilt, and the filth of his sin is his obstacle; in his heart he thinks of iniquity, and his deeds cause him to stumble.
Rebuttals and excuses to offer— what can I find? I have become repulsive and polluted for I am filled with disgrace and derision. The abundance of my tears has not endured, its source has been interrupted; [even] my assembly [for prayer] is filled with iniquity and deceit, and my fast days filled with strife.
Erase our transgression, forgive our iniquity, and atone our guilt. I cry out from an aching heart, that is disgraced, shamed and humiliated: “Quiet Your wrath, calm Your rage, and annul Your anger; be pleased with [our emmissary who seeks<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the Chazzan.</i>] to make us favored and loved [in Your eyes], and confound [Satan] who digs pits for us.”
Remember the tribes of Israel! Prepare yourselves with pure hearts, with whole hearts, uphold [the Mitzvos], and bring forth your supplication, do homage in purity [of heart]. When Adonoy makes Himself accessible, seek Him with added might, He will not shame or detest the cry of the humble and crushed [heart].
A day of deliverance and a time of favor may I find in Your Presence; fit, worthy and faultless, may I be considered in Your eyes. When I stand in prayer to plead for mercy on Your children, let us hear, “I have bestowed favor on you,” “I have pardoned you”— may this be told us from Your Dwelling.
Quickly, seek the Presence of the Almighty, excise the hardness of your hearts, remove the obstacle [the evil inclination], clear the way and straighten the crooked, abandon iniquity and confess, and do not continue to harden [your hearts]. He who knows of his sin, let him repent and show regret, let him accept words of admonition, and let him plead [for forgiveness].
Listen O Master to my supplication, give ear to my prayer, be pleased with my cry, be appeased and conciliated and accept my prayer; I call You out of distress, be near to me and come deliver me, quickly, help me, my Master, my deliverer.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.

Chapter 5


Our God, and God of our fathers!
We beseech You, arouse Your old love, with which You loved [Israel], the uncountable congregation, with every term of love, brotherhood and friendship, You designated them; for the sake of my brethren and companions, let me speak, I beseech You.
When You set foot on Mount [Sinai] to delight us with Your ancient treasure,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah which existed even before Creation.</i> You likened us to a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, [calling us] “My son”; and she [Israel] then said: “He is my brother, my King, and my Master.”
You caused them [Israel] to inherit a delightful heritage, the sweet portion;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Land of Israel.</i> Your glory [Shechinah] You caused to frequent between the images of the Cherubim; and now they [Israel] have been driven away by strangers and evil doers. In a land that is not theirs, Your brethren now sojourn.
Remember, do not forget, be not silent and do not rest, Almighty, for Edom and Ishmael wanted to cut me off, Gracious One, You know of all these afflictions, so speak Your brethren, Israel.
Plunderers beset me and emptied me, to exchange the clean for the unclean,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To renounce Judaism.</i> oppressors tried to force me, behold, every day how Your servants are beaten and whipped; the voice of Your brother’s blood cries out.
They have dug a pit to trap me; my soul faints and yearns to seek Your help, knock at my door and be my deliverance, [and say] “I seek my brothers.”
From the Day of Rosh Hashana<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Metsudah T’hillim page 165 note 4.</i> when You sit on Your glorious throne and look down to examine simultaneously the hearts of those who rebel against You and the hearts of those who serve You, exact with force the debt from all who rebel against You; but whatever Your brother owes You, let Your hand release.
When the Books [of Life and Death] are read for the creatures of Your world, decreeing life or the opposite [of life] to the rich and the poor; Most High grant favor and kindness in Your Sanctuary [of judgement]. Be surety for Your servant for good, so that Your brother may live with You.
Turn to me and be gracious to me, and set me on high, cause those who provoke You to perish in wretchedness and in poverty; but when You apportion the sustenance giving each his yearly provision, do not shut Your hand from Your needy brother.
I rise before dawn and cry to You my Creator. Forward Your kindness and forgive my transgression and treachery. Let Your mercy be extended to me as one who comforts me in my mourning. O that You were like a brother to me.
Consider the supplication of Your poor ones and [hear their] cry, satiated with troubles are their souls and spirit; cast into the depths of the sea all their sins; we beseech You, forgive now, the transgression of Your brothers, and their sins.
I rejoice at the word of Your promise, You drew our hearts [to You] through Your messengers [the prophets]; when will You reveal Your mighty arm? Go now and see to the peace [welfare] of Your brothers.
You were always the hope of Israel and the sword of their pride,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Israel took pride that God fought their battles.</i> living God, lift up their stature now, strengthen their arm and dwell among them; and Your brothers, remember them for peace and their families too.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Chapter 6


Our God, and God of our fathers!
My eye pours out tears to God when I cry to You, say, “I am here;” give ear to my words when I pray, Answer me God, answer me.
When You weigh my actions on the scale, [You will see] that in Your commandments, my share and desire is insignificant, and if You reward me according to my work I am afraid, for I am bare [of good deeds].
Banish and consume, sin and rebellion uncover the flask of healing, [heal my soul] let [only] my righteousness testify before my Creator, tomorrow [Rosh Hashana] when You come to decide my recompense.
Wash away the stain and whiten the redness [of sin]. Consider that their origin is dust, repay them not according to their deeds for great is the wickedness of man.
The sinful soul, how can it be atoned? Riches are of no avail, nor great ransom for You have set as witness [Satan] who is quick to testify to our sins, committed inside and outside.
How can one deny [his] guilt when his own hand lists his perverse deeds and all his activities, and how can he say: “Who knows the count [of my misdeeds]?” When the plague is engraved on the wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When his sins are obvious.</i>
The pure [angels] who accompany you in every region, who are alert to guard you wherever you go; even [the soul] that lies within man testifies against rich and poor alike when it stands before the King.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Each evening the soul returns to Heaven and reports man’s activities.</i>
I tremble, for nothing is hidden from Him, Who relates to man his every word, and even his thoughts as he lies on his bed. He must give an accounting to His Creator.
Before your feet stumble [before death] [when your] pledge [the soul is returned] cleanse yourself from all iniquity, because you will not be saved by all the wealth you leave behind, when the Ruler says, “Come, give account.”
You appointed four periods<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Mesechet Rosh Hashana 16a.</i> and set them to judge the remnant of Your inheritance, and if they have trespassed against You regard the covenant [with the Patriarchs] and do not stand in the crossway to cut them off.
For on the day of Rosh Hashana<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Metsudah T’hillim page 165 note 4.</i> every man’s fate comes before his Creator, be he poor or rich, he is judged, some go up and some go down.
Appoint a just advocate for Your people, when all mankind come to be counted with Your rod, like a flock of sheep passing by the hand of one who counts them.
Let Your people’s judgement be first.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Before the Almighty is angered by the other nations.</i> Lift their souls from destruction, assure them of goodness, and judge each nation by itself, let there not be an inter-mixture.
Illustrious God, who can be associated with You? Ordinarily no one uses a broken vessel, but You do not despise a humble and broken heart; is anything too miraculous for Adonoy?
Clear away the stumbling block<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Evil Inclination.</i> that the path may become smooth, “Depart you unclean one!” call out to the concealed fool, for the enemy cares not of our hurt; come let us deal wisely with him, lest he become too mighty.
Man serves two masters during the years of his life, doing the will of his Creator or serving his [evil] inclination; but well for him who clings to his Creator all of his [life] time, then he is a servant free from his master.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Evil Inclination.</i>
He who prepares his meal before evening, he who works in this [world] will be prepared for the future [world]; but he who waits for the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">When death approaches.</i> what gain will he have?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This is a paraphrase of the saying, “He who prepares before the Sabbath, will have what to eat on the Sabbath.”</i> That which is crooked cannot be made straight.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Koheles 1:15.</i>
Therefore, we hasten to pray even before the Day of Judgement, listen to our prayer; fasting and whole-hearted repentance will turn away Your wrath, but not [like the dog] which returns to his vomit to sin again and repent, for no opportunity will be given him to repent.
Rise you who sleep in the cave of Machpelah,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Patriarchs.</i> and help me, I am disgraced, and I have no good deeds, cry out and pray to God, with me, and from the strength [of your deeds] offer a gratuity on my behalf.
Arouse Your mercy to strengthen those that are powerless, Exalted One, [do it] for they were forgotten these many years, open the gates of tears for [Your] beautiful plants [Israel], who come weeping and supplicating [to You].
Almighty One, because of our rebellion, we are considered strangers, but now that we return to You have mercy on us as a father on his sons; remember that You called us children, and You are the one Father of us all, why diminish the Name of our Father? I have no offering to present to You, in exchange accept my prayer and plea, please accept the present that goes before me, and let all these people know that You are Adonoy.
You made known and ordained repentance even before creation,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">God knew that the world could not exist without repentance.</i> God considered it a benefit [to man], and so we hasten to return to You; cause us to return to You Adonoy and we shall return.
Your loved ones cry out, they beseech You with great murmuring, let their voice be heard in His Dwelling, from on high; may His mercy be aroused in the merit of the three Patriarchs, may Almighty God grant you mercy.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Chapter 7


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Master! when You appoint a time to judge us rightly with Your might, I stand trembling to see Your Presence, to exalt You, for I do not depend on my deeds, but only on Your mercy. Adonoy! Do it for the sake of Your Name.
The faithful ones have been cut off— the mighty, with power to intercede, [gone] also are those who made fences and stood in the breach<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Defending the integrity of Yiddishkeit.</i> who forcefully brought their petition before Him Who dwells in the high heavens. The pious man has perished from the earth.
Behold, I am unworthy, and what can I answer with my mouth? Behold, I am young [insignificant] without good deeds in my hand; how, then, can I hope when I am so full of fault? Let the words of my mouth be acceptable.
I tremble and I am afraid to express my wishes; I fear my wickedness and my rebellious disobedience; Gracious One, have mercy on me as I confess my sins and forsake them. Hear the voice of my supplication, when I cry out to You.
I have erred but behold I repent and confess [in order] to do Your will; You Who are pure of eyes, consider me as perfect in Your Presence; God, deal with me more leniently than to the letter of Your law. And let me know You [so] that I might find favor in Your eyes.
May Your power be magnified and be adorned with my prayer, as with the prayer of a [wise] old man, who is fluent in prayer and of blameless character. My heart is crushed, humbled and grieved. Look from the heavens and behold.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Chapter 8


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Master, if You judge scrupulously, examining actions meticulously, no man will be found righteous before You. You find fault with the hosts of Heaven, faulting even Your angels— certainly one<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Man.</i> who drinks wrong like water.
Neither merit nor justice are in us, we are totally sinful. Good One, enter not into judgement with us. Let Your innards churn for us, in Your abundant mercy turn to us, Not to do as our evil deeds deserve.
Our willful acts are too many to count. There are no sweet savored offerings to provide pardon for our iniquities. On our righteousness we do not rely; we are sullied with iniquity and sin. To find charity we come in prayer.
Do not measure our ways strictly; maggots and worms are our end, vanity and emptiness our [lives] years. Repent the evil, change Your mind. That is Your way, merciful one; with Your great mercies, have mercy on us.
Your ways You instructed the humble one<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Moses is referred to as the humble one.</i> to teach, You informed him of the thirteen in sequence, assured him they are never ineffective. Our supplication we have arranged accordingly before You. Hear the cries of Your supplicants and do not send us away empty-handed from Your Presence.

Chapter 9


Master, when You call on man each morning [for judgment] do not press justice to its limits. If You combine body and soul [in judgment] they would be thrust down and be unable to rise.
Can man be innocent in judgement? Is he possessed of deeds to justify him? His birth stream is from a fetid drop, his enemy is hidden within him from the time of his birth.
Lurking within him as a snare to his feet, he entices him daily, to make him fall into the abyss [of sin]; there is no power or might in the body to stand firm and resist him.
From the day he attains perception, he puts his life in his hand to gain his bread, all his days are filled with vexation and grief; until he returns to his dust he is not at rest.
Regard O Master his sorrowful spirit, look at his broken heart, You are near to these who are afar, You desire the repentance of the wicked.
Mighty One! let Yourself be found by those who seek You, say: “Here I am,” to those who petition You let the tiding: “I have pardoned”— be told to those who call in Your Name, make righteous in judgment the people who proclaim Your Unity.
Muzzle the foul one [Satan] that he may not condemn us, rebuke the accuser that he not accuse us, stand up for us an upright advocate; “I have found atonement,” let the penitent hear.
We have cast our burden upon You we beseech You to sustain us, be pleased with our prayer our request and desire fulfill with compassion. In You we place our trust, let Your mercy come swiftly toward us; Strong and Mighty One, we have not forgotten Your Name, we beseech You, never forget us.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Chapter 10


Master, when You judge man who is a worm, remember in Your anger to be gracious and compassionate with us, when You sit in judgment to rebuke the guilty, clear and justify the erring and simple.
Grant kindness and goodness to the guilty, do not press judgment to its limits. [When] those who are poor in good deeds and destitute in conduct, call upon You, let them find You.
We stand before You with great guilt, we are ashamed to mouth a reply [excuse]; can man be justified before God? In the Presence of His Maker, can man be found pure [innocent]?
Maliciousness lurks within him, deceit is hidden within him, he is full of iniquity and great transgression, account and reckoning before the Supreme King of Kings, he will have to give at his end.
His sins are engraven by his own hand, his wickedness will testify against him, the beams of his house will reveal and declare his deeds, the stone from the wall will scream and call out.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Mesechet Taanis 11a; Chagigah 16a.</i>
The judged will hide his face in shame, he will be considered as naught when he stands before Your Presence; we beseech You, be pleased with the work of our hands, behold our broken hearts, and preserve us from destruction.
Let Your servants find favor this day, declare them guiltless, they desire Your nearness as of old; like snow and wool whiten the sins of the rose [Israel], save them from all evil in this year.

The righteousness of Your virtues are delightful, the world’s inhabitants learned justice as they stand to be judged by You.
Your seal [of justice] is pure and clean, according to man’s acts [his fate] is sealed. [Thus], the judgments of God are true.

The Temple [has become] stones of the field. Hurry to establish its foundation; Zion will be redeemed through justice. Avenge Me from my enemies Who have scattered me. Lop off the horns of those who have scattered me and Your judgment [of my enemies] will save me.

He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!

Chapter 15


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Inscribe us for long life and let us not be uprooted. As You sit upon Your throne examining all actions in Your judgment, view only the good and do not examine the evil; for with You is the source of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">You dispense life.</i>
You dispense life when You are willing while Your period of anger is fleeting. Do not punish until eternity your weary inheritance (Israel). Let me hear the clarion, “I forgive!” as You forgive my sins, and [also let me hear] “I’ve granted you today the gift of life!”
Grant us life and redeem us from ruin. Wrap me with the kindness of Abraham<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham, the patriarch, is sometimes referred to as “Ezrach,” e.g. Ayson Haezrachi.</i> and with the truth that was rooted in Jacob, he planted it and it flourished [in Israel]. Distance our sins from us as west is distant from east. Make known to us the truth path of life.
Make known to us Your living Word<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah gives life to those who uphold it.</i> Almighty, powerful and [wise] Counselor— [motivate us] to cling to Your Torah; His advice is for our own benefit. Make the good inclination triumph over the evil inclination and shatter it in order that we preserve the way of the Tree of Life.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah.</i>
The Torah sustains those who hold it. It is a cure and antidote for sickness. The supporters of Torah are also fortunate to bask in the expanding radiance of Torah. Those who cling to the way of Torah, have an added quality to their lives over all other living flesh.
Support us with life and peace that we may serve You in reverence. We shall be glad and rejoice in You when the wicked are destroyed. May the three hundred ten worlds<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Which are reserved for the righteous.</i> be our portion and grant us the reverence of God [which leads] to wealth, honor, and life.
He granted us a fortunate portion in life, He Who provides advice and thoughts, He Who is a refuge to us, and a helper during times of travail. “Return to me and I shall return to you,” He says as He opens His mouth, “Because he who finds Me, discovers life.”
Grant me the gift of undeserved life, Almighty, Who knows our thoughts. Forgive the iniquities that are engraved upon tablets, and Your enemies will be cloaked in shame as You punish them in rebuke. They will not repent or comprehend the [true] paths of life.
Bestow good life to Your servants. Redeem their souls from Gehenom just as You granted King David his request.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalms 21, 5.</i> Not so, for the wicked who rejected You, send the angel of death unto them in order that they descend to their graves.
Those of us who are alive can thank You, but not those who are severed from life. A father informs his children of Your praises in his conversation. And we bless You, God, Your praise we extoll, that we may merit to see God’s goodness upon us in the land of life.
Let us hear today: “That you all will live” with the proper allotment of sustenance. Purify them from their sins and don’t turn them away empty-handed. Those decreed for death are in Your hands Adonoy, sustain them for life, and even those destined for death because of old age, grant them a portion amongst the living.
Life is an attribute for the discerning person because through the life of Torah he can distant himself from Gehinom. Therefore, please God, redeem my soul from a broken body and let it live forever and for long life; For the mitzvah is a lamp and the Torah is light and the way to achieve life.
Erase from the book of life Gival and Moav who are now exalted though they bow down to a block of wood and proclaim it to be a god. Do not grant kindness to the wicked who afflict us; let them be sentenced for destruction because they disgrace Israel who are the legions of the eternal God.
You swore to give life to Your only son (Isaac), the gates of his enemies was to be the inheritance of his descendants through You they would fall in his hands. Despite Your anger, You will again grant us mercy and, therefore, I thank You, for Your kindness is greater than life.
[Instruct us in the path of true life] in order that we be satiated with joy when we see Your wondrous face.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the Divine Presence, (Shechinah).</i> Renew our days like in times of old and people will see our graciousness. Return and have mercy upon us, Adonoy, God of Hosts because from You emanates life.
Let life on earth be decreed for Your people from the heavens and cast into the depths of the sea all of our sins and iniquities. Create for us a pure heart and grant us the kindnesses of many days and years of life.
Grant life to the righteous one and to the wicked dispense fear. When on Rosh Hashana You decree wars, or peace or fears and trembling, a year of plenty or famine, terror, life, or death, a year of blessing or curse, choose for us the portion of life.
A life of righteousness and dignity grant her<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> who is beautiful and amenable, who does kindness with others, privately, without causing the recipient shame. Adonoy make the righteous one secure and fulfill his needs. He who pursues righteousness and kindness will himself find life.
Grant us the inheritance of eternal life (Torah) given with Divine wisdom and advice. Let gladness and rejoicing be heard from the streets of Jerusalem; and remove iniquity from us and garb us with fresh clothing (Torah). I will then go before God in the lands of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i>
See fit, God, to grant life to Your people who are Your treasure, let them return to serve you as previously.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the days of the Holy Temple.</i> You do not desire the death of the sinner but rather that he repent. A broken and pained heart is considered precious before You. Therefore say to them that they are holy include them among those inscribed for life.
When [David] requested life from You, You granted it to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When Moshiach Ben David sees that Moshiach Ben Yosef is killed he will ask God for life, and God will grant him that request because of King David’s prayer. See Succah 52.</i> Grant him life now as You did then. His glory will be great in Your salvation [just as the glory of Israel was great] as they ascended to Jerusalem at festivals. Look from the dwelling place of Your holiness from the heavens [to save us]. On that day spring water will flow from Jerusalem.
You desire to grant life and to forgive their sins. Let it be heard: “And My spirit, I will place among you” saying that I found atonement [for you]. I wish to accept you because you truly cling to Adonoy, Your God, Who lives eternally.
Almighty, with life support Your dove (Israel) who follows You to cling to Your laws. Bring us to Mount Zion and restore the kingship because from there Adonoy commands (and sends forth) the blessing of life.
We await life from Him and hope for His deliverance. At this time Adonoy will expand our territory enabling us to increase and multiply. From the destruction of the two temples He will resurrect us and build the third Temple, and all those who are before You today shall remain amongst the living.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.

Chapter 16


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Thirteen Divine attributes which were pronounced with compassion; by virtue of every fitting attribute, I beseech the Presence of my King with supplication, to search for the merit [of Israel] who were named and called the Rose. Save them from all evil in this year.
If their guilt be so great as to reach the heavens and their stars, [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute, I plead for mercy for them, to annul for them what is written:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 32:26.</i> “I said I will scatter them etc.” Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 115:2.</i>
If their iniquities are grievous and too many to count, [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute cast them away, Adonoy, and conceal them; let our vigorous words of supplication annul that which is written: “I will hide [my face from them].”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 32:20.</i> Why, Adonoy, do You stand far off, hiding Yourself in times of trouble?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 10:1.</i>
If they have acted perversely in the Presence of their King, with a brazen face; [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute, I offer supplication with a loud voice, [and say to] my soul: “Pour out your heart as water”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 2:19.</i> in the presence of Him “Who is pure white and ruddy.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 5:10.</i> “Why, God, have You cast us off forever.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 74:1.</i>
If willful sins have misled the foolish and haughty heart; [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute, save them, Adonoy, from crushing wounds, hasten and come, and lift up the strong voice [of redemption] “Why do I go mourning under oppression.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 42:10.</i>
If they have slandered in words and thoughts against You, [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute, remember the love of those who praise You and let Your compassion be moved towards the remnant of Your people. “Why should Your anger burn against Your people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 32:11.</i>
If they harden their ear [from hearing] and pervert their way, [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute, I offer silent prayer for my people, and my soul—pour out your heart in the Presence of your Possessor and Rock. “Why have You broken down her fences, so that all wayfarers pluck her fruit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 80:13.</i>
If they have rebelled with great transgression against the Rock, my King, my Holy One; [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute, my soul—seek pleasantness for them; before the Awesome, Most High, and Holy One, address prayerful supplication. Why, Adonoy, do You cast off my soul?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 88:15.</i>
If they were stubborn like a heifer from their many days and years [of exile]; [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute, I will lift my eyes to the heavens, and open my mouth in behalf of my people, who are the fewest among peoples. “Why do You forget us forever, [and] forsake us for the length of days?”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 5:20.</i>
If our transgressions are enormous and overwhelming as a mountain, by virtue of every fitting attribute [I pray], with a soft [birdlike] voice for wonders. On Your refined [faithful] word,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That our prayers do not go unanswered.</i> [I rely] to plead for this people. “Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? Draw it from Your bosom to consume [evil].”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 74:11.</i>
If they have perverted their actions willfully and wickedly, [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute, let Your heart be moved to deliver them; “Arise cry out aloud in the night”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 2:19.</i> to the Almighty, the Deliverer. “Why should You be like a man confused, like a mighty man that cannot save.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 14:9.</i>
If in truth, all have repented with their heart and soul to appease You, [then] by virtue of every fitting attribute, consent to pardon them; and do it O Master for Your sake, forgive and pardon Your congregation. “Return to us for the sake of Your servants,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Patriarchs.</i> the tribes of Your heritage.”
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Chapter 18


[You are] the Judge of all the earth, and You arraign her in judgment, we beseech You, life and kindness bestow on an afflicted people. Accept their morning prayer as a substitute for the burnt offering— as the burnt offering of the morning which was a continual burnt offering.
You are wrapped in a cloak of righteousness, You alone have the ability [to forgive], if we have no [good] deeds, recall the virtues of the [Patriarchs] who sleep in Hebron, and may their merits ascend as a memorial before Adonoy always. As the burnt offering of the morning which was a continual burnt offering.
You are inclined towards kindness to favor man with life. Incline Your nation toward kindness be benevolent with him, that he may live, inscribe him with the sign of life, and let it be on his forehead always. As the burnt offering of the morning which was a continual burnt offering.
Do good, as You see fit, to Zion, My holy city. Grant power and fame in Your House to my holy ones [the pious and righteous], and an illuminated lamp for the son of Yishai; that a light be kept burning always. As the burnt offering of the morning which was a continual burnt offering.
Be strong and let your hearts take courage my people, whose strength is in the Almighty; and when You keep His testimonies, He, too, will in equal measure atone Your sins, and will remember mercy in His anger. Seek Adonoy and His strength, seek His Presence always. As the burnt offering of the morning which was a continual burnt offering.

Chapter 19

<small><i>The following prayer was composed by Rabbi Mordechai.</i></small>
Our God, and God of our fathers!
My God Who is my savior and my strong rock my Protector and my Shield my Salvation<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. the horn of my salvation. He fights against my enemies as an ox who gores with its horn as it attacks.</i> and my Assurance, during my times of trial and pain. I wake up early to pray unto You, O Great King, and unto You, Adonoy I cry in the morning.
In the morning remember to have mercy in the merit of Abraham’s kindness, the first patriarch of “the strong ones,” the one whom You chose and who trusted in You, the first of all believers. Remember his covenant with You and deliver me from my sins. Adonoy, listen this morning to my voice, to my prayer of the morning.
In the morning You spoke with him<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham.</i> and tested him in order to reward him and You made a covenant with him to serve as a protector for him. You loved him and wanted him and accepted him like the incense that was brought each morning.
When the morning star shone, when You wished to show his great rightousness, You tested him a tenth time and said to him: Take your son, and do not hesitate, to one of the mountains and bring him there as a burnt offering just as the sheep that you bring as a sacrifice in the morning.
In the morning he singularized Your Name and harkened to Your voice and manifested his love while rejoicing whole-heartedly to fulfill Your command. His love made him transcend normalcy by rising with joy. And Abraham rose early in the morning.
In the morning both readied their hearts to do Your will, O awesome One. The son took the wood and the father took the knife to slaughter without intending to redeem him. They were summoned and went with whole hearts and saw Your Divine honor on the third day in the morning.
In the morning he girded himself as a warrior girds his loins. He first bound his son then took a knife to slaughter him, without thinking of him as a human being and said: “Today I will bring my offering and sprinkle the blood of my sacrifice.” It will not remain until the morning.
In the morning Your mercy was aroused on the only son and that mercy shone upon him. An angel of Adonoy called to him and said not to harm the lad because in Isaac will Your seed be perpetuated, [and the merit of this event] will be remembered for all generations, it will remain as a safe-keeping for you until the morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Until the redemption which is analogous to morning.</i>
In the morning his<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac’s.</i> propriety and righteousness will benefit the people who pray to You and his ashes will always be seen before You to cleanse them from their sins. Grant them their lives which is their request, because it is You Whom they desire. In the evening they come to You in prayer and also in the morning.
Harken to their voices in the morning and atone their iniquities. Consider the order of their prayers like the order of the sacrifices. They come with the merits of the righteousness of their ancestors. And also bring to Him their contributions of prayer every morning.
In the morning turn to us and have mercy and let Your mercy be aroused upon us. Cast to the depths of the sea all our sins and let them not be remembered. Lord, our Rock, pass our sins from before You and let them not remain before You until the morning.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.

Chapter 20


Remember the covenant of Abraham and the binding of Isaac, and return the captives of the tents of Jacob and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
We lost the good land all too soon, and the prophesied exile has lasted very long; in Israel, they no longer live in open villages,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">They must live in fortified cities for fear of enemy attack.</i> our plenty has been turned into famine. Turn with compassion to the remnant of Israel, and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
Exile after exile, has all of Judah been exiled, grief and destruction is her lot each day, and there is none to inquire or plead for her. Return the captives of the tents of Jacob and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
The city of holiness and its environs had become disgraced and plundered; all its treasures are buried and hidden, and nothing remains except this Torah. Turn with compassion to the remnant of Israel, and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
Mighty Redeemer, for Your sake redeem us, see how helpless we are, look, our pious men are gone, and we have none to intercede for us. Return the captives of the tents of Jacob and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
The covenant with the Patriarchs the Matriarchs and the [twelve] tribes, Your oft-repeated mercy and kindness— remember [now] O God to those who are stricken and tortured, and for Your sake [they are ready] to be killed all the day. Turn with compassion to the remnant of Israel, and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
You Who avenges [innocent] blood, judge our cause, repay [punish] sevenfold into the bosom of those who torment us; we have been sold for naught, [therefore] redeem us without [ransom] money, raise up Your ruined, Holy Temple, before our [very] eyes, and return the captives of the tents of Jacob and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake the covenant with [their] ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations; to be their God, I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”
<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.

We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.

Chapter 22

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rav Sadyah Gaon 892–942</i></small>
We have forgotten Your goodness, and been mindless of Your great kindnesses; we have rebelled against Your word, and have turned away from Your laws. We have indulged in the vanities of this world, and to men of arrogance and deceit we have turned. We have been very foolish, we have loved evil more than good, and falsehood rather than speaking righteousness, we have sought impurity rather than purity, and the loathsome rather than the clean; we have exchanged the permanent [world] for the transitory. Day by day we rise early to sin, until our iniquities have mounted above our heads, and are more numerous than our hairs, and more powerful than the words of our mouth, and exceeded the steps of our feet, and surpassed the breathing of our nostrils. We have sunk into muddy depths, and there is no foothold; we have come into deep waters, and a whirlpool has swept us away.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 69:3.</i> Not You Adonoy, our God, have we harmed, but [only] ourselves, not You have we irritated but [only] ourselves; for when man sins, what effect has it on You? If his transgressions are numerous, what does it do to You? But woe to the sons of man who sin against You, and woe to their souls, for they bring evil upon themselves. Our God, we are too ashamed and disgraced, to lift our faces to You, our God;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ezra 9:6.</i> for we are like a repulsive vessel, thus are we disgraced in our own eyes. As a man immersed in a [muddy] ditch and soils his clothing;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Job 9:31.</i> and as we were conceived in iniquity, so the shame of our faces have covered us.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 44:16.</i>
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
And now Adonoy, our God, after we have repented, we regret [our sins], and after realizing [our guilt], we struck ourselves on the thigh. We are ashamed, even disgraced, for we also bear the shame of our youth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 31:18.</i> Because of this we take our flesh in our teeth,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">We bite ourselves.</i> and put our life in our hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Job 13:14.</i> How shall we approach You, Adonoy, our God, and how shall we bow unto You, exalted God?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Micah 6:6.</i> How will You be reconciled to us and atone all our sins, which have passed by and gone like water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 14:14.</i> If through repentance and confession You will be reconciled to us, behold we repent and confess before You Adonoy, our God: “We have sinned and transgressed, and that which is straight, we distorted, and it has not profited us.” And if through prayer and supplication You will forgive us, behold we offer our supplication before You; “As the eyes of servants [look] toward the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden [look] toward the hand of her mistress; so our eyes are lifted to You.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 123:2.</i> And if through weeping and wailing You will pardon us, behold, our soul weeps in secret because of our sins, and our spirit groans within us over the multitude of our transgressions. And if through a broken spirit, You will atone us, behold our heart is broken within us, and our spirit is crushed by the troubles and travails which have passed over us, until there is nothing left whole in our flesh. Were it not for Your mercy and kindness, we would have perished because of our iniquities.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.

We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.

Chapter 24

Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”



Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.

Answer us, Father of orphans, answer us. Answer us, [Protective] Judge of widows, answer us.

Merciful One, answer us; Merciful One, have pity; Merciful One, redeem, Merciful One, save, Merciful One, have compassion on us, now, speedily, and very soon.
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.

Receive our prayer, accept our supplication in place of the fragrance of the continual morning offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">After the destruction of the Temple, prayers replaced the daily offerings.

From a golden vessel it was given to drink,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This was done to facilitate the skinning which was done later.</i> and was examined again by torchlight. The kohain who won the privilege of offering the daily sacrifice— and who allotted twelve of his brethren [the privilege of assisting him]—brought the lamb to the slaughter house.
He delayed the slaughtering until the large gate was opened. He maneuvered his hand, up to his elbow, into the opening of the gate [to open one lock] two keys were needed for opening the gate.
When the door turned on its hinges, it would give out a creaking sound that was heard in the plain of Jericho. The diligent [kohanim] carefully bound [the lamb], binding the fore and hind legs as Isaac was bound on Mount Moriah.
The second ring merited that it be used for slaughtering,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This ring was used to hold the head of the lamb when it was slaughtered.</i> both the morning and afternoon sacrifices were performed facing the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the morning it was offered in the northwest corner and in the evening in the northeast so as to face the sun.</i> The blood was sprinkled twice against the four sides of the Altar— once on the northeast corner and once on the southwest corner.
The remaining blood was poured out at the southern base of the Altar; and the lamb had to be skinned, and totally consumed by fire as an offering to the Most High. The operation of the dissection [of the lamb] is too lengthy to describe, silence is better than to weary the congregation.
Nine kohanim performed the offering joined by three others who were privileged to perform the pan-offering, the fine flour offering and the wine libation. Then, on the western side of the ramp, the pieces were salted; and then they went into the Stone Chamber to read the [morning] Sh’ma.
At the signal they recited one blessing;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">After receiving a signal from the presiding kohain, they recited the blessing of “<span>אַהֲבָה רַבָּה</span>,” the blessing before the Sh’ma.</i> they also recited the “Ten Commandments,” and an additional blessing on the Sabbath. They recited <i>True and firm</i> and the <i>Avodah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The seventeenth blessing of the Amidah.</i> and the “Priestly Blessing” [in which] they blessed the people a benificent blessing
New kohanim were selected by lot for the privilege of offering the incense, and he who was chosen once, could not repeat because it enriched the one who performed it. At the fourth lot, all kohanim participated, for the privilege of carrying the pieces to the square [Altar].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Altar was a square.</i>
Then they sounded the “Magrephah” which produced many sounds,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Magrephah had ten holes each of which was capable of producing ten different sounds. See Mesechet Arachin 10b.</i> and its sound was heard in Jericho.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Jericho was known as the city of psalms.</i> Levites and kohanim were trained at its sound to be ready for song and worshipful kneeling.
They quickly ran up the steps of the Vestibule, the kohanim who had to remove the ashes from the inner Altar took the basket of ashes and withdrew. Another cleaned the “Menorah”; rekindled the extinguished lamps, and took the vessel with the Menorah’s ashes and hurriedly went on his way.

Whenever the Kohain Gadol desired he could take part in the sacrificial order; the Vice Kohain Gadol would be at his right as they walked up the ramp [to the Altar].
The other kohanim came near him and handed him the pieces upon which he laid his hands and threw them into the fire. And then into the special openings he poured the [wine] libations. The Vice Kohain Gadol stood and waved a cloth.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This was a signal that the libations were completed.</i>
The trumpeteers<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">These were kohanim.</i> came and stood next to Ben Arza<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A member of the only family who knew how to make these sounds.</i> who with his thumb and middle finger caused the <i>tsaltsal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>tsaltsal</i> was a musical instrument that could be heard at a distance.</i> to be heard. When the Levites heard the sound, they chanted songs of praise; at the conclusion of each psalm, they sounded trumpets and prostrated themselves.
This was the order of the daily service in the House of our God— may it be speedily restored. May the daily morning offering be fulfilled through our recounting of it, and serve as atonement for Jeshurun [Israel].
The same order of the morning sacrifice, and for the meal and wine offerings, was used for the evening sacrifice. Eleven kohanim were privileged to offer it,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Two more than the morning sacrifice.</i> two of whom held the two wooden logs.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Which were used to maintain the fires on the Altar.</i>
The lamb offerings subdued and washed away iniquities; and the innocence of a year old child was brought upon the treasured [people]. These sacrifices were like a mighty advocate making it possible for righteousness to abide in the city of our God, may God [soon] restore it.
Be not silent [you Angels] appointed as guardians [of Jerusalem] say: “And You shall rise and be merciful.” May the Jerusalem built in heaven be established and be renowned on earth.
And may the great angel [Michael] rise to plead for his people that evil be removed from them. May their cry<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Their cry of supplication.</i> adorn You as a crown, and ascend the heavenly Altar as a burnt-offering.

Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy.

Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted.

May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Fast of Gedaliah



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.

Chapter 3


Even before the clouds were stretched above, and the soil was joined together on earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Before God created heaven and earth.</i> in Your Presence seven things were [already] gathered: the Torah; the Divine Throne; and [Repentance] the remedy for rebellious children.
The beauty of Paradise; and the flames of Hell; and a Place of atonement [the Altar] by virtue of the offerings [brought thereon]; and the glorious name of the Moshiach which has been desecrated through our sins. All these were created two thousand years before the creation of the inhabited earth.
They are arranged above the firmament, appearing with sparkling lustre, firmly rooted before Him Who dwells over the Cherubim. His throne was placed in the firmament, standing firmly— the seat of the King Whose awe is upon all that surround Him.
From His right hand [He gave us the Torah] a fiery law engraved in writing, which was set on His knees with loving caress. Situated on the south, was the Garden of Eden, on the north was the blazing hell.
Facing east was Jerusalem built with hewn stones, concealing within it the Almighty’s Sanctuary on earth; set in its center was the Altar, that atoned the guilty, it lay on the hewn, foundation stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">From which God shaped the world.</i>
The name of Yinon [Moshiach] was engraved on it, also the ineffable four-letter Name was etched in letters. There in the center before Him Who blesses His people with rain repentance is joined [with the other six objects], it is the remedy for the sick and grieved.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Because of their sins and transgressions.</i>
It is ready to cleanse the filth, and to provide clean garments, and to pour good [fragrant] oil on the heads of the penitent. Therefore, we come before You, young and old, [pleading with You] to cleanse us from the stench [of sin], and cast away the record of our iniquity.
With prayer, they approach You Your rebellious children; they seek You every day with words of prayer. Let our words be considered as the burning of sacrificial blood and fat, and accept the murmuring of our lips as the sacrificial pieces of bullocks and lambs. Cause our sins to sink into the earth. there where water drips.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Causing the earth to be soft and absorbent.</i> Bring us near to You, under the wings of Your abundant mercy.
For in Your abundant mercy we trust, and on Your righteousness, we rely, and for Your pardon, we hope, and for Your deliverance, we yearn. You are a King Who loves righteousness from of old, Who passes over the iniquities of His people, and removes the sins of those who fear Him. You made a covenant with the Patriarchs, and will keep [Your] oath with their descendants. You are He Who descended in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai, and disclosed the ways of Your goodness to Moses, Your servant. The ways of Your kindliness, You revealed to him; and You made known to him that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness, and full of beneficence, guiding the entire world with the quality of mercy. And so it is written: “And He said: ‘I will cause to pass all My goodness before you, and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy in your presence; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate.’”
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 4


While Adonoy may be found,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Especially during the Ten Days of Penitence.</i> I rise early to seek Him; to entreat Him to atone [my] iniquities, for I am red [with sin] as scarlet. My heart is confused and benumbed, and as one asleep, I drowse. I have become almost like Sodom, and to Gomorrah am I likened.
I resemble a faithless wife, and a shameless adultress; I have become like a polluted garment, like a garment stained with blood. I lack a mediator, and one that knows how to pray [for me]. Look Adonoy! and see, for I have become repulsive.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 1:11.</i>
[Israel] the honored one has become repulsive in the hands of those who besmirch her; she has been sold for naught forever, and there is none to redeem her. That which was firm and upraised<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy Temple.</i> has sunken and the Ariel [the Altar] has been destroyed; cast down from heaven to the earth, is the glory of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 2:1.</i>
Israel is a prey to robbers and vandals— how long will this continue? Numerous as locusts are my pursuers and mighty are my destroyers; when I take to heart, my ruin, my destruction and my devastation, my soul prefers [to die from] strangulation, and death rather than to dwell in my bones.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">My soul prefers death rather than dwell within me.</i>
Because my bones are crushed and pierced by those who provoke and blaspheme You, I said, “I cannot bear Your anger and Your wrath.” May it be in Your heart to redeem the life of Your beloved ones, for Your Name is called on Your city and on Your people.
Your people, scattered and dispersed among every nation, remember You in their adversity and fear You in deed and thought. Drown their deliberate sins, and forgive and heal their negligence. My Master, hear our voice, let Your ears be attentive [to our prayer].
Let Your ears be attentive to the outpouring of our pleading, let the praise of our lips be acceptable as the sweet savor of our sacrifices. We seek You, our Shield, and in You we place our trust, for we are called by Your Name, do not abandon us.
You have abandoned us, O Master, these many years—why? We have become as astonishment, an example, a byword, a scorn, a shame and disgrace.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Among the nations of the world who persecute us.</i> Speedily fulfill the promise that You made to the desolate [land]: “I, Adonoy, build the ruins, and plant that which was desolate.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 36:36.</i>
The desolate land, in Your great mercy, rebuild it, and establish it firmly; hear, O God, her supplication, for the time to favor her is come. Strengthen those who praise You, shield them in the shadow of Your hand, and may the redeemed ones of Adonoy, return and come to Zion with singing.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>

Chapter 5


Our God, and God of our fathers!
My soul mourns and my face is darkened, [because] the House of my glory<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy Temple.</i> has been smashed by the lion;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuchadnetsar.</i> even my escaped ones that were left, my remnant, were crushed on the third day of Tishri.
The raging flames and flood overwhelmed us in their pursuit; they trod down the Temple and divided the spoil; the elders of the remnant who escaped the day of vengeance, were now destroyed on the fast day of Gedaliah ben Achikam.
The poor among the people were torn apart, that which was left by the caterpillar,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuchadnetsar.</i> was quickly devoured by the locust;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael ben Netanya.</i> the vine-keepers and farmers that were left on the orders of Nevuchadnetsar,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “the earth shakers.” See Jeremiah 52:16.</i> perished in the flames, and there was none left to erect a fence and to stand in the breach.
How can I narrate [the disaster] when my groaning is so heavy? My soul is weary, and my congregations are grieved. The few vines [Jews] that remained, from the fierce burning, even they could not remain, and were scattered in wrath.
How long will You hide your face from us? Hear our cry and loosen our bound ones, O Holy One, behold, there is no one to plead in our behalf, look on our misery [and redeem us], and we will crown You with Your praise.
We have been despoiled from generation to generation, and from age to age, the fangs of the flying viper stings us; Mighty One, be aroused and awake for our justification, Atone our iniquities, and call an end [to our suffering].
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people.

Chapter 6


Our God, and God of our fathers!
You taught us of old, to entreat You with our lips; [how] with prayer and supplication to knock at [Your] door. We approach You with diligence and not with laziness— avert calamities [from us] that come from time to time.
Behold we come before You with broken spirit and humbled heart, to confess before You all our follies and stubborness of heart; You Who searches hearts, and heals the broken in spirit, renew a correct spirit within us, and create for us a pure heart.
You appointed from of old these ten days, for each individual to return and find atonement, while the entire year is available for communal repentance, to cry and pray in times of anguish and distress.
If the individual hastens and repents within [these ten days], he is pardoned; but if he despairs [of atonement] and does not repent, there is no hope for his iniquity. Even if he prepares and offers all the rams of Nevayos<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A place of the choicest rams.</i> to help him, though he will plead and cry his prayer will not be heard.
The prayers of the congregation as well as those of the individual, ascend to You alone; for You, our Rock, hear prayer; receive us with favor and grant us pardon, favor us as though we had brought burnt-offerings.
Judge us with compassion and pity— Your distinguished children whom You took for Your treasure— let their disobedience be drowned in the depths of the sea, and let them praise You forever with every kind of praise.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people.

Chapter 7


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Send us Your light and Your truth, grant good fortune to those who believe in You, for You Adonoy are good and forgiving. Look on our afflicted souls, in Your goodness, take us to freedom, for the waters have reached our souls.
May our cries be heard, return our exiles to their dwellings, for we are strangers and sojourners. We knock at Your door constantly, we cling to You, to be joined, for we have been brought very low.
The insolent deride us in our plight, save us that we may thank You, our Rock, that You have delivered us from our tormentors. Your dispersed ones look to You for support, strengthen them in their fear of You, for this is the whole purpose of man.
The laws of the heathen peoples are vanity, but Your desired ones follow You longingly for You are gracious and merciful. Your Temple was turned into ruins, favor her with rebuilt walls, for Your kindness<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In returning Your <i>Shechinah</i> to dwell among us.</i> is better than life.
I am weary and in my affliction I pray: “May my oppressor be shamed and disgraced,” for Adonoy will do justice for the afflicted. The speech of my enemies lie heavy on me, they provoke me all the day, and thus my days are consumed in smoke.
May He pay them according to their deeds,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Israel’s.</i> and thus teach His people a beneficial lesson, that He will not cast us off forever. May his Merciful One grant his desire, and remove his disgrace from him, for how good and how beautiful was he.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">When he [Israel] lived on its own land.</i>
My cities have become ruins, strangers have entered my gates, because I bore the disgrace<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The sins.</i> of my youth. “I will yet greatly rejoice in you,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 61:10.</i> when You will say this to Your redeemed,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> [they will say:] “For You have given me joy, Adonoy, with Your deeds.”
Mighty One! Awesome One! Revered One! cause our redemption now, because for Your sake, we are continually slain. Clear the crooked way [of impediments] that we may proclaim Your glorious praise— that Adonoy has redeemed Jacob.
May our enemies perish by excisement, look down on us from the mighty heavens, for our days on earth are a shadow. Bring near the time of my redemption, let my enemies hear [Your] voice [proclaim]: “That the day of Adonoy is near.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Joel 1:15.</i>
Exalted One, show Your arm, to Your beloved,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> show a pleasant countenance, for though Adonoy is exalted, He still regards the lowly.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">psalms 138:6.</i> Hear the voice of my supplication, let my prayer ascend to Your dwelling, for Adonoy hears the cry of the needy.
Favor our prayer as a thanksgiving offering, say to Your people, “I will show you favor,” for the Torah shall go forth from Me. He will incline the scale [in our favor], He will garb and wrap Himself in strength, for He causes pain and brings healing.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.

Chapter 8


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Again be compassionate with us, bring back our exiles as You promised, renew again as of old Your love for Your people. Remove anger and quickly quiet Your vexation. Turn from Your fierce anger and let Your mind be changed concerning the evil intended for Your people.
Gather and seek the lost ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> and strengthen Your inheritance—<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> [Your] sheep that are slaughtered and shorn for fearing You. If the transgressions are too numerous among those who crave Your forgiveness, turn [from Your anger] for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage.
The iniquity of our fathers has burdened us [with exile] and we have to taste the sour grapes;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Jeremiah 31:29. I.e. the punishment of their sins.</i> we were made to drink the cup of poison, bitterness and wrath. As in the days when You dwelt among us, and made our lives sweet, return to us, O God of our deliverance, and annul Your anger toward us.
You have not totally rejected those who take refuge in You and testify to Your Oneness; they have been punished for their sins, and look to You to be healed. Appease Your anger in accordance with righteous practice. Turn [from Your anger] Adonoy, how long? and change Your mind about Your servants.
Daily we yearn for the revelation of Your secret<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The coming of Moshiach.</i> which is sealed and hidden, [while] Your pious ones waste away [in exile]; humiliation breaks our hearts as we wait for Your graciousness. Return Adonoy, free our souls, deliver us for the sake of Your lovingkindness.
We are forsaken and counted with them that go down into the grave, into mourning has been turned [our] harp, and song, and flute; those who mourn with tears, will walk proudly with thanksgiving. Adonoy! Bring back our exiles like springs in the desert.
Tears are the food of those who trust in You, O my Rock [Who is] Almighty; “Where is the Redeemer?” the Almighty’s adversaries ask scornfully. As You appeared then in a vision, as You spoke to the righteous [prophets]— return [now] Adonoy to the thousand myriads of Israel.
Hear Adonoy, incline Your ear and listen to those who plead, “Please forgive,” reply, “I have forgiven.” Even though our sins are numerous, You open the door saying. “Return O Israel.” Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

Chapter 9


You taught the way of repentance to the rebellious daughter [Israel]; between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur we are to return unto You [in repentance]. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return.
Long ago, from of old, You prepared the way for repentance, before You spread out the mighty heavens, and established the earth; thus, for all who return, repentance is a balm and a remedy. Those who knock at Your door, do not send them away empty-handed. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return.
Behold, the first to be created from dust, Adam, the first to be formed, You tried him with a light commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Not to eat from the tree of knowledge.</i> which he did not keep. You were indignant and angry with him, [and decreed] to shorten his years; but when he repented, You preserved him like the apple of Your eye. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return.
When his offspring [Cain] went astray by shedding his brother’s blood, You sentenced him to be a wanderer, to go from place to place; but when he returned to You and left his evil ways, You prolonged his life to seven generations, anyone who found him was forbidden to slay him. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return.
He [Reuben] who profaned his father’s bed, was unstable as water, his feet had almost slipped<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He was almost condemned to Gehinom for his sin.</i> had he not poured out his heart as water.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Before You in repentance.</i> The young lion [Judah] sinned with Tamar at Enaim,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 38:15–23.</i> when he confessed his sin, You inclined the scale to justify him. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return.
He broke the barriers of the world, did [Achav] son of Omri, with his wickedness, he desired to worship the Asherim idols, and added transgression upon sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">By causing others to do likewise.</i> You tore up his sentence when he repented of his transgressions; You had mercy on him as he confessed and forsook [his evil way], and in You he found deliverance. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return.
Tongues as sharp as arrows had the people of [Ninveh] the great city, their errors and willful sins were numerous, without count; when You sent the vision of their destruction<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Through the prophet Jonah.</i> they were seized with trembling and terror; they repented properly, and it was accepted before Your glorious throne. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return.
You Who searches the innermost heart, and Who is girded with might, teach us that we may know to walk the straight path; if our rebelliousness is great with transgression and crookedness, for Your sake, please, cause us to return, that we should repent in the proper way. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.

Chapter 10


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Then on Mount Mor<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Poetic form of Moriah.</i> the mute dove<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac who accepted his role silently.</i> rejoiced when Ethan<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Literally “giant”—a reference to Abraham.</i> took him as a burnt whole offering the proud One tested him, “Take this lad as a raise-offering to Adonoy, sanctified.”
“Like the law for the basket,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The basket of first fruits; see <i>Devorim</i> 26:4.</i> place him before Me your son here, bring him as a bread offering; I have chosen him, come anoint him with the oil of sanctified anointment.”
The pure one, upon hearing, did not worry; the will of His Rock was all he desired united, both father and son bowed to Adonoy in the splendor of holiness.
He prepared wood intending to kindle it. The only son wondered and hoped saying, “Where is the lamb of offering sanctified sacred to Adonoy?”
“The One Above will show the lamb,” he replied, “to satisfy, make happy the mother’s soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Sarah would rejoice if God would choose an animal and Isaac would return.</i> He Who sees the hidden, my son, will heed your prayer, He’ll send you aid from the sanctified place.”
“Stop, please, father and bind the sacrifice lest I move in fear of the blade. Tie me down lest I desecrate the offering and spoil its sanctity.”
Kofer Eshkol<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to Isaac. See <i>Shir HaShirim</i> Raba 1:14.</i> burst into tears when he thought of his father bereft of his son. He grabbed the knife to perform the entire sanctified service.
Angels screamed up in Heaven, “The mute dove’s slaughter, who can watch?” One to the other declared, “Don’t keep silent, raise your hands in sanctity.”
The One Above gazed at binder and bound, the bound lamb and the burning flame. The Tester of puremindedness recalled the pitied and His voice was heard entering the Sanctum.
Spoke the “advocate”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The angel in the Name of God.</i> as he took the knife, “Spare your only one from going to death. This is written before me, clearly inscribed, inscribed in sanctified etching.
“I know the beautiful integrity of your way. Rejoice and take a ram instead of the buck.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to Isaac. See above.</i> I’ve prepared a substitute for the Eshkol Hakofer<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to Isaac. See <i>Shir HaShirim</i> Raba 1:14.</i> and he and his replacement will be sanctified.”
The youngster was saved from the sharp blade; from outstretched throat his blood did not flow. His right grasped the gripped ram, to sanctify it holy to Adonoy.
Merciful One! You provided him a peaceful ending. Till this day You recall his covenant for his seed. For the rest of the remnant, what is left of his remainder, let there be a haven in sanctity.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.

Chapter 11


Remember the covenant of Abraham and the binding of Isaac, and return the captives of the tents of Jacob and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
For our sins are great our Temple was taken as a debt. We betrayed Your abundant love which caused a reversal [of that love]. Return with compassion to the remnant of Israel and save us for the sake of Your Name.
The deeds of Your first righteous remember, [as well as] the strength of Your friendship. Command the redemption of Your servants. Reveal Your hidden secret. Return the captives of the tents of Jacob and save us for the sake of Your Name.
We became tied as brothers to frivolity and insipidness. Our speech (quality of prayer) has greatly sunk. Exalted One! Raise us up from our low state and bring us into the light from darkness. Return with compassion to the remnant of Israel and save us for the sake of Your Name.
[Pour] a tide of fire and flame [upon our enemies], to destroy the torturer and the haughty one. From the oppressor [to be saved] send us Your help. Awaken! to arouse Your love [for us]. Return the captives of the tents of Jacob and save us for the sake of Your Name.
Mighty Redeemer, for Your sake redeem us, see how helpless we are, look, our pious men are gone, and we have none to intercede for us. Return the captives of the tents of Jacob and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
The covenant with the Patriarchs the Matriarchs and the [twelve] tribes, Your oft-repeated mercy and kindness— remember [now] O God to those who are stricken and tortured, and for Your sake [they are ready] to be killed all the day. Turn with compassion to the remnant of Israel, and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
You Who avenges [innocent] blood, judge our cause, repay [punish] sevenfold into the bosom of those who torment us; we have been sold for naught, [therefore] redeem us without [ransom] money, raise up Your ruined, Holy Temple, before our [very] eyes, and return the captives of the tents of Jacob and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake the covenant with [their] ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations; to be their God, I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 12

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor. Act for the sake of Your teaching. Act for the sake of Your kingship. Act for the sake of Your eternity. Act for the sake of Your counsel. Act for the sake of Your strength. Act for the sake of Your magnificence. Act for the sake of Your righteousness. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your abundant mercy. Act for the sake of Your Divine Presence. Act for the sake of Your praise. Act for the sake of Your beloved ones, who repose in the dust. Act for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Act for the sake of Moses and Aaron. Act for the sake of David and Solomon. Act for the sake of Jerusalem, city of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Zion, Dwelling Place of Your honor. Act for the sake of the desolation of Your Habitation. Act for the sake of the destruction of Your Altar. Act for the sake of the blood of Your servants that was spilled. Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

He Who answered Joshua at Gilgal, He will answer us. He Who answered Samuel at Mizpah, He will answer us. He Who answered David, and Solomon, his son, in Jerusalem, He will answer us. He Who answered Elijah on Mount Carmel, He will answer us. He Who answered Elisha in Jericho, He will answer us. He Who answered Jonah in the belly of the whale, He will answer us. He Who answered Hezekiah, King of Judah, in his illness, He will answer us. He Who answered Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah in the midst of the fiery furnace, He will answer us. He Who answered Daniel in the lions’ den, He will answer us. He Who answered Mordecai and Esther in Shushan, the capital [city of Persia], He will answer us. He Who answered Ezra in captivity, He will answer us. He Who answered all the righteous, the pious, the perfect and the upright, He will answer us.
May the Merciful One, Who answers the poor, answer us. May the Merciful One Who answers the broken-hearted, answer us. May the Merciful One Who answers the broken in spirit, answer us. Merciful One, answer us; Merciful One, have pity; Merciful One, redeem, Merciful One, save, Merciful One, have compassion on us, now, speedily, and very soon.
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.

Chapter 13


O holy Torah, pray pleadingly before the Rock Who is revered in holiness. Pour forth sweet prayer and recall the actions at Horeb,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Where the Torah was given to Israel.</i> when they uttered: “We shall do and obey” in order to draw near to God.
Seir and Paran rejected Your Torah not wanting to keep it, God arose and investigated them,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If they observed the seven Noachide laws which they had accepted.</i> seeing that they did not, he released them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even from the seven Noachide laws.</i> The High One cast them off for not keeping their statutes; in anger and wrath, he executed vengeance against them.
He came accompanied from His myriads,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He came to Mt. Sinai only with some of His angels.</i> and was sanctified in the heavens; from His right hand a fiery law, a flashing flame. With pleasant faces, they joined themselves to Him, they were kissed from His mouth through the Ten Commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They heard the first two commandments from His mouth.</i>
The world became firmly established though it melted due to the stipulation.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">God created the world on the condition that Israel accept the Torah. The world’s existence was not secure until after Sinai.</i> As though finding great spoil, [it rejoiced] at [Israel’s acceptance of] Your word. The mysteries of Your precepts were entrusted to Your loved ones, who have ever since honored You.
Though they are wanderers and fugitives, and exceedingly vexed, in the sweetness of Your honey [the Torah] they always delight. They beautify the tradition of both the Written and Oral Law, they prize Your word as more precious than onyx and jasper [stones].
My heart loves those who expound Your Law, who refine it with clarity, who set aside their time to reveal Your hidden secrets. The general and specific principles they perceive and examine, they banish sleep from their bedchambers.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In order to pursue their study of Torah.</i>
Daily they search and ponder in their hearts [to determine] what is forbidden and what is permitted, and verbally expound their decisions. Between the clean and the unclean, they distinguish and teach; despite distress and privation, their eyes are filled with light.
Statutes and Judgements were decided on their word, and yet by hostile judges were they judged. Remember this O Torah, to strengthen those who study you; those who explain your thoughts, grant them aid and support.
Entreat your Creator with words of supplication, for He is your God, your Creator and your Master. If not for the perfect one’s [Israel] constant meditation in the perfect Torah, it would have been cast in a corner, forsaken and desolate.
Heaven and earth stand firm because of her, and by virtue of [Israel’s] pure reverence and [fulfillment of] her lucid commandments. Chant mightily and pour forth supplication, that our prayers go through [to Him] unobstructed by the clouds.
They approach You<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">lit. Him.</i> with supplication, to be cleansed from their stains [sins], grant their wish, be merciful and gracious. Gather the numberless congregation into the faithful city [Jerusalem], and like a noisy flock in its pasture, may she resound with multitudes of people.
May He rescue the captives from darkness and gloom, and forever encompass them with strength and songs of rescue. And through repentance may they be gently saved from destruction, may He seek the lost and strayed flock.
May He heal the weak, and remove all sickness, may Zion, the glorious city, be filled.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">With multitudes of people.</i> Bind up the broken [Israel] and disgrace the haughty [nations], and greatly avenge the city so attached to You.

Chapter 14

Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Second Day of the Ten Days of Penitence



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.

Chapter 3


To You, we pour out our hearts and souls like water, all of us—to the Almighty in heaven. Come, you old, with your young, cleanse yourselves, and remove your sinfulness.
Let us multiply before Him [our] supplication and prayer, and this we ask of our God: That the good [inclination] prevail over the corrupt [one], that he forsake his way— the transgressor and evildoer. Prepare your heart and amend your thoughts for great is the power of repentance. In the assembly of people let us multiply words [of prayer] and the mighty God will not abhor them.
He desires the return of the corrupt sinner, to save his soul from destruction [Gehinnom]. Hear [our] supplication and accept those who beseech You, as we lift up our hands toward Your Holy Dwelling.
May the words of our mouth be acceptable [before You], and atone our sins, both the involuntary and the intentional.
Consider and remember the call of Your pleasant ones, and relent of the evil against Your people. Grant the desire of Your servants, and let them delight in Your comfort. They rely on Your kindliness and trust in Your compassion.
For in Your abundant mercy we trust, and on Your righteousness, we rely, and for Your pardon, we hope, and for Your deliverance, we yearn. You are a King Who loves righteousness from of old, Who passes over the iniquities of His people, and removes the sins of those who fear Him. You made a covenant with the Patriarchs, and will keep [Your] oath with their descendants. You are He Who descended in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai, and disclosed the ways of Your goodness to Moses, Your servant. The ways of Your kindliness, You revealed to him; and You made known to him that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness, and full of beneficence, guiding the entire world with the quality of mercy. And so it is written: “And He said: ‘I will cause to pass all My goodness before you, and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy in your presence; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate.’”
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 4


Our God, and God of our fathers!
I call out to You [knowing] that the Almighty will answer me. I ask for [Your] mercy as a beggar at the door. Reveal Your great awesomeness, ascent—answer us with righteousness, so that all will know that God is with Israel.
Behold, You have been from long ago my God, my Holy One, why must I die of persecution and hardship? Recall and arouse Your kindliness— renew it as before; restore my ruins [Jerusalem] and establish the site of my Temple.
You are good to those who hope in You, to the soul who seeks You. We wait for You, in time of trouble— we seek You. We are slaughtered for Your sake all the day, for the sake of Your holy Name; yet our hearts are not turned away from blessing You and sanctifying You[r Name].
We are consumed with fear from Your hand, by Your anger and wrath, we are like an empty vessel, and are covered with shame. We are put in the hands of cruel masters who terrorize us, until Adonoy looks down and sees from the heavens.
Bring us out and save us from the hand of strangers, they cut off our lives, spilling our blood, to destroy us. Declare retribution for the wicked, pay them according to their deeds, for He Who is concerned for the bloodshed, [and] He is mindful of them.
Bring us back to You and rescind Your anger, conceal our iniquities and forgive our sins, lift us up from our low state, and let us not be in disgrace; when You record us, who yearn for Your glory, inscribe us for life in Your book.
Strengthen and encourage those whose hands and knees are weak, clear a way for Your people and remove [all] obstacles; may our prayers please You as sacrifices and Burnt-offerings, and You, Holy One, are enthroned upon praises.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Grant us pardon, and remove evil from grieving souls, Almighty God Who knows man’s thoughts; I cry to You in affliction and weariness, redeem my soul from destruction and the pit, draw near to my soul and redeem it.
Beneficent One, Who drew me from the womb, my Creator, my hope and my trust, in Your hand I entrust my spirit; withhold Your anger from Your beloved ones, cause not Your devoted ones to see the pit, answer me Adonoy, for Your kindness is good.
With an incurable, eternal blow, strike with anger those who blaspheme You, but do not plague Your people; we afflict ourselves this day, do not abhor nor despise our cry, pardon the iniquity of this people.
We have transgressed and dealt treacherously, O Rock, we have been corrupt towards You. Therefore, we are consumed by Your anger and we are terrified by Your rage; Holy One! do not extend contention, behold, my hands are stretched out to You, on the day when I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.
Your people pour out their prayer, be merciful and answer Your faithful ones, do not abhor us for Your Name’s sake, turn to the cry of the suffering, to those who call You out of distress, hear them from the high heavens, You Who listens to the needy.
[Israel] the noblest among people, the pleasant offspring, they trust in You, they hope to You, they are counted among Your pure ones, quickly have mercy on them as a father has mercy on his children.

You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

Between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur we cast away the Evil Inclination,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Evil Inclination is often repeated to as the yeast in the dough as it ferments the passion to do evil.</i> justify us in judgment so that the light of life shines on us; behold we have come to You Mighty and Glorious One, for with You is the source of life, in Your light shall we see light.
O Master, with You is pardon<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It is in Your hands to pardon.</i> pardon and forgive those who return to You.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">To those who repent.</i> At the time when You seal Your decree, remember [Israel], Your loved one for good, so that it be known that there is God in Jeshurun,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Jeshurun is a name by which Israel is sometimes referred.</i> Your devoted ones, and set me as a seal upon Your heart, between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
Be surety for Your servants for good, order that their stains [sins] be erased, remember the pillars of the world<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The merit of the Patriarchs.</i> if their [our] deeds are not sufficient; [even] in anger remember to be merciful when You engrave [the fate] of Your children. Inscribe them on Your tablet and inscribe them in Your book [for life], between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
With supplications like the poor and needy they approach You, look on their most bitter misery, how they live in oppression and degradation; on the day when hidden things are searched. O Most High, let them find favor in Your eyes, and may they all be inscribed in Your book, between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
Let those who seek You, find You, those who rise early to entreat You, that the Accuser not prevail and not seem wise in Your eyes; with [our] advocates and defenders— agree with them in Your kindness, [say to them:] “Write concerning the Jews as it is good in their eyes,” between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
Behold the spirit and heart of Your people are broken and sick, let that<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Their broken hearts and spirits.</i> be as a sin-offering and as a guilt-offering, and as the fulfillment of a vow-offering.

Not according to their merit should You judge my congregation, Jeshurun, who proclaim Your Oneness even under the oppression of my enemies; order their engraved inscription for praise and not for disgrace, let their engraved seal [read:] “They are holy to Adonoy,” [do this] between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
To appease You with supplication, Your servants have agreed, be accessible to them and remember [Your assurances of] comfort; do wonders for them in Your kindness, and remove their [sins] stains, Almighty! King, Who sits on the throne of mercy, between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Chapter 9


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Abraham taught the knowledge of God before it was known to all the world. He expounded Your Name to all mankind, and revealed what was hidden and unknown.
He abhorred and broke the idols, the misinformed, he attached to Your Name, he chose the upright way [of life], Torah and Mitzvos he kept without tarrying.
You rescued him from the fire of the Chaldeans, You protected him in the valley of Siddim,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When he battled the four kings in order to rescue Lot.</i> You promised him: “Your reward will be very great,” and You distinguished him with great wealth and honor.
And when he replied, crying: “What will You give me? when I have neither root nor branch.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham had not yet been blessed with a child.</i> You strengthened him in a vision, telling him, “this one<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Eliezer. See Genesis 15:4.</i> shall not be your heir.”
With his first fruit [Isaac] You endowed him in his hundredth year, and when You desired him<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac.</i> as an offering both of them rejoiced with all their hearts, and hastened to do Your will.
As Abraham suppressed his compassion to do Your will, so may Your compassion suppress Your anger from Your flock. Their hearts and souls were ready, so too, may our prayers before You be accepted as an incense-offering.
He hastened and took the knife, therefore save their seed from childless death; the one son was bound like a lamb for slaughter, therefore favor our prayers like a burnt-offering and sacrifice.
He arranged the wood and kindled the fire, therefore as we stand praying this day let us not be put to shame. You answered him from the highest heavens, and You swore to him twice by Your Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That You would remember his seed for good.</i>
You redeemed him [Isaac] with a ram caught in a thicket, therefore, do not disgrace our petition and affliction.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Our fasting on Yom Kippur.</i> Hear our cry and hearken to our entreaty, in the merit of the Patriarch [Jacob] who traveled to Succos.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 33:17.</i>
Let the voice of him who brings tidings<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Moshiach will bring tidings of our redemption.</i> be heard in the world, to redeem the people [who are] the offspring of the everlasting hills.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Matriarchs were so called.</i> Have mercy on the congregation adorned [with Torah and Mitzvos], the plant of the Twelve Tribes.
Let Your Divine Presence dwell among us, lead us to the borders of our land, turn to us with compassion, for You are called [God] full of compassion.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 10

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.

We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor. Act for the sake of Your teaching. Act for the sake of Your kingship. Act for the sake of Your eternity. Act for the sake of Your counsel. Act for the sake of Your strength. Act for the sake of Your magnificence. Act for the sake of Your righteousness. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your abundant mercy. Act for the sake of Your Divine Presence. Act for the sake of Your praise. Act for the sake of Your beloved ones, who repose in the dust. Act for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Act for the sake of Moses and Aaron. Act for the sake of David and Solomon. Act for the sake of Jerusalem, city of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Zion, Dwelling Place of Your honor. Act for the sake of the desolation of Your Habitation. Act for the sake of the destruction of Your Altar. Act for the sake of the blood of Your servants that was spilled. Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

Merciful One, answer us; Merciful One, have pity; Merciful One, redeem, Merciful One, save, Merciful One, have compassion on us, now, speedily, and very soon.
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.

Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Third Day of the Ten Days of Penitence



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.

Chapter 3


Our God, and God of our fathers!
We seek You, we plead with You, You Who forms the mountains, Who relates to man his thoughts and words. We pray to You and implore You in shame and disgrace because of our sins which we enumerate today.
We are gathered old and young, in the House of Prayer, our diminutive Temple, with enfeebled hands and shaking limbs, alarmed and terrified on all sides.
We dread and fear the two emissaries— “anger and wrath” the two accusers. As we search our deeds and behold they are abominable, we are seized with trembling, with pangs and sorrow.
Our faces are blackened and we go about in depression, we are shaken and shattered to pieces; our loins shake as with the pangs of a woman in labor, we fear and dread from our many iniquities, as we substitute our prayers for the offerings of bullocks, depending, trusting and hoping in Your mercy.
For in Your abundant mercy we trust, and on Your righteousness, we rely, and for Your pardon, we hope, and for Your deliverance, we yearn. You are a King Who loves righteousness from of old, Who passes over the iniquities of His people, and removes the sins of those who fear Him. You made a covenant with the Patriarchs, and will keep [Your] oath with their descendants. You are He Who descended in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai, and disclosed the ways of Your goodness to Moses, Your servant. The ways of Your kindliness, You revealed to him; and You made known to him that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness, and full of beneficence, guiding the entire world with the quality of mercy. And so it is written: “And He said: ‘I will cause to pass all My goodness before you, and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy in your presence; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate.’”
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.
As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 4


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Only in You, Adonoy, is the hope of Israel. In later times and in early times was Israel saved by Adonoy. Why, then, is this day so delayed for so long a time while we await Your deliverance, Adonoy.
I resided and was delayed in exile during the days that I was forsaken, in the land of a detestable and ugly people. Why has there been such a decline in my dignity, while I was chastised with suffering. Still, I say: “Hope to Adonoy, be strong and He will give you courage and hope to Adonoy.”
You were originally the sword of our pride.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Through You our enemies were destroyed.</i> When we hoped for You, also, the way of Your judgments we desired.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">To see Your judgements inflicted upon the enemy.</i> Why is it so that there is no person of merit to pray for atonement of our guilt. Regarding our suffering the nations say that our bones have dried up and our hope is lost.
We recall the previous exiles but their duration was short. The two first exiles were limited but the current exile is still intense. Why should we be regarded as animals,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Let to the slaughter.</i> in such variance to what is normal among other people. The hope of Israel is Adonoy Who is their Savior during times of travail.
To carry and be relieved of the yoke of the nations is what the children must do because the Torah obliges them to do so. They are driven from their homeland (Israel) and their Beis Hamikdash is destroyed. Why should the Father hide their path (of redemption) which is promised in their behalf, that there is hope for ultimate salvation by the word of God, that the Children of Israel will return to their boundaries.
My legs have virtually buckled and they have fallen [from the path of God] because I became jealous of the mockers of Torah who distort the proper ways. Why should there not be destruction of the supremacy of those who band against God. When this happens, those who trust in Adonoy will obtain renewed strength and grow wings like eagles.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Radak Isaiah 40,31.</i>
I have been absolutely pursued but the year of my redemption has not come. We are handed over to those who afflict us and pull out our hair while we are not confident of redemption. Why are our heroes pursued— the few strong among us that remain. I hope sincerely to Adonoy that He will turn to me.
Your vines<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the nation of Israel.</i> that were fenced it have been penetrated by the nations and destroyed and plundered; whereas the thorns that were removed from the vineyard<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the nations that veered from God.</i> became arrogant and did not rot. Why then have they become old and strong? Why are they not ashamed, as promised?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">By the prophets.</i>— “The hope of Israel is Adonoy and those who forsake You will be shamed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">There appears to be a juxtaposition in the verse. The last two lines refer to the promise of the prophet mentioned above.</i>
Those who engage in falseness glorified themselves by saying: “What we desired we saw [in Israel’s state].” They explained this by saying: “Our signs that we used as indications were just.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the arrows which they shot that landed toward Jerusalem, serving as an indication that Jerusalem would be destroyed.</i> Why is their way successful while we, who awaited Your kindness became tormented. Adonoy, be merciful to us because we hope to You.
The resurrection of the Beis Hamikdash in which there were thirteen breaches— its time appears distant. The breach extended to the roof. Why should the wicked live and not be destroyed so that those who trust in Adonoy will then inherit the land?
The nations plunder Your inheritance<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the land of Israel.</i> in order to drive us from Your portion. “Turn back, turn back, Shulamith,” they say in order to separate us from God. However, we reply: “Why are you so arrogant and say to each other that we shall disassociate Israel from God?” [On the contrary,] “Adonoy is good to those who trust Him and to the soul that seeks Him.”
O God! the answer to the ‘whys’ that we ask we can answer with a full mouth. We have sinned to Adonoy, our God, and these predicaments have befallen us. Your judgments are just and You (even when inflicting pain) are supreme and exalted. Righteousness is Yours and we are full of shame.
You warned us many times and we said that we will not listen. The voice that dripped from Your prophets we rejected instead of listening. Let Your power be aggrandized forever, You Who can gather the stray people, and in complete repentance, bring us back to You.
[The nations will ask:] “Why is your garment red?” The time for this question is near. Their blood will be sprinkled on the garment that he wears. We will be eternally grateful for the day [of redemption] which will come in its time. [We then will say] “This is Adonoy for Whom we hoped and we will rejoice and be happy in His deliverance.”
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.

Chapter 6


Our God, and God of our fathers!
There is no God besides You, Your dominion is over all generations, and Your covenant endures forever. Your right hand knows no restraint, the power of Your hand is unlimited, Almighty, Who answers in distress.
Mighty are Your wonders, and the power of Your kingdom is forever, and Your years are unending. Avenger of [our] blood, You have saved us many times, and humbled mighty kings.
Behold, You have not changed, You are now what You have always been, the sons of Jacob, You have not consumed. As we are their descendants, why are we forsaken forever, and forgotten as dead men, from the heart?
We are scattered in every corner, enslaved in every country, and no favor is shown us. We are obscured among every people, and put to shame and disgrace among the nations of the world.
We are sunk in the lowest depths, we have collapsed and there is none to raise us, to You alone do we cry. We sit [disgraced] as false witnesses, ashamed to lift our heads, and are drunk with gall and wormwood.
We stumble at noon and at night, like the blind, we grope in the darkness, and know not the time of our redemption. Even those purchased for money, can be freed, but we are wearied day and night and find no rest.
How can I endure in the thick slime,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Of Exile.</i> and what is my end that I should be patient until the time You bring me to freedom? In the morning we say: “Would it were evening,” and in the evening: “Would that the morning<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Yesterday’s morning; see Rashi to Deut. 28:67.</i> draw near,” because of fear of heart and soul.
We are likened to sheep gone astray, whoever finds us, consumes us, and takes no pity on our souls. I lifted my eyes around me and looked left and right, but I found no one who knows me.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Who cares for me.</i>
I turned to every side but there was no help, I cried to You and called— Almighty, Who answers in time of trouble. O Rock, Your hand is not shortened,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., limited.</i> Yours is the power and strength, why do You sleep—rouse Yourself.
Listen to our words of supplication, behold our feebled state, and do not rebuke us with Your anger. Look on the humiliation of our generation, regard our heavy grief and do not chastise us with Your rage.
Turn to our cry from Your Dwelling, look on the groans of Your children, and turn us not away empty-handed from Your Presence. We seek You with entreaty and prayer, O God, favor us in this hour, and hear Adonoy, our supplication.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Chapter 7


Our God, and God of our fathers!
How can I return to You through repentance when those who worship other gods don’t permit me to worship You? They seek to separate me from You and still I did not forsake Your precepts.
How was I able to go into exile and go on every path and province while the idol worshippers ruled over me with their laws that endured and their king reigned for a long time; while I have not been called to come to the king?
How were the rivers able to flow from the dripping of my tears while I was given over to evil doers? They and their children shoot me with arrows from their quivers while I am a choice sheep taken to slaughter.
How is it that the end of days is concealed and not known, and my enemies who cut my glory are saved from death, considering themselves wise like Haymon<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi Kings I, 2:11, referring to Moses and the generation that left Egypt.</i> and Darda while I am foolish without wisdom.
How is it possible that the kingdom of the Chosen People has been torn apart while their kingdom has endured— the kingdom of evildoers and they live with confidence, in joy and gladness and I reside in exile?
The potion of poison— how did I drink and swallow? I cried and shed tears because of the oppressive yoke of Ishmael while they mock me [and insist] that I heed and harken what they say and I remain like a deaf person and I do not hear.
How was my God able to smite me while my previous wounds were still unhealed and the cloak of my glory was donned by Edom as they eat their sweet delicacies— milk and honey, when I am like withered grass?
How did the nation of Kedar surround me and Didan and Shva rule over me? They proclaim as a prophet a man who never prophecied they provide strength for their kingdoms, troops and armies and I, where shall I go?
How did You administer such suffering commensurate with my sins and foolishness? In the teeth of lions and lionesses was I consumed, and they, young and old [were confident] saying that they can overpower us. As I was childless from previous suffering, I became again childless from further suffering.
How did my stars become dark and my zodiac change as the nations abominated my scrolls? They prevented my feet from ascending to Jerusalem during festivals and I virtually veered completely from God.
How did You heed my iniquities and scrutinize my guilt but against those who battle my soul You did not defend me? Even while they were in full strength in inflicting pain and anguish upon me and still I trusted in Your kindness and my heart therefore rejoiced.
How did I sit alone and become cast astray and denigrated from my dignity? I wandered amongst the nations while they ruled and were successful their kingdom endured and I am childless and alone.
How have my mockers and denigraters so embarrassed me. Their power has not deserted them; as they cried out Aha! Aha! with words [of joy] I was a disgrace with them.
How did I remain amongst them in worry and pain? From the waves of anguish they pour on me and from their spring, do I draw; while they rest and lay [secure] as the raven and the wolf, while I am oppressed and sore.
How is it that those who despise pureness, dwell in Zion? Who would believe such a thing, who would imagine this to be God’s will? While they are wealthy princes, having been given high positions, I remain impoverished and needy.
How do they live in my Palace [my Temple] and dwell there in dwellings from above to below<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Temple mount to the Courtyard.</i> and from below to the middle?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From the Courtyard to the Temple.</i> While they have inherited a wealth of gold and precious coins, I am crippled while awaiting more blows.
How is that my thoughts are confused while they remain in Your thoughts? Remember us and be mindful of us for deliverance from idol worshippers. Let them be devoured and removed from the Place of Your Dwelling, and then through Your abundant kindness, I will enter Your House.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”

Chapter 9


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Abraham who came from beyond the river<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Euphrates River.</i> hurried to recognize You without delay, You tried him with ten tests, and he was found perfect without blemish.
He was driven from his birthplace, yet You made him a world-nation; he fulfilled Your command, and did not break it, and he said: “I am but dust and ashes.”
He brought [the angels] milk and butter, and his fruit ripened when he was a hundred.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac was born when Abraham was a hundred years old.</i> And when You said to him: “Bring him up as a burnt-offering,” he split the wood, laid it in order, and put him [Isaac] upon us.
Remember for us this day, his binding,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac was bound on the altar.</i> and his self sacrifice. Be gracious this day to the tribes of [Jacob] the perfect one, and dwell among their congregations.
The offspring of the Twelve Tribes, may they never cease to thrive, bring them into Your beloved Dwelling, in the mountain of Your inheritance may they be planted.
Gather all the scattered of their exile, lead them to the House of their longing. Spare those who are sentenced to death,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For their sins.</i> close the mouth of the accuser and spare [us].
Bear and raise us as in the days of old, and atone every wanton and unintentional sin, forgive and overlook our transgression, and pardon our guilt and wickedness.
Answer this day all those who hope in You, for our eyes are lifted to You. Redeem us from trouble and distress, and bring us up from the deep pit.
Accept our cry on this day, and save us from the hands of the Satan, erect the House of Your glorious Presence, and disgrace not the Throne of Your Glory.
Heal Your people from all [their] wounds, for [Your] children have come to the birthstool<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Their pain is like that of a woman giving birth.</i> we are seized in trembling like a woman in labor who has no strength to give birth.
Redeem Your people from Gehinnom, for upon You they cast their burden, lead them to [Your] rebuilt city, hasten [the arrival of Elijah] the Tishbite, [and the Moshiach] [who is called] Menachem and Nechemiah.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 10

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.

We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor. Act for the sake of Your teaching. Act for the sake of Your kingship. Act for the sake of Your eternity. Act for the sake of Your counsel. Act for the sake of Your strength. Act for the sake of Your magnificence. Act for the sake of Your righteousness. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your abundant mercy. Act for the sake of Your Divine Presence. Act for the sake of Your praise. Act for the sake of Your beloved ones, who repose in the dust. Act for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Act for the sake of Moses and Aaron. Act for the sake of David and Solomon. Act for the sake of Jerusalem, city of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Zion, Dwelling Place of Your honor. Act for the sake of the desolation of Your Habitation. Act for the sake of the destruction of Your Altar. Act for the sake of the blood of Your servants that was spilled. Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

May the Merciful One, Who answers the poor, answer us. May the Merciful One Who answers the broken-hearted, answer us. May the Merciful One Who answers the broken in spirit, answer us. Merciful One, answer us; Merciful One, have pity; Merciful One, redeem, Merciful One, save, Merciful One, have compassion on us, now, speedily, and very soon.
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.

Chapter 11


Our God, and God of our fathers!
May the seat of the Throne which is exalted in heaven, intercede for us before the towering Rock.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God.</i> May the King on His Throne be a shelter for His people, and behold the image of the perfect one<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob.</i> which is engraved upon the Throne.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis Rabbah 82:2; and 78:3.</i>
Let the lion [engraved] on the right<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 1:10; a lion is engraved on the right side of the Throne.</i> implore the Presence of God to spare and be compassionate to the seed which were to be [as the stars];<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 15:5.</i> may He be our deliverance and revive us, and restore the kingdom to descendants of the lion cub [Judah].
May the bullock [engraved] on the left<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 1:10.</i> present our prayer [which is:] that He teach us to better ourselves, and to correct our perverted ways. May He pour forth blessings and enrich our downtrodden, and restore to the stronghold [Jerusalem] the glorious majesty [of Joseph] [who was called] B’chor Shor.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 33:17.</i>
Let the image of man<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Engraved on the Throne.</i> bring our supplication before the Presence of the Mighty Rock, the Creator of man. May He whiten that which is red [our sins], and awaken the slumberers; and increase the dominion [of those] who are called the flock of man [Israel].
The twittering of our lips [prayer], may the eagle<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Which is engraved on the Divine Throne.</i> gather them with its wings, and plead our righteousness before Him Who loves uprightness. May He relate our good fortune, and direct our eyes to what is right, and speak with righteous justification of the people borne on eagles’ wings.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 19:4.</i>
Holy angels! Seraphim and Ophanim, cause our prayers to be heard in the Presence of the Master of masters. May He remember our ancestors and the love of our Patriarchs, and fulfill His oath to the later generations.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Fourth Day of the Ten Days of Penitence



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.

Chapter 3








For in Your abundant mercy we trust, and on Your righteousness, we rely, and for Your pardon, we hope, and for Your deliverance, we yearn. You are a King Who loves righteousness from of old, Who passes over the iniquities of His people, and removes the sins of those who fear Him. You made a covenant with the Patriarchs, and will keep [Your] oath with their descendants. You are He Who descended in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai, and disclosed the ways of Your goodness to Moses, Your servant. The ways of Your kindliness, You revealed to him; and You made known to him that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness, and full of beneficence, guiding the entire world with the quality of mercy. And so it is written: “And He said: ‘I will cause to pass all My goodness before you, and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy in your presence; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate.’”
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 6


Our God, and God of our fathers!
I am appalled in my great affliction, for on the day when my sins are reckoned, what will I plead before my Master? I am desolate and speechless when I remember how guilty I am, I am ashamed and disgraced.
My days are consumed in vanity; because of the shame of my youth, there is no peace in my bones, I am burnt with fever because the scroll [of my debts] is unfolded, and the Creditor has come to collect.
I held fast to my darkness, and my soul did not consider that I am a stranger and a sojourner here. Woe unto me when my day comes, then I will awake from my dream, and return to my place.
And then for the sins I did, and the transgression I committed, what excuse will I offer to Him [God] Who sent me here? The evil in my heart enticed me, and for the iniquity which exhausted me, I was met from the womb.
The degenerate imagines in his soul that he is like a tree planted by a brook, while in fact he is carried to the grave. A false allusion clings to him, which melts away on his [final] journey, and he looks from side to side.
He is cast [into the grave] like a silent stone, and carries into the grave nothing of all that he possessed. His strength did not support him even when his soul carried him, how much less when the fires consume him.
“My iniquity ensnared me,” behold these are the words of my soul during my existence on earth. Therefore my soul is devastated; and like a man lying in disgrace I must return there naked.
I was carried away by my sins while in my heart I called out: “I have sinned,” that which is right, I did not desire, and to the obstinacy of my heart, I clung, to what avail is my crying now.
Bear the punishment of your guilt, my soul behold your sin confronts you, so, therefore, bear your disgrace. When I am perplexed about my iniquity, my thoughts say to me [“don’t despair] for we fall into the hand of Adonoy.”
Turn from the Throne of Your Dwelling, and open the door for me, for there is none beside You. O Rock, shield me, redeem me from my iniquity and teach me Your Torah. Hear my voice according to Your kindness; and on the day I stand before You do not turn away Your servant in anger.
See my affliction and answer me; behold I am in Your hand, and You Adonoy, be gracious to me. Send Your truth and Your kindness to the people [Israel] who cry unto You, even to me, I am your servant. Forgive our guilt, and do not reckon the sins of our youth, for our days are but a shadow.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Let us hear “I have pardoned”; You Who dwells in the shelter of the Most High; with Your right hand of deliverance, deliver a people poor and needy. When we cry to You, answer us with awesome righteousness, Adonoy, be our Helper!

To those who gather to beseech Your kindness, say to them “Here I am.” Restrain the dominion of our evil inclination, set in us as though nailed down, weighing heavily on our necks like a beam, placed there to hold us in his power. Who is strong enough to throw off the stranger [Satan], or fierce enough to remove him? Adonoy, be our Helper!
Open the door for the lily [Israel], O God above, attend to my meditation and let me enter the closed gates. Have compassion on us, anticipate our needs, heal our wounds with balm; cleanse my tongue that I may justify myself, let my iniquity be sought for in vain. Adonoy, be our Helper!
May the Perfect One grant the silent dove a goodly portion, it will be a sign of righteousness— that she has justified herself in fear of You —when You deliver her [from exile]; she cries to You, Master that the time of her liberation is now, release the sheath from its casing<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">To reveal Your forgiveness of our sins.</i> let judgement go forth as a light.

Though the pigeon offerings have ceased,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of the word <span>רֶבַע</span> is a quarter.

Recognize his presence when we mention his righteousness before You; You commanded him, “Take your beloved son, and let his blood be wrung out at the side [of the Altar].”
He ran to the lad and consecrated him, though his soul was bound up in his soul; he put the wood and fire around him, and the crown of his God was on his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was compared to the Kohain Gadol who wore the Crown of God upon his forehead.</i>
The only son, tender and light as a deer, answered and said to his father, “Behold we are bringing the fire and wood, but there is no offering to bring.”
He answered him with words that would not terrify him; his father said to him, “God Himself will show [the lamb], and Adonoy will let us know that which is His [sacrifice].”
Both heeded Your commandment and did not question You[r word]; without hesitation, they hurried quickly to one of the mountains.
When they saw a blazing pillar of fire, they quickly brought the wood for the burnt-offering; together, linked closely in love, they walked straight through the wilderness as though it was a plain.
When the only son perceived that he was to be the lamb, he said to his father, the tested one<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">God had tested Abraham with nine tests and this was the tenth.</i> “Do with me as you would a lamb, have no pity and do not spare me.
He [God] has delight in me and desires me, to Him I will bare my heart; even should you refuse to sacrifice me, in the end my spirit and my soul will be gathered unto Him.
He [Abraham] bowed his hands and feet, and held his sword over him; he laid him carefully on the wood as the fire blazed on the altar.
He stretched forth his neck willingly, and his father came close to slaughter him in the Name of his Master and behold, Adonoy stood over him.
God observed what was being done, how the father had not spared his son, his heart and his hands were lifted [as one],<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">To do God’s will.</i> and God saw all that was done.
God called to Abraham who was sanctified from the womb,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi, Psalms 110:3.</i> choose an exchange for your son, behold there is another ram, offer it without delay.
The exchanged [ram] will be his offering, its burning will be proper and its smoke will ascend; and it will be [as if] he and his exchange [are offered before Me].
May the memory be before You in heaven, engraved forever in [Your] book, an everlasting covenant, never to be erased, with Abraham and Isaac.
Your worshippers have come to bow to You; regard the righteousness of that binding and remember Your flock with compassion, [for] the faces of Your flock look to the merit of the binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Israel hopes that it will be redeemed in the merit of the <i>Akeidah</i> [binding].</i>

Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.

Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.

We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.
Merciful Almighty is Your Name, Gracious Almighty is Your Name. Upon us is Your Name called, Adonoy! act [now] for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your truth. Act for the sake of Your covenant. Act for the sake of Your greatness and glory. Act for the sake of Your Law. Act for the sake of Your glorious majesty. Act for the sake of Your congregation. Act for the sake of Your memorial. Act for the sake of Your kindliness. Act for the sake of Your goodness. Act for the sake of Your Unity. Act for the sake of Your honor.

Act for the sake of David and Solomon. Act for the sake of Jerusalem, city of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Zion, Dwelling Place of Your honor. Act for the sake of the desolation of Your Habitation. Act for the sake of the destruction of Your Altar. Act for the sake of the blood of Your servants that was spilled. Act for the sake of those who were slain to sanctify Your holy Name. Act for the sake of those who were slaughtered for [proclaiming] Your Oneness. Act for the sake of those who went through fire and water to sanctify Your Name. Act for the sake of nursing-infants who have never sinned. Act for the sake of weaned-children who have never transgressed. Act for the sake of “Yeshiva”-children. Act for Your sake and not ours. Act for Your sake and deliver us.

Merciful One, answer us; Merciful One, have pity; Merciful One, redeem, Merciful One, save, Merciful One, have compassion on us, now, speedily, and very soon.
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.

Chapter 11


King of Kings and loftiest of lofty, resident of heaven and dweller on high Who is praised and glorified forever, blessed and blessed by all that exists—
See the oppression of mourners, the worried. Look, please, at the denigration of the least of nations who, dispersed and divided among all peoples, are shamefully, disdainfully, shamed and disdained;
mournful, isolated, repulsed, and devastated exposed to smiters, their bodies to blows. Mornings—”Wish it were night” they say; nights—they say, “Wish daylight were here!”
They have no rest, quiet, or peace— nothing satisfying to provide consolation. Looking forward to peace, they’re always at war; hoping for good, they’re paid with evil.
So they prefer the sleep of death. “Complain? Argue? Our sins are the cause. “We’ve erred, done evil, ignored pleasant laws.” Recall Your mercy, Adonoy, and Your potent kindliness.
Arise and pity us fully. Gather our dispersed on land and sea whom You sold for free to the Edomites. Redeem us soon without money, bloodlessly.  O Rock of integrity, for Yours, Master, are forgiveness and mercy.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Fifth Day of the Ten Days of Penitence



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You Who hears prayer, unto You does all flesh come. All flesh shall come to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy. They will come and prostrate themselves before You, my Master and they will give honor to Your Name. Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow; let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker. Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father, because of our great foolishness, we have sinned. Forgive us our King, for our iniquity is great.

Chapter 3


(Adonoy’s) people, be strong; let us be strong and call strongly to Adonoy. The iniquitous will confess his sin, and return to Adonoy who will pity him.
Call to Him who neither sleeps nor slumbers, Guardian of Israel, “Wake up! Why’re you sleeping? Recall uprightness and deeds well done!” And Adonoy will do what He thinks best.
God of truth, assured us, “I do not desire a person’s death.” Now that He’s available, seek Him out; call to Him when He is near.
Appease Him, beg Him, serve Him in awe; all Jacob’s seed, honor Him! Persist at the doors of the patient One, lift our hearts as high as our hands.
Whoever can appease [Him] effectively— prepare [to pray] to your God, O Israel. Arrange tearful prayers because of Your tribulation; designate a fast; call a [prayer] meeting.
Let God’s servant beg, pray that He turn from His wrath lest we be lost. Perhaps He will prefer those gifts to fattened [animals] and myriad streams of oil.
Prefer [our] heeding to burnt offerings, obeying to the fat of rams. Refine and straighten the crooked— recall these [to the seed] of Jacob. Bring words with you, and let us make up for bullocks with our lips.
For in Your abundant mercy we trust, and on Your righteousness, we rely, and for Your pardon, we hope, and for Your deliverance, we yearn. You are a King Who loves righteousness from of old, Who passes over the iniquities of His people, and removes the sins of those who fear Him. You made a covenant with the Patriarchs, and will keep [Your] oath with their descendants. You are He Who descended in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai, and disclosed the ways of Your goodness to Moses, Your servant. The ways of Your kindliness, You revealed to him; and You made known to him that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness, and full of beneficence, guiding the entire world with the quality of mercy. And so it is written: “And He said: ‘I will cause to pass all My goodness before you, and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy in your presence; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate.’”
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small>
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 5


God, You are known to be great in Israel, You Adonoy, are our Father; whenever we call unto You, You are near to us, You are exalted and uplifted in our midst.
You have granted us good favors despite our liabilities [sins], not because of our righteousness and the uprightness of our hearts; You are our loved One even though we have forsaken You. Redeem us, for we are slaves.
Because of our iniquity, we have been brought to the crushing point, shrunken are the souls of those who yearn for You, and where is Your earlier kindness with us? For ever and ever, they are everlasting.
We carry the burden of Your wrath, and it has weakened our might, Adonoy, do not rebuke us with Your anger, terrifying panic has consumed our flesh; please, do not chastise us with Your rage.
Our suffering from distress is indescribable, who can weigh them and who can count them? We know our wickedness, that we have sinned, for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
May [Your] anger and wrath cease from us, for [the nation of] Jacob is small and frail, let us be relieved from oppression, and let the yoke of tyranny be crushed, for our strength to endure is weakened.
Do not use the measure [of our evil ways as a yardstick] to exact punishment from us, for we remain but a few from many; rescind the evil intended for Your people, for tipping the scale towards kindness is Your attribute.
Forgive us even if our sins testify against us, help us; for on You, we depend; bend our necks to serve You, with love and reverence may we serve and honor You.
Those who remember You have prepared and set aside days of fasting, their perception has become so shrunken— they are unable to ask for their needs; may the outpourings of their prayers come before You, bind up each one’s wounds and pains.
The voice of Jacob cries out from the depths of Your exile, may it be heard in the heavens, the place of Your habitation; destroy with Your anger, their pursuers. The year of punishment for those who strive against Zion, reveal [to us soon].
You saw and came down— You acquired us in our youth, do not cast us off in our old age; we have gone astray leftward [the way of sin] let Your right hand bring us near, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Look down and gaze [at our trouble] and look after Your loved ones, be girded with Your graciousness and be garbed with Your righteousness, be covered with Your compassion, and be enwrapped with Your kindliness, and let there appear before You the attributes of Your goodness and humility.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Chapter 6


Our God, and God of our fathers!
You are my portion and the rock of my heart I longed for You in the night as I lay on my bed; to You, Adonoy, I call when my heart is faint.
We have betrayed You and have thus increased Your fury and anger, we have been stepped on and crushed, for we have no good deeds.
Our distress has greatly increased, for we have erred in our vision [of truth] and stumbled in our judgement, and [even] all our righteous deeds are as filthy rags.
We lack knowledge, we are simpletons without wit, even high angels, You charge with folly, how much more so man, who is but a worm.
Behold, You lift the isles as dust particles, should You search and examine wrongdoings, what could we speak and how could we justify ourselves?
I searched for one to set up the fence and stand in the breach,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To protect us from destruction with his prayers and good deeds.</i> but there is no upright one to appease You; the pious man has perished from the earth.
My destined time<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Of my redemption from exile.</i> is hidden from my knowledge, my iniquities have caused my glory to be cut down; indeed, I acknowledge my transgressions.
I cry of violent robbery, but there is none to deliver me; why is the righteous surrounded by the wicked? Your hand is not powerless to deliver us.
Your lambs [Israel] are beaten by [the enemy] who roar [with triumph] like the sea, they are ravished and robbed in the hands of the nations; “Why have You forgotten us forever, forsaken us for so long a time.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 5:20.</i>
Jacob has been given for a spoil, and Israel to plunderers; she who was honored with a canopy of seven clouds<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When she left Egypt.</i> is now dumb like a sheep before shearing.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Her crying is of no avail.</i>
The miser and degenerate [are seated] like a king at his table, while the generous and noble are banished for their debt,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The sins of the vile and degenerate.</i> like an unwanted vessel.
Do not preserve [our iniquity] forever to destroy us, when Your left hand thrusts us away, let Your right hand draw us near; O Master, we are oppressed, be our surety.
We have had a bad name from long and yet You have given hope to the repentant with a generous spirit, [saying:] “I will heal their rebelliousness, I will love them in free-willed devotion.”
My eyes flow like a stream with tears, the mockers enjoy tranquility while my gladness has ceased; and as for me, in an instant my feet would have slipped.
Seek the lost sheep, the people that will be saved [by You], even though they have been found with sin and transgression from the womb, and the righteous man has fallen before the wicked.
[Your] testimony to Jacob is sealed in the Torah, that in the land of their enemy, You promised to preserve them alive, even were they to be so situated.
Remove transgressions and erase guilt, lest hell enlarges itself to squeeze in<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">To take in more souls.</i> and opens its mouth without limit.
Behold the storm<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The exile is compared to a storm.</i> and draw near to free us, raise us and pull us from the muddy mire, return, Adonoy, free our souls.
We have sanctified a day of fasting,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Yom Kippur.</i> to approach You in prayer, prepare beforehand healing for our wounds, remember Your congregation, which You acquired of old.
Lay aside anger, withhold wrath, those who are held prisoners [Israel], pull them out with bonds of love from the dungeon, where they sit in darkness.
Proclaim liberty to the broken and desolate, cut away the bars and break the yoke,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Of their exile.</i> heal her fragments for she totters.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is a plea for the redemption of the Land of Israel.</i>
You have set repentance [as a remedy] against the reptile and serpent,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the Evil Inclination.</i> I hope in Him Who forgives and pardons, and even should He slay me, yet I trust in Him.
Turn Your ear to us, O Creator, hear O God those who seek You, listen to those who entreat You, accept my prayer as incense<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As an offering of incense.</i> before You.
Strengthen the faint and fortify the feeble, establish the Temple, restore the canopy [Your Shechinah], do good, as You see fit, to Zion.

Chapter 8


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Heed supplication and listen to prayer, cancel anger and diminish fury. The bitter-hearted who pray to You will find help in Your great Name.
Regard the cry of the groaning<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The groaning of the nation of Israel.</i> behold their suffering; do not disdain their bent stature. Charge the insolent enemy for shaming them; trample them and let their blood spurt.
You have existed and still do, and will exist in all Your glory. You said the seed of Your loyal ones would exist, yet they are being wasted by the power of Your fury.
They angered You with their sins and were evicted from their desire, they were scattered all over without rest; their spirit wounded, bent to the earth, plowed upon and deeply furrowed.
Sunk in mud with no rescuer, their predators at peace all around, daily their enemy fights; they spread their hands<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">To God in prayer.</i> to get out of trouble.
Their lives are wasted with agony and groans; the weak are many and joy is gone. They hope for salvation and end up crying; they’re wearied by upstarts who undermine them.
They plot slyly to convert them from You, weigh them down to weaken them. They cry to You when exhausted to find respite from their heavy burden.
They express prayer, standing crowded, request pardon with bowed head; oppressors enrage them, seeking their extermination; may they be confounded and annihilated.
Redeem Your followers from total destruction, save them from enemies and elevate them, command the salvation of those who seek You in prayer, justify them in judgment from hidden and open [sins].
Jealous avenger, be jealous for Your Name, cut away the yoke thongs from Your people’s neck. See our suffering and repent from Your anger, fight our battle against the people You damned.
Repay sevenfold those who anguish me, besot Your arrows with the blood of my oppressors. Turn Your ear to the sound of my supplications, accept me when I call out, “Adonoy, Adonoy.”

I remember O God, and I moan when I see every city built on its site, and the city of God [Jerusalem] is humbled to the bottom of the pit; and yet we cleave to God, and our eyes look to God.
Divine Mercy, intercede for us, and before your Possessor, present our supplication, and on behalf of your people, plead for compassion; for every heart is faint and every head is ill.
I support myself with the thirteen attributes [of God], and rely on the gates of [penitent] tears, which are never joined, therfore, I have poured out my prayers, before Him, Who searches hearts. I trust in these, and in the merit of the three Patriarchs.
May it be Your will, You Who hears the voice of weeping, that You place our tears in Your skin-flask [of tears] for preservation; and save us from all cruel decrees, for to You alone do our eyes focus.

Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the nations; to be their God I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.”

Chapter 11

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have trespassed more than any other people, we are more ashamed than any other generation; happiness has departed from us, our hearts are miserable with our sins; [the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> [the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> the abode of our Holy Temple has been destroyed because of our iniquities; our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i> our beautiful land belongs to strangers, our strength [wealth] to foreigners. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.

We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited, torn and stripped from us. They have their yoke upon us, we bear it on our shoulders. Slaves rule over us, there is none to free us from their hands. Many troubles have encompassed us, we called out to You Adonoy, our God, but You remained distant from us because of our iniquities. We turned away from You, we have gone astray and are lost. Still, we have not repented our errors, so how can we be so insolent and obstinate as to say before You, “Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned.” But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his ways, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.”
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”

And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14), “I am greatly distressed; let us fall into the hand of Adonoy for His mercies are great, but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications. Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger, nor chastise me with Your rage. Be gracious unto me, Adonoy, for I am desolate, help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified. My soul, too, is utterly terrified, and You Adonoy, how long? Return Adonoy, free my soul, deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness. For in death there is no mention of You; in the lower world who will thank You. I am worn out with my sighing, every night I cause my bed to float; with my tears, I melt my couch. My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my tormentors. Depart from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping. Adonoy has heard my supplication, Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer. Ashamed and utterly terrified will all my foes be, they will return and be instantaneously ashamed.
<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives, He raises up from the pit to life eternal. When a son sins, his father smites him, but then a compassionate father heals his wound. A rebellious slave is put in chains, but if the master desires, he breaks the chains. We are Your firstborn and we have sinned against You— —our souls are filled with bitter affliction. We are Your slaves, and we rebelled against You— —some of us have endured plunder, some captivity, some the whip. We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy, heal our overwhelming pain, so that we are not completely annihilated in exile.

Chapter 12


Hope of Israel, its Savior at times of trouble; its guardian, shelterer, and rescuer on the day of fury— have much mercy on the storm-tossed, poor people, isolated and looted, pained and anguished.
Trampled by enemies and sullied in the dirt, bereft of children and alone, exiled and mourning, by lions and bears trampled and crushed, like shepherdless sheep wandering and scattered.
Master! How long will You disregard her anguish, why forever leave her in the hands of her provoker? In Your mercy remove her from darkness to light; for Your Name’s sake do not shame her, she who is luminous like the sun.
You chose her from all the nations with unique clarity. Look, please, at her poverty, and dust off her dirt. Fight her battles and abhor her enemy; avenge her vengeance and that of Your Chosen House,
which they smashed and ruined and set afire, desecrating and insulting the honored and awesome Name. Recall the insult of the loathsome one who spoke insultingly against You. Arise, Adonoy, in Your anger, rise vigorously, and do not forget the constant noises of Your enemies.
Destroy, cut down the cursed kingdom. The heralder of peace to Your people send soon to console Zion and to mend her breaches, for Yours, Adonoy, are greatness and power.
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i> Bring our plea for compassion before the Presence of the Lord of mercy. Angels of prayer! Cause our prayers to be heard before Him Who hears prayer. Angels of weeping! Cause our cries to be heard before Him Who listens to cries. Angels of tears! bring our tears before the King Who is appeased by tears. Intercede for us and amplify supplication and entreaty before the King, Almighty, Who is exalted and uplifted. Mention before Him, cause Him to hear of the Torah learning and good deeds of our ancestors who repose in the dust. May He remember their love and give life to their descendants so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish; for the flock of the faithful shepherd has become a disgrace; Israel the unique nation [has become] an example and a byword [of humiliation]. Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance, and redeem us from all harsh decrees, deliver in Your abundant mercy Your righteous annointed and Your people.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a captive implores his captor. All captives are ransomed with money, but Your people Israel [are redeemed] through compassion and supplication. Grant our petition and our request, that we not return empty-handed from before You.
Master in heaven, we beseech You, as a slave implores his master. We are oppressed and live in darkness, our souls are grieved from great affliction. We don’t have the strength to appease You, Master, do it for the sake of the covenant, which You made with our forefathers.
Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and let not Israel perish, who say, “Hear Israel.”
Guardian of the unique nation guard the remnant of the unique people and let not the unique nation perish, who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name, [saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation, guard the remnant of the holy people and let not the holy nation perish who repeat the threefold sanctification to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy, are conciliated by supplications be appeased and conciliated to an afflicted generation for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King! be gracious to us and answer us for we have no [good] deeds: deal with us charitably and kindly and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon You. Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindnesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us, as we have waited for You. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your mercy come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Help us for the Name of Adonoy Creator of Heaven and earth. Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us for we are saturated with humiliation. [Even] in anger remember to have compassion. [Even] in anger remember the binding of Isaac. Even in anger remember the uprightness of Jacob Adonoy deliver [us] the King will answer us on the day we call. For He knows of what we are made; He is mindful that we are but dust. Help us, God of our deliverance, for the sake of the glory of Your Name; save us and atone our sins, for the sake of Your Name.
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His kingdom bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Mashiach in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.

Yom Kippur Eve



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy while shame is ours. How can we complain? What can we say? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? Let us search into our ways and examine them, and return to You; for Your right hand is extended to receive those who repent. Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One. Please do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence. From Your Presence our King turn us not away empty-handed; for You hear [our] prayers.
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger, Lord of Mercy, You are called, and the way of repentance, You have taught us. The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness, remember this day and every day for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. With supplication and prayer we approach Your Presence, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. From Your fierce anger turn, as it is written in Your Torah. In the shadow of Your wings, may we be sheltered and lodged, as on the day [of which it is said:] “When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] “And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i> And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i> “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.

As a father has compassion on his children so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah! Adonoy of Hosts! fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver us! the King will answer us on the day we call.
“Please pardon the sins of this nation in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness; and as You forgave this people from when it left Egypt until now.” And there it is said:
“And Adonoy said, I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear, open Your eyes and behold our desolate places, and the city which is called by Your Name; for it is not on account of our righteousness that we let fall our supplication before You, but because of Your great mercy. My Master, hear! My Master, pardon! My Master, listen and take action, do not delay! For Your sake, my God, because Your Name is proclaimed over Your city and over Your people.

Chapter 3


Our God, and God of our fathers!
Master, if You judge scrupulously, examining actions meticulously, no man will be found righteous before You. You find fault with the hosts of Heaven, faulting even Your angels— certainly one<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Man.</i> who drinks wrong like water.
Neither merit nor justice are in us, we are totally sinful. Good One, enter not into judgement with us. Let Your innards churn for us, in Your abundant mercy turn to us, Not to do as our evil deeds deserve.
Our willful acts are too many to count. There are no sweet savored offerings to provide pardon for our iniquities. On our righteousness we do not rely; we are sullied with iniquity and sin. To find charity we come in prayer.
Do not measure our ways strictly; maggots and worms are our end, vanity and emptiness our [lives] years. Repent the evil, change Your mind. That is Your way, merciful one; with Your great mercies, have mercy on us.
Your ways You instructed the humble one<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Moses is referred to as the humble one.</i> to teach, You informed him of the thirteen in sequence, assured him they are never ineffective. Our supplication we have arranged accordingly before You. Hear the cries of Your supplicants and do not send us away empty-handed from Your Presence.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

Chapter 4


Master, when You call on man each morning [for judgment] do not press justice to its limits. If You combine body and soul [in judgment] they would be thrust down and be unable to rise.
Can man be innocent in judgement? Is he possessed of deeds to justify him? His birth stream is from a fetid drop, his enemy is hidden within him from the time of his birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Man.</i>
Lurking within him as a snare to his feet, he entices him daily, to make him fall into the abyss [of sin]; there is no power or might in the body to stand firm and resist him.
From the day he attains perception, he puts his life in his hand to gain his bread, all his days are filled with vexation and grief; until he returns to his dust he is not at rest.
Regard O Master his sorrowful spirit, look at his broken heart, You are near to these who are afar, You desire the repentance of the wicked.
Mighty One! let Yourself be found by those who seek You, say: “Here I am,” to those who petition You let the tiding: “I have pardoned”— be told to those who call in Your Name, make righteous in judgment the people who proclaim Your Unity.
Muzzle the foul one [Satan] that he may not condemn us, rebuke the accuser that he not accuse us, stand up for us an upright advocate; “I have found atonement,” let the penitent hear.
We have cast our burden upon You we beseech You to sustain us, be pleased [accept] our prayer our request and desire fulfull with compassion.
In You we place our trust, let Your mercy come swiftly toward us; Strong and Mighty One, we have not forgotten Your Name, we beseech You, never forget us.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty!

Chapter 5


Accept Your people’s fast who sprinkle their blood to You; consider their fat as an offering, do not disdain their sacrifice. Set upon them the sign of life— regard their prayer. This sign will take place tomorrow.
Gird Yourself with righteousness, eternal and lofty Reposer. Support the stumblers, extend Your hand to lift them whose tear is their drink, whose groan is their bread. Avenge the blood of Your servants from their enemies, until they are no more. Look at their blood that is shed to know why and wherefore this. This sign will take place tomorrow.
Gracious One! grant Your people who trust in Your Name; appoint and advocate for me who will hide my sin— hide my debt in his left and raise my merit in his right, and bring up Isaac’s ashes] so that He will say, “This is it!” This sign will take place tomorrow.
Come and hear my prayer; open the gate before my cries to cleanse me of sin like a one-year-old. And silence the tongue of my prosecutor; let him not open his mouth. Adonoy will shout at Satan, “Get off this, immediately!” This sign will take place tomorrow.
How shall I greet, approach, the One Who takes no bribe? I have no deed in hand, and my heart is therefore afraid. But now that I mention the kingship of Your unique Name, on this I rely, when we say “Adonoy is One” in unison as one, one on that side and one on this. This sign will take place tomorrow.
See, I have no one atoning for me, no one to serve for me; the priest, garbed in white, is no longer, nor is the High Priest, adorned in glory, nor is there an obligatory, sin-offering, nor free-will and vow-offering; so You will atone for me, examiner of kidney and chamber. Close the breaches of Your sheep and make space for the flock. Build them a fence on that side and one on this. This sign will take place tomorrow.
Under Your shield have come the children who were exiled; Your children have gathered in Your house, awed and upset. Recall the kindliness of their forefathers when they come to be judged; in truth and peace they meet, that one facing this one. This sign will take place tomorrow.
Almighty! King! Who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting righteously with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. Almighty! You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moses of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.”
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy, and kindlinesses for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem, the love of Zion, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin.
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember.

Chapter 6

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us.
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped me and comforted me. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May there be gracious acceptance for the words of our mouth, and the meditation of our heart, before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. For to You Adonoy, we hope You will answer us Adonoy, our God. Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered; We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
Your righteous annointed [King David] declared before You, Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse You.”
Your people and Your inheritance hunger for Your goodness, thirst for Your kindness, long for Your deliverance. Let them realize and know that unto Adonoy, our God, belongs compassion and pardon.

Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Israel, —and say Amen.
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amein.
