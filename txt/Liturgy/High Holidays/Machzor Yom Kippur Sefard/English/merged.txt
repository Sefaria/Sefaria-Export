Machzor Yom Kippur Sefard

Kapparot



Behold, I have come to make this atonement, to fix what I have corrupted in the upper source. May it be your will, Lord my God and the God of my ancestors, that this hour be a time of favor and mercy. You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to favor it, for the appointed time has come. When the Temple is built quickly in our days, there will be a scapegoat according to the law, and the goats will be made willingly, and we will all rejoice in the service of the Temple. May our eyes see and our hearts be glad. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, Lord my rock and my redeemer.

Merciful God who dwells above, provide a sure rest on the wings of the Divine Presence, amongst the holy and pure who shine as brightly as the sky, to the soul of (Hebrew name of deceased) son/daughter of (Hebrew name of his/her father)
who has gone on to his eternity. For the sake of the charity which they gave to commemorate his soul, let his rest be in the Garden of Eden. Hence, the Merciful One will shade him forever with his wings, and will bind him in the bundle of life. The LORD is his inheritance, and he shall rest peacefully on his bed. So let us say, Amen.
