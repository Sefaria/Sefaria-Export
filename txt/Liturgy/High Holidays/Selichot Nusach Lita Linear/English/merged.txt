Selichot Nusach Lita Linear

First Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak,
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now on forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
far above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>

Chapter 3

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Benjamin ben Zarach</i></small><br>
Our God, and God of our fathers!<br>
How can we open our mouths before You,
O’ One Who dwells in the heavens;
in what manner
can we pour out our words of prayer?
We have rejected
Your upright and honest ways,
[instead] we cling to abominations,
and acts of corruption.<br>
We have adhered
to false and misleading concepts,
we have been stubborn and brazen;
You were angered at us,
[the Temple,] our secure abode,
You destroyed
and the pleasing aroma of sacrifices ceased.<br>
Banished and uprooted
are the priests, the anointed ones,
who knew how to arrange burnt-offerings
and other sacrifices [on the Altar];
You warned us many times
through the prophets, Your messengers;
we did not take heed or listen
to those who admonished us.<br>
From then and even till now
we have been scattered [among the nations,]
we have been killed,
slaughtered and butchered.
We are a bare remnant [among the nations]
who tear at us like painful thorns;
our eyes fail with disappointment
for we have found no relief.<br>
Those who enslave Your people,
who bow down to false gods—
why do they succeed morning till night?
They rise against You saying with scorn:
“Shattered ones [Israel,]
in whom do you trust?”<br>
You Who live eternally, holy One!
See the humiliation of those who groan,
they rely on You, and to You they cleave.
With the awesome might of Your right hand,
deliver them for eternity—
for in Your abundant mercy,
we trust.<br>
<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rav Sadyah Gaon 892–942</i></small><br>
For in Your abundant mercy
we trust,
and on Your righteousness, we rely,
and for Your pardon, we hope,
and for Your deliverance, we yearn.
You are a King
Who loves righteousness from of old,
Who passes over the iniquities of His people,
and removes the sins of those who fear Him.
You made a covenant with the Patriarchs,
and will keep [Your] oath
with their descendants.
You are He Who descended
in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai,
and disclosed the ways of Your goodness
to Moses, Your servant.
The ways of Your kindliness,
You revealed to him;
and You made known to him
that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness,
and full of beneficence,
guiding the entire world
with the quality of mercy.
And so it is written:
“And He said:
‘I will cause to pass
all My goodness before you,
and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy
in your presence;
I will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious,
and I will be compassionate
to whom I will be compassionate.’”<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i>
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i>
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6.</i>
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:7.</i>
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i><br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
The pious have disappeared from the earth,
and uprightness in man no longer exists.
No one calls with Your Name in righteousness,
inspired to be steadfast with You.
Deliver us Adonoy
for the devoted man has ceased,
for the faithful have disappeared
from among the sons of man.
For with You is the source of life,
in Your light shall we see light.
For with Adonoy there is loving-kindness,
and with Him there is much redemption.
And He will redeem Israel
from all its iniquities.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Shlomo ben Yehuda, HaBavli</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers.<br>
There is none that offers righteous prayer,
the best of men is like a briar-thorn;
to seek compassion on those who are crushed—
no one [worthy] can be found.<br>
The blameless and pure man has vanished,
the pious man has disappeared
and the righteous has been trampled;
thus a generation impoverished in good deeds
is held to account for its iniquities,
for there is none to direct its ways.<br>
Our sins have caused
[God’s] wrath to be kindled,
[even against the righteous] who offered, as members of Your household
to pray and intercede for us;
and thus, who is there, great or small,
that is able to offer confession and prayer
to the Holy One Who is ever awake?<br>
I tremble and fear
to offer prayer on behalf of the congregation
to Him Who searches and probes [hearts;]
deficient in virtue and full of sin,
how can I find favor with my supplication?<br>
You are good to those who call upon You
with all their soul,
You bear their burden and sustain them;
expand Your precious kindness upon me,
and give ear to my voice with Your love.<br>
[Regard me] as one who is of worthy character
and completely proficient in prayer,
as one who is mature and fluent
and not as a boor,
consider my broken heart before You,
and let me not be ashamed;
for the sake of my relief,
remember Your mercy—
let it not be concealed.<br>
Numerous are our needs,
but they cannot be expressed
because of our short-sightedness
and rebellious spirit;
but all is revealed to You
Who has formed us from clay,
[our] guide, shepherd, shelter and protector.<br>
We are left like a single tree on a mountain
in our solitude,
our glory has turned to rubbish and refuse,
answer us and sustain us in our servitude,
add to Your counted ones [Israel]
by seeking out those who are lost from us.<br>
Those who are inflicted with pain
by the rods of Your chastisement,
are scattered, dispersed
and pawned among the nations;
protect them in Your shelter
from strife and punishment,
for to behold Your glory
is their hope and desire.<br>
[God,] Whose powerful voice hews flames of fire,
Who decrees both good and its opposite,
Your beloved ones knock [at Your door]
with a sorrowful voice;
accept their offer of prayer,
and dwell among them.<br>
They persevere in fasting [in order]
to humble their hearts,
their multitude—from the wrath of judgement
conceal them in Your chamber;
they beseech You in quiet prayer,
lips whispering,
withhold not their desire.<br>
Your Name O God
is glorified by Your desire to grant life,
we remain in good life because of You,
for the fountain of life flows from You;
look to us, and answer us,
and enlighten our eyes.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Do not enter into judgment with us,
for no living soul will be justified before You.
Let our prayer come before You
and be not concealed from our supplication.
Let come before You,
the groans of the prisoners,
according to Your great might
release those doomed to die.
My Master, hear our voice.
Let Your ears be attentive
to the voice of our supplication.
Let Your ears be attentive
and let Your eyes be open—
to the plight of Your people Israel.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 5

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Shlomo ben Yehudah HaBavli</i></small><br>
Our God, and God of our Fathers!<br>
May our fervent prayers come before You,
may Your ear be attentive to our supplication,
hear our justification, Adonoy,
and listen to our song,
for You look at our righteous deeds,
and overlook the complaints against us.<br>
We are disgraced, ashamed to raise our heads,
for the sweet aroma of our good name
we have polluted,
we have corrupted righteousness,
and the Written and Oral Torah,
we have misrepresented,
we therefore hide our faces in the ground.<br>
Distress and anguish seize us from all sides,
we are like sheep adrift without shelter,
if we turn to the right,
the axe cuts us down,
to the left, there is dread
lest we fall prey to those who hunt us.<br>
May Your ever-seeing eyes be opened
to behold our affliction and distress
from our prolonged suffering;
may our mourning be turned into exultation,
our chastisement to favour,
turn about our misfortune,
befitting Your ways of uprightness.<br>
We have been subjected
to captivity and plunder,
we, our kings and our priests to disgrace;
from glorious heights and [Your] mighty love,
we have been hurled to the earth
in desolation and scorn.<br>
We did not seek Your Presence—
to offer supplication,
nor did we seek understanding of Your truth,
because of the stench of our iniquity;
we were destined for the same end as Sodom,
for we diminished the sound of Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally “mill”. The study of Torah is likened to the grinding of a mill which operates day and night.</i>
we were almost destroyed, but for Your grace.<br>
You spared the remnant [of the First Temple,]
You established and fenced in [the Second,]
and You gathered us therein;
we were cast away because of the sin<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to <span>שִנֽאַת חִנָם</span>, unwarranted hatred, which was the cause for the destruction of the Second Temple.</i>
which equals the three sins<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The three sins of idolatry, adultery, and murder were the cause for the destruction of the First Temple.</i> which You despise;
the Temple of Your yearning,
You trampled because of us (our sins).<br>
We have acted corruptly and treacherously,
thus we were driven from one yoke to another;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">From exile to exile.</i>
remember Your promise never to abhor us,
gather Your scattered ones and rule over them.<br>
After all that has befallen us,
we know that Your judgements are righteous,
and we alone caused our disgrace,
for even to this day we have not changed,
and we appear before You with great guilt.<br>
This lowly people,
held in shame and contempt,
pushed about, swept aside,
given as plunder
exile and captivity tested and refined them;
turn about in Your kindness
to pardon and heal them.<br>
Through Your mercy, shown many times,
may we find deliverance in You—
fulfill Your promise of “I will deliver them;”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 1:7.</i>
let them come from afar in droves,
some from the north,
and some in ships from Kittim.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 24:24.</i><br>
They are Yours, Your servants and Your people,
cherish them as in the days of old—
Your sweet ones [Israel],
draw us that we may follow You;
put us among those inscribed in Your Book,
for we all yearn to fear Your Name.<br>
May this small people increase a thousandfold,
O our Beloved,
and may this youth
grow into a mighty nation in our borders;
with all Your ways of righteousness,
have compassion on us,
turn back from Your fierce anger
and comfort us.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;

Chapter 6

<small><span>בְּמוֹצָאֵי מְנוּחָה</span></small><br>
After the departure of the Sabbath,
we approach You [in prayer,]
incline Your ear from on high,
You Who are enthroned upon praises,
[and] hear our cry and our prayer!<br>
Raise Your mighty, right hand
to act valiently [against our accusers;]
for the sake of [Isaac] the righteous one,
who was bound [on the altar,]
and in whose stead a ram was slain—
shield his descendants
as they cry to You while it is yet night,
[and] hear our cry and our prayer!<br>
Turn to those who seek You
when they seek Your Presence,
be accessible to them
from Your Heavenly Abode,
and to the cry of their supplication
close not Your ear;
[and] hear our cry and our prayer!<br>
They tremble and quake
at the day of Your coming [to judge them,]
they are panic-struck—
as a woman giving birth the first time,
from the burning wrath You carry;
O’ please, wipe away their filth
that they may praise Your wonders,
[and] hear our cry and our prayer!<br>
You are the Creator of all that is formed,
You prepared from of old, a remedy
to save them from distress,
by bestowing undeserved grace upon them
from Your hidden treasure.
Hear our cry and our prayer!<br>
Exalted One,
if the sins of Your congregation are great,
strengthen them, we pray
from the treasure stored in Your abode;
Your community [implores You]
to grant them undeserving grace
as they approach You.
Hear our cry and our prayer!<br>
Turn to our sufferings
and not to our sins,
justify those who cry out to You;
[God] who performs wonders,
listen to their supplication,
God, Adonoy of Hosts.
Hear our cry and our prayer!<br>
Be pleased [and accept their pleadings
as they stand [before You] at night,
regard [their prayers] with favor
as the offering of burnt-offerings;
show them Your miracles
He Who does great things.
Hear our cry and our prayer!<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,

and pardon to transgressors.

“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>

Chapter 7

Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 8

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i>
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i>
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These are all references to the Holy Temple.</i>
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
Before our eyes, our toil has been exploited,
torn and stripped from us.
They have their yoke upon us,
we bear it on our shoulders.
Slaves rule over us,
there is none to free us from their hands.
Many troubles have encompassed us,
we called out to You Adonoy, our God,
but You remained distant from us
because of our iniquities.
We turned away from You,
we have gone astray and are lost.<br>
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed;
we have therefore not been delivered.
Grant that our hearts [be inspired to]
abandon the path of wickedness,
and hasten our deliverance;
as is written by the hand of Your prophet,
“Let the wicked man abandon his ways,
and the man of iniquity his thoughts;
and let him return unto Adonoy,
and He will have compassion on him,
and unto our God
for He pardons abundantly.”<br>
Your righteous annointed [King David]
declared before You,
Errors—who can comprehend?
From hidden [faults], cleanse me.”
Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God,
from all our transgressions,
and purify us from all our defilement.
Sprinkle clean waters on us
and cleanse us,
as it is written by the hand of Your prophet,
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse You.”<br>
Micah, Your servant, said before You,
“Who is an Almighty [God] like You?
Who bears iniquity and overlooks transgression
of the remnant of His inheritance;
Who does not retain His anger forever,
for He delights in kindliness.
He will again have compassion on us,
He will subdue our inquities,
and cast into the depths of the sea,
all their sins.
And all the sins of Your people
the House of Israel,
You will cast into a place
where they will never be remembered
or counted
and never recalled to mind.
You will grant truth to Jacob,
kindliness to Abraham,
as You have sworn to our fathers
from the days of old.”<br>
Daniel, man of [Your] delight,
cried to you,
“Incline Your ear, my God and hear;
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places
and the city which is called by Your Name,
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall
our supplications before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! my Master, forgive!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
for Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and Your people.”<br>
Ezra, the Scribe, said before You,
“My God, I am [so] ashamed, and disgraced,
that I cannot lift my face to You, my God,
for our iniquities have risen over our heads,
and our guilt has grown to the heavens.”
“And You are a God of pardon,
Gracious, Merciful, Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness;
and [therefore] You did not forsake them.”
Do not forsake us, our Father,
do not cast us off, our Creator,
do not abandon us, our Maker,
do not consume us
on account of our sins.
Fulfill for us, Adonoy, our God,
the word, You promised
by the hand of Jeremiah, Your <i>seer</i>
as it is said,
“In those days and at that time,
says Adonoy,
the iniquity of Israel will be sought,
and there will be none [found],
and the sins of Judah [will be sought]
but they shall not be found;
for I will pardon
those whom I leave as a remnant.”
Your people and Your inheritance
hunger for Your goodness,
thirst for Your kindness,
long for Your deliverance.
Let them realize and know
that unto Adonoy, our God,
belongs compassion and pardon.<br>

And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14),
“I am greatly distressed;
let us fall into the hand of Adonoy
for His mercies are great,
but into the hand of man let me not fall.<br>
Merciful and gracious One
I have sinned before You;
Adonoy, full of mercy,
have compassion upon me
and accept my supplications.
Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger,
nor chastise me with Your rage.
Be gracious unto me, Adonoy,
for I am desolate,
help me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified.
My soul, too, is utterly terrified,
and You Adonoy, how long?
Return Adonoy, free my soul,
deliver me for the sake of Your lovingkindness.
For in death there is no mention of You;
in the lower world who will thank You.
I am worn out with my sighing,
every night I cause my bed to float;
with my tears, I melt my couch.
My eye is dimmed from anger,
it has aged because of my tormentors.
Depart from me, all you evildoers,
for Adonoy has heard the voice of my weeping.
Adonoy has heard my supplication,
Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer.
Ashamed and utterly terrified
will all my foes be,
they will return
and be instantaneously ashamed.<br>

Chapter 10

<small><i>(The following prayer is said only if a Minyan of ten males is present.)</i></small><br>
He wounds and heals, He slays and revives,
He raises up from the pit to life eternal.
When a son sins, his father smites him,
but then a compassionate father
heals his wound.
A rebellious slave is put in chains,
but if the master desires, he breaks the chains.
We are Your firstborn
and we have sinned against You—
—our souls are filled with bitter affliction.
We are Your slaves,
and we rebelled against You—
—some of us have endured plunder,
some captivity, some the whip.
We beseech You, in Your abundant mercy,
heal our overwhelming pain,
so that we are not completely annihilated
in exile.<br>
Angels of mercy!<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities omit this prayer because they object to the idea of praying to angels.</i>
Bring our plea for compassion
before the Presence of the Lord of mercy.
Angels of prayer!
Cause our prayers to be heard
before Him Who hears prayer.
Angels of weeping!
Cause our cries to be heard
before Him Who listens to cries.
Angels of tears!
bring our tears before the King
Who is appeased by tears.
Intercede for us
and amplify supplication and entreaty
before the King, Almighty,
Who is exalted and uplifted.
Mention before Him, cause Him to hear
of the Torah learning and good deeds
of our ancestors who repose in the dust.
May He remember their love
and give life to their descendants
so that the remnant of Jacob will not perish;
for the flock of the faithful shepherd
has become a disgrace;
Israel the unique nation [has become]
an example and a byword [of humiliation].
Hasten and answer us, God of our deliverance,
and redeem us from all harsh decrees,
deliver in Your abundant mercy
Your righteous annointed and Your people.<br>
Master in heaven, we beseech You,
as a captive implores his captor.
All captives
are ransomed with money,
but Your people Israel [are redeemed]
through compassion and supplication.
Grant our petition and our request,
that we not return empty-handed
from before You.<br>
Master in heaven, we beseech You,
as a slave implores his master.
We are oppressed and live in darkness,
our souls are grieved
from great affliction.
We don’t have the strength to appease You,
Master, do it for the sake of the covenant,
which You made with our forefathers.<br>
Guardian of Israel,
guard the remnant of Israel,
and let not Israel perish,
who say, “Hear Israel.”<br>
Guardian of the unique nation
guard the remnant of the unique people
and let not the unique nation perish,
who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name,
[saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.<br>
Guardian of the holy nation,
guard the remnant of the holy people
and let not the holy nation perish
who repeat the threefold sanctification
to the Holy One.<br>
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy,
are conciliated by supplications
be appeased and conciliated
to an afflicted generation
for there is none else to help.<br>
Our Father, our King!
be gracious to us and answer us
for we have no [good] deeds:
deal with us charitably and kindly
and deliver us.<br>
As for us, we know not what to do;
but our eyes are upon You.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindnesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us,
as we have waited for You.
Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your mercy come swiftly toward us
for we have been brought very low.
Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us
for we are saturated with humiliation.
[Even] in anger remember to have compassion.
For He knows of what we are made;
He is mindful that we are but dust.
Help us, God of our deliverance,
for the sake of the glory of Your Name;
save us and atone our sins,
for the sake of Your Name.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Kaddish</i></small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.<br>
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>
May their be acceptance
of the prayers and supplications
of the entire House of Israel
before their Father in heaven.
And say, Amen.<br>
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and life for us
and for all Israel,
—and say Amen.<br>
He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He, make peace for us
and for all Israel,
—and say Amen.<br>

Second Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
If our iniquities testify against us,
Adonoy, act [mercifully] for Your Name’s sake.
Adonoy, God, please pardon
the iniquity of Jacob, for he is small.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He is a small nation.</i>
For our souls are lowered to the dust,
our bodies cleave to the ground.
Be aroused, why do You slumber?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Why do You make Yourself appear to us as asleep.</i>
My Master, awaken!
Do not forsake us eternally.
And now,
let Your strength be magnified, my Master,
as You have declared, saying:<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 3

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Shlomo ben Yehuda, HaBavli</i></small><br>
Our God, and God of our fathers!<br>
Even if our iniquities are great and magnified,
if their testimony against us
is strong like woven strands of rope,
creating a separation between us;
let Your ways of compassion
not be withheld from us.<br>
You affirmed to govern with kindliness,
and You have always been, from of old.
Remember Your community that You acquired;
take pity on the remnant of those [Israel]
whom You called Your first born.<br>
You carried us [up high]
to the city [Jerusalem] and implanted us there.
You caused us to dwell [in the city]
built of strong and mighty stones.
Abruptly You cast us down
to a place [where our enemies]
[attack us] like serpents.
Bring forth the relief that we await.<br>
The many [evil] episodes and dreadful panic
have caused my soul to abhor life.
[My life has become] loathsome as dirt.
Support our bodies, dragged to the ground.
Awaken, why do You slumber?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See previous note.</i>
You are our [only] hope!<br>
Open [Your eyes,] remove our shackles,
call to Your imprisoned ones with affection.
Hurry, shorten their sentence of oppression;
gather Your dispersed ones,
Your scattered flock;
when they see [Your deliverance,]
the mouths of the unjust will close [in shame].<br>
Preserve the oath of kindness,
and the stipulation
You made with the perfect one [Jacob],
with [Isaac], whose ashes are on the Altar,
and with the builder of the Altar [Abraham],
all of whom were mighty in their trust in You.
Command Your peace with us
that we be not disgraced;
turn about and change the evil time for good.<br>
Jacob [the nation of Israel] is small and poor.
We are known to be ill, despised and worthless.
Grant them life and kindness;
be their stronghold and tower.
And even now,
let Your power of deliverance be magnified.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Even for the ways of Your judgements, Adonoy,
we hope for You.
The greatness of Your Name and Your mention
is our soul’s desire.
We hope for You, Adonoy,
turn to us and hear our cry.
And now, what is our hope, Adonoy?
Our yearning is for You[r deliverance].
Only for God does our soul yearn;
from Him will come our deliverance.
As the stag cries out in thirst
for the springs of water,
so do our souls cry out in thirst
for You, O God.
[May] only good and kindness pursue us
all the days of our lives,
and we shall dwell in the House of Adonoy
for long days.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
I longed for You, I hoped for You,
though I was in a distant land.
With all my heart, I seek You;
I call to You from the depths [of my being].
I am crushed with my longing for You
as a stag longs for springs of water.
I seek You and search for You
[even] on the streets and in the markets.<br>
Behold the time has come
for You to relieve the distressed
and do justice for the oppressed.
Their vineyards, they [the enemy] destroyed;
they have been plundered by the plunderers;
they have been robbed and oppressed
by those who crushed them.<br>
Those who cling to You;
those in whom You took delight
as with tender infants,
have been for many days
oppressed and battered.
They lack everything,
they are destitute of [all] good.
Lions<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to our enemies who are likened to lions.</i> gnash their teeth at them.<br>
You have abhored, forsaken, and cast off
those who cleave to You.
You have annulled the covenant
with the three [Patriarchs] who You desired.
You have made us an object of repulsiveness.
We are whipped and beaten;
torn by maggots and devoured by locust.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to our enemies who are likened to locust and maggots.</i><br>
We are wounded, bruised,
our limbs torn;
we lack balm, and we are without ointment.
Arise! help those
who sigh and groan.
Lift them from the dunghill
and raise them from the dust.<br>
The power is in Your hand
to raise up the downtrodden.
Your might is in the heavens
and Your dominion is on earth.
The righteous will acknowledge Your Name
when You lift the head of those
who have been purified seven times.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Israel has been purified in the fires of suffering in exile.</i><br>
Then all [nations] will say,
those near and far,
when You deliver those who yearn for You,
those strengthened by Your mitzvos:
“The Strong and Mighty One
has fulfilled His promise
to the rose of Sharon,
the lily of the valley [Israel].”<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;

Chapter 5


Israel, that is delivered by Adonoy
with eternal deliverance,
even this day may they be delivered
[by decree] from Your mouth,
You Who dwell on high!
for You are magnanimous to pardon
and the Lord of compassion.<br>
At Your door they knock
like poor and destitute [beggars].
To the outpourings of their heart—
listen, O God, Who dwells in the heavens,
for You are magnanimous to pardon
and the Lord of compassion.<br>
They are terrified from all [their] distress,
from their slanderers and oppressors.
We beseech You, do not forsake them,
Adonoy, God of their fathers,
for You are magnanimous to pardon
and the Lord of compassion.<br>
Let Your goodness await them
on the day of chastisement,
and from amidst [their] distress
find for them redemption and relief,
for You are magnanimous to pardon
and the Lord of compassion.<br>
Deliver them within sight of all,
and let them not be ruled by the wicked.
Destroy the tyranny of Seir [Esau]
and his father-in-law [Ishmael],
and let the deliverers go up to Zion,
for You are magnanimous to pardon
and the Lord of compassion.<br>
Listen, O Master, to the voice of their cry
and to Your throne in the heavens,
let their prayers ascend,
for You are magnanimous to pardon
and the Lord of compassion.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.

Chapter 6

Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Third Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
Our God! we are ashamed with our deeds;
we are disgraced with our iniquities.
Our God! we are too ashamed and disgraced
to lift our faces to You, our God.
Do not deal with us according to our sins,
nor repay us according to our iniquities.
If you God should take account of iniquities,
my Master, who could survive?
For with You is forgiveness,
in order that You be feared.
Enter not into judgements with us,
for no living soul will be justified before You.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 3

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Shlomo ben Yehuda, HaBavli</i></small><br>
Our God, and God of our fathers!<br>
Your ways are not like those of man,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Who cannot always fulfill his will.</i>
where, then, is Your vengeance<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">But since You can, why don’t You take revenge from our enemies.</i>
and Your enduring counsel?
The daughter [Israel] whom You chose
to serve You in Your cherished House—
is now dominated by [strange] masters
and she is unable to cleave unto You.<br>
She groans [saying]:
“I am betrothed to my beloved—
but the abhorred oppressor—
how he has trampled upon me.”
The sentence of death, she accepts on herself,
though she is exiled [from her land]
and coerced by the nations.<br>
The mother<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Congregation of Israel.</i> is sent away—not divorced,
the son, like a lost orphan—is sent off.
She, who was likened to a closed-in garden,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Israel, who was protected by its Divine faith, has now been abandoned.</i>
has become abandoned like wild grass,
and the foundation that was sealed
is now trodden and polluted.<br>
Formerly Your wrath lasted but a moment,
but now the reverse is true.
The [priests who wore the] holy crowns,
are now cast into the streets.
She, who was beloved of God, was beautiful
as “Keren Hafuch” [Job’s daughter, Job 42:14]
is now forsaken, and regarded
as one [a harlot] with painted eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God considers our love to be insincere.</i><br>
She, who was of pleasing appearance,
has become blackened by hard labor,
her sore festers without healing.
The day of vengeance—its path is yet closed;
the day of redemption—
the window is yet sealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The time of redemption is concealed from our view.</i><br>
Our endurance is weakened by the burden;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Of exile.</i>
crippled and lame are the survivors of death.
Without rest, they stray and wander,
they labor and strive, while others reap.<br>
The horn [pride of Israel] was planted
in the rich, fertile land [of Israel].
Why has it become trampled
like thistles for the furnace?
The Guardian above, who never sleeps,
why does He let His plant be trampled
by the bulls of Bashan [Israel’s enemies].<br>
What profits the vine when it is cut down?
What benefit is it to the spreading vine
when it is uprooted?
She [Israel], who is engraved on God’s palm,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Isaiah 49:16.</i>
and upon His T’filin,
why has God’s love for her been withdrawn?<br>
The task of the nations
requires minimal effort,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They are required to observe only the seven Noachide laws.</i>
but the payment of their wages increases.
She [Israel] yearns for Your attention,
but her waiting time is prolonged.
Each occurrence of trouble
is followed immediately by another.<br>
The holy first offerings of the grain heaps<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is referred to as God’s first fruits.</i>
are scattered like chaff to the ends of the earth,
driven by the wind like leaves of the forest.
They flee in panic, as pursued by the sword.<br>
Those ninety eight curses [described in the Torah, Deut. 28]
and those not described are fulfilled in us.
Have mercy, gather us
from these [four] corners.
Then will they say among the nations:
“Adonoy has done great things for them.”<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses];
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,

Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Let us lift our hearts with our hands
to the Almighty in heaven.
Our help comes from Adonoy,
Maker of heaven and earth.
He will not let our feet slip;
He will not slumber—our Guardian.
Behold, He does not slumber,
nor does He sleep, the Guardian of Israel.
Deliver, Adonoy, Your people,
the remnant of Israel.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Shlomo ben Yehuda, HaBavli</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
In the day of dread, I call upon You.
Let me not be oppressed by the insolent—
those who forsake the precious Torah.
Render to them their just deserts;
sit [in judgement] to scrutinize [their deeds].
May the sentence of the wicked and corrupt
be carried out in full.<br>
Those who intend to make us forget
Your holy and revered Name
and make us familiar with idolatrous names—
that are despicable and vulgar;
through their methods
the best of our people have been destroyed.
Spare the remnant
from being crushed as [olives] in an oilpress.<br>
As they tear beasts of prey,
so they learned to devour man, as it is said:<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 19:3.</i>
they cast lots for us
as if we were ownerless property
in the wilderness.
We were almost utterly consumed,
and nothing would have been left of us,
were it not for Your mercy, O Master,
Who rules with kindness<br>
Who dares murmur at Your ways,
to argue against them?
who dares gird himself to dispute You?
We have turned away [from Your mitzvos]
and have been scattered like the wind.
The enemy’s bloody sword was drawn;
but with You is justice
and Your hand is uppermost.<br>
Let the tyrant not say: “I have prevailed,”
nor let Judah’s enemies exult at my fall:
Proclaim—
for those who were sold for naught—
the year of release.
May the wicked seeking to extend their rule
be turned back and cut down.<br>
Your bill of sale<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">You acquired Israel as Your exclusive possession.</i> preceded theirs
and yet the creditors<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Israel’s enemies.</i> demand payment.
To postpone Your lien [is the intent]
of the many harsh rulers.
The border marks of Your boundary,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Mitzvos of the Torah are boundary marks dividing Israel from all other nations.</i>
they seek to uproot.
The grain [Israel] which You sanctified,
has been devoured—
both grain ears and chaff.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Both good and bad ones.</i><br>
Let judgement for their evil come on them
and reveal their guilt.
According to their misdeeds
be harsh and bring devastation upon them.
For the portion of their cups,
rain upon them fiery coals;
return to them sevenfold.
Avenge Your covenant and destroy them.<br>
To the city of Your beautiful Palace, lead us.
Make a path through the sea
for the redeemed congregation to pass.
In You is our hope,
and You, our Almighty Creator,
comfort us; may Your kindliness be upon us.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!

Chapter 5


Messengers of mercy, angels of the Most High!
beseech the Presence of the Almighty
with words of virtue [concerning Israel].
Perhaps, He will spare
this poor and needy people.
perhaps He will be compassionate.<br>
Perhaps He will be compassionate
with the remnant of Joseph,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Amos 5:16.</i>
who are lowly and disgraced, torn to pieces,
innocent captives, sold without compensation;
they cry out in prayer
seeking permission [to enter His Presence].
Perhaps [then] He will spare
this poor and needy people,
perhaps He will be compassionate.<br>
Perhaps He will be compassionate
toward those who are afflicted in chains,
accustomed to beatings—enduring oppression,
the subject of head-shaking
among the nations;
a byword among peoples, of anger and shame.
Perhaps [then] He will spare
this poor and needy people,
perhaps He will be compassionate.<br>
Perhaps He will be compassionate
and see the affliction of His people,
and listen to those who pray to Him;
they gather to offer silent prayer
amid their suffering,
their eyes look to Him, hoping for favor.
Perhaps [then] He will spare
this poor and needy people,
perhaps He will be compassionate.<br>
Perhaps He will be compassionate
toward those who say “Please pardon us,”
who vigorously praise Him at all times,
who band together in times of trouble
to pour out supplications;
in the Presence of their God,
they pour out their weak hearts.
Perhaps [then] He will spare
this poor and needy people,
perhaps He will be compassionate.<br>
Perhaps He will be compassionate
upon those who have been doubly smitten,
swallowed by lions [enemies of Israel],
even in the mouth of small lions
smitten [by God] and punished
for their conspicuous iniquities;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Lamentations 1:9—<span>טוּמֽאָתָה בְּשׁוּלֶיהָ</span></i>
yet, she has not forgotten
the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi to Habakuk 3:4—<span>חֶבְיוֹן עוּזוֹ</span>.</i>
Perhaps [then] He will spare
this poor and needy people,
perhaps He will be compassionate.<br>
Perhaps He will be compassionate
upon those who hide their faces [in shame],
who listen to their degradation
and do not reply or argue;
to Him Who is eternal they hope,
and upon His deliverance they depend,
for His mercy is never absolutely withheld.
Perhaps [then] He will spare
this poor and needy people,
perhaps He will be compassionate.<br>
Perhaps He will be compassionate
to strengthen one, oppressed in poverty,
release the captive from his land of captivity,
remove his pain and heal his sickness,
hear his cry
and hasten the time of redemption.
Perhaps [then] He will spare
this poor and needy people,
perhaps He will be compassionate.<br>
Almighty! King!

Chapter 6

Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Fourth Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
Adonoy is good to those who hope for Him,
to the soul who seeks Him.
Our humiliation is before us all the day,
our faces are covered with shame.
We are murdered for Your sake, all the day,
we are considered like sheep for slaughter.
Yet our hearts are not turned away,
nor are our feet moved from Your path.
For He is concerned for the bloodshed,
of them He is mindful;
He has not forgotten the cry of the humble.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 3


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
I call out to You [knowing]
that the Almighty will answer me.
I ask for [Your] mercy
as a beggar at the door.
Reveal Your great awesomeness,
ascent—answer us with righteousness,
so that all will know
that God is with Israel.<br>
Behold, You have been from long ago
my God, my Holy One,
why must I die of persecution and hardship?
Recall and arouse Your kindliness—
renew it as before;
restore my ruins [Jerusalem]
and establish the site of my Temple.<br>
You are good to those who hope in You,
to the soul who seeks You.
We wait for You, in time of trouble—
we seek You.
We are slaughtered for Your sake all the day,
for the sake of Your holy Name;
yet our hearts are not turned away
from blessing You and
sanctifying You[r Name].<br>
We are consumed with fear from Your hand,
by Your anger and wrath,
we are like an empty vessel,
and are covered with shame.
We are put in the hands of cruel masters
who terrorize us,
until Adonoy looks down and sees
from the heavens.<br>
Bring us out and save us
from the hand of strangers,
they cut off our lives, spilling our blood,
to destroy us.
Declare retribution for the wicked,
pay them according to their deeds,
for He Who is concerned for the bloodshed,
[and] He is mindful of them.<br>
Bring us back to You and rescind Your anger,
conceal our iniquities
and forgive our sins,
lift us up from our low state,
and let us not be in disgrace;
when You record us, who yearn for Your glory,
inscribe us for life in Your book.<br>
Strengthen and encourage those
whose hands and knees are weak,
clear a way for Your people
and remove [all] obstacles;
may our prayers please You
as sacrifices and Burnt-offerings,
and You, Holy One,
are enthroned upon praises.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”
Look down from the heavens and see,
from the abode of Your holiness and glory.
Where is Your vengeance and Your might?
The multitude of Your compassion and mercy
has been withheld from us.
You split the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
If our iniquities testify against us,
Adonoy, act [mercifully] for Your Name’s sake.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Gershom ben Yehudah (the Light of the Exile).</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Where are all Your wonders—
the great and awesome [wonders]
of which our fathers told us,
Adonoy of Hosts?
When Israel went down to Egypt
to slavery and toil,
with cords of humanity, You drew them—<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob and his sons were drawn to Egypt to see Joseph.</i>
not with chains.<br>
Even those who enslaved them with hard labor,
who decreed their males be cast in the river,
You judged them measure for measure;
You brought out the bannered hosts
with a wealth of all desired gifts.<br>
The sea and its waves
were divided by Your strength,
You dried up the Jordan
and they crossed it on foot,
You sustained them in the wilderness,
and they lacked nothing;
kingdoms and nations
were put into their hands.<br>
They rejected the good ways
and they were pursued by their oppressors,
they cried to You and You heard them,
and You appointed deliverers for them.
When they lived in the land,
they enjoyed all good things,
they sinned and were exiled [to Babylon],
You remembered to redeem after seventy years.<br>
They joined themselves to falsehood
and were left to be trampled,
they were forced into exile
by men of violence [the Romans],
they were forced out of their land,
and the time of their return is concealed;
they live among the nations as bondsmen.<br>
Strengthen the remnant that escaped,
she [Israel] is weakened
by the heavy and bitter catastrophe;
still feeling the pain of the first calamity<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The destruction of the First Temple.</i>
she was quickly struck a second below.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The destruction of the Second Temple.</i><br>
From day to day my trouble increases,
each new day is worse than yesterday.
I am weary of bearing
the yoke of the oppressor
who says:
“Count out and bring heavy taxes.”<br>
Your treasured people
are hard pressed by the cruel enemy,
she [the enemy] anticipated
that they would exchange their faith in God
for a faith in man.
How long, Adonoy,
shall I call [upon You] in distress?
Answer me with Divine enlargement,
for Your hand is not lacking.<br>
If the gravity of our transgressions
have created a barrier between You and us,
if the curtain has shut out [our] prayer;
Mighty God, beneath Your throne of glory,
hollow out a passage,
that our cry come before You,
that it be accepted before Your glory.<br>
Proclaim a year of favor
to relieve me from grief,
gather my scattered ones, and go before me,
defend me Adonoy
against those that strive against my soul;
please save me, my holy God.<br>
Break the teeth of the wicked with gravel,
may they be childless, their wives widows,
destroy them; [and]
let their blood be spilled on the ground,
let it be poured out;
release those who are prepared to die<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For Your sake.</i>
and betroth them in faithfulness.<br>
Repair the breach
of the tabernacle of David which is fallen,
raise up the city
which is lowered to the dust.
Comfort her in captivity with double measure,
brighten her light and lighten her darkness.<br>
Build Your city as in the days of old,
restore Your Altar, Temple, and Entrance Hall,
then will Judah and Israel worship You there,
—all of them,
and Your Name will be magnified forever.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses];
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>

Chapter 5


You search all things and review them,
and understand all my doings;
if perchance, I have dealt falsely
and acted deceitfully—
please, do not investigate my iniquity,
and do not examine my misdeeds.
Adonoy! Hear my voice in the morning.<br>
My Creator!
With a span, He measures the heavens above;
for You, I prepare a crown [with my prayers]
offered to You in the third watch<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The last watch which culminates at daybreak, the period most appropriate for prayer.</i> [of night]
during which You give ear to the entreaties
of those who hope for Your deliverance.
Send Your rebuke
to the violent and rebellious [nations]
who speak haughtily [of themselves]
and say “There is none else but her.”
And the Place where incense was offered,
and the Holy of Holies and the Altar,
with which the Kohanim served You,
they [our enemies] have made a thoroughfare.
May curses cling to them
as the liver to the lobe,
and may violent wrath,
and every wound and sickness befall them.
Adonoy! Hear my voice in the morning.<br>
[Our] Rock,
Your Name is Almighty of Vengeance,
why do You appear as asleep?
Year after year
the vine which Your right hand planted
is most oppressed and afflicted,
it [Israel] is bought and sold;
Your people are nick-named with degradation
but in fact are not degraded.
Your judgement is just,
for no sentence is passed without justice.
But take vengence for the [Torah of] faith
which was given from Your right hand,
and in which it is written: “Who can count.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 23:10, “Who can count the dust of Jacob.”</i>
Yet now we are counted like sheep;
my Rock, be aroused, I beg You
destroy our enemy from its base,
and uproot its kingdom,
God, Adonoy is my strength.
Adonoy! Hear my voice in the morning.<br>
Mighty One,
Who is near to those who call Him
and hears [the prayers of] the needy,
judge the plight of the poor and needy,
render judgement for the oppressed
and persecuted.
The fate of high and the low
are in Your hands, Master of masters.
Let my sentence come from You
as a bright light, Almighty of faithfulness.
The Almighty is not like man
that He should lie,
that He should change His word,
yet You have decreed:
“At the end of six years

and many times six years have gone by me
although I have not loved my masters.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 21. The servant could opt to remain in the service of his master if he loved him.</i>
And if I was sold to a heathen,
and was not released after [six] years,
the duty of ransom falls on the kinsman,
and You are my Kinsman and Redeemer.
Adonoy! Hear my voice in the morning.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses];
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>

Chapter 6

Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Fifth Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:<br></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
Turn from Your fierce wrath
and let Your mind be changed
concerning the evil intended for Your people.
Turn for the sake of Your servants,
the tribes of Your inheritance.
Return Adonoy
to the myriads and thousands of Israel.
Return Adonoy, our exiles,
like springs in the desert.
Return, return, You said to us,
and concerning repentance,
You promised to accept it from the beginning.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return;
renew our days as of old.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 3


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Your people Israel set prayers [before You],
for they are in distress and need deliverance;
their adversaries add to the yoke [of exile],
all this has befallen them,
yet Your Name they bless.<br>
Their illness and suffering
is indescribable,
they have been humiliated from their youth,
and it has not been removed from them;
Holy One, it is in Your hand
to release the prisoner
according to Your pure attribute [of mercy],
unlike the attribute of man.<br>
He is garbed in righteousness
which adorns Him like a cloak [of royalty],
from the wound itself, He prepares the cure;
raise up Your congregation
from its lowly fall
with Your great strength and outstretched arm.<br>
With Your love and compassion
You uplifted and exalted [Your people Israel]
[we beseech You therefore] to eradicate the counsel of the wicked
and to annul their [evil] plans against us;
inflict them with great turmoil,
and let the cruel angel thrust them
and throw them [into exile].<br>
For the sake of Your honor,
and Your holy Name, that is greatly extolled,
perform awesome wonders [for us]
lest [Your Name] be desecrated among nations;
lead their advisors and men of power
to total confusion,
and do to them
as they did to us.<br>
Raise up the poor from the dust
and the needy from the dunghills,
Your community—
let them not be destroyed and humiliated;
if she has been casual regarding Your precepts
and negligent [in their performance,]
may all her transgressions
be covered over by Your love.<br>
They are most precious in Your Presence,
Master of masters,
regardless of their conduct
they are called Your children.
Let Your mercy go before them,
God of the high and lowly
before they are drowned in the wicked flood.<br>
They desire Your nearness above all else,
hasten for their sake
to bring the deliverance that was prophesied.
Holy One,
let them be a sign of [Your] beneficence.
Strong and mighty is their redeemer—
Adonoy of Hosts.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Unto You, Adonoy, we lift up our souls.
We lift our hearts with our hands
to the Almighty in heaven.
For Your sake, we are murdered all the day,
we are considered as sheep for the slaughter.
Be aroused!
Why do You appear as asleep, my Master?
Awaken, do not forsake us forever.
Why do You conceal Your Presence,
have You forgotten our suffering
and our oppression?
For our souls are bowed to the dust,
our bowels cling to the earth.
Arise—come to our aid
and redeem us for the sake of Your kindness.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


God, You are known to be great in Israel,
You Adonoy, are our Father;
whenever we call unto You, You are near to us,
You are exalted and uplifted in our midst.<br>
You have granted us good favors
despite our liabilities [sins],
not because of our righteousness
and the uprightness of our hearts;
You are our loved One
even though we have forsaken You.
Redeem us, for we are slaves.<br>
Because of our iniquity,
we have been brought to the crushing point,
shrunken are the souls
of those who yearn for You,
and where is Your earlier kindness with us?
For ever and ever, they are everlasting.<br>
We carry the burden of Your wrath,
and it has weakened our might,
Adonoy, do not rebuke us with Your anger,
terrifying panic has consumed our flesh;
please, do not chastise us with Your rage.<br>
Our suffering from distress is indescribable,
who can weigh them and who can count them?
We know our wickedness, that we have sinned,
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
May [Your] anger and wrath cease from us,
for [the nation of] Jacob is small and frail,
let us be relieved from oppression,
and let the yoke of tyranny be crushed,
for our strength to endure is weakened.<br>
Do not use the measure [of our evil ways
as a yardstick] to exact punishment from us,
for we remain but a few from many;
rescind the evil intended for Your people,
for tipping the scale towards kindness
is Your attribute.<br>
Forgive us
even if our sins testify against us,
help us; for on You, we depend;
bend our necks to serve You,
with love and reverence
may we serve and honor You.<br>
Those who remember You
have prepared and set aside days of fasting,
their perception has become so shrunken—
they are unable to ask for their needs;
may the outpourings of their prayers
come before You,
bind up each one’s
wounds and pains.<br>
The voice of Jacob cries out
from the depths of Your exile,
may it be heard in the heavens,
the place of Your habitation;
destroy with Your anger, their pursuers.
The year of punishment
for those who strive against Zion,
reveal [to us soon].<br>
You saw and came down—
You acquired us in our youth,
do not cast us off in our old age;
we have gone astray leftward [the way of sin]
let Your right hand bring us near,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Look down and gaze [at our trouble]
and look after Your loved ones,
be girded with Your graciousness
and be garbed with Your righteousness,
be covered with Your compassion,
and be enwrapped with Your kindliness,
and let there appear before You
the attributes of Your goodness and humility.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses];
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>

Chapter 5


Let us hear “I have pardoned”;
You Who dwells
in the shelter of the Most High;
with Your right hand of deliverance,
deliver a people poor and needy.
When we cry to You,
answer us with awesome righteousness,
Adonoy, be our Helper!<br>
I have placed my reliance
upon Him Who is mighty and uplifted,
before Him Who drew me out of the womb,
I pour our my prayer,
perhaps He will lift up my face;
I have set the “Thirteen Attributes” [in my prayer]
according to the order which He ordained,
with these Your precious one [Israel]
will break down the wall [separating us],
remember us still,
Adonoy, be our Helper!<br>
When the wheel of Satan comes like a wave<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When we are overwhelmed with misfortune.</i>
to change our way of thinking,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Misfortune may cause one to change his beliefs.</i>
Your beloved dove [Israel] turns to You, crying:
“Look [and see our troubles;]”
with a yearning soul she approaches You,
regretting her transgressions,
may Your right hand be stretched forth below,
as we watch anxiously.
Adonoy, be our Helper.<br>
To those who gather to beseech Your kindness,
say to them “Here I am.”
Restrain the dominion of our evil inclination,
set in us as though nailed down,
weighing heavily on our necks like a beam,
placed there to hold us in his power.
Who is strong enough
to throw off the stranger [Satan],
or fierce enough to remove him?
Adonoy, be our Helper!<br>
Open the door for the lily [Israel],
O God above,
attend to my meditation
and let me enter the closed gates.
Have compassion on us, anticipate our needs,
heal our wounds with balm;
cleanse my tongue that I may justify myself,
let my iniquity be sought for in vain.
Adonoy, be our Helper!<br>
May the Perfect One grant the silent dove
a goodly portion,
it will be a sign of righteousness—
that she has justified herself in fear of You
—when You deliver her [from exile];
she cries to You, Master
that the time of her liberation is now,
release the sheath from its casing<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">To reveal Your forgiveness of our sins.</i>
let judgement go forth as a light.
Adonoy, be our Helper!<br>
May I succeed in my mission,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph applies to the Chazzan.</i>
to bring back word to those who sent me,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That their prayers were accepted.</i>
You established a strong statute
that the thirteen Attributes as stated,
will strengthen them and not be said in vain;
I have been sent to utter them with might,
and do this You Who bears iniquity,
return now to have compassion upon us.
Adonoy, be our Helper!<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;

Chapter 6

Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Sixth Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.
My eyes were [opened] early
even before the [last two] night watches
to meditate in Your word.
The arrangement of thoughts belong to man,
but from Adonoy comes eloquent speech.
A prayer of the poor
when he is enwrapped [with affliction]
and before Adonoy
he pours out his prayers.
For behold, He forms mountains
and creates winds;
He recounts to man, his [secret] thoughts.
He makes the morning dark
and trods over the high places on earth.
Adonoy, God of Hosts is His Name.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 3


Our God, and God of our fathers!<br>
I will call with Your Name,
I will strengthen myself to grasp You,
my prayer precedes the morning watch,
I awaken the dawn.
I approach the Ark to speak clear words,
I have prepared my speech with great care
so that my lips may move freely.<br>
Behold, my desire is
that God will give ear and answer me,
but where is the competent petitioner
and who is worthy
to say, “I have cleansed my heart
and my deeds are truthful,
I am free from transgression
and the work of my hands is clean?”<br>
Deal magnanimously with the guilty
and do not exterminate them,
let their prayer be esteemed as an offering
and their supplication as sweet incense.
Raise Your bent ones
that they may lift up their heads,
let no sins be found in them,
neither secret ones or public ones.<br>
Be a stronghold in times of distress
for those who trust in You;
do not banish into exile, the wanderers,
those who stray like sheep,
place into Your bottle, the tears
with which I cause my couch to melt,
let my strength be in You,
My Strength and Refuge.<br>
Rescue them and bring them relief,
release Your bound ones,
they cry to You, they knock at Your door,
they call upon You in distress with prayer,
they have been robbed by thieves,
the wicked have surrounded the righteous.
[Almighty] Master and Judge,
why have You concealed Your Presence?<br>
The shouts of Your adversaries—
those who rise against You—
crush them and destroy them;
for the knowers of Your secrets—<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah.</i>
may Your kindness be reserved, always.
Please! Return the dispersed
and gather the exiled,
raise up the lowly to the heights,
and bring the dejected up [to Jerusalem].<br>
Let them say among the nations:
“Adonoy has done great things for them,
the desolate has become [a garden of] Eden,
the ruins have become a fortress.”
Save those who trust in You,
those who sought refuge in Your shelter;
regard [the shame of] their oppression,
this must be done by You.<br>
Hear the prayers of the downtrodden,
look at his crushed spirit,
accept his words favorably—
the outpouring of his prayer.
Strengthen the weak, encourage the faint,
grant him relief
for You are the Sculptor of mountains
and the Creator of winds,
and You relate to man, his conversation.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
My Master, hear our voice;
let Your ears be attentive
to the voice of our supplication.
Unto Adonoy, our God,
is mercy and forgiveness,
though we have been disloyal to Him.
Do not enter into judgement with us,
for no living soul will be justified before You.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Where is Your jealousy
and where are Your mighty deeds,
with which You worked awesome wonders
for the descendants [of those]
with whom You made a covenant?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Patriarchs.</i>
We are driven away and cast out
from our inheritance;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The land of Israel.</i>
Adonoy, [our] God!
We are ruled by masters besides You.<br>
The anxiety of Your impoverished ones
is exceedingly great;
they bear the yoke of Your fear
with their heart and soul and possessions.
They are bowed down and humbled,
exceedingly.
Let Your compassion come swiftly toward us
for we have been brought very low.<br>
The sparkle in our faces has changed
because of those who insult us each day,
they gnash their teeth and say:
“Behold this is the day.”
Reveal the design of Your dominion,
O fearful God,
for we are slain for Your sake
all the day long.<br>
We yearn for the time
of redemption and comfort,
[meanwhile] we are covered with shame
and wrapped with humiliation,
oppressed and enslaved
under the rule of every nation;
and not one of us knows for how long.<br>
King of kings!
remember Your mercy of old,
save those who guard Your unity
from the smoking fire-brands.
Cleanse the stains of their sin
which are red as scarlet;
remember not the sins of our ancestors.<br>
Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate,
my face is hidden [with shame]
and my heart is appalled.
The enemy who laid it waste
condemn
and let Your radiant countenance shine
upon Your desolate Sanctuary.<br>
[Israel] is the possession You acquired of old
for the sake of Your glory,
have compassion and do not destroy her,
for she is the cause of Your praise;
for thus have we been promised
by [Moses] the faithful one of Your House,
“For a merciful Almighty
is Adonoy, your God;
He will not weaken you
and He will not destroy you.”<br>
Remember the likeness of the perfect one<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob.</i>
which is etched on Your throne;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to tradition, Jacob’s likeness is etched on the Heavenly Throne.</i>
Illustrious One!
From the stream of Your delights
give his children to drink;
bestow upon them deliverance,
acquit them from iniquity,
for You are He Who forgives iniquity,
and remits transgression and acquits.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses];

Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,

Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,

Chapter 5


He Who dwells in hidden, high heavens,
my Shield, my Protector,
listen to my cry,
give ear to my song,
cleanse my sin;
O Holy One, grant my hope—
give me my life as my request,
and my people’s as my petition.<br>
Deal charitably with Your people,
Holy One [do it] for Your Name’s sake,
for Your perfect ones have vanished,
[the righteous] who appeased Your anger,
also [the priests] who brought Your offerings;
therefore, I have come now [with prayer].
Give me my life as a request,
and my people’s as my petition.<br>
Drown the sins of my youth,
and let the sea turn them about;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Let them be turned to virtue through repentance.</i>
exalt the righteousness of our ancestors,
and let the prayers of the humble
adorn You as a crown.
And when You purify me as in a crucible,
my accuser [Satan] will bewail,
for my heart will be whole with You;
therefore, I have come now [with prayer].
Give me my life as my request,
and my people’s as my petition.<br>
Gracious and Living One, be gracious to me,
the sound of my cry is in my throat,
answer me when You hear it.
Increase Your forgiveness,
inscribe me for life,
let my righteousness testify for me.
Give me my life as my request,
and my people’s as my petition.<br>
This is my Almighty, deliver me,
and incline the scale in my favor;
reveal Yourself from Your Dwelling,
and grace Your storm-tossed nation;
destroy my slanderer [Satan]
let him not prove Your flock guilty,
lest I witness misfortune—
the destruction of my kin.
Give me my life as my request,
and my people’s as my petition.<br>
Sanctify Your holy Name
which they<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The nations that destroyed the Temples.</i> profaned in Your Sanctuary,
and [killed] Your holy priests<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. the Aharonites, descendants of Aharon, the first priest of God.</i>
who brought Your burnt-offerings.
For what can [Israel] Your holy ones do
now that Your offerings have ceased?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They have no offerings to atone their iniquities.</i>
Therefore we beseech You to regard
the prayers of Your holy ones
as if they offered heifers.
Give me my life as my request,
and my people’s as my petition.<br>
Accept [the prayers of] Your servants
for the sake of Your glorious Name;
they proclaim Your Unity and testify
that there is none beside You;
please seek out Your lost ones [Israel]
as they approach You in prayer,
for Your love for them is great,
therefore, I seek Your Presence.
Give me my life as my request,
and my people’s as my petition.<br>
Let my voice be as desirable
as fat offerings offered in Zion;
please turn to me for goodness
and let me find grace [in Your eyes],
for to whom shall I turn now
that I am without support?
I pray, forgive those who hope in You,
and let them hear “I have forgiven.”
Give me my life as my request,
and my people’s as my petition.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,

Chapter 6

Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Seventh Day



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
How long shall the wicked—
Adonoy—
how long shall the wicked rejoice?
Against Your people they plot deceitfully,
they conspire against those sheltered by You.
They have given the corpse of Your servants
as food to the birds of the heavens;
the flesh of Your pious ones
to the beasts of the earth.
They have no mercy on infants.
nor do their eyes pity young children.
Pour out Your wrath upon them,
and may Your fierce anger overtake them.
For You will again bring us life,
and Your people will rejoice in You.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 3


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
The virgin daughter of Judah
is full of pain and sobbing,
she bewails herself
[and] spreads her hands [in prayer]
from the depths of her captivity.
From the narrowness [of distress]
I call out to You,
Answer me
with the breadth of Divine relief;
from out of fire and water
bring her into safety.<br>
She lifts her eyes for help,
she looks to all sides;
she trembles [like a woman]
giving birth to her first child,
her birth pains
are compounded by her delicate nature.
She claps her hands,
and murmurs in her thoughts:
“Where now is my hope,
and [the fulfillment of] my hope
who will see?”<br>
The beloved of her soul and her Dwelling,
her ornament and pride [the Holy Temple]
have been given into the hands
of those who revile her,
into the palms of those who afflict her.
They yell out amid their assemblies,
giving voice, they taunt her, saying:
“Where is the word of Adonoy?”
“Let it come now [and deliver them].”<br>
From captivity to exile, driven and shattered
is Your nation that was once feared;
[this resulted] from Your fierce anger
and the terror of Your wrath.
With her broken spirit and bitter voice,
she cries out to You:
“Where is Your indignation and Your might?”<br>
You have abandoned Your people,
the House of Israel,
in the land of their captivity;
they are tossed about in the enemies’ land
like a ship in the heart of the sea.
Babes ask their fathers:
“Where are the wonders of the shepherd?”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Moses.</i>
Where is He
Who brought them out of the [Reed] Sea?<br>
Degenerates and non-entities
have trampled our inheritance [the Temple],
they have driven us far from our country
from the borders of our land;
we said: “We are cut off, our hope is lost.”
“Where are all Your wonders
of which our fathers told us?”<br>
Remember Adonoy to the sons of Edom,
the destruction of Your Temple,
the shattering of my mighty ones
and the dismemberment
of the infants of Your congregation;
uncover Your mighty arm—demand from them
an account of the flock of Your pasture:
“Where is the flock that was given you?”<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Adonoy! bring back our exiles
like springs in the desert.
Turn away from Your fierce anger
and let Your mind be changed
concerning the evil intended for Your people.
Return Adonoy—how long?
and change Your mind about Your servants.
Return to us, God of our deliverance,
and annul Your anger toward us.
Enter not into judgement with us,
for no living soul will be justified before You.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
The glory of the honored [Israel] has ceased,
the eloquent spokesman is silenced.
She dwells in depression,
weak and feeble is she
who was once a proud ruler.
She who was protected like a delicate rose,
sits in mourning, turned backwards;
diminished and despondent
are her Levites and Aharonites [Priests],
and villagers.<br>
The praiseworthy one has been vilified
profaned as an unfaithful wife,
cast aside like a <i>niddah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A woman in menstruation is prohibited from being intimate with her husband.</i>
impure as a <i>metzorah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A spiritual disease, often mistakenly interpreted as leprosy.</i>
Her crown and glory are profaned,
her strongholds cut off,
she is again dispersed
in an uncultivated land.<br>
Your flock—amid turmoil and anger—
has been devoured by the unclean,
he gnashes his teeth,
he runs to swallow them—
[to satisfy his] hunger and thirst.
The powers of Your might [Oh God]—
where and how will it become known?
[Punish those] who offer incense to idols
time and time again.<br>
The long rule of the rebellious—
why have You made it permanent?
The degenerate rules over the prince,
the evil one rules over the nobleman.
His hope is on You,
save him who is called by Your Name;
be a help to him,
a stronghold and a refuge.<br>
Turn to the prayer of the supplicant,
and accept his plea;
overlook the stench of his sins,
cleanse his stain as with nitre [soap]
open the prison [exile],
release the condemned,
uplift and restore their name,
let them remain for a life of goodness.<br>
Smite those who torture us,
strike them, excise them, crush them,
arouse Your vengeance,
sound the war-cry, shout like a warrior;
the lost ones, the remote ones—
yearn for them, collect them, assemble them,
gather them, give them rest, uplift them,
take them up from the pit.<br>
Announce the deliverance [of Israel],
establish the ramparts and walls [of Jerusalem]
humble the haughty [nations],
demote their arrogant leaders;
those who trust in You—
return them to Your Resting Place [Jerusalem]
according to Your promise of consolation,
[then] will the tyrants who rule them
be clothed in disgrace and humiliation.<br>
Almighty God, rescue Your servants,
make Your loved ones successful,
quickly bring near the time [of deliverance],
send them [Your] redemption;
pardon us our Father
and forgive our sins,
for You Adonoy are good and forgiving.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite

Chapter 5


If our iniquities testify against us,
we come before You [with remorse]
and we rely on Your [merciful] Name;
as a father has mercy on his children,
so too have mercy on us,
as one who is comforted by his mother,
may we be comforted by You.
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
You Adonoy are good and forgiving,
but the evil inclination has corrupted us,
—Your children—despite their transgression
You will not cast them off;
our devastated hearts are gripped by sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The stench of our sin.</i>
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
You Who are great in kindness,
Who preserves merit
for thousands of generations,
deal with us with Your mercy and kindness,
and not with the opposite attributes.
Your promise<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Of benevolence.</i> was not empty or misleading,
therefore we yearn for Your kindness
as those who are exhausted and faint.
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
With rapt attention [Your] messenger<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Moses.</i> listened
[to Your words that he might know] if even those who desecrate Your Torah
might still be saved;
You strengthened him
[by] teaching him Your way of amnesty,
with that same attribute, acquit us.
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
Remembering forgotten things—
this is Your praise,
You diminish [Your] anger, [causing it to last]
no longer than a spoken word;
[therefore] articulate life [for us]
in Your judgement.
Grant us undeserved grace
as You search our hearts.
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
Into the mud amidst the stormy sea
cause our sins to sink—
the unintentional, the intentional,
the hidden ones and the revealed;
[You] know that our [evil] inclination
has caused us to do these deeds,
lift Your hand to do good for us.
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
You search the innards of man
and the paths of his heart, [to know]
does he walk in the proper and upright path
or does he follow the whim of his heart?
Is his heart humble or is he insulting?
Let the bitterness of sin
be sweetened [with repentance],
that he not return as a “dog to his vomit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">An idiomatic expression used by the Sages to describe one who returns to his previous sin.</i>
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
You save even those
whose judgements indicate a death penalty,
we cry out to You with yearning:
lighten and remove the burden of iniquity
lest it becomes part of us;
may our sins be forgiven and forgotten
when the Accuser comes to indict us.
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
[Although] the record of our guilt
has been signed by witnesses,
declare his indictment a forgery
and thereby silence his claim;
our sins are as visible as a stain,
through Your mercy, let them be removed.
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
Clear the stone<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Evil Inclination which is an impediment to us.</i> from Your path
let it be straightened;
turn to our never emptying river of tears,
this rock<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See previous note.</i> is an obstacle for young and old—
destroy it,
and as an eagle has mercy on her nestlings
have mercy on Your habitation.
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
“Quick to be appeased”—this is Your praise,
the heavy yoke born by Your legion—
let it be modified and exchanged;
Your quarrel [with the sinner] is not eternal,
have mercy [even] in Your anger,
[even] when You exercise judgement.
Do not rebuke us with Your anger,
lest we be [completely] diminished.<br>
Some repent in their later years,
but more praiseworthy are those
who repent in their earlier years,
it is good to be implanted in uprighteness,
from early youth;
shield us, free us from Your anger,
be gracious with us.

Chapter 6

Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 7

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Erev Rosh Hashana



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the following two sentences and the congregation repeats them.</i></small><br>
<b>Fortunate is the people</b>
<b>that understand the call of the teruah,</b>
<b>Adonoy,</b>
<b>in the light of Your Presence they will walk.</b>
<b>With trumpets and the sound of the shofar</b>
<b>raise your voice before the King, Adonoy.</b><br>
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>

Chapter 3

<small><i>The following prayer was composed by Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac (</i>Rashi<i>).</i></small><br>
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
Who is feared by the heavenly angels,
You said, “Repent you stubborn children,
come to Me with thanksgiving and praise,
seek My Presence
with tears and supplications.<br>
Though the doors are closed
to expressions of prayer,
the gates are open to the penitent—
even the windows,
Your words stand firm for all time;
Your ways of goodness
are forever unchangeable.<br>
Behold, we come before You
like the poor and needy,
the righteousness is Yours,
and the iniquity is ours,
we return to You with shameful faces,
and at Your gates we moan like doves.<br>
Remember us for a [good] proper life,
cleanse our stains
that they be pure and white,
erase the sins of our youth,
let them vanish like clouds;
renew our days as the days of old.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Before we sinned.</i><br>
Remove [our] defilement
and abolish [our] presumptuous sins,
cleanse [us]
sprinkle upon us the faithful [pure] waters.
We know our wickedness,
we are rebellious and as evil as thorns,
our necks are as stiff as oaks.<br>
The vineyard of our planting,
is overgrown with weeds [sins]
it is covered with nettles and thorns [evil]
accustomed to doing evil,
clinging to sun-deities,
taking bribes, pursuing pay-offs.<br>
We have quickly profaned
the wedding-canopy<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai is compared to a wedding canopy.</i>
since then we have been thrust backward
and not forward,
gone are the sacrifices of choice rams,
the fragrance of the incense-offerings.<br>
Gone are the captain(s) of fifty,
the advisor(s), the man (men) of honor,
the deputy [High Priest],
the Annointed [High Priest], the Levites,
and the Aaronites [sons of Aaron].
Behold! we stand impoverished and empty
grieved in spirit, bitter as wormwood.<br>
We remember You in our distress
with an outpouring of prayers,
in fear of Your judgement,
we worry and groan;
let righteousness spring forth
for the faithful,
Order the removal of our early iniquities.<br>
Let the voice [of our prayer] that calls,
put an end to those who contend with us,
let it hush the accuser
and silence the antagonists.
Let our humble spirit,
our subdued and broken hearts,
be as acceptable to You
as the fat of the sacrifice.<br>
The oath You swore to the Patriarchs—
fulfill unto their children,
the cry of Your callers
hear from heaven;
prepare their hearts to fear You,
may Your ear be attentive
to the words of their supplication.<br>
Return to raise Your people
from destruction,
let come swiftly to us
Your former mercy,
in their judgement,
let Your favored ones be found innocent.
They hope for Your lovingkindness,
and depend on Your compassion.<br>
For in Your abundant mercy
we trust,
and on Your righteousness, we rely,
and for Your pardon, we hope,
and for Your deliverance, we yearn.
You are a King
Who loves righteousness from of old,
Who passes over the iniquities of His people,
and removes the sins of those who fear Him.
You made a covenant with the Patriarchs,
and will keep [Your] oath
with their descendants.
You are He Who descended
in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai,
and disclosed the ways of Your goodness
to Moses, Your servant.
The ways of Your kindliness,
You revealed to him;
and You made known to him
that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness,
and full of beneficence,
guiding the entire world
with the quality of mercy.
And so it is written:
“And He said:
‘I will cause to pass
all My goodness before you,
and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy
in your presence;
I will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious,
and I will be compassionate
to whom I will be compassionate.’”<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
Do not enter into judgment with us,
for no living soul will be justified before You.
Seek Adonoy when He is accessible,
call Him when He is near.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
Adonoy is close to the broken-hearted,
and those crushed in spirit, He delivers.
For what nation is there so great
that has God so near unto them,
as Adonoy, our God
in all that we call upon Him?
For Your sake, our God, act!
and not for our sake.
See how we stand impoverished and empty.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
How can I open my mouth,
and how can I lift my eyes,
when in me there are no good deeds
and in my hand there is no merit?
I shout, I am like a drunkard,
and like one overcome with wine.
I am like a warrior
without weapons:<br>
The humble heart trembles,
for gone is [the righteous one]
appointed to intercede on our behalf;
and who is left to open his mouth—
the fool, and one who lacks perception.
His transgression is concealed in him,
and his iniquity is imprisoned within him,
he is a sinner and full of rebelliousness,
a captive of the despicable [evil inclination].<br>
Filled with distraction is this humiliated heart
of him who comes to entreat You,
the straight path he has distorted,
[and] he despises admonition,
[for] he has become twisted and crooked.
His knee is weak because of his guilt,
and the filth of his sin is his obstacle;
in his heart he thinks of iniquity,
and his deeds cause him to stumble.<br>
Rebuttals and excuses to offer—
what can I find?
I have become repulsive and polluted
for I am filled with disgrace and derision.
The abundance of my tears has not endured,
its source has been interrupted;
[even] my assembly [for prayer]
is filled with iniquity and deceit,
and my fast days filled with strife.<br>
Erase our transgression, forgive our iniquity,
and atone our guilt.
I cry out from an aching heart,
that is disgraced, shamed and humiliated:
“Quiet Your wrath, calm Your rage,
and annul Your anger;
be pleased with [our emmissary who seeks<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the Chazzan.</i>]
to make us favored and loved [in Your eyes],
and confound [Satan] who digs pits for us.”<br>
Remember the tribes of Israel!
Prepare yourselves with pure hearts,
with whole hearts, uphold [the Mitzvos],
and bring forth your supplication,
do homage in purity [of heart].
When Adonoy makes Himself accessible,
seek Him with added might,
He will not shame or detest
the cry of the humble and crushed [heart].<br>
A day of deliverance and a time of favor
may I find in Your Presence;
fit, worthy and faultless,
may I be considered in Your eyes.
When I stand in prayer
to plead for mercy on Your children,
let us hear, “I have bestowed favor on you,”
“I have pardoned you”—
may this be told us from Your Dwelling.<br>
Quickly, seek the Presence of the Almighty,
excise the hardness of your hearts,
remove the obstacle [the evil inclination],
clear the way and straighten the crooked,
abandon iniquity and confess,
and do not continue to harden [your hearts].
He who knows of his sin,
let him repent and show regret,
let him accept words of admonition,
and let him plead [for forgiveness].<br>
Listen O Master to my supplication,
give ear to my prayer,
be pleased with my cry,
be appeased and conciliated
and accept my prayer;
I call You out of distress,
be near to me and come deliver me,
quickly, help me, my Master, my deliverer.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Do not enter into judgement with us
for no living soul will be justified before You.
When You appoint a time, O God
to judge us with uprightness.
Hear the voice of our supplications
when we cry out to You.
When we lift our hands
toward the Holy of Holies of Your Sanctuary.
Save our souls from death
and sustain us from hunger.
And You Adonoy, are our shield,
our glory and the uplifter of our heads.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 5

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Joseph ben Isaac of Orleans (1150).</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Master! when You appoint a time
to judge us rightly with Your might,
I stand trembling
to see Your Presence, to exalt You,
for I do not depend on my deeds,
but only on Your mercy.
Adonoy! Do it for the sake of Your Name.<br>
The faithful ones have been cut off—
the mighty, with power to intercede,
[gone] also are those who made fences
and stood in the breach<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Defending the integrity of Yiddishkeit.</i>
who forcefully brought their petition
before Him Who dwells in the high heavens.
The pious man has perished from the earth.<br>
Behold, I am unworthy,
and what can I answer with my mouth?
Behold, I am young [insignificant]
without good deeds in my hand;
how, then, can I hope
when I am so full of fault?
Let the words of my mouth be acceptable.<br>
I tremble and I am afraid
to express my wishes;
I fear my wickedness
and my rebellious disobedience;
Gracious One, have mercy on me
as I confess my sins and forsake them.
Hear the voice of my supplication,
when I cry out to You.<br>
I have erred
but behold I repent and confess
[in order] to do Your will;
You Who are pure of eyes,
consider me as perfect in Your Presence;
God, deal with me
more leniently than to the letter of Your law.
And let me know You
[so] that I might find favor in Your eyes.<br>
May Your power be magnified
and be adorned with my prayer,
as with the prayer of a [wise] old man,
who is fluent in prayer
and of blameless character.
My heart is crushed, humbled and grieved.
Look from the heavens and behold.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,

Chapter 6

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Joseph ben Isaac of Orleans (1150).</i></small><br>
Our God and god of our fathers!<br>
The needs of Your people are numerous,
but [since] their knowledge is limited—
their wants and desires
they are unable to recount;
please [therefore] regard our thoughts
even before we call.
The Almighty, Great, Powerful and Awesome.<br>
Utterly extinct are they
that knew how to invoke [You],
with the order of prayers
to express them with eloquence;
we are left bare and evil has increased,
therefore we have not attained deliverance.<br>
We have not the arrogance
to approach You with supplication,
[for] we have transgressed, rebelled,
and perverted our ways;
Your charitable benevolence is all we ask
as we set forth Your praise,
we who stand in the House of God, nightly.<br>
Holy One, behold!
how the capable advocate is extinct,
accept my words [of prayer]
as if it were a generous offering;
let my praise today
be fastened to Your crown,
Almighty, girded with might.<br>
Regard my plea
and may my prayer be pleasant [before You],
hear my prayer as if it were perfect,
decree for us a good life,
and make good for us
the inscription and seal.
You suspend the earth on nothingness.<br>
Stretch out Your hand
and accept my repentance as I stand,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Before You.</i>
please pardon and forgive my evil deeds.
Please turn and occupy Yourself
with the welfare of those who seek You,
my friend and my support;
for You, Adonoy, are a shield about me.<br>
Do not despise my words of praise,
I have exalted Your majesty
according to my limited wisdom;
fulfill for good my desire and my request
God, my Master, is my strength.
Let my words be pleasant [before You]
and be receptive to my prayer,
add to my account [of merit]
every word [of praise and prayer],
Holy One, regard my standing [in prayer]
as a meal-offering mixed with oil.
Give ear, God of Jacob, forever.<br>

Do not enter into judgement with us
for no living soul will be justified before You.
Give ear, Adonoy, to our prayer
listen to the voice of our supplication.
What can we say before You, Adonoy, our God
what can we speak
and how can we justify ourselves?
We have sinned, as have our fathers,
we have caused others to sin,
and we have caused others to do evil.
The sins and transgressions of our youth,
do not recall.
According to Your kindness
should You remember us,
for the sake of Adonoy.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,

Chapter 7

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Solomon Ibn Gabirol (1021–1056).</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
We beseech You, arouse Your old love,
with which You loved [Israel],
the uncountable congregation,
with every term of love, brotherhood
and friendship, You designated them;
for the sake of my brethren and companions,
let me speak, I beseech You.<br>
When You set foot on Mount [Sinai]
to delight us with Your ancient treasure,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah which existed even before Creation.</i>
You likened us to a kingdom of priests
and a holy nation, [calling us] “My son”;
and she [Israel] then said:
“He is my brother, my King, and my Master.”<br>
You caused them [Israel] to inherit
a delightful heritage, the sweet portion;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Land of Israel.</i>
Your glory [Shechinah] You caused to frequent
between the images of the Cherubim;
and now they [Israel] have been driven away
by strangers and evil doers.
In a land that is not theirs,
Your brethren now sojourn.<br>
Remember, do not forget,
be not silent and do not rest, Almighty,
for Edom and Ishmael wanted to cut me off,
Gracious One, You know
of all these afflictions,
so speak Your brethren, Israel.<br>
Plunderers beset me and emptied me,
to exchange the clean for the unclean,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To renounce Judaism.</i>
oppressors tried to force me,
behold, every day
how Your servants are beaten and whipped;
the voice of Your brother’s blood cries out.<br>
They have dug a pit to trap me;
my soul faints and yearns
to seek Your help,
knock at my door and be my deliverance,
[and say] “I seek my brothers.”<br>
From the Day of Rosh Hashana<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Metsudah T’hillim page 165 note 4.</i>
when You sit on Your glorious throne
and look down to examine simultaneously
the hearts of those who rebel against You
and the hearts of those who serve You,
exact with force
the debt from all who rebel against You;
but whatever Your brother owes You,
let Your hand release.<br>
When the Books [of Life and Death] are read
for the creatures of Your world,
decreeing life or the opposite [of life]
to the rich and the poor;
Most High grant favor and kindness
in Your Sanctuary [of judgement].
Be surety for Your servant for good,
so that Your brother may live with You.<br>
Turn to me and be gracious to me,
and set me on high,
cause those who provoke You to perish
in wretchedness and in poverty;
but when You apportion the sustenance
giving each his yearly provision,
do not shut Your hand
from Your needy brother.<br>
I rise before dawn
and cry to You my Creator.
Forward Your kindness
and forgive my transgression and treachery.
Let Your mercy be extended to me
as one who comforts me in my mourning.
O that You were like a brother to me.<br>
Consider the supplication of Your poor ones
and [hear their] cry,
satiated with troubles are their souls and spirit;
cast into the depths of the sea
all their sins;
we beseech You, forgive now,
the transgression of Your brothers,
and their sins.<br>
I rejoice at the word of Your promise,
You drew our hearts [to You]
through Your messengers [the prophets];
when will You reveal Your mighty arm?
Go now and see
to the peace [welfare] of Your brothers.<br>
You were always the hope of Israel
and the sword of their pride,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Israel took pride that God fought their battles.</i>
living God, lift up their stature now,
strengthen their arm and dwell among them;
and Your brothers, remember them for peace
and their families too.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,

and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Do not enter into judgement with us
for no living soul will be justified before You.
Give ear Adonoy to our prayer,
listen to the voice of our supplication.
What can we say before You Adonoy our God?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Our God, we are ashamed and embarrassed
to lift up our faces to You, our God,
for great is our desertion,
to You we have sinned.
We have sinned together with our fathers,
we have been malicious and have done evil.
The sins of our youth, and our transgressions,
do not recall.
According to Your kindness, remember us,
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 8

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Joel ben Isaac HaLevi.</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
My eye pours out tears to God
when I cry to You, say, “I am here;”
give ear to my words when I pray,
Answer me God, answer me.<br>
When You weigh my actions on the scale,
[You will see] that in Your commandments,
my share and desire is insignificant,
and if You reward me according to my work
I am afraid, for I am bare [of good deeds].<br>
Banish and consume, sin and rebellion
uncover the flask of healing, [heal my soul]
let [only] my righteousness testify
before my Creator,
tomorrow [Rosh Hashana]
when You come to decide my recompense.<br>
Wash away the stain
and whiten the redness [of sin].
Consider that their origin is dust,
repay them not according to their deeds
for great is the wickedness of man.<br>
The sinful soul, how can it be atoned?
Riches are of no avail, nor great ransom
for You have set as witness [Satan]
who is quick to testify
to our sins, committed inside and outside.<br>
How can one deny [his] guilt
when his own hand lists
his perverse deeds and all his activities,
and how can he say:
“Who knows the count [of my misdeeds]?”
When the plague is engraved on the wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When his sins are obvious.</i><br>
The pure [angels] who accompany you
in every region,
who are alert to guard you
wherever you go;
even [the soul] that lies within man
testifies against rich and poor alike
when it stands before the King.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Each evening the soul returns to Heaven and reports man’s activities.</i><br>
I tremble, for nothing is hidden from Him,
Who relates to man his every word,
and even his thoughts as he lies on his bed.
He must give an accounting to His Creator.<br>
Before your feet stumble [before death]
[when your] pledge [the soul is returned]
cleanse yourself from all iniquity,
because you will not be saved
by all the wealth you leave behind,
when the Ruler says, “Come, give account.”<br>
You appointed four periods<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Mesechet Rosh Hashana 16a.</i> and set them
to judge the remnant of Your inheritance,
and if they have trespassed against You
regard the covenant [with the Patriarchs]
and do not stand in the crossway
to cut them off.<br>
For on the day of Rosh Hashana<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Metsudah T’hillim page 165 note 4.</i>
every man’s fate comes
before his Creator,
be he poor or rich, he is judged,
some go up and some go down.<br>
Appoint a just advocate for Your people,
when all mankind come
to be counted with Your rod,
like a flock of sheep passing by
the hand of one who counts them.<br>
Let Your people’s judgement be first.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Before the Almighty is angered by the other nations.</i>
Lift their souls from destruction,
assure them of goodness,
and judge each nation by itself,
let there not be an inter-mixture.<br>
Illustrious God,
who can be associated with You?
Ordinarily
no one uses a broken vessel,
but You do not despise
a humble and broken heart;
is anything too miraculous for Adonoy?<br>
Clear away the stumbling block<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Evil Inclination.</i>
that the path may become smooth,
“Depart you unclean one!”
call out to the concealed fool,
for the enemy cares not of our hurt;
come let us deal wisely with him,
lest he become too mighty.<br>
Man serves two masters
during the years of his life,
doing the will of his Creator
or serving his [evil] inclination;
but well for him who clings to his Creator
all of his [life] time,
then he is a servant free from his master.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Evil Inclination.</i><br>
He who prepares his meal before evening,
he who works in this [world]
will be prepared for the future [world];
but he who waits for the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">When death approaches.</i>
what gain will he have?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This is a paraphrase of the saying, “He who prepares before the Sabbath, will have what to eat on the Sabbath.”</i>
That which is crooked
cannot be made straight.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Koheles 1:15.</i><br>
Therefore, we hasten to pray even before
the Day of Judgement, listen to our prayer;
fasting and whole-hearted repentance
will turn away Your wrath,
but not [like the dog]
which returns to his vomit
to sin again and repent,
for no opportunity will be given him
to repent.<br>
Rise you who sleep in the cave of Machpelah,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Patriarchs.</i>
and help me,
I am disgraced, and I have no good deeds,
cry out and pray to God, with me,
and from the strength [of your deeds]
offer a gratuity on my behalf.<br>
Arouse Your mercy
to strengthen those that are powerless,
Exalted One, [do it]
for they were forgotten these many years,
open the gates of tears
for [Your] beautiful plants [Israel],
who come weeping and supplicating [to You].<br>
Almighty One, because of our rebellion,
we are considered strangers,
but now that we return to You
have mercy on us as a father on his sons;
remember that You called us children,
and You are the one Father of us all,
why diminish the Name of our Father?
I have no offering to present to You,
in exchange accept my prayer and plea,
please accept the present
that goes before me,
and let all these people know
that You are Adonoy.<br>
You made known and ordained
repentance even before creation,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">God knew that the world could not exist without repentance.</i>
God considered it a benefit [to man],
and so we hasten to return to You;
cause us to return to You Adonoy
and we shall return.<br>
Your loved ones cry out,
they beseech You with great murmuring,
let their voice be heard in His Dwelling,
from on high;
may His mercy be aroused
in the merit of the three Patriarchs,
may Almighty God grant you mercy.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,

“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
The Rock, His work is perfect,
for all His ways are justice.
Almighty of faithfulness, without iniquity,
just and right is He.
For Your judgement they stand today,
for they are all Your servants.
Blow the shofar on the new month,
at the appointed time for our festive day.
For it is a statute for Israel,
a day of judgement of the God of Jacob.
Your righteousness
is like the mighty mountains,
Your judgements like the great deep;
man and beast, You deliver, Adonoy.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>

Chapter 9


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Trusted God, extend help
and do goodness to Your entire nation
[when] they come together to be judged.
[He] Who knows their innermost thoughts
[and] rules the world with His might
brings to judgment for everything hidden.<br>
God, Who is exalted through judgment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. by bringing the evil to justice, all perceive Him ruling the world.</i>
[and] sanctified through His righteousness,
[powerful] as the mighty mountains
when He judges Israel.<br>
Remove retribution from those You carry,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">“Those You carry,” i.e. the nation of Israel.</i>
those who exalt You with “Grace and truth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. those who recognize God’s grace and truth.</i>
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your Throne.<br>
Straighten before You, a crooked heart,
Your judgment bores through the mountain<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. nothing can stand in the way of God’s judgment.</i>—
the justice of the God of Jacob.
The righteousness of Your virtues
are delightful,
the world’s inhabitants learned justice
as they stand to be judged by You.<br>
Your seal [of justice] is pure and clean,
according to man’s acts [his fate] is sealed.
[Thus], the judgments of God are true.
All fear the Prosecutor
Who grinds and pulverizes finely.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. who investigates to the minutest detail.</i>
The judgments of God are true and just.<br>
He is a good supporter as He promised,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. He is good to us even when punishing us.</i>
on this day<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. on the judgment day.</i> He will forget His wrath
when He judges His nation.
Those clinging to You pour [their hearts] out in prayer,
and praise You for Your perfect laws
[and] for Your righteous judgment.<br>
Erase the stain of sin
let them not be shamed,
those who look to You in hope
and do justice for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">“Do … them” i.e. avenge them.</i>
We were established to remember Your Name
we were placed for an everlasting covenant.
[Thus] do not come into judgment with us.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. do not judge us harshly.</i><br>
The One Who rules the angels!
May He close the breach with compassion
and through judgment establish the Land.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. may He rebuild our land by first avenging us.</i>
My songs praise Him the entire day
for we do not find Him burdening us
[For it is God’s (way) to be just].
Strengthen Your nation with Your kindness,
to their cries open Your heavens
as befits those who love Your Name.
We will throw all our burdens upon You.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e.—we will trust in You to care for all our problems.</i>
Tip the scales with love<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. out of Your love for us let our merits outweigh our discretions.</i>
for Your justice is good.<br>
Shine Your countenance to forgive me
for my sin
do not extinguish my ember<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Do not have me die.</i>
for to Your justice do I look forward.
Find us righteous as one being,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Consider us as one with the rest of the Jewish nation.</i>
keep us from the blaze of the coming day<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">“Coming day”—i.e. the day of Judgment.</i>
for Your judgment is unfathomable.<br>
Bring Your tribes closer to salvation,
who are tied to the ropes of Your chastisement
and the righteousness of Your judgment.
Song from the heart of flesh and soul
shall rise to You to the heavens,
the place of judgment is there.<br>
Our Judge, Who formed us with Your hands,
teach Your ways to those who look to You
as well as all the Laws that you commanded.
Bestow Your abundant goodness,
Your powerful mercy according to our will.
As is Your manner, grant us life.<br>
The Temple [has become] stones of the field.
Hurry to establish its foundation;
Zion will be redeemed through justice.
Avenge Me from my enemies
Who have scattered me.
Lop off the horns
of those who have scattered me
and Your judgment [of my enemies]
will save me.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite

“For You, my Master,

Do not enter into judgment with us
for no living soul will be justified before You.
God is our hope and strength,
our help in trouble, He is most accessible.
May God favor us and bless us,
may He cause His countenance to shine
among us forever.
God judges,
this one He humbles and this one He exalts.
God, deliver us with Your Name,
and with Your might, judge us.
God, hear our prayer,
give ear to the words of our mouth.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
cause us to return to You,
enlighten us with Your countenance
and we will be delivered.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;

Chapter 10

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Yoel ben Yitzchak HaLevi.</i></small><br>
God! Let Him choose for Himself
the scattered sheep<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Israel, which is scattered among nations as sheep among the wolves.</i>
and let Him deliver her.
To the sound of her cries
let Him listen and be attentive,
lest she be destroyed
by the sword and arrow.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Of the nations.</i>
Oh, why does He allow
the evil one to blaspheme God.<br>
God! I tremble at the uproar,
the tumultous clamor<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Of our enemies.</i>
urging me to refute Your Oneness.
They oppress Your inheritance,
why, [God, do you permit them]
to remove me from my belief in You.
so that the vile one can say in his heart
that there is no God.<br>
God! do not remain silent
over our spilt blood,
over our arrayed limbs
that have filled [many] chambers.
Why do You ignore without hearing
that he has villified the armies of God.<br>
God! be our Protector and we shall sing
at the demise of the evil ones
who say: “Do not partake of Your Torah,
and what is the benefit
that you chose the honored God;
it is in vain to worship God.”<br>
God! The nations have come
to tire and exhaust Your inheritance,
with poured graven images
they have made their sign as a sign.
See that they have cut off the sheep
from their habitat,
and they have said:
“We shall inherit for ourselves
the dwelling of God.”<br>
God! Inquire into this
that they<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The nations.</i> have decided to slaughter
[our] infants and sucklings
who have volunteered for the sword,
and appointed themselves
to be brought as sacrifices
to the altar of God.<br>
God of hosts! please return
and avenge me from the hands of Esau
for he has enticed me
saying: what [hope] is there,
for You have given up on me
and that I have been forgotten by God.<br>
They<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> rejected any new god
for vain is its worship.
They cleaved to their Creator
and spat at their books of philosophy;
and each of them gave
his spirit and body<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">To sanctify God’s holy Name.</i>
and none is left
for they were<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “he was.”</i> taken by God.<br>
“God is holy,” they pronounced,
and confessed [the sins] of their souls,
without concealing their sins.
To their mothers they cried out:
“Hurry and bind us,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">So that we will not resist.</i>
for through us God will be honored.”<br>
Let God fight for him<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the nation of Israel.</i>
just as He gave over His people
to be cut down
like heads of grain stalks.
May she be<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the soul of His nation.</i> bound
to those who sit in a circle<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Sanhedrin who customarily sit in a semi-circle.</i>
[in the garden of Eden] of God.<br>
God! To those who are pure of heart
my eyes flow [with tears like] water
when I remember that with their feet
they dragged them along the roads.
Hear the voice of those who blaspheme,
those who speak repulsive words;
enough of their sounds, O God.<br>
God! Accept me! And be a strength
to those who come under Your wing
to find protection from the beasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><span>לבְאָיִם</span>—lit. lions.</i>
They have run for Your help
to be saved from conspiracy<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Of the nations.</i>
by being together with God.<br>
God! May they fall in their conspiracies,
these planners [of evil].
May their memory be blotted
and lay Your anger upon them.
May [they] very speedily
[receive] their just rewards upon their heads
and let all nations be erased
those [nations] who have forgotten God.<br>
Living God!
May we please fall into Your hands,
but into the hands of the evil
do not deliver Your servants.
Seek the vengeance of the persecuted
the children of Your beloved ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i>
How dear is Your kindness, O God!<br>
God! You have abandoned us
and we are at fault.
Therefore, my heart trembles
and I sit stunned.
Hurry to help me
from those who rise up [against me].
Save me from bloodiness, God!<br>
God! Let the voice of my speech
and the voice of [Your] flock
come before You
from the ends of the world.
Return us unto You
and release us from oppression.
And let my prayer be
at a time of acceptance to You, Adonoy.
God.<br>
Almighty! King!

they<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the <i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah.</i> are strongly supported forever

Blessed is Adonoy
Who looks down from the heavenly aperture;
Who leads me in the true way.<br>
Truth (the Torah) was in His Mouth
when He created His world<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash states that God used the Torah as a blueprint for creating the world.</i>
a delight He holds upon His lap
to cleave together.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah being the wisdom of God is looked upon as one with God.</i>
All His deeds
are based upon its (the Torah’s) advice.
All God’s ways are goodness and truth.<br>
Those who act truthfully,
humbly and righteously
merit their reward [in the world to come].
The One Who acts with justice
and righteousness
will not stay aloof from them.
The evil person
who commits acts of falsehood,
his mouth will be stopped up.
But, the one who plants righteousness
will receive true and lasting reward.<br>
Remember to give true reward
to the smallest of nations,
Israel that is saved by Adonoy
an everlasting salvation.
Therefore, come, find protection,
in the shadow of Him Who rests on high,
and serve Him with perfection and truth.<br>
You [God] desire that truth
[be rooted] in our innermost selves
and You said [to us]: “Improve your ways.”
[With] truth and justice
shall you judge within your gates.
Therefore, you children of Jacob
remove your evil deeds [and then]
will your true words become apparent.<br>
He arranged “<span>אֶמֶת</span>“ to be His seal
to make it known that He is One
and there is no other.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">“He arranged — other.” There is nothing that can stand in the way of His fulfilling His promises; hence His seal of “truth.”</i>
This is my God and I will glorify Him,
the God of my father and I will exalt Him.
Adonoy is close to all who call to Him,
to all who truly call to Him.<br>
My mouth will utter [words of] Truth<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Torah.</i>
and I will speak of Your Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Torah.</i>
I will recall my song [of praise] at night
and that I cleaved to Your Torah.
God! Remember this for the good
of all the members of Your covenant.
You, Adonoy, are close [to us]
and all Your precepts are true.<br>
My flesh truly yearns for You,
Creator of the world.
[I pray] that You save Your servants
from poverty and loss,
and take pity on all the children
of the one who left “Kasdim.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Abraham who originated from Ur Kasdim.</i>
Righteousness and justice
are the fundamentals of Your Throne

Truth remains forever

Strengthen [and encourage] the victim,

He should tremble from the judgment day.

And please beseech the countenance of God
to bring closer the end which is hidden<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The days of the Messiah.</i>
and give to me a truthful sign [that your prayers were accepted].<br>
Truth and justice shall uplift
the nation that has been weakened,
but the kindness of nations is sinful,
the nations that regret [their good deeds],
that declare wood and stone to be gods.
And only Adonoy, God is true.<br>
Buy truthfulness<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Based on Avos Chap. I, Mishnah 6.</i>
and do not sell it.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Teach others without pay.</i>
[Do this] in order to serve and worship

for His Name alone is exalted,
for He satiates every living thing

[He does this] with an open hand.
He gives abundantly to us
of His kindness and trustworthiness.<br>
Truly see
the neediness of Israel
for Your judgment is deep as the abyss
and Your justice as the highest mountains.
Accept the prayer of the nation
that turns to You with its requests:
“In your hands do I place my soul
for You [always] redeem me,
[You], Adonoy the trusthworthy God.”<br>
[You], Who truthfully judges the poor

for all the generations;
[You], the King

God, in Your abundant kindness
respond to me with true [salvation].<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Do not enter into judgment with us,
for no living soul will be justified before You.
For with You is forgiveness,
in order that You be feared.
For with You is the source of life,
[and] in Your light shall we see light.
[Grant us] life, and do kindness with us,
and let Your precepts preserve our spirit.
We ask of You, life,
grant us length of days,
forever.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 12


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Inscribe us for long life
and let us not be uprooted.
As You sit upon Your throne
examining all actions in Your judgment,
view only the good
and do not examine the evil;
for with You is the source of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">You dispense life.</i><br>
You dispense life when You are willing
while Your period of anger is fleeting.
Do not punish until eternity
your weary inheritance (Israel).
Let me hear the clarion, “I forgive!”
as You forgive my sins, and
[also let me hear] “I’ve granted you today
the gift of life!”<br>
Grant us life and redeem us from ruin.
Wrap me with the kindness of Abraham<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham, the patriarch, is sometimes referred to as “Ezrach,” e.g. Ayson Haezrachi.</i>
and with the truth that was rooted in Jacob,
he planted it and it flourished [in Israel].
Distance our sins from us
as west is distant from east.
Make known to us the truth path of life.<br>
Make known to us Your living Word<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah gives life to those who uphold it.</i>
Almighty, powerful and [wise] Counselor—
[motivate us] to cling to Your Torah;
His advice is for our own benefit.
Make the good inclination triumph
over the evil inclination and shatter it
in order that we preserve
the way of the Tree of Life.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah.</i><br>
The Torah sustains those who hold it.
It is a cure and antidote for sickness.
The supporters of Torah are also fortunate
to bask in the expanding radiance of Torah.
Those who cling to the way of Torah,
have an added quality to their lives
over all other living flesh.<br>
Support us with life and peace
that we may serve You in reverence.
We shall be glad and rejoice in You
when the wicked are destroyed.
May the three hundred ten worlds<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Which are reserved for the righteous.</i>
be our portion
and grant us the reverence of God [which leads]
to wealth, honor, and life.<br>
He granted us a fortunate portion in life,
He Who provides advice and thoughts,
He Who is a refuge to us,
and a helper during times of travail.
“Return to me and I shall return to you,”
He says as He opens His mouth,
“Because he who finds Me, discovers life.”<br>
Grant me the gift of undeserved life,
Almighty, Who knows our thoughts.
Forgive the iniquities
that are engraved upon tablets,
and Your enemies will be cloaked in shame
as You punish them in rebuke.
They will not repent or comprehend
the [true] paths of life.<br>
Bestow good life to Your servants.
Redeem their souls from Gehenom
just as You granted King David his request.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalms 21, 5.</i>
Not so, for the wicked
who rejected You,
send the angel of death unto them
in order that they descend to their graves.<br>
Those of us who are alive can thank You,
but not those who are severed from life.
A father informs his children
of Your praises in his conversation.
And we bless You, God,
Your praise we extoll,
that we may merit to see God’s goodness
upon us in the land of life.<br>
Let us hear today: “That you all will live”
with the proper allotment of sustenance.
Purify them from their sins
and don’t turn them away empty-handed.
Those decreed for death are in Your hands
Adonoy, sustain them for life,
and even those destined for death
because of old age,
grant them a portion amongst the living.<br>
Life is an attribute for the discerning person
because through the life of Torah he can
distant himself from Gehinom.
Therefore, please God,
redeem my soul from a broken body
and let it live forever
and for long life;
For the mitzvah is a lamp
and the Torah is light
and the way to achieve life.<br>
Erase from the book of life
Gival and Moav who are now exalted
though they bow down to a block of wood
and proclaim it to be a god.
Do not grant kindness to the wicked
who afflict us;
let them be sentenced for destruction
because they disgrace Israel
who are the legions of the eternal God.<br>
You swore to give life
to Your only son (Isaac),
the gates of his enemies
was to be the inheritance of his descendants
through You they would fall in his hands.
Despite Your anger,
You will again grant us mercy
and, therefore, I thank You,
for Your kindness is greater than life.<br>
[Instruct us in the path of true life] in order that we be satiated with joy
when we see Your wondrous face.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the Divine Presence, (Shechinah).</i>
Renew our days like in times of old
and people will see our graciousness.
Return and have mercy upon us,
Adonoy, God of Hosts
because from You emanates life.<br>
Let life on earth
be decreed for Your people from the heavens
and cast into the depths of the sea
all of our sins and iniquities.
Create for us a pure heart
and grant us the kindnesses
of many days and years of life.<br>
Grant life to the righteous one
and to the wicked dispense fear.
When on Rosh Hashana You decree wars,
or peace or fears and trembling,
a year of plenty or famine,
terror, life, or death,
a year of blessing or curse,
choose for us the portion of life.<br>
A life of righteousness and dignity
grant her<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> who is beautiful and amenable,
who does kindness with others, privately,
without causing the recipient shame.
Adonoy make the righteous one secure
and fulfill his needs.
He who pursues righteousness and kindness
will himself find life.<br>
Grant us the inheritance of eternal life (Torah)
given with Divine wisdom and advice.
Let gladness and rejoicing be heard
from the streets of Jerusalem;
and remove iniquity from us
and garb us with fresh clothing (Torah).
I will then go before God
in the lands of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i><br>
See fit, God, to grant life
to Your people who are Your treasure,
let them return to serve you as previously.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the days of the Holy Temple.</i>
You do not desire the death of the sinner
but rather that he repent.
A broken and pained heart
is considered precious before You.
Therefore say to them that they are holy
include them among those inscribed for life.<br>
When [David] requested life from You,
You granted it to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When Moshiach Ben David sees that Moshiach Ben Yosef is killed he will ask God for life, and God will grant him that request because of King David’s prayer. See Succah 52.</i>
Grant him life now as You did then.
His glory will be great in Your salvation
[just as the glory of Israel was great] as they ascended to Jerusalem at festivals.
Look from the dwelling place of Your holiness
from the heavens [to save us].
On that day
spring water will flow from Jerusalem.<br>
You desire to grant life
and to forgive their sins.
Let it be heard:
“And My spirit, I will place among you”
saying that I found atonement [for you].
I wish to accept you
because you truly cling
to Adonoy, Your God, Who lives eternally.<br>
Almighty, with life
support Your dove (Israel) who follows You
to cling to Your laws.
Bring us to Mount Zion
and restore the kingship
because from there Adonoy commands
(and sends forth) the blessing of life.<br>
We await life from Him
and hope for His deliverance.
At this time Adonoy will expand our territory
enabling us to increase and multiply.
From the destruction of the two temples
He will resurrect us and build the third Temple,
and all those who are before You today
shall remain amongst the living.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.

Chapter 13

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Joel ben Isaac Halevi.</i></small><br>
One King will rule [all] the nations,
He [God] will raise my banner,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Of redemption.</i>
He will cause those appointed to tax me
to seek my peace,
and my oppressors to deal righteously.
I will make it known to him
when I say, “Where is God Who made me?”
I say, “My deeds are in honor of the King.”<br>
The King will call to judgement
His people Israel [on Rosh Hashana],
therefore, I hasten to flee [from evil]
[and seek] the Presence of the Almighty.
I and my young men will fast,
and plead with supplications,
and thus will I go into the King.<br>
The King is greater than all gods,
He is the possessor of heaven and earth,
around those who fear Him,
the angel of Adonoy encamps;
Angels of mercy! Please entreat Him
Who appeared in the [burning] bush,
and also you angels
who serve in the Presence of the King.<br>
O King! Leave out nothing
that You have promised:
to repair the breaches of the house,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The House of Israel.</i>
to remove the stones from Your vineyard<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Remove the sins, the stumbling blocks from Israel.</i>
and to erect a fence around it;
strengthen the advocate and silence the accuser,
so that he does no damage,
for the adversary
is not worthy of the King’s loss.<br>
O King! see what is good in Your eyes—
forgive our iniquities,
rebuke the seducer [Satan]
let destruction and ruin come upon him;
let him withdraw disgraced
before [Your] great terror and awe;
let the evil decree against him be final
from the King’s will.<br>
The King and His command approaches
on the day when judgment is recorded,
He judges the peoples,
the righteous, the sinner and the guilty;
and now let the King’s scribes be called,
those who cause drought and make rain,
and let them inscribe for the Jews
whatever You desire in the King’s Name.<br>
O King! Put to shame the sun’s brilliance,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">So that men will not worship it.</i>
and let the worshippers of Nebo be disgraced,
let man despise his idols of silver
and his idols of gold;
for they will see with their eyes
His [God’s] return to Zion,
and be uplifted doors to eternity
so that the King may enter.<br>
The wise King Who scatters the wicked
and also the empty-headed,
and turns the wheel upon them<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He punishes them.</i>
and rebukes them—
cast out the scorner [Satan],
and let strife depart,
that he not open his mouth [against us];
[and say to him]: “That he is forbidden
to enter the King’s gate.<br>
If it pleases the King
let there go forth a royal edict from Him
based on the following:
“I will guard the feet of my children,
and will not put them in stockades<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">To torture them.</i>
on the day set for judging
who shall prosper and who shall fail,”
for so has the King ordained.<br>
The King sits on the throne of judgment,
small and great, He reviews as one,
and discerns who is truly penitent
and who returns like a dog;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He who returns to his sin as a dog who returns to his vomit.</i>
He will avenge the offended [Israel]

when the heart of the King is benevolent.<br>
The King of all the earth,
the Almighty Who answers me
in the day of my distress,
and Who was with me
every time I was encircled by enemy camps,
may He continue forever to surround me
with glad songs of rescue,
when I find favor in the eyes of the King.<br>
O King! Grant superior honor
to Your servants [Israel],
let their lives be precious in Your eyes
for they are children of the Almighty’s kings,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><span>שֶׁהֵם נִקְרָאִים בְּנֵי מְלָכִים</span>—sons of kings.</i>
and see how the whole of Israel
every man and woman
come before the King [in judgment].<br>
O King! His servants seek His Presence
with fasting and affliction [saying],
“The nations have been warned,
whoever touches them [Israel]
touches the apple of His eye;”
and behold Esau oppresses them,
say to him, “Perverse one,
why do you transgress
the King’s command?”<br>
Awesome King!
How long will You imprison
the children of Zorach and Peretz,
the twins of Tamar?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The sons of Judah from where the royal House of David were descended and from whence the Messiah will come.</i>
Restore their kingdom and uproot Amalek
as it is said [in Your Torah, see Deut 25:19];
for she has not kept
the word [command] of the King.<br>
O King!
May His princes and servants
surround Him in His Palace [the Holy Temple],
let them dwell in Bashan and Gilead,
let them dwell alone [in security];
lead Your people with Your scepter,
take us out into abundance,
You my Master, the King.<br>
O King!
The eyes of all Israel are upon You,
to gather my multitude,
may they yet dwell in the gates of Jerusalem,
my aged women and men;
and then, together they will serve You
my Priests and my deputy Priests,
and Adonoy will be King.<br>
O King!
The magnificence of the House of Adonoy,
my eyes long to behold,
and the whole people together
will magnify Your Name;
then will our mouths be filled with laughter,
and all will joyfully sing:
“[God] will be King in Jeshurun.”<br>
O King! [How long] will my enemies exult?
How long will they prevail?
They have grown and prospered

behold they say: “Our hands are mighty,”
and I have not been called
to come to the King.<br>
O King! Rise in Your [lit. His] anger
to destroy as You promised
those who eat the flesh of swine,
[and] the [other] abominated animals and mice;
let Him trumpet and shout,
He will prevail over His enemies,
for this is the promise of the King.<br>
O Great King,
remove from us the heart of stone,
whiten our sins like snow and wool,
that we may cling to You
like the red to the white;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The yolk of the egg to the albumen.</i>
grant the king [Moshiach] Your justice
and Your righteousness to the king’s son[s].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Children of Israel are called the <i>sons of kings</i> (<span>בְּנֵי מְלָכִים</span>).</i><br>
O King Who faithfully judges the poor,
You see
that the pride of our spirit is broken<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">We are no longer haughty or arrogant.</i>
even this day.
A broken and humbled heart
You, God, will not despise;
[therefore] deposit our works<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Our repentance and good deeds.</i>
in the treasury of the King.<br>
O King grant Your righteousness to Israel,
for he is a tender youth,
cling to him,
as a man clings to his wife;
do not despise him,
but turn to the prayer of the destitute,
and to all the servants of the King
who are at the gate of the King.<br>
O King, I have come to beseech Him,
to inscribe me for a good life,
from the abundance of His House,
to be filled,
let all nations gather in the Name of God,
and let them go up every year
to bow in worship to the King.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Do not enter into judgment with us,
for no living soul will be justified before You.
Even in His holy ones, He does not trust,
and the heavens are not innocent in His eyes.
Even more, since man is but a worm
and the son of man a maggot.
Behold we are guilty in Your Presence,
we are not worthy to stand in Your Presence
because of this.
Who cay say: “My heart is pure,
I have cleansed it from sin.”<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 14


Master, when You call on man
each morning [for judgment]
do not press justice to its limits.
If You combine body and soul [in judgment]
they would be thrust down
and be unable to rise.<br>
Can man be innocent in judgement?
Is he possessed of deeds to justify him?
His birth stream is from a fetid drop,
his enemy is hidden within him
from the time of his birth.<br>
Lurking within him as a snare to his feet,
he entices him daily,
to make him fall into the abyss [of sin];
there is no power or might in the body
to stand firm and resist him.<br>
From the day he attains perception,
he puts his life in his hand
to gain his bread,
all his days are filled
with vexation and grief;
until he returns to his dust
he is not at rest.<br>
Regard O Master his sorrowful spirit,
look at his broken heart,
You are near to these who are afar,
You desire the repentance of the wicked.<br>
Mighty One! let Yourself be found
by those who seek You,
say: “Here I am,”
to those who petition You
let the tiding: “I have pardoned”—
be told to those who call in Your Name,
make righteous in judgment
the people who proclaim Your Unity.<br>
Muzzle the foul one [Satan]
that he may not condemn us,
rebuke the accuser that he not accuse us,
stand up for us an upright advocate;
“I have found atonement,”
let the penitent hear.<br>
We have cast our burden upon You
we beseech You to sustain us,
be pleased with our prayer
our request and desire
fulfill with compassion.
In You we place our trust,
let Your mercy come swiftly toward us;
Strong and Mighty One,
we have not forgotten Your Name,
we beseech You, never forget us.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;

Do not enter into judgment with us
for no living soul will be justified before You.
For they have devoured Jacob,
and his habitation they have laid waste,
the tents [armies] of Edom, Ishmael,
Moab and Gris.
For our souls are filled with misfortune
and our lives have reached the abyss.
And You are our King from of old,
You do wonders in the midst of the earth.
Bring forth our righteousness the daylight
and our judgment as at noon-time.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.

Chapter 15

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Elyah ben Shemayah.</i></small><br>
Master, when You judge man who is a worm,
remember in Your anger
to be gracious and compassionate with us,
when You sit in judgment to rebuke the guilty,
clear and justify the erring and simple.<br>
Grant kindness and goodness to the guilty,
do not press judgment to its limits.
[When] those who are poor in good deeds
and destitute in conduct, call upon You,
let them find You.<br>
We stand before You with great guilt,
we are ashamed to mouth a reply [excuse];
can man be justified before God?
In the Presence of His Maker,
can man be found pure [innocent]?<br>
Maliciousness lurks within him,
deceit is hidden within him,
he is full of iniquity and great transgression,
account and reckoning
before the Supreme King of Kings,
he will have to give at his end.<br>
His sins are engraven by his own hand,
his wickedness will testify against him,
the beams of his house will reveal
and declare his deeds,
the stone from the wall
will scream and call out.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Mesechet Taanis 11a; Chagigah 16a.</i><br>
The judged will hide his face in shame,
he will be considered as naught
when he stands before Your Presence;
we beseech You,
be pleased with the work of our hands,
behold our broken hearts,
and preserve us from destruction.<br>
Let Your servants find favor this day,
declare them guiltless,
they desire Your nearness as of old;
like snow and wool
whiten the sins of the rose [Israel],
save them from all evil
in this year.<br>

Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
I cry out to God with my voice,
in the morning, I address my prayer to You,
on behalf of my congregation;
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer!
We approach You with supplication and prayer,
we keep watch at Your door,
O Mighty One in wondrous deeds,
remove from us, plague and sickness.<br>
Grant us pardon,
and remove evil
from grieving souls,
Almighty God Who knows man’s thoughts;
I cry to You in affliction and weariness,
redeem my soul from destruction and the pit,
draw near to my soul and redeem it.<br>
Beneficent One, Who drew me from the womb,
my Creator, my hope and my trust,
in Your hand I entrust my spirit;
withhold Your anger from Your beloved ones,
cause not Your devoted ones to see the pit,
answer me Adonoy, for Your kindness is good.<br>
With an incurable, eternal blow,
strike with anger those who blaspheme You,
but do not plague Your people;
we afflict ourselves this day,
do not abhor nor despise our cry,
pardon the iniquity of this people.<br>
We have transgressed and dealt treacherously,
O Rock, we have been corrupt towards You.
Therefore, we are consumed by Your anger
and we are terrified by Your rage;
Holy One! do not extend contention,
behold, my hands are stretched out to You,
on the day when I am afraid,
I will put my trust in You.<br>
Your people pour out their prayer,
be merciful and answer Your faithful ones,
do not abhor us for Your Name’s sake,
turn to the cry of the suffering,
to those who call You out of distress,
hear them from the high heavens,
You Who listens to the needy.<br>
[Israel] the noblest among people,
the pleasant offspring,
they trust in You, they hope to You,
they are counted among Your pure ones,
quickly have mercy on them
as a father has mercy on his children.<br>

[Our] Father,
You created us with compassion and pardon,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When God created man, He knew that man required His mercy and forgiveness.</i>
we are the children of Your holy covenant,
and You have never exchanged us;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For any other nation.</i>
even in our exile, You are with us,
as You have given us hope.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">By promising not to leave us even in the worst of times.</i>
And [now] pardon our iniquity and our sin
and take us for Your inheritance.<br>
Wash away the blood and filth<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Of our sins.</i>
bring our judgment into light;
let our sin be hidden
and not be found to make us repulsive
and let our iniquity be sought
and none be found,
As You clearly stated:
“I will forgive those that I will spare.”<br>
The foulness [of our sins] is great
and the aroma of our sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“<span>ניחוח ממלח</span>“ lit. the salted pleasant odor—all sacrifices were salted before being burnt on the altar as a pleasant fragrance to God. (v. Vayikra 2, 13)</i> has ceased.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since the destruction of the Temple.</i>
The covering of soil [caused by]
the filth of the moist creeping thing,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A ritually unclean person who has any foreign matter covering any part of his body cannot become ritually clean unless he first removes the impurity.</i>
let that become cleansed by immersion
in the flow of Your waters,
for You are Adonoy, good and forgiving.<br>
Since we sinned we were exiled
and from corpulence [we became] emaciated
for the impurity is abundant
and there is none [priest] to sprinkle us.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">With the mixture of water and ashes from the red heifer—the procedure used in purifying one who was contaminated with the ritual uncleanness of a dead body.</i>
For Your sake, Adonoy,
as [You did] then and before this,
forgive, please, the sins of this nation.<br>
They are too abundant to relate—
the great goodness that You have bestowed.
You led the nation
[even] when it was rebellious towards You.
Please, carry their burden
as You carried it in previous days,
and forgive Your nation that has sinned to You.<br>
Upon us, from on high
let His holy spirit pour forth,
so that we may separate ourselves [from sin],
and sanctify [us]
and [a] new [heart] create for us.
The purification and the cleansing [from sin]—
order that they be without suffering,
for forgiveness is with You<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It is in Your hands to forgive.</i>

Stand upright the fallen one.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Fallen one”—the Jewish nation.</i>

[With] a spirit of kindness
satiate our hunger.
Annihilation has come [to those who]
rebuilt us at the time we were weakened.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">“To those … rebuilt us” i.e. the righteous of every generation.</i>
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
forgive our sins.<br>
We have become as leftovers<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">“Leftovers”—the remains at the bottom of the pot.</i>
and who, like You, can forgive [such as these].
Not [based] upon our righteousness

we will send<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><span>נפיל</span>—lit. “throw.”</i> our plea.
Adonoy, listen! Adonoy, forgive!
Adonoy, pay attention [to us] and do!<br>
In Your fear and in Your righteous Torah,
establish our footsteps to tread,
for through our sins
we have become too weak to take a step.
Please fulfill Your good promise
to support [us]:
“For I shall forgive their iniquities,
and their sins I will no longer remember.”<br>
You know the hidden
of every blood and flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Blood and flesh, i.e. human.</i>
[We committed] iniquities
[despite] that we knew them

We, hereby, come before You

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Solomon ben Menachem.</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Thirteen Divine attributes
which were pronounced with compassion;
by virtue of every fitting attribute,
I beseech the Presence of my King
with supplication,
to search for the merit [of Israel]
who were named and called the Rose.
Save them from all evil
in this year.<br>
If their guilt be so great
as to reach the heavens and their stars,
[then] by virtue of every fitting attribute,
I plead for mercy for them,
to annul for them what is written:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 32:26.</i>
“I said I will scatter them etc.”
Why should the nations say,
“Where is their God?”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 115:2.</i><br>
If their iniquities are grievous
and too many to count,
[then] by virtue of every fitting attribute
cast them away, Adonoy, and conceal them;
let our vigorous words of supplication
annul that which is written:
“I will hide [my face from them].”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 32:20.</i>
Why, Adonoy, do You stand far off,
hiding Yourself in times of trouble?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 10:1.</i><br>
If they have acted perversely
in the Presence of their King,
with a brazen face;
[then] by virtue of every fitting attribute,
I offer supplication with a loud voice,
[and say to] my soul:
“Pour out your heart as water”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 2:19.</i>
in the presence of Him
“Who is pure white and ruddy.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 5:10.</i>
“Why, God, have You cast us off forever.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 74:1.</i><br>
If willful sins have misled
the foolish and haughty heart;
[then] by virtue of every fitting attribute,
save them, Adonoy, from crushing wounds,
hasten and come,
and lift up the strong voice [of redemption]
“Why do I go mourning under oppression.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 42:10.</i><br>
If they have slandered
in words and thoughts against You,
[then] by virtue of every fitting attribute,
remember the love of those who praise You
and let Your compassion be moved
towards the remnant of Your people.
“Why should Your anger burn
against Your people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 32:11.</i><br>
If they harden their ear [from hearing]
and pervert their way,
[then] by virtue of every fitting attribute,
I offer silent prayer for my people,
and my soul—pour out your heart
in the Presence of your Possessor and Rock.
“Why have You broken down her fences,

my soul—seek pleasantness for them;

address prayerful supplication.
Why, Adonoy,
do You cast off my soul?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 88:15.</i><br>
If they were stubborn like a heifer
from their many days and years [of exile];

who are the fewest among peoples.
“Why do You forget us forever,

“Why do You withdraw Your hand,

forgive and pardon Your congregation.

Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Unto You Adonoy is our plea,
and in the morning our prayer is before You.
Adonoy, in the morning hear our voice,
in the morning we beseech You and hope.
My soul waits for my Master
more than the watchman waits
for the morning,
[more than] the watchman [waits]
for the morning.
The [correct] offerings to God
is a broken spirit;
a broken and humbled heart,
God will not despise.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 19

<small><i>The following prayer was composed by Rabbi Mordechai.</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
My God Who is my savior and my strong rock
my Protector and my Shield
my Salvation<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. the horn of my salvation. He fights against my enemies as an ox who gores with its horn as it attacks.</i> and my Assurance,
during my times of trial and pain.
I wake up early to pray unto You,
O Great King,
and unto You, Adonoy
I cry in the morning.<br>
In the morning remember to have mercy
in the merit of Abraham’s kindness,
the first patriarch of “the strong ones,”
the one whom You chose
and who trusted in You,
the first of all believers.
Remember his covenant with You
and deliver me from my sins.
Adonoy, listen this morning to my voice,
to my prayer of the morning.<br>
In the morning You spoke with him<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham.</i>
and tested him in order to reward him
and You made a covenant with him
to serve as a protector for him.
You loved him and wanted him
and accepted him like the incense
that was brought each morning.<br>
When the morning star shone,
when You wished to show
his great rightousness,
You tested him a tenth time
and said to him: Take your son,
and do not hesitate,
to one of the mountains
and bring him there as a burnt offering
just as the sheep that
you bring as a sacrifice in the morning.<br>
In the morning he singularized Your Name
and harkened to Your voice
and manifested his love
while rejoicing whole-heartedly
to fulfill Your command.
His love made him transcend normalcy
by rising with joy.
And Abraham rose early in the morning.<br>
In the morning both readied their hearts
to do Your will, O awesome One.
The son took the wood
and the father took the knife
to slaughter without intending to redeem him.
They were summoned
and went with whole hearts
and saw Your Divine honor
on the third day in the morning.<br>
In the morning he girded himself
as a warrior girds his loins.
He first bound his son
then took a knife to slaughter him,
without thinking of him as a human being
and said: “Today I will bring my offering
and sprinkle the blood of my sacrifice.”
It will not remain until the morning.<br>
In the morning Your mercy was aroused
on the only son
and that mercy shone upon him.
An angel of Adonoy called to him
and said not to harm the lad
because in Isaac
will Your seed be perpetuated,
[and the merit of this event] will be remembered for all generations,
it will remain as a safe-keeping for you
until the morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Until the redemption which is analogous to morning.</i><br>
In the morning
his<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac’s.</i> propriety and righteousness
will benefit the people who pray to You
and his ashes will always be seen before You
to cleanse them from their sins.
Grant them their lives which is their request,
because it is You Whom they desire.
In the evening they come to You in prayer
and also in the morning.<br>
Harken to their voices in the morning
and atone their iniquities.
Consider the order of their prayers
like the order of the sacrifices.
They come with the merits
of the righteousness of their ancestors.
And also bring to Him
their contributions of prayer every morning.<br>
In the morning turn to us and have mercy
and let Your mercy be aroused upon us.
Cast to the depths of the sea
all our sins
and let them not be remembered.
Lord, our Rock, pass our sins from before You
and let them not remain before You
until the morning.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,

and pardon to transgressors.

Chapter 20

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Shlomo ibn Gabirol.</i></small><br>
[You are] the Judge of all the earth,
and You arraign her in judgment,
we beseech You, life and kindness
bestow on an afflicted people.
Accept their morning prayer
as a substitute for the burnt offering—
as the burnt offering of the morning
which was a continual burnt offering.<br>
You are wrapped in a cloak of righteousness,
You alone have the ability [to forgive],
if we have no [good] deeds,
recall the virtues
of the [Patriarchs] who sleep in Hebron,
and may their merits ascend
as a memorial before Adonoy always.
As the burnt offering of the morning
which was a continual burnt offering.<br>
You are inclined towards kindness
to favor man with life.
Incline Your nation toward kindness
be benevolent with him, that he may live,
inscribe him with the sign of life,
and let it be on his forehead always.
As the burnt offering of the morning
which was a continual burnt offering.<br>
Do good, as You see fit, to Zion,
My holy city.
Grant power and fame in Your House
to my holy ones [the pious and righteous],
and an illuminated lamp for the son of Yishai;
that a light be kept burning always.
As the burnt offering of the morning
which was a continual burnt offering.<br>
Be strong and let your hearts take courage
my people, whose strength is in the Almighty;
and when You keep His testimonies,
He, too, will in equal measure
atone Your sins,
and will remember mercy in His anger.
Seek Adonoy and His strength,
seek His Presence always.
As the burnt offering of the morning
which was a continual burnt offering.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,

The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator.<br>

Chapter 21


To You, my Creator
I have spread my hands [in prayer],
I have abandoned arrogance and haughtiness.
Truly, a broken spirit,
I [have brought before You as a] sacrifice,
and in Your loving-kindness, I trust.
I trust in You
and not upon refined weaponry,
even when I was threatened with death
[along with] scholars and their students.
Search out [for redemption]
the speechless dove and nestling,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Speechless dove”—i.e. the nation of Israel.</i>
and let him return the robbery<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">And—robbery, i.e. let the gentiles return the land that they robbed from us.</i>
that he robbed.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator.<br>
He [the gentile nations] robbed and destroyed
the exalted righteous [of our nation]
and his wise elders,
and destroyed his House<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">‘House’—i.e. the Temple.</i>
and desecrated the Holy<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Holy, i.e. the Temple.</i> and its holies
and slashed the Curtain<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the curtain separating the Holy of Holies from the rest of the Temple.</i>
and slaughtered his prophets and holy men,
that was a generation that seeked Him.
The blood of those that seeked Him
shall be a ransom and redemption
before Your honorable Throne
[that instills] fear [in all creation].
[We are] attached to You
as linked couplets and twins,
because for Your sake
we are constantly killed.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator.<br>
On this day
how many tens of thousands
fell [by the sword] from Your nation,
and gave their lives
for the Unity of Your Name.
For their sake bring forth into the light
their judgments and sentence
from Your heights,
and hear the prayers
of Your servants and Your nation.
And Your nation they loot and rob
and their riches they plundered
and they rejoice in the fear<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">‘In the fear’ i.e. the fear of the Jewish Nation.</i>
and in the breach<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">‘In the break’ i.e. the breach of the Jewish Nation.</i> they revel.
‘And who has given Jacob to loot’
loudly they proclaim,
“Is it not Adonoy that did this!”<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator<br>
[To this we respond] ‘Our sins caused this,
and [caused our] pursuer to smite us.
We have veered from the path
and like a rebellious counsel we have kicked.
We suffered His anger
according to the measure [that we deserve],
and according to our evil actions
we have suffered
to Adonoy our God we have sinned.
We have sinned
and we are still [immersed] in great guilt.
To ridicule and mockery
we have been placed in exile.
[The prophecy of Scripture has befallen us:
“Behold!
Adonoy has made you wander wanderings.”<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator.<br>
The wanderings and sorrows
became stronger and intensified.
The wolves [who attack their prey at] dusk<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">‘The wolves — dusk,’ i.e. the nations of the world.</i>
devoured and stunned us.
They tore us to pieces
and left not even a bone till morning.
They are ruthless and do not take pity.
May pity come from the Heavens!
To do miracles [for us]
and let Him save His people
from the hand of the strong and violent.
May His beloved dwelling<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Temple.</i>
expand its length and breadth
as a mast and as a banner<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">May the Temple be so visible and prominent!</i> at the mountaintop.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator.<br>
As a [lonely] flagpole, [remained]
the remnant of His inheritance,
Masters, besides Him, lorded over us.
Now, let it be told to Jacob<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Israel.</i>
whom He forgives:
“God has chosen him,
Israel to be His chosen nation.”
To His chosen nation
let there not be pain and destruction.
As in days of yore
let my ruins<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Jerusalem.</i> be rebuilt.
To my king let Him give strength
and let him be exalted,
[God] Who humbles and exalts.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator.<br>
Exalted One!
Show me [vengeance] in my enemies,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">בשוררי—lit. those who see to my destruction.</i>
His vengeance
and the vengeance of my chosen place<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">‘Chosen place,’ i.e. the Temple.</i>.
Transfer the pain of my shame to my enemies
for I carried
the shame of [the wrongdoing] of my youth.
[God responds:] I remember his youth
the love of betrothal.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">‘I remember — betrothal’ i.e. I remember the kindnesses that I did for you when you first became My nation.</i>
[So, too] in her old age
act kindly towards her.
Please! Let my prayer be established
as a burnt-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">‘Let — offering,’ i.e. let my prayer be considered as a sacrifice brought at the time of the Temple.</i>
God of Jacob listen to my prayer forever.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator.<br>
You have always been a support to those who put their hope in You.
For Your sake do [for them],
if not for their sake.
[Then] their enemies will be embarrassed
and disgraced through their prayers
[for they will pray] to Adonoy
and You will not answer them.
Answer [the prayers] of the House of Israel,
who have declared Your oneness,
even when You put their cities to rubble
they desired You.
Therefore, [even when they had to hide]
in the cracks [of the earth]
they honored You.
Adonoy, in their anguish, they remembered You.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator.<br>
They remembered You,
You to whom lips turn to call [in prayer].
Rescue them from punishment
and from severe edicts.
Please! Turn towards their song
and their beseeching.
You are their strength in time of anguish.
Anguish and distress
remove from me, my Creator,
and the gates of tears
shall not be shut for me.
For they are gathered in Your vessel;
are they not counted by You, my Redeemer!
I have cried. Hear my voice!<br>
We have sinned, our Rock,
forgive us, our Creator.<br>
I will raise my voice in plea
[that You save me] from the oppression
[of My] tumultuous enemy.
I was overwhelmed
by the severe anger of my oppressor.
The mother, together with her children,
was torn to pieces.
[The mother] was torn to pieces

You have not found them contemptuous,
when they have called You, You responded.
[Even when] a single poor person calls,
You have prepared Your reply:
“I will hear their prayer

Hear, Israel,
Adonoy is our God,
Adonoy is one.<br>

trust in the Name of Adonoy, our God.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">‘These nations — God,’ i.e. whereas, other nations depend on the might of their weapons we depend solely on the help of God.</i>
We carry [the Name of God]
with fear, trepidation, and trembling.
Strengthen them against the nations

as promised in Your holy word<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Holy Scriptures.</i>:

we depend on that which was said:
“Adonoy will answer you

When affliction comes to Jacob,

[You Who are] abundant in deeds.
Turn towards us to our cries

And remove from us our evil deeds
You the Holy One
Who sits [awaiting] praises [of Israel].
You Who awaits praises!
Awaken those who slumber<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. those whom the suffering of the exile has desensitized.</i>
in darkness amongst the nations.
Redeem them and cleanse them of their stains,
Almighty, King
Who sits on the throne of compassion.<br>
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 24

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>

Chapter 25

<small><i>The following prayer was composed by Rabbi Saadyah Gaon.</i></small><br>
And so may it be Your will
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
that this coming year
be for us,
and for all Your people, the House of Israel,
the end and limit of the captivity
of Your people, the House of Israel;
and the last of our exile and mourning,
and a happy end
to our days of affliction and misery;
for our servitude has been protracted,
and the yoke of captivity is long upon us;
and behold each day
we become more and more diminished,
and with the increase in years,
we are less in number,
and in the length of time,
we are dwindling away.
We have no leader
nor anyone to strengthen our hands,
[for] it is as You said [Jeremiah 15:5]:
“For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem?
And who will moan over you?
And who will turn
to inquire about your well-being?”
Who will erect a [spiritual] fence,
and who will stand in the breach?
There is no longer a prophet or seer,
and there is no one
that calls upon Your Name in truth,
that is inspired to grasp You;
for we are all like sheep gone astray,
each one
has turned to his evil way,
every man after his gain
and everyone
after the desire of his evil heart;
and, as if we were not content
with our previous iniquities,
we have added new ones to them,
we were heedless of all the warnings
with which You warned us,
and we were not chastised
by all the admonishment
with which You rebuked us;
and what other righteousness have we
that we can cry out to the King?<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>

Chapter 26

<small><i>This prayer too was composed by R’ Saadyah Gaon.</i></small><br>
We have forgotten Your goodness,
and been mindless of Your great kindnesses;
we have rebelled against Your word,
and have turned away from Your laws.
We have indulged in the vanities of this world,
and to men of arrogance and deceit
we have turned.
We have been very foolish,
we have loved evil more than good,
and falsehood
rather than speaking righteousness,
we have sought impurity rather than purity,
and the loathsome rather than the clean;
we have exchanged
the permanent [world] for the transitory.
Day by day we rise early to sin,
until
our iniquities have mounted above our heads,
and are more numerous than our hairs,
and more powerful
than the words of our mouth,
and exceeded the steps of our feet,
and surpassed the breathing of our nostrils.
We have sunk into muddy depths,
and there is no foothold;
we have come into deep waters,
and a whirlpool has swept us away.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 69:3.</i>
Not You Adonoy, our God, have we harmed,
but [only] ourselves,
not You have we irritated
but [only] ourselves;
for when man sins,
what effect has it on You?
If his transgressions are numerous,
what does it do to You?
But woe to the sons of man
who sin against You,
and woe to their souls,
for they bring evil upon themselves.
Our God, we are too ashamed and disgraced,
to lift our faces to You, our God;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ezra 9:6.</i>
for we are like a repulsive vessel,
thus are we disgraced in our own eyes.
As a man immersed in a [muddy] ditch
and soils his clothing;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Job 9:31.</i>
and as we were conceived in iniquity,
so the shame of our faces have covered us.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 44:16.</i><br>

Chapter 27

<small><i>This prayer, too, was composed by R’ Saadyah Gaon.</i></small><br>
And now Adonoy, our God,
after we have repented, we regret [our sins],
and after realizing [our guilt],
we struck ourselves on the thigh.
We are ashamed, even disgraced,
for we also bear the shame of our youth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 31:18.</i>
Because of this
we take our flesh in our teeth,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">We bite ourselves.</i>
and put our life in our hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Job 13:14.</i>
How shall we approach You,
Adonoy, our God,
and how shall we bow unto You,
exalted God?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Micah 6:6.</i>
How will You be reconciled to us
and atone all our sins,
which have passed by and gone
like water spilt on the ground,
which cannot be gathered up again?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 14:14.</i>
If through repentance and confession
You will be reconciled to us,
behold we repent and confess
before You Adonoy, our God:
“We have sinned and transgressed,
and that which is straight, we distorted,
and it has not profited us.”
And if through prayer and supplication
You will forgive us,
behold we offer our supplication before You;
“As the eyes of servants [look]
toward the hand of their master,
as the eyes of a maiden [look]
toward the hand of her mistress;
so our eyes are lifted to You.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 123:2.</i>
And if through weeping and wailing
You will pardon us,
behold, our soul weeps in secret
because of our sins,
and our spirit groans within us
over the multitude of our transgressions.
And if through a broken spirit,
You will atone us,
behold our heart is broken within us,
and our spirit is crushed
by the troubles and travails
which have passed over us,
until there is nothing left
whole in our flesh.
Were it not for Your mercy and kindness,
we would have perished
because of our iniquities.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

And now Adonoy, our God,
if we did like our foolishness,
You do according to Your trait and forgive
because You are perfect and complete.
If we repaid evil in exchange for good
still grant us good and not evil;
because even a righteous person forgives
and certainly the Creator should do this.
If we transgressed so extensively,
You are capable of excessive kindness
and can forgive extensively
since Your righteousness and kindness
are greater than high and mighty mountains,
and more profound than the greatest depths.
Your glory covers the heavens
and Your praise fills the earth.
Adonoy, we heard Your reputation—
that with one of Your character traits
You forgive those who sinned against You
and even all of those who sinned.
Forgive our intentional and unintentional sins
and all the sins and iniquities of Israel,
and cleanse us from our iniquity
and purify us from our sins.
Don’t be excessively angry at us
and don’t remember our iniquity forever,
since You have the vast capacity to forgive.<br>
And You, Adonoy,
intended to rid us of our refuse,
and to remove our unworthiness<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. tin.</i>
and break our straying heart,
and destroy our defilement from within us.
Therefore, You exiled us
and scattered us among the nations.
Behold, in the pandemonium of kingdoms
we drowned
and like the smelting of silver
in a vat we were melted
and it was not because of Your inability
that You did not save us,
nor because of deafness in Your ears
that You did not hear our prayers.
Rather our sins separated
us from Your deliverance.
Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while the shame is ours.
To Adonoy, our God,
is mercy and forgiveness
because we have rebelled against Him
and to You, God, is only kindness
because You pay [reward]
a person according to his deeds.
And You, Adonoy, our God,
Redeemer of Israel and its Holy One,
will You eternally be angry at us?
Will Your anger endure for all generations?
God forbid!
Will You forsake forever
and not forgive again?
God forbid!
Because forever there will not cease
Your performance of kindness
and Your mercy will not stop
since this trait is renewed daily
and is created at all times
and every moment.
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy
perform with us (your kindness and forgive us)
because this is Your praise
and because Your Name is called upon us,
Adonoy, God of Israel;
and for the sake of the covenant,
with our ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
that You made with them;
and the oath
that You swore to them, remember.
And for the sake of Your Torah
and the holy ones who study it,
for they have been diminished and subdued.
And You have promised us in its regard
that the Law will never be forgotten
from his seed;
“And My words that I placed in their mouths
will never cease”;
and for the sake of Your nation and inheritance
of which only a few remain from many
as a rod placed on a mountain top
or a banner on a hill.
For the sake of Jerusalem, Your holy city,
that became a desolate wilderness
and all its glory was taken from it;
and for the sake
of our house of life and beauty
that for which our ancestors praised You
and that was consumed by fire,
and all of its treasures destroyed.
For the sake of those who were killed
[because they upheld] Your holy Name
and for those who were slaughtered
[because they expounded] Your singularity.
For the sake of Your holy Torah
that was burned in fire
and cast to be trodden upon
by all passers-by.
In view of all these tragedies
will [You] Adonoy, restrain Yourself,
therefore hasten to answer us
to the greatest extent.<br>
Behold all of the nations
dwell in tranquility without turmoil
whereas the poor of Your people,
are tormented and denigrated and unsettled
and in their turmoil they seek You
and extend their supplication
opposite the Ark of Your covenant.
Adonoy, the God of Hosts,
until when will You continue
not to have mercy on Jerusalem
and the cities of Judah
against whom You were angered
for so many years,
and see Your nation
in great fear.
There is no one to unite and help them
and there is no savior for Israel.
We have turned to the right
and there is no savior;
to the left and there is no support,
and for us,
we can rely on no one
except upon You
our Father in heaven.
Now is the time and the opportunity
that it behooves You to help
and to promulgate
the intensity of Your mercy
that always existed
for it [Your mercy] is very great.<br>
When Israel sinned in the desert,
Moses, our teacher stood
and prayed before You,
and beseeched You for mercy
upon Your nation, Israel,
and said the following in his prayer:
“My King and my God,
please forgive the sin of this people
with the immensity of Your kindness,
just as You forgave this nation
from Egypt until the present time.
And You responded to him
in your manner of goodness
and You spoke and said to him,
“I forgive [them] as you ask.”
We are ashamed of our actions
and we are disgraced with our sins
and our faces are blackened
from our sins.
Our statures are bent
because of our guilt
and we have no excuse to offer
nor audacity to raise our heads.<br>

Chapter 28

<small><i>The following prayer was composed by R’ Saadyah Gaon.</i></small><br>
We beseech You, look at the righteousness
of Your servants and Your pious ones,
who exposed themselves to death for You,
and did not spare themselves
or their children,
but rejected the life of this world.
They subjected their will to Your will
and sanctified Your great Name,
and did not desecrate It.
They willingly offered themselves as sacrifices;
they stretched out their necks
and withstood the test, and were found true;
they were proven with cleansing,
and found to be perfect.
The blood of fathers and sons merged,
also the blood of mothers and children;
the blood of brothers and sisters were mingled,
also the blood of bridgrooms and brides,
the blood of wise men and women,
the blood of worthy men and women,
the blood of young men and women,
the blood of communal leaders
and their adjutants,
the blood of pious men and women,
the blood of old men and women,
the blood of judges and their scribes,
the blood of teachers and their pupils;
the blood of husbands and their wives;
they were all slain together
for the sanctification
of Your holy and unique Name.<br>
Earth! Cover not their blood,
and let their cry find no [resting] place,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Job 16:18.</i>
until Adonoy looks from heaven and sees,
and takes His own vengeance,
and the vengeance of His people,
and the vengeance of His Torah,
and the vengeance of His servants
whose blood was poured like water;
as You promised us
through [Moses], the father of all prophets,
“Sing the praises of His people, you nations,
for the blood of His servants, He will avenge,
and vengeance will He repay to His foes;
and His land will be atoned
[with the atonement] of His people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:43.</i><br>
Remember these altars,
and see these bindings [sacrifices],
for because of one binding [Isaac’s],
the world shook,
and the angels cried without,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 33:7.</i>
and You swore that You would bless,
[Abraham] the one who bound,
and [Isaac] who was bound,
to multiply their children
like the sand of the sea.
And certainly now
that so many [sacrificed] bound their children
for the unity of Your Name,
Unique and Revered One.
We beseech You, Avenger of blood,
the voice of Your children’s blood,
cry out to You from the earth,
and let the land not atone
the blood that was spilled in her,
except with the blood of those who spilt it.
And let Your mind be changed,
and let Your anger be stilled,
and Your wrath be withheld;
and cease destruction and ruin
from Your people.<br>
Spare and have mercy on the escaped remnant,
and bring them from darkness to light,
and grant us a good year,
a year of favor and time of redemption.
Almighty, remember to us
the covenant with Abraham,
and recall for us
the merit of [Isaac], who was bound,
and have mercy on us
for the piety of [Jacob] the perfect man.
And You are the Righteous One
over all that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>

Chapter 29


The cry of those who praise You
may it rise before Your Throne of Honor.
Fulfill the requests of

those who come to You.<br>
Forgive [us]!
[Refrain] from bringing us to judgement

Receive me as [You did]

Enlightened One!
According to Your great kindness

who could possibly say:
“I have cleansed my heart from deception.”<br>
And if we have perverted Your command,
[nevertheless], heed us and accept our song,
for according to what [we have] perverted
what shall they do,
they that reside in mud huts.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., those that reside in this lowly world.</i><br>

act [towards us] today and every day,

Chapter 30

<small><i>The following prayer was composed by Rabbi Meir ben Isaac.</i></small><br>
Receive our prayer, accept our supplication
in place of the fragrance
of the continual morning offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">After the destruction of the Temple, prayers replaced the daily offerings. See Mesechet Berachos 26b.</i>
Consider those who rise to praise Your Name,
as though they had been privileged

Accept their worship [prayers]
in the sanctuary [synagogues] of their exile
as if it were the “Chavittin” in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These were daily meal offerings brought by the Kohen Gadol.</i>
Listen to our reading [of the Sh’ma]

as the burning of the limbs and fat pieces.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If these were not consumed on the Altar at night, they were placed at the sides of the Altar in the morning. See Mesechet Tamid 2:1.</i><br>
Consider the spreading of our hands [in prayer]

Consider our facing eastward [in prayer]
as the wood on the Altar that faced eastward.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Mesechet Tamid 2:4.</i><br>
May it be pleasant before You

May our rising early to pray at dawn,

The presiding kohain ordered
that a lamb be brought

which was carefully examined [for blemishes].<br>
From a golden vessel
it was given to drink,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This was done to facilitate the skinning which was done later.</i>

He delayed the slaughtering
until the large gate was opened.
He maneuvered his hand, up to his elbow,
into the opening of the gate [to open one lock]
two keys were needed for opening the gate.<br>
When the door turned on its hinges,
it would give out a creaking sound
that was heard in the plain of Jericho.

were performed facing the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the morning it was offered in the northwest corner and in the evening in the northeast so as to face the sun.</i>
The blood was sprinkled twice
against the four sides of the Altar—
once on the northeast corner
and once on the southwest corner.<br>
The remaining blood was poured out
at the southern base of the Altar;
and the lamb had to be skinned,
and totally consumed by fire
as an offering to the Most High.
The operation of the dissection [of the lamb]
is too lengthy to describe,
silence is better than to weary the congregation.<br>
Nine kohanim performed the offering
joined by three others who were privileged
to perform the pan-offering,
the fine flour offering and the wine libation.
Then, on the western side of the ramp,
the pieces were salted;
and then they went into the Stone Chamber
to read the [morning] Sh’ma.<br>
At the signal they recited one blessing;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">After receiving a signal from the presiding kohain, they recited the blessing of “<span>אַהֲבָה רַבָּה</span>,” the blessing before the Sh’ma.</i>
they also recited the “Ten Commandments,”
and an additional blessing on the Sabbath.
They recited <i>True and firm</i> and the <i>Avodah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The seventeenth blessing of the Amidah.</i>
and the “Priestly Blessing” [in which]
they blessed the people a benificent blessing<br>
New kohanim were selected by lot
for the privilege of offering the incense,
and he who was chosen once, could not repeat
because it enriched the one who performed it.
At the fourth lot, all kohanim participated,
for the privilege of carrying the pieces
to the square [Altar].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Altar was a square.</i><br>
Then they sounded the “Magrephah”
which produced many sounds,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Magrephah had ten holes each of which was capable of producing ten different sounds. See Mesechet Arachin 10b.</i>
and its sound was heard in Jericho.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Jericho was known as the city of psalms.</i>
Levites and kohanim were trained at its sound
to be ready
for song and worshipful kneeling.<br>
They quickly ran up the steps of the Vestibule,
the kohanim who had to remove the ashes
from the inner Altar
took the basket of ashes and withdrew.
Another cleaned the “Menorah”;
rekindled the extinguished lamps,
and took the vessel with the Menorah’s ashes
and hurriedly went on his way.<br>
Another kohain spread<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This kohain had the privilege of bringing burning coals from the outer-altar to the golden altar.</i>
the burning coals with the back of the censer;
he bowed and withdrew.
Another heaped the incense on the coals
from the center of the Altar outwards;<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Towards himself.</i>
they taught him to spread them in this manner
so that his arms should not be burned.<br>
Trembling, they quickly withdrew
during the burning of the incense,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">They were not permitted to have benefit from the holy aroma.</i>
this was done secretly to atone
for slander [which is done in secret].

lifting their hands over their heads.
Whenever the Kohain Gadol desired
he could take part in the sacrificial order;
the Vice Kohain Gadol would be at his right
as they walked up the ramp [to the Altar].<br>
The other kohanim came near him
and handed him the pieces
upon which he laid his hands
and threw them into the fire.
And then into the special openings
he poured the [wine] libations.
The Vice Kohain Gadol stood
and waved a cloth.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This was a signal that the libations were completed.</i><br>
The trumpeteers<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">These were kohanim.</i> came
and stood next to Ben Arza<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A member of the only family who knew how to make these sounds.</i>
who with his thumb and middle finger
caused the <i>tsaltsal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>tsaltsal</i> was a musical instrument that could be heard at a distance.</i> to be heard.
When the Levites heard the sound,
they chanted songs of praise;
at the conclusion of each psalm,
they sounded trumpets
and prostrated themselves.<br>
This was the order of the daily service
in the House of our God—
may it be speedily restored.
May the daily morning offering
be fulfilled through our recounting of it,
and serve as atonement for Jeshurun [Israel].<br>
The same order of the morning sacrifice,
and for the meal and wine offerings,
was used for the evening sacrifice.
Eleven kohanim were privileged to offer it,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Two more than the morning sacrifice.</i>
two of whom held the two wooden logs.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Which were used to maintain the fires on the Altar.</i><br>
The lamb offerings subdued
and washed away iniquities;
and the innocence of a year old child
was brought upon the treasured [people].
These sacrifices were like a mighty advocate
making it possible for righteousness to abide
in the city of our God,
may God [soon] restore it.<br>
Be not silent [you Angels]
appointed as guardians [of Jerusalem]
say: “And You shall rise and be merciful.”
May the Jerusalem built in heaven
be established and be renowned on earth.<br>
And may the great angel [Michael] rise
to plead for his people
that evil be removed from them.
May their cry<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Their cry of supplication.</i> adorn You as a crown,
and ascend the heavenly Altar
as a burnt-offering.<br>
And you, the awesome angel [Gabriel],
who stands behind the veil of separation,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Pargod refers to the separation between the sky and the Shechina. See Mesechet Berachos 18b.</i>

and bind our merits together,

and thereby regained your original high rank.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Mesechet Yoma 77a for explanation of this incident.</i><br>
On behalf of Israel, plead for justice,

Let righteousness arouse His mercy as myrrh,
and appear before Him
with the attribute of mercy.<br>

Fast of Gedaliah



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>

Chapter 3

<small><i>The following prayer was composed by Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac (</i>Rashi<i>).</i></small><br>
Even before the clouds were stretched above,
and the soil was joined together on earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Before God created heaven and earth.</i>
in Your Presence
seven things were [already] gathered:
the Torah; the Divine Throne;
and [Repentance] the remedy
for rebellious children.<br>
The beauty of Paradise; and the flames of Hell;
and a Place of atonement [the Altar]
by virtue of the offerings [brought thereon];
and the glorious name of the Moshiach
which has been desecrated through our sins.
All these were created two thousand years
before the creation of the inhabited earth.<br>
They are arranged above the firmament,
appearing with sparkling lustre,
firmly rooted
before Him Who dwells over the Cherubim.
His throne was placed in the firmament,
standing firmly—
the seat of the King
Whose awe is upon all that surround Him.<br>
From His right hand [He gave us the Torah]
a fiery law engraved in writing,
which was set on His knees
with loving caress.
Situated on the south, was the Garden of Eden,
on the north
was the blazing hell.<br>
Facing east was Jerusalem
built with hewn stones,
concealing within it
the Almighty’s Sanctuary on earth;
set in its center was the Altar,
that atoned the guilty,
it lay
on the hewn, foundation stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">From which God shaped the world.</i><br>
The name of Yinon [Moshiach]
was engraved on it,
also the ineffable four-letter Name
was etched in letters.
There in the center
before Him Who blesses His people with rain
repentance is joined [with the other six objects],
it is the remedy for the sick and grieved.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Because of their sins and transgressions.</i><br>
It is ready to cleanse the filth,
and to provide clean garments,
and to pour good [fragrant] oil
on the heads of the penitent.
Therefore, we come before You,
young and old, [pleading with You]
to cleanse us from the stench [of sin],
and cast away the record of our iniquity.<br>
With prayer, they approach You
Your rebellious children;
they seek You every day
with words of prayer.
Let our words be considered
as the burning of sacrificial blood and fat,
and accept the murmuring of our lips
as the sacrificial pieces of bullocks and lambs.
Cause our sins to sink into the earth.
there where water drips.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Causing the earth to be soft and absorbent.</i>
Bring us near to You,
under the wings of Your abundant mercy.<br>
For in Your abundant mercy
we trust,
and on Your righteousness, we rely,
and for Your pardon, we hope,
and for Your deliverance, we yearn.
You are a King
Who loves righteousness from of old,
Who passes over the iniquities of His people,
and removes the sins of those who fear Him.
You made a covenant with the Patriarchs,
and will keep [Your] oath
with their descendants.
You are He Who descended
in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai,
and disclosed the ways of Your goodness
to Moses, Your servant.
The ways of Your kindliness,
You revealed to him;
and You made known to him
that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness,
and full of beneficence,
guiding the entire world
with the quality of mercy.
And so it is written:
“And He said:
‘I will cause to pass
all My goodness before you,
and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy
in your presence;
I will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious,
and I will be compassionate
to whom I will be compassionate.’”<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
Seek Adonoy while He may be found,
call upon Him while He is near.
“Return to Me, and I will return to you,”
says Adonoy of hosts.
He who knows shall return,
and God will relent
and turn from His fierce anger,
and not destroy
He who knows shall return and repent,
and leave a blessing after him.
Rend your hearts, not [merely] your clothes,
and return to Adonoy, your God.
For He is gracious and merciful,
slow to anger and abundant in kindness,
and relenting of evil.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


While Adonoy may be found,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Especially during the Ten Days of Penitence.</i>
I rise early to seek Him;
to entreat Him to atone [my] iniquities,
for I am red [with sin] as scarlet.
My heart is confused and benumbed,
and as one asleep, I drowse.
I have become almost like Sodom,
and to Gomorrah am I likened.<br>
I resemble a faithless wife,
and a shameless adultress;
I have become like a polluted garment,
like a garment

I lack a mediator,

That which was firm and upraised<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy Temple.</i> has sunken
and the Ariel [the Altar] has been destroyed;
cast down from heaven to the earth,
is the glory of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 2:1.</i><br>
Israel is a prey to robbers and vandals—
how long will this continue?
Numerous as locusts are my pursuers
and mighty are my destroyers;
when I take to heart,
my ruin, my destruction and my devastation,
my soul prefers [to die from] strangulation,
and death rather than to dwell in my bones.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">My soul prefers death rather than dwell within me.</i><br>
Because my bones
are crushed and pierced
by those who provoke and blaspheme You,
I said,
“I cannot bear Your anger and Your wrath.”
May it be in Your heart
to redeem the life of Your beloved ones,
for Your Name is called
on Your city and on Your people.<br>
Your people, scattered and dispersed
among every nation,
remember You in their adversity
and fear You in deed and thought.
Drown their deliberate sins,
and forgive and heal their negligence.
My Master, hear our voice,
let Your ears be attentive [to our prayer].<br>
Let Your ears be attentive
to the outpouring of our pleading,
let the praise of our lips be acceptable
as the sweet savor of our sacrifices.
We seek You, our Shield,
and in You we place our trust,
for we are called by Your Name,
do not abandon us.<br>
You have abandoned us, O Master,
these many years—why?
We have become as astonishment, an example,
a byword, a scorn,
a shame and disgrace.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Among the nations of the world who persecute us.</i>
Speedily fulfill the promise
that You made to the desolate [land]:
“I, Adonoy, build the ruins,
and plant that which was desolate.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 36:36.</i><br>
The desolate land,
in Your great mercy, rebuild it,
and establish it firmly;
hear, O God, her supplication,
for the time to favor her is come.
Strengthen those who praise You,
shield them in the shadow of Your hand,
and may the redeemed ones of Adonoy, return
and come to Zion with singing.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”
Seek Adonoy and His might,
seek His Presence continually.
Seek Adonoy while He may be found
call upon Him while He is near.
Let the wicked one forsake his way,
and the man of deceit, his thoughts;
and let him return to Adonoy,
and He will have compassion for him,
and to our God,
for He will abundantly pardon.
Return Israel unto God,
for you have failed by your iniquity.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 5

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rav Saadyah Gaon.</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
My soul mourns and my face is darkened,
[because] the House of my glory<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy Temple.</i>
has been smashed by the lion;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuchadnetsar.</i>
even my escaped ones
that were left, my remnant,
were crushed on the third day of Tishri.<br>
The raging flames and flood
overwhelmed us in their pursuit;
they trod down the Temple
and divided the spoil;
the elders of the remnant
who escaped the day of vengeance,
were now destroyed
on the fast day of Gedaliah ben Achikam.<br>
The poor among the people were torn apart,
that which was left by the caterpillar,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuchadnetsar.</i>
was quickly devoured by the locust;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael ben Netanya.</i>
the vine-keepers and farmers
that were left on the orders of Nevuchadnetsar,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “the earth shakers.” See Jeremiah 52:16.</i>
perished in the flames,
and there was none left to erect a fence
and to stand in the breach.<br>
How can I narrate [the disaster]
when my groaning is so heavy?
My soul is weary,
and my congregations are grieved.
The few vines [Jews] that remained,
from the fierce burning,
even they could not remain,
and were scattered in wrath.<br>
How long will You hide your face from us?
Hear our cry
and loosen our bound ones,
O Holy One, behold,
there is no one to plead in our behalf,
look on our misery [and redeem us],
and we will crown You with Your praise.<br>
We have been despoiled
from generation to generation,
and from age to age,
the fangs of the flying viper
stings us;
Mighty One,
be aroused and awake for our justification,
Atone our iniquities,
and call an end [to our suffering].<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,

Chapter 6

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Benjamin ben Zorach.</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
You taught us of old,
to entreat You with our lips;
[how] with prayer and supplication
to knock at [Your] door.
We approach You with diligence
and not with laziness—
avert calamities [from us]
that come from time to time.<br>
Behold we come before You
with broken spirit and humbled heart,
to confess before You
all our follies and stubborness of heart;
You Who searches hearts,
and heals the broken in spirit,
renew a correct spirit within us,
and create for us a pure heart.<br>
You appointed from of old
these ten days,
for each individual to return
and find atonement,
while the entire year
is available for communal repentance,
to cry and pray
in times of anguish and distress.<br>
If the individual hastens
and repents within [these ten days],
he is pardoned;
but if he despairs [of atonement]
and does not repent,
there is no hope for his iniquity.
Even if he prepares and offers
all the rams of Nevayos<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A place of the choicest rams.</i> to help him,
though he will plead and cry
his prayer will not be heard.<br>
The prayers of the congregation
as well as those of the individual,
ascend to You alone;
for You, our Rock, hear prayer;
receive us with favor
and grant us pardon,
favor us
as though we had brought burnt-offerings.<br>
Judge us
with compassion and pity—
Your distinguished children
whom You took for Your treasure—
let their disobedience
be drowned in the depths of the sea,
and let them praise You forever
with every kind of praise.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness

“For You, my Master,

Remember not the sins of our ancestors,
let Your mercy come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
For Adonoy hears the [cry] of the needy,
and His bound ones, He does not shame.
For our lives are spent in sorrow,
and our years in sighing.
For because of [our faith in] You
we are murdered each day;
we are considered as sheep
to be slaughtered.
For You will not forsake us forever, O God.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.

Chapter 7

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rav Shimon ben Isaac [R’ Shimon the Great].</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Send us Your light and Your truth,
grant good fortune to those who believe in You,
for You Adonoy are good and forgiving.
Look on our afflicted souls,
in Your goodness, take us to freedom,
for the waters have reached our souls.<br>
May our cries be heard,
return our exiles to their dwellings,
for we are strangers and sojourners.
We knock at Your door constantly,
we cling to You, to be joined,
for we have been brought very low.<br>
The insolent deride us in our plight,
save us that we may thank You, our Rock,
that You have delivered us
from our tormentors.
Your dispersed ones look to You for support,
strengthen them in their fear of You,
for this is the whole purpose of man.<br>
The laws of the heathen peoples are vanity,
but Your desired ones follow You longingly
for You are gracious and merciful.
Your Temple was turned into ruins,
favor her with rebuilt walls,
for Your kindness<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In returning Your <i>Shechinah</i> to dwell among us.</i> is better than life.<br>
I am weary and in my affliction I pray:
“May my oppressor be shamed and disgraced,”
for Adonoy will do justice for the afflicted.
The speech of my enemies lie heavy on me,
they provoke me all the day,
and thus my days are consumed in smoke.<br>
May He pay them according to their deeds,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Israel’s.</i>
and thus teach His people a beneficial lesson,
that He will not cast us off forever.
May his Merciful One grant his desire,
and remove his disgrace from him,
for how good and how beautiful was he.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">When he [Israel] lived on its own land.</i><br>
My cities have become ruins,
strangers have entered my gates,
because I bore the disgrace<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The sins.</i> of my youth.
“I will yet greatly rejoice in you,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 61:10.</i>
when You will say this to Your redeemed,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i>
[they will say:] “For You have given me joy, Adonoy,
with Your deeds.”<br>
Mighty One! Awesome One! Revered One!
cause our redemption now,
because for Your sake,
we are continually slain.
Clear the crooked way [of impediments]
that we may proclaim Your glorious praise—
that Adonoy has redeemed Jacob.<br>
May our enemies perish by excisement,
look down on us from the mighty heavens,
for our days on earth are a shadow.
Bring near the time of my redemption,
let my enemies hear [Your] voice [proclaim]:
“That the day of Adonoy is near.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Joel 1:15.</i><br>
Exalted One, show Your arm,
to Your beloved,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> show a pleasant countenance,
for though Adonoy is exalted,
He still regards the lowly.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">psalms 138:6.</i>
Hear the voice of my supplication,
let my prayer ascend to Your dwelling,
for Adonoy hears the cry of the needy.<br>
Favor our prayer as a thanksgiving offering,
say to Your people,
“I will show you favor,”
for the Torah shall go forth from Me.
He will incline the scale [in our favor],
He will garb and wrap Himself in strength,
for He causes pain and brings healing.<br>

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rav Shlomo Habavli.</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Again be compassionate with us,
bring back our exiles as You promised,
renew again as of old
Your love for Your people.
Remove anger
and quickly quiet Your vexation.
Turn from Your fierce anger
and let Your mind be changed
concerning the evil intended for Your people.<br>
Gather and seek the lost ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i>
and strengthen Your inheritance—<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i>
[Your] sheep that are slaughtered
and shorn for fearing You.
If the transgressions are too numerous
among those who crave Your forgiveness,
turn [from Your anger] for the sake of
Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage.<br>
The iniquity of our fathers
has burdened us [with exile]
and we have to taste the sour grapes;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Jeremiah 31:29. I.e. the punishment of their sins.</i>
we were made to drink the cup of poison,
bitterness and wrath.
As in the days when You dwelt among us,
and made our lives sweet,
return to us, O God of our deliverance,
and annul Your anger toward us.<br>
You have not totally rejected
those who take refuge in You
and testify to Your Oneness;
they have been punished for their sins,
and look to You to be healed.
Appease Your anger
in accordance with righteous practice.
Turn [from Your anger] Adonoy, how long?
and change Your mind about Your servants.<br>
Daily we yearn
for the revelation of Your secret<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The coming of Moshiach.</i>
which is sealed and hidden,
[while] Your pious ones waste away [in exile];
humiliation breaks our hearts
as we wait for Your graciousness.
Return Adonoy, free our souls,
deliver us for the sake of Your lovingkindness.<br>
We are forsaken
and counted with them
that go down into the grave,
into mourning has been turned
[our] harp, and song, and flute;
those who mourn with tears,
will walk proudly with thanksgiving.
Adonoy! Bring back our exiles
like springs in the desert.<br>
Tears are the food
of those who trust in You,
O my Rock [Who is] Almighty;
“Where is the Redeemer?”
the Almighty’s adversaries ask scornfully.
As You appeared then in a vision,
as You spoke to the righteous [prophets]—
return [now] Adonoy
to the thousand myriads of Israel.<br>
Hear Adonoy,
incline Your ear and listen
to those who plead, “Please forgive,”
reply, “I have forgiven.”
Even though our sins are numerous,
You open the door saying.
“Return O Israel.”
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,

Return Adonoy, free our souls,
and deliver us for the sake of Your kindliness.
Return, return, You have said to us,
regarding repentance,
from the very beginning of creation
You promised to accept it.
The correct offering to God
is a broken spirit,
a broken and humbled heart,
God will not despise.
Let come before You
the groaning of the prisoner [of sin],
according to the greatness of Your power
set free those condemned to die.
Grant truth to Jacob,
kindliness to Abraham,
as You have sworn to our fathers
from the days of old.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children

“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;

from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,

My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,

For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 9

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rav Ephraim ben Isaac of Regensburg. It is entitled the Akeidah, the Binding and retells the episode of the binding of Isaac.</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Though the pigeon offerings have ceased,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of the word <span>רֶבַע</span> is a quarter. In the time of the Temple a poor man was permitted to bring doves or young pigeons which were worth a quarter of a <i>dinar</i> for his offerings.</i>
though the tent of His dwelling is now empty,
we need not lose hope
for we have the merit of our old father.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham.</i><br>
Recognize his presence
when we mention his righteousness before You;
You commanded him,
“Take your beloved son,
and let his blood be wrung out
at the side [of the Altar].”<br>
He ran to the lad and consecrated him,
though his soul was bound up in his soul;
he put the wood and fire around him,
and the crown of his God was on his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was compared to the Kohain Gadol who wore the Crown of God upon his forehead.</i><br>
The only son, tender and light as a deer,
answered and said to his father,
“Behold we are bringing the fire and wood,
but there is no offering to bring.”<br>
He answered him with words
that would not terrify him;
his father said to him,
“God Himself will show [the lamb],
and Adonoy will let us know
that which is His [sacrifice].”<br>
Both heeded Your commandment
and did not question You[r word];
without hesitation, they hurried quickly
to one of the mountains.<br>
When they saw a blazing pillar of fire,
they quickly brought the wood for
the burnt-offering;
together, linked closely in love,
they walked straight through the wilderness
as though it was a plain.<br>
When the only son perceived
that he was to be the lamb,
he said to his father, the tested one<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">God had tested Abraham with nine tests and this was the tenth.</i>
“Do with me as you would a lamb,
have no pity and do not spare me.<br>
He [God] has delight in me and desires me,
to Him I will bare my heart;
even should you refuse to sacrifice me,
in the end my spirit and my soul
will be gathered unto Him.<br>
He [Abraham] bowed his hands and feet,
and held his sword over him;
he laid him carefully on the wood
as the fire blazed on the altar.<br>
He stretched forth his neck willingly,
and his father came close
to slaughter him in the Name of his Master
and behold, Adonoy stood over him.<br>
God observed what was being done,
how the father had not spared his son,
his heart and his hands were lifted [as one],<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">To do God’s will.</i>
and God saw
all that was done.<br>
God called to Abraham
who was sanctified from the womb,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi, Psalms 110:3.</i>
choose an exchange for your son,
behold there is another ram,
offer it without delay.<br>
The exchanged [ram] will be his offering,
its burning will be proper
and its smoke will ascend;
and it will be [as if] he
and his exchange [are offered before Me].<br>
May the memory be before You in heaven,
engraved forever in [Your] book,
an everlasting covenant,
never to be erased,
with Abraham and Isaac.<br>
Your worshippers have come to bow to You;
regard the righteousness of that binding

Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses];
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>

Chapter 10

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Benjamin ben Zorach.</i></small><br>
You taught the way of repentance
to the rebellious daughter [Israel];
between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur
we are to return unto You [in repentance].
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return.<br>
Long ago, from of old,
You prepared the way for repentance,
before You spread out the mighty heavens,
and established the earth;
thus, for all who return,
repentance is a balm and a remedy.
Those who knock at Your door,
do not send them away empty-handed.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return.<br>
Behold, the first to be created from dust,
Adam, the first to be formed,
You tried him with a light commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Not to eat from the tree of knowledge.</i>
which he did not keep.
You were indignant and angry with him,
[and decreed] to shorten his years;
but when he repented,
You preserved him like the apple of Your eye.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return.<br>
When his offspring [Cain] went astray
by shedding his brother’s blood,
You sentenced him to be a wanderer,
to go from place to place;
but when he returned to You
and left his evil ways,
You prolonged his life to seven generations,
anyone who found him
was forbidden to slay him.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return.<br>
He [Reuben] who profaned his father’s bed,
was unstable as water,
his feet had almost slipped<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He was almost condemned to Gehinom for his sin.</i>
had he not poured out his heart as water.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Before You in repentance.</i>
The young lion [Judah] sinned
with Tamar at Enaim,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 38:15–23.</i>
when he confessed his sin,
You inclined the scale to justify him.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return.<br>
He broke the barriers of the world,
did [Achav] son of Omri, with his wickedness,
he desired to worship the Asherim idols,
and added transgression upon sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">By causing others to do likewise.</i>
You tore up his sentence
when he repented of his transgressions;
You had mercy on him as he confessed
and forsook [his evil way],
and in You he found deliverance.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return.<br>
Tongues as sharp as arrows
had the people of [Ninveh] the great city,
their errors and willful sins
were numerous, without count;
when You sent the vision of their destruction<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Through the prophet Jonah.</i>
they were seized with trembling and terror;
they repented properly, and
it was accepted before Your glorious throne.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return.<br>
You Who searches the innermost heart,
and Who is girded with might,
teach us that we may know
to walk the straight path;
if our rebelliousness is great
with transgression and crookedness,
for Your sake, please, cause us to return,
that we should repent in the proper way.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite

the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,

“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>

Your “friends”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Friends,” the righteous are considered God’s “friends.”</i> are dear,

As of now Your servants are still smitten.

They smite and strike with whips
[the people known as] My one nation.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Israel.</i>
My drink was blended with tears.
From the deepest pits I called Your Name:
Where [and when will I find] my hope?
My hope was for peace.
[But within our] homes there is fear.
I did not hide from disgrace.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For I was accustomed to it.</i>
Beloved Israel
is slaughtered upon the hills and mountains.
“These are the sin-offerings.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2*</sup><i class="footnote">“These are flogged.” Each verse ends with a punishment meted out by the <span>בֵּית דִין</span>—the Jewish court.</i><br>

The sins have overpowered
and they [therefore] torture Your inheritance.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Israel is tortured by the nations.</i>
And we are considered as sheep for slaughter.
The best of us are trapped for our sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the righteous are punished for the sins of the rest.</i>
We are truly at fault
for [that which happens to] our brothers.
Our brothers, the unfortunate Jews,
all their blood is spilled as waste,
and their flesh is beaten
with thorns and bramble.
“These are those who are stoned.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2*</sup><i class="footnote">“These are flogged.” Each verse ends with a punishment meted out by the <span>בֵּית דִין</span>—the Jewish court.</i><br>

the bitterness of death has reached you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. your end has come.</i>
We hoped for light,

In the place of deep darkness,
their voice [still] chirps.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">‘In … chirps,” i.e. despite great despair we don’t cease to pray.</i>
And from the [great] sound of the crier
my limbs tremble and turn weak.

Who is the only One.

that He is One.
At [the word] One their souls departed

The killed have become many

They were bitten
by the snake, poisonous serpent, and scorpion
and their blood mixed on the barren rock
when many [of Israel] fell.
Old and young and righteous people
that are beloved to one another

[Yet], the enemy insults and abuses Your Name.
And [from] the wounds of] my flesh

“And also the dead do they divide.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Even after having murdered, they ruthlessly defile the body.</i>

Oh! would that we died at the hands of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than at the hands of our enemies.</i>

The destroyer sliced her<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Israel’s.</i> pregnant ones,
to destroy his offspring
and they kneeled
[expelling] their children through the fissures.

Therefore, I cry with bitter tears,

My strength was cut down

Chapter 12

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Gershom ben Yehudah (the Light of the Exile).</i></small><br>
Remember the covenant of Abraham
and the binding of Isaac,
and return the captives
of the tents of Jacob
and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.<br>
For our sins are great
our Temple was taken as a debt.
We betrayed Your abundant love
which caused a reversal [of that love].
Return with compassion
to the remnant of Israel
and save us
for the sake of Your Name.<br>
The deeds of Your first righteous
remember,
[as well as] the strength of Your friendship.
Command the redemption
of Your servants.
Reveal Your hidden secret.
Return the captives
of the tents of Jacob
and save us
for the sake of Your Name.<br>
We became tied as brothers
to frivolity and insipidness.
Our speech (quality of prayer)
has greatly sunk.
Exalted One!
Raise us up from our low state
and bring us into the light
from darkness.
Return with compassion
to the remnant of Israel
and save us
for the sake of Your Name.<br>
[Pour] a tide of fire and flame [upon our enemies],
to destroy the torturer
and the haughty one.
From the oppressor [to be saved]
send us Your help.
Awaken!
to arouse Your love [for us].
Return the captives
of the tents of Jacob
and save us
for the sake of Your Name.<br>
Mighty Redeemer, for Your sake redeem us,
see how helpless we are,
look, our pious men are gone,
and we have none to intercede for us.
Return the captives
of the tents of Jacob
and deliver us
for the sake of Your Name.<br>
The covenant with the Patriarchs
the Matriarchs
and the [twelve] tribes,
Your oft-repeated mercy and kindness—
remember [now] O God
to those who are stricken and tortured,
and for Your sake [they are ready]
to be killed all the day.
Turn with compassion
to the remnant of Israel,
and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.<br>
You Who avenges [innocent] blood,
judge our cause,
repay [punish] sevenfold
into the bosom of those who torment us;
we have been sold for naught,
[therefore] redeem us without [ransom] money,
raise up Your ruined, Holy Temple,
before our [very] eyes,
and return the captives
of the tents of Jacob
and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”<br>

Chapter 13


Hear Israel,
Adonoy is our God,
Adonoy is One.<br>

with an abundance of praises.
Besides Him there is none
that can perform wonders.
His strength I shall relate [with clarity],
with might, His awesomeness,
[concerning] Adonoy the King of Hosts.
His way is [powerful as] the tempest
and with storm is His demeanor;
Who illuminates the world
and darkness is His dwelling.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">‘Who … dwelling’ i.e. though light to the world emanates from God yet He is hidden—He cannot be perceived by any creature.</i>
And all His servants

Whose kingdom is glorious.<br>
Hear Israel,
Adonoy is our God,
Adonoy is One.<br>
Earthquakes, meteors, and thunderclaps,
hurry and run
to praise Him with pleasantness.
The Pure One makes His world quake
at the time of His anger.
[When] Adonoy will rule<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. when the Kingdom of God will be perceived by all.</i>
the nations will tremble.
The pillars of the heavens will tremble;
and become solidified.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">By the “shout” of God.</i>
The stars and the constellations
and the illuminating hosts.
Before Him kneel
those that are many and on high,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the angels.</i>

Hear Israel,

The One Who rules the world
wounds<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. punishes.</i> and heals,
He preserves righteousness,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. He remembers the good that is done, for generations.</i> He ignores sin,

The world of the five-hundred year cycle
they fear [Him] and tremble
in every single district [of the world].
They tread in fear
to bow to the King.
And the people will say, Adonoy is King!<br>
Hear Israel,
Adonoy is our God,
Adonoy is One.
I will raise my voice at all times,
the exaltedness of God

Keepers of the Law<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Torah.</i>
and those who know my decrees,
sound the trumpet before Adonoy, the King.
Strong One! Who reveals the hidden,

They powerfully adore [You],
old and young.
Your kingdom
is Kingdom over all the worlds.<br>
Hear Israel,
Adonoy is our God,
Adonoy is One.<br>
Strong One from on high!
Exalted in Your domain,

For Your sake take pity

Adonoy Who rules, Adonoy who ruled.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Who rules now and has always ruled.</i>
He Who lives forever,
Who helps and supports,

Gather [from exile] those who hope to You

Adonoy will rule forever.<br>
Hear Israel,
Adonoy is our God,
Adonoy is One.<br>
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 14

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Chapter 15


Let the evil one leave his path,
and let him humble
the haughtiness of his heart.
Let him return to Adonoy
and He will show him mercy as he repents.
Let him do so before he perishes<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. before his time.</i>
or before his day comes.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. or if he dies when his time comes.</i><br>
I beseech you, man, abandon!
I beseech you, abandon!
Abandon that which is disgraceful
and that which is slanderous,
before you are flown away
as the doves to their dove-coves;
and before the creditor<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. God.</i> comes to collect
the deposit.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The soul which He temporarily gives to man.</i>
Therefore, repent!
and remember the Day that is coming<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Day of Repentance (Yom Kippur).</i>
for the day is short
and the work [remaining] is great.
O! who will give his attention [to this]!
Let him do so before he perishes
or before his day comes.<br>
I beseech you, man, abandon!
I beseech you, abandon!
Abandon the vanities of this world
and remove yourself [from them],
for tomorrow<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. when you are no longer alive.</i> you shall weep
from that which you laugh today.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. while still alive.</i>
And in the writ of your adversary<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">‘Writ… adversary’ the accusations drawn up by the ‘yetzer hora’ (the evil inclination).</i>
that which is written cannot be erased,
and no gifts will help
neither bribery placed in his lap.
“The workers are lazy
and the master is pressing.”
The accuser is stepping forward
and stands ready for his conflict.
[Therefore … do something …] Let him do so before he perishes
or before his day comes.<br>
I beseech you, man, abandon!
I beseech you, abandon!
Abandon the [seeming] honors of this world
which is just a passing state,
for hell<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">‘<span>תָּפְתֶּה</span>‘—lit. enticed, i.e. the place for those who are enticed to sin.</i> is ready
with [powerful] flames and sparks.
I beseech you, remember your end
at the time
you will be plucked and lost [from this world],
when every brother<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Who will remain alive.</i> will shout “Hoah!”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">An exclamation of joy.</i>
and every friend<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Who will remain alive.</i> will wander away.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. will forget about you once you have died.</i>
Therefore, return
and mend yourself while in the vestibule<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This world is compared to the vestibule of the world to come.</i>
so that you may enter the palace<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the world to come.</i>
and its goodness.
Let him do so before he perishes
or before his day comes.<br>
I beseech you, man, abandon!
I beseech you, abandon!
Abandon the enticements
that your soul loves
and say [to your soul]: “My soul,
better that you bear the pain<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Of depriving yourself of sin.</i>
rather than attain your desire,
to draw water from another well.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. from deriving your sustenance from other sources than the Torah.</i>
And if you will claim:
‘who will bear witness
[as to what I do] when I lie down.’<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. who is to know what I do in the privacy of my inner chambers?</i>
[Know!] that the ledger is open
and the hand is writing,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">All your misdeeds are being recorded.</i>
repent! and you will merit
[the rewards of] the future to come.
Let him do so before he perishes
or before his day comes.<br>
I beseech you, man, abandon!
I beseeech you, abandon!
Abandon the pleasure of this world
and its joy
before your spirit wanders off
in every corner and direction.
And your eyes will see
an open hell;
there your soul will be consumed,
and severed [from the ultimate good].
For, from where do you come,
from a fetid drop;
and you are going
to the grave and abyss,
and you will give an accounting
to the One Who places clouds as His chariots.
Let him do so before he perishes
or before his day comes.<br>

Chapter 16

<small><i>The following prayer was composed by Rabbi Shimon ben Isaac.</i></small><br>
O holy Torah,
pray pleadingly
before the Rock Who is revered in holiness.
Pour forth sweet prayer
and recall the actions at Horeb,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Where the Torah was given to Israel.</i>
when they uttered: “We shall do and obey”
in order to draw near to God.<br>
Seir and Paran rejected Your Torah
not wanting to keep it,
God arose and investigated them,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If they observed the seven Noachide laws which they had accepted.</i>
seeing that they did not, he released them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even from the seven Noachide laws.</i>
The High One cast them off
for not keeping their statutes;
in anger and wrath,
he executed vengeance against them.<br>
He came accompanied from His myriads,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He came to Mt. Sinai only with some of His angels.</i>
and was sanctified in the heavens;
from His right hand a fiery law,
a flashing flame.
With pleasant faces,
they joined themselves to Him,
they were kissed from His mouth
through the Ten Commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They heard the first two commandments from His mouth.</i><br>
The world became firmly established
though it melted due to the stipulation.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">God created the world on the condition that Israel accept the Torah. The world’s existence was not secure until after Sinai.</i>
As though finding great spoil, [it rejoiced]
at [Israel’s acceptance of] Your word.
The mysteries of Your precepts
were entrusted to Your loved ones,
who have ever since honored You.<br>
Though they are wanderers and fugitives,
and exceedingly vexed,
in the sweetness of Your honey [the Torah]
they always delight.
They beautify the tradition
of both the Written and Oral Law,
they prize Your word as more precious
than onyx and jasper [stones].<br>
My heart loves those who expound Your Law,
who refine it with clarity,
who set aside their time
to reveal Your hidden secrets.
The general and specific principles
they perceive and examine,
they banish sleep from their bedchambers.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In order to pursue their study of Torah.</i><br>
Daily they search
and ponder in their hearts [to determine]
what is forbidden and what is permitted,
and verbally expound their decisions.
Between the clean and the unclean,
they distinguish and teach;
despite distress and privation,
their eyes are filled with light.<br>
Statutes and Judgements
were decided on their word,
and yet by hostile judges
were they judged.
Remember this O Torah,
to strengthen those who study you;
those who explain your thoughts,
grant them aid and support.<br>
Entreat your Creator
with words of supplication,
for He is your God,
your Creator and your Master.
If not for the perfect one’s [Israel]
constant meditation in the perfect Torah,
it would have been cast in a corner,
forsaken and desolate.<br>
Heaven and earth
stand firm because of her,
and by virtue of [Israel’s] pure reverence
and [fulfillment of] her lucid commandments.
Chant mightily
and pour forth supplication,
that our prayers go through [to Him]
unobstructed by the clouds.<br>
They approach You<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">lit. Him.</i> with supplication,
to be cleansed from their stains [sins],
grant their wish,
be merciful and gracious.
Gather the numberless congregation
into the faithful city [Jerusalem],
and like a noisy flock in its pasture,
may she resound with multitudes of people.<br>
May He rescue the captives
from darkness and gloom,
and forever encompass them
with strength and songs of rescue.
And through repentance
may they be gently saved from destruction,
may He seek the lost and strayed flock.<br>
May He heal the weak,
and remove all sickness,
may Zion, the glorious city, be filled.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">With multitudes of people.</i>
Bind up the broken [Israel]
and disgrace the haughty [nations],
and greatly avenge
the city so attached to You.<br>

Chapter 17

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbenu Gershom [the light of the exile].</i></small><br>
My throat has become parched
[from] crying out over injustice,
when I see the evil one
trample that which is holy.
I cried out: Help [us reach]
the hidden<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. for that day is known only to God.</i> day of vengeance.
My intestines, therefore, tremble
and my heart melts.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">‘My intestines … melts’ i.e. I am consumed by fear.</i><br>
Master! You have sanctified the land<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Land of Israel.</i>
with ten [levels of] holiness.
Within her You dwelt
for [so that we may merit] forgiveness.
[The place of] Your majestic power<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Temple.</i>
was established by Your Holy Hands.
Foxes trampled there
and [the Temple] was plowed up by plows.
My intestines, therefore, tremble
and my heart melts.<br>
The city of perfect beauty,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Jerusalem.</i>
the fortified city,
and the place where sins are forgiven
once a year,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Yom Kippur.</i>
You have poured wrath and anger on it
for so many years.
Your anger You poured out,
and You have not yet taken pity
to reestablish it.
My intestines, therefore, tremble
and my heart melts.<br>
The hub of the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Jerusalem.</i>
You have destroyed and emptied it.
The forest of Lebanon<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">‘<span>לְבָנוֹן</span>‘—a play on the word <span>לָבָן</span>—white, i.e. the place where we were cleansed by our sins—the Temple.</i>
You burned and ignited.
Great One!
The inhabitants You brought down
[and] removed them.
Those [i.e. the nation] that You took,
on the day of anger
You slaughtered [in many ways].
My intestines, therefore, tremble
and my heart melts.<br>
From the delightful land
Your beloved left.
They wander in exile,
they [nevertheless] praise Your Name.
The enemies oppress
to cause pain to Your nation
[by saying:] You are Adonoy’s nation,
[yet] you are exiled from your place.
My intestines, therefore, tremble
and my heart melts.
We shall open our mouths
and we will justify You.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. We will admit that You have dealt rightly with us.</i>
Our Strength! [Despite] all that befalls us,
You are righteous.
Holy One! Justice is with You
to give us over to the oppressor,
who tramples us with his foot,
grates his teeth and crushes us.
My intestines, therefore, tremble
and my heart melts.<br>
Our fathers corrupted their ways,
and for their sins we were trapped to suffer
for the reason that
we held on to their deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. we continued in their ways.</i>
[Because] we were filled with rebuke
we became repulsive and despicable,
[so that] many evils and tribulations
were provided [for us] as our punishment.
My intestines, therefore, tremble
and my heart melts.<br>
To return to You, Master,
we have consulted and agreed.
Upon returning
we have been greatly remorseful and contrite.
With Your mercy be gracious to us
for we have been annihilated and finished.
Let our enemies not rejoice,
for despite that we have fallen we shall rise.
My intestines, therefore, tremble
and my heart melts.<br>
Return the captives who have been scattered
due to their great guilt.
And gather them from amongst the nations
with an abundance of love.
Fulfill Your promise
that Your messenger the prophet prophesied.
Establish the kingdom of David
that is fallen and destroyed.
Then my intestines will exult
and my heart will rejoice.<br>
Remember the kindness of our youth<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Remember what You did for us when we first became Your nation.</i>
and the covenant with our early generations.
Remember the merit of our forefathers,
[so that] the sons will not be destroyed.
With pride they shall go
with tears [of joy] and with prayers
from north and south
and from the hidden lands.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The lands to which the ten lost tribes were exiled.</i>
Then my intestines will exult
and my heart will rejoice.<br>
Now in our oppression
we have remembered You,
ashamed and humiliated.
We declare: ‘We have sinned.’
‘Forgive us, please,’ we pronounce.
Please convert ‘strict justice’
to ‘lenient justice.’
Bring our righteousness into the light
as bright as the seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Of creation.</i>
Then my intestines will exult
and my heart will rejoice.<br>

Second Day of the Ten Days of Penitence



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>

Chapter 3


To You, we pour out our hearts and souls
like water,
all of us—to the Almighty in heaven.
Come, you old, with your young,
cleanse yourselves,
and remove your sinfulness.<br>
Let us multiply before Him
[our] supplication and prayer,
and this we ask of our God:
That the good [inclination]
prevail over the corrupt [one],
that he forsake his way—
the transgressor and evildoer.
Prepare your heart and amend your thoughts
for great is the power of repentance.
In the assembly of people
let us multiply words [of prayer]
and the mighty God will not abhor them.<br>
He desires the return of the corrupt sinner,
to save his soul from destruction [Gehinnom].
Hear [our] supplication
and accept those who beseech You,
as we lift up our hands
toward Your Holy Dwelling.<br>
May the words of our mouth
be acceptable [before You],
and atone our sins,
both the involuntary and the intentional.<br>
Consider and remember
the call of Your pleasant ones,
and relent of the evil against Your people.
Grant the desire of Your servants,
and let them delight in Your comfort.
They rely on Your kindliness
and trust in Your compassion.<br>
For in Your abundant mercy
we trust,
and on Your righteousness, we rely,
and for Your pardon, we hope,
and for Your deliverance, we yearn.
You are a King
Who loves righteousness from of old,
Who passes over the iniquities of His people,
and removes the sins of those who fear Him.
You made a covenant with the Patriarchs,
and will keep [Your] oath
with their descendants.
You are He Who descended
in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai,
and disclosed the ways of Your goodness
to Moses, Your servant.
The ways of Your kindliness,
You revealed to him;
and You made known to him
that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness,
and full of beneficence,
guiding the entire world
with the quality of mercy.
And so it is written:
“And He said:
‘I will cause to pass
all My goodness before you,
and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy
in your presence;
I will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious,
and I will be compassionate
to whom I will be compassionate.’”<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
Israel will be delivered by Adonoy
for an everlasting deliverance;
she will not be ashamed or humiliated
for all eternity.
The hope of Israel is Adonoy,
their deliverer in time of affliction.
Hope of Israel, Adonoy,
all who forsake You, will be humiliated.
“And there is hope in your destiny
says Adonoy,
“[Your] children will return to their borders.”
I hoped continually for Adonoy’s [help],
and He turned to me and heard my cry.
Righteousness is Yours, my Master,
and the shame is ours
to this very day.
Do good, as You see fit, to Zion
may You rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said.<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Only in You, Adonoy,
is the hope of Israel.
In later times and in early times
was Israel saved by Adonoy.
Why, then, is this day so delayed
for so long a time
while we await Your deliverance, Adonoy.<br>
I resided and was delayed in exile
during the days that I was forsaken,
in the land of a detestable
and ugly people.
Why has there been
such a decline in my dignity,
while I was chastised with suffering.
Still, I say: “Hope to Adonoy,
be strong and He will give you courage
and hope to Adonoy.”<br>
You were originally
the sword of our pride.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Through You our enemies were destroyed.</i>
When we hoped for You,
also, the way of Your judgments
we desired.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">To see Your judgements inflicted upon the enemy.</i>
Why is it so
that there is no person of merit to pray
for atonement of our guilt.
Regarding our suffering the nations say
that our bones have dried up
and our hope is lost.<br>
We recall the previous exiles
but their duration was short.
The two first exiles were limited
but the current exile is still intense.
Why should we be regarded as animals,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Let to the slaughter.</i>
in such variance
to what is normal among other people.
The hope of Israel is Adonoy
Who is their Savior during times of travail.<br>
To carry
and be relieved of the yoke of the nations
is what the children must do
because the Torah obliges them to do so.
They are driven from their homeland (Israel)
and their Beis Hamikdash is destroyed.
Why should the Father hide
their path (of redemption)
which is promised in their behalf,
that there is hope for ultimate salvation
by the word of God,
that the Children of Israel will return
to their boundaries.<br>
My legs have virtually buckled
and they have fallen [from the path of God]
because I became jealous
of the mockers of Torah
who distort the proper ways.
Why should there not be destruction
of the supremacy
of those who band against God.
When this happens, those who trust in Adonoy
will obtain renewed strength
and grow wings like eagles.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Radak Isaiah 40,31.</i><br>
I have been absolutely pursued
but the year of my redemption has not come.
We are handed over to those who afflict us
and pull out our hair
while we are not confident of redemption.
Why are our heroes pursued—
the few strong among us that remain.
I hope sincerely to Adonoy
that He will turn to me.<br>
Your vines<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the nation of Israel.</i> that were fenced it
have been penetrated by the nations
and destroyed and plundered;
whereas the thorns
that were removed from the vineyard<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the nations that veered from God.</i>
became arrogant and did not rot.
Why then have they become old and strong?
Why are they not ashamed, as promised?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">By the prophets.</i>—
“The hope of Israel is Adonoy
and those who forsake You will be shamed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">There appears to be a juxtaposition in the verse. The last two lines refer to the promise of the prophet mentioned above.</i><br>
Those who engage in falseness
glorified themselves by saying:
“What we desired we saw [in Israel’s state].”
They explained this by saying: “Our signs
that we used as indications were just.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the arrows which they shot that landed toward Jerusalem, serving as an indication that Jerusalem would be destroyed.</i>
Why is their way successful
while we, who awaited Your kindness
became tormented.
Adonoy, be merciful to us
because we hope to You.<br>
The resurrection of the Beis Hamikdash
in which there were thirteen breaches—
its time appears distant.
The breach extended to the roof.
Why should the wicked live
and not be destroyed
so that those who trust in Adonoy
will then inherit the land?<br>
The nations plunder Your inheritance<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the land of Israel.</i>
in order to drive us from Your portion.
“Turn back, turn back, Shulamith,”
they say in order to separate us from God.
However, we reply: “Why are you so arrogant
and say to each other
that we shall disassociate Israel from God?”
[On the contrary,] “Adonoy is good to those who trust Him
and to the soul that seeks Him.”<br>
O God!
the answer to the ‘whys’ that we ask
we can answer with a full mouth.
We have sinned to Adonoy, our God,
and these predicaments have befallen us.
Your judgments are just
and You (even when inflicting pain)
are supreme and exalted.
Righteousness is Yours
and we are full of shame.<br>
You warned us many times
and we said that we will not listen.
The voice that dripped from Your prophets
we rejected instead of listening.
Let Your power be aggrandized forever,
You Who can gather the stray people,
and in complete repentance,
bring us back to You.<br>
[The nations will ask:] “Why
is your garment red?”
The time for this question is near.
Their blood will be sprinkled
on the garment that he wears.
We will be eternally grateful
for the day [of redemption]
which will come in its time.
[We then will say] “This is Adonoy
for Whom we hoped
and we will rejoice and be happy
in His deliverance.”<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
Deliver us Adonoy,
for the pious man has ceased,
for the faithful have disappeared
from among the sons of man.
The pious man is gone from the land,
and the man of righteousness is no more.
Behold that there is no [righteous] man,
and we are bewildered,
for there is no one to pray [for us].
You are our King, O God,
command the deliverance of Jacob.
Israel waits for Adonoy[‘s deliverance]
from now and forever.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 5


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
I resemble a lion in the forest<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Based on Jeremiah 12:8. This is a reference to an unfit person who steps down to the Ark to act as Chazzan. See Mesechet Taanis 16b.</i>
and I am so likened because of my guilt.
My utterance is foolish,
my words are exaggerated;
I am deprived of intercessors<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. those who knock at Your door.</i>
such as [Mordchai] ben Kish,
Mispar and Bigvai.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These were colleagues of Mordchai.</i>
[Therefore] every head is sick
and every heart is faint.<br>
Faint, exiled, and despised,
I am pained and distressed,
I am chased about and broken,
I am filled and intoxicated with wormwood,
I am oppressed by masters
to whom I was sold for naught;
yet, when my soul fainted within me,
I remembered Adonoy.<br>
I remembered Your kindness and love
which were like a banner over me;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the banners of the tribes as they were encamped in the wilderness.</i>
they removed my guilt
and made me Your treasure.
But now, Your flock [Israel]
is left with only entreaty and prayer.
May the poorest among men [Israel]
rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.<br>
Your servants will exult and rejoice
when You remember my walls;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem is the speaker.</i>
to surround them with precious stones—
when [will You do this]?
My city is become a ruined heap forever,
and my heights are laid low;
and You, Adonoy, for how long?<br>
When will You revive us,
and bring us up from the abyss?
O glorious One,
loosen and remove the straps of our yoke,
fill our storehouses with plenty,
and prosper our endeavors;
may Your kindness, Adonoy, be upon us.<br>
May Your mercy be full upon us,
as we seek You in distress.
I stretch out my hands to You,
I seek You from within [my heart],
my soul thirsts after You in the night,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A metaphor for exile.</i>
for I have desired You;
Adonoy, put me not to shame
when I call upon You.<br>
I call upon You from the depth,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Of my heart.</i>
I lift my eyes [to the heavens],
I lift my hands to the heights,
I let my fountain of tears spread out;
O look at my virtuous deeds,
blot out and remove my wickedness.
Adonoy, hear my prayer,
give ear to my supplication.<br>
Give ear to my supplication, my Foster,
my Creator, and my Pedagogue.
To You are revealed and known
my wishes and hopes—
that my intentional sins be sunken,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In the depths of the sea.</i>
and my unintentional ones be atoned.
Give ear to my words, Adonoy,
and consider my meditations.<br>
May my meditations be regarded as pure,
and my prayer correct.
Hear, O God,
forgive my unworthy and perverse deeds,
strengthen those who praise You,
and accept my words,
and let the meditations of my heart
be before You, my Rock and my Redeemer.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,

“For You, my Master,

to all who call upon You.”<br>
O Israel, return
unto Adonoy, your God,
for you have stumbled in your iniquity.
Adonoy, do not rebuke us with Your anger,
nor chastise us with Your rage.
We are sunk in muddy depths [of sin]
without a foothold,
we have come into deep waters
and the whirlpool has swept us away.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return;
renew our days as of old.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.

the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation

And there it is said:<br>

Chapter 6


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
There is no God besides You,
Your dominion is over all generations,
and Your covenant endures forever.
Your right hand knows no restraint,
the power of Your hand is unlimited,
Almighty, Who answers in distress.<br>
Mighty are Your wonders,
and the power of Your kingdom is forever,
and Your years are unending.
Avenger of [our] blood,
You have saved us many times,
and humbled mighty kings.<br>
Behold, You have not changed,
You are now what You have always been,
the sons of Jacob, You have not consumed.
As we are their descendants,
why are we forsaken forever,
and forgotten as dead men, from the heart?<br>
We are scattered in every corner,
enslaved in every country,
and no favor is shown us.
We are obscured among every people,
and put to shame and disgrace
among the nations of the world.<br>
We are sunk in the lowest depths,
we have collapsed
and there is none to raise us,
to You alone do we cry.
We sit [disgraced] as false witnesses,
ashamed to lift our heads,
and are drunk with gall and wormwood.<br>
We stumble at noon and at night,
like the blind, we grope in the darkness,
and know not the time of our redemption.
Even those purchased for money,
can be freed,
but we are wearied day and night
and find no rest.<br>
How can I endure in the thick slime,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Of Exile.</i>
and what is my end
that I should be patient
until the time You bring me to freedom?
In the morning we say:
“Would it were evening,”
and in the evening:
“Would that the morning<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Yesterday’s morning; see Rashi to Deut. 28:67.</i> draw near,”
because of fear of heart and soul.<br>
We are likened to sheep gone astray,
whoever finds us, consumes us,
and takes no pity on our souls.
I lifted my eyes around me
and looked left and right,
but I found no one who knows me.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Who cares for me.</i><br>
I turned to every side
but there was no help,
I cried to You and called—
Almighty, Who answers in time of trouble.
O Rock, Your hand is not shortened,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., limited.</i>
Yours is the power and strength,
why do You sleep—rouse Yourself.<br>
Listen to our words of supplication,
behold our feebled state,
and do not rebuke us with Your anger.
Look on the humiliation of our generation,
regard our heavy grief
and do not chastise us with Your rage.<br>
Turn to our cry from Your Dwelling,
look on the groans of Your children,
and turn us not away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
We seek You with entreaty and prayer,
O God, favor us in this hour,
and hear Adonoy, our supplication.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite

Keeper of kindness

Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,

and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
All the peoples
walk, each of them, in the name of his god,
but we walk
in the Name of Adonoy, our God forever.
And we trust in Your loving kindness,
our hearts will exult in Your deliverance.
And we will sing of Your strength,
we will sing joyously
of Your lovingkindness in the morning.
And through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 7


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
How can I return to You through repentance
when those who worship other gods
don’t permit me to worship You?
They seek to separate me from You
and still I did not forsake Your precepts.<br>
How was I able to go into exile
and go on every path and province
while the idol worshippers ruled over me
with their laws that endured
and their king reigned for a long time;
while I have not been called
to come to the king?<br>
How were the rivers able to flow
from the dripping of my tears
while I was given over to evil doers?
They and their children
shoot me with arrows from their quivers
while I am a choice sheep taken to slaughter.<br>
How is it that the end of days is concealed
and not known,
and my enemies who cut my glory
are saved from death,
considering themselves wise
like Haymon<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi Kings I, 2:11, referring to Moses and the generation that left Egypt.</i> and Darda
while I am foolish without wisdom.<br>
How is it possible that the kingdom
of the Chosen People has been torn apart
while their kingdom has endured—
the kingdom of evildoers
and they live with confidence,
in joy and gladness
and I reside in exile?<br>
The potion of poison—
how did I drink and swallow?
I cried and shed tears
because of the oppressive yoke of Ishmael
while they mock me [and insist]
that I heed and harken what they say
and I remain like a deaf person
and I do not hear.<br>
How was my God able to smite me
while my previous wounds were still unhealed
and the cloak of my glory
was donned by Edom
as they eat their sweet delicacies—
milk and honey,
when I am like withered grass?<br>
How did the nation of Kedar surround me
and Didan and Shva rule over me?
They proclaim as a prophet
a man who never prophecied
they provide strength for their kingdoms,
troops and armies
and I, where shall I go?<br>
How did You administer such suffering
commensurate with my sins and foolishness?
In the teeth of lions and lionesses
was I consumed,
and they, young and old [were confident]
saying that they can overpower us.
As I was childless from previous suffering,
I became again childless from further suffering.<br>
How did my stars become dark
and my zodiac change
as the nations abominated my scrolls?
They prevented my feet
from ascending to Jerusalem during festivals
and I virtually veered completely from God.<br>
How did You heed my iniquities
and scrutinize my guilt
but against those who battle my soul
You did not defend me?
Even while they were in full strength
in inflicting pain and anguish upon me
and still I trusted in Your kindness
and my heart therefore rejoiced.<br>
How did I sit alone
and become cast astray
and denigrated from my dignity?
I wandered amongst the nations
while they ruled and were successful
their kingdom endured
and I am childless and alone.<br>
How have my mockers and denigraters
so embarrassed me.
Their power has not deserted them;
as they cried out
Aha! Aha! with words [of joy]
I was a disgrace with them.<br>
How did I remain amongst them
in worry and pain?
From the waves of anguish they pour on me
and from their spring, do I draw;
while they rest and lay [secure]
as the raven and the wolf,
while I am oppressed and sore.<br>
How is it that those who despise pureness,
dwell in Zion?
Who would believe such a thing,
who would imagine this to be God’s will?
While they are wealthy princes,
having been given high positions,
I remain impoverished and needy.<br>
How do they live in my Palace [my Temple]
and dwell there in dwellings
from above to below<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Temple mount to the Courtyard.</i>
and from below to the middle?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From the Courtyard to the Temple.</i>
While they have inherited a wealth of gold
and precious coins,
I am crippled while awaiting more blows.<br>
How is that my thoughts are confused
while they remain in Your thoughts?
Remember us and be mindful of us
for deliverance from idol worshippers.
Let them be devoured and removed
from the Place of Your Dwelling,
and then through Your abundant kindness,
I will enter Your House.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;

and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
God will remember His covenant
with Abraham, with Isaac
and with Jacob.
“I have sworn by Myself,” declares Adonoy,
“That because you performed
this deed
and did not withhold
your only son,
I will bless you greatly
and make your descendants numerous
as the stars of the sky
and as the sand on the seashore,
and your descendants will inherit
the gate of their enemies.
Through your children, will be blessed
all the nations of the world
because you heeded my voice.”<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 8


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Abraham who came from beyond the river<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Euphrates River.</i>
hurried to recognize You without delay,
You tried him with ten tests,
and he was found perfect without blemish.<br>
He was driven from his birthplace,
yet You made him a world-nation;
he fulfilled Your command,
and did not break it,
and he said: “I am but dust and ashes.”<br>
He brought [the angels] milk and butter,
and his fruit ripened when he was a hundred.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac was born when Abraham was a hundred years old.</i>
And when You said to him:
“Bring him up as a burnt-offering,”
he split the wood, laid it in order,
and put him [Isaac] upon us.<br>
Remember for us this day, his binding,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac was bound on the altar.</i>
and his self sacrifice.
Be gracious this day
to the tribes of [Jacob] the perfect one,
and dwell among their congregations.<br>
The offspring of the Twelve Tribes,
may they never cease to thrive,
bring them into Your beloved Dwelling,
in the mountain of Your inheritance
may they be planted.<br>
Gather all the scattered of their exile,
lead them to the House of their longing.
Spare those who are sentenced to death,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For their sins.</i>
close the mouth of the accuser and spare [us].<br>
Bear and raise us as in the days of old,
and atone every wanton and unintentional sin,
forgive and overlook our transgression,
and pardon our guilt and wickedness.<br>
Answer this day all those who hope in You,
for our eyes are lifted to You.
Redeem us from trouble and distress,
and bring us up from the deep pit.<br>
Accept our cry on this day,
and save us from the hands of the Satan,
erect the House of Your glorious Presence,
and disgrace not the Throne of Your Glory.<br>
Heal Your people from all [their] wounds,
for [Your] children have come to the birthstool<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Their pain is like that of a woman giving birth.</i>
we are seized in trembling
like a woman in labor

Redeem Your people from Gehinnom,
for upon You they cast their burden,
lead them to [Your] rebuilt city,
hasten [the arrival of Elijah] the Tishbite,
[and the Moshiach] [who is called] Menachem and Nechemiah.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,

Keeper of kindness

Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;

Chapter 9

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rav Isaac Ibn Gyas.</i></small><br>
In the early morning, I call upon You
Almighty, Who is praised;
let the order of my prayer be sweet to You
on this day when my heart exalts You;
lighten my darkness
and may it be bright as the morning.
My King and my God,
to You I pray.<br>
My foes who anger You,
humiliate Your people in their rage.
I bear the fear of You
despite the tumult of Your adversaries.
Pour out Your wrath upon them
and rage from Your Heavenly Dwelling;
and be jealous, Almighty, for Your Name
which has been profaned among the nations.
My King and my God,
to You I pray.<br>
O living One,
Who rides upon a swift cloud;
if You place me on a scale,
let my righteousness
be as heavy as the sand of the sea,
and my wickedness as light as a feather;
and if my path has been crooked,
and my sentence is [to be]
as that of an ox who is stoned to death,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">An ox that killed a man was stoned to death.</i>
then weigh me on the scale of grace,
for I am a man, wounded with transgressions.
My King and my God,
to You I pray.<br>
Restore the Holy Ark and its staves,
and clothe Aaron in his [priestly] garments;
and they<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael and Edom.</i> that hunt with snares
shall eat the fruit of their labor,
and each of those who rebelled,
let tongues of flame consume their offspring,
and let them both<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael and Edom.</i> be discarded
as dung is thrown out.
My King and my God,
to You I pray.<br>
Holy One, Who is above all masters,
Who judges all His creatures,
see how my quarrelsome adversary [Satan],
speaks evil of me
and lifts his spear against me,
and his vengeful darts are cast at me.
Let my soul be rescued [from him]
O God who annuls and frustrates [evil] counsel.
My King and my God,
to You I pray.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty.
You instructed us to recite

“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”
Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>

Chapter 10


Master! Understand our thoughts!
Listen to our murmuring when we cry out.
For our iniquities
do not allow us to disintegrate.
For our evil
do not allow us to be humiliated.
Our sinful matters have increased;
they have grown to the heavens.
The moving to and fro
of the shaking souls,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary to move to and from during prayer.</i>
Beloved One,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. God.</i> turn to us in response!<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
We have enraged You, O God of our praises.
We have angered You with our many follies,
and, therefore, our hope has been impeded
and our inheritance has reverted to strangers.
We have been scattered
from our House of Life,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Temple.</i>
for we demeaned the House of our Desire.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Temple.</i>
The Place of our Desire was destroyed.
[The bringing of] of sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">‘<span>נחוחי רצויינו</span>‘—lit. the pleasant odors that we brought to please God.</i> has ceased.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
We have strayed from the straight path.
We were too foolish to straighten our footsteps
for we abhorred propriety.
Our enemies
You have thrown upon us as an eagle.
Pul<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">King of Assyria.</i> captured my congregation,
he has weakened me and confused me.
I was hauled off to Lachlach and Chovor<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cities in Assyria.</i>
to distance me from my border.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Land of Israel.</i><br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
The holy remnant that was left
from the holy crowning city<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Jerusalem.</i>
spoke words of rebelliousness against You.
[Therefore,] You rose up
and removed Your Spirit [from us].
Nebo<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Pagan god of the Babylonians, an allusion to Nebuchadnezzar.</i> eroded all my heroes,
and destroyed all my courageous.
He broke all my limbs
and I was weakened by my destroyers.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
We trembled from our many hardships;
we cracked from difficult illnesses.
We hoped that You would show us redemption
[but, instead] troubles still beckon us.
Holy One of Israel! See
the humiliation of Your beloved [people]
that is distraught.
She has fallen from her honor
and been ruined.
Heal her broken [limbs] for she has sunk.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
Hear the prayers of the mouths [of Israel],
establish the magnificent structure.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Temple.</i>
Return [to us], God of all creatures.
Return the banished among lions.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The nations of the world.</i>
Please! bandage our wounds;
please, heal our diseases;
hear the sound of our song;
accept with compassion and willingness
our prayers.
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 11

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Third Day of the Ten Days of Penitence



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:<br></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>

Chapter 3


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
We seek You, we plead with You,
You Who forms the mountains,
Who relates to man his thoughts and words.
We pray to You and implore You
in shame and disgrace
because of our sins
which we enumerate today.<br>
We are gathered old and young,
in the House of Prayer, our diminutive Temple,
with enfeebled hands and shaking limbs,
alarmed and terrified on all sides.<br>
We dread and fear the two emissaries—
“anger and wrath” the two accusers.
As we search our deeds
and behold they are abominable,
we are seized with trembling,
with pangs and sorrow.<br>
Our faces are blackened
and we go about in depression,
we are shaken
and shattered to pieces;
our loins shake
as with the pangs of a woman in labor,
we fear and dread
from our many iniquities,
as we substitute our prayers
for the offerings of bullocks,
depending, trusting
and hoping in Your mercy.<br>
For in Your abundant mercy
we trust,
and on Your righteousness, we rely,
and for Your pardon, we hope,
and for Your deliverance, we yearn.
You are a King
Who loves righteousness from of old,
Who passes over the iniquities of His people,
and removes the sins of those who fear Him.
You made a covenant with the Patriarchs,
and will keep [Your] oath
with their descendants.
You are He Who descended
in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai,
and disclosed the ways of Your goodness
to Moses, Your servant.
The ways of Your kindliness,
You revealed to him;
and You made known to him
that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness,
and full of beneficence,
guiding the entire world
with the quality of mercy.
And so it is written:
“And He said:
‘I will cause to pass
all My goodness before you,
and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy
in your presence;
I will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious,
and I will be compassionate
to whom I will be compassionate.’”<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
To You, Adonoy, we cry
and in the morning, our prayers greet You.
To You we lift our eyes,
[You] Who resides in heaven.
We lift our hearts to our hands
to the Almighty in heaven.
God, our King from of old
Who does wonders in the midst of the earth.
You are our King, O God,
command the deliverance of Jacob.
Deliver, Adonoy, Your people,
the remnant of Israel.
Deliver us, God of our deliverance;
gather us and save us from the nations,
to give thanks to Your holy Name,
to be extolled in Your praise.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
To You, Almighty,
are the eyes of all creatures raised
because before You
the hidden [things] are revealed.
Great is Your counsel
and abundant are Your deeds,
the true Judge and Reprover
the witness and plaintiff to all creatures.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. He is the witness and accuser.</i><br>
Surely, there is no favoritism before You
for the rich and poor are equally judged.
Seek the merits
of Your trustworthy children.
Be compassionate to them
as a father is compassionate to children.<br>
You arranged and preceded
repentance before creation,
to discard evil deeds
and to choose to do [henceforth]
praiseworthy deeds.
The power of the ‘Evil Inclination,’
that entices and seduces
[man] from his youth [on],
for Your sake, repel him
so that he will no longer cause error
to those whose heart he has entrapped.<br>
Arrange for us, before You
a complete repentance,
Enlightened One,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. God.</i> in Your hands are
the hidden of the spirit and soul.
Cleanse our thoughts
from sin and guilt,
so that we may return to You
without perverseness and deceit.<br>
Your wonders are many wonders,
Your justice is an awesome justice;
those who call You with trepidation and fear.
Please turn towards their prayer
and do for them a sign that is good.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">‘A sign—good’ i.e. show them a sign that You accept their prayer.</i><br>
We have sought you
before the rising of the morningstar.
Shine Your countenance upon us
like the light of the morningstar.
With Your illumination cast light
that is as visible as the morningstar.
My Master, hear! My Master, forgive!
My Master, be attentive! and do it,
do not delay!<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>

“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Like the stag yearns
for flowing streams of water,
so does our soul yearn
for You, O God.
O God, the insolent rise against us,
and the congregation of tyrants seek our soul,
and they do not set Your Presence
before them, selah.
They said, we will inherit them,
[they who are] the favored of God.
Because of this, will Adonoy restrain Himself,
be silent, and allow us to be tortured
so greatly?<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation

Chapter 5

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rav Shlomo HaBavli.</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
We yearn for You
as the stag for flowing streams;
we long for the time of redemption,
but [thus far] in vain.
Distant, and remote,
our release [from exile] seems unattainable,
yet, we hope and wait
and do not cease to trust.<br>
Those who thirst after You,
pour hope into their hearts,
that they will yet appear before You
in their beloved Temple
amidst a throng [of worshippers]
with a pillar of fire around them.
Remove the uncircumcised and unclean,
who are their enemies.<br>
Let us cut them off
and inherit them,
they said and thought [this];
from the inheritance You granted them,
they have driven Your people away,
and each day, our destruction,
they still seek;
they tax us and rob us,
further impoverishing Your poor ones.<br>
They humiliate Your loved ones [Israel],
calling them dogs.
Stupid and disgusting
are their razored shaven priests.
They [Israel] however hear their reproach
without retorting,
they do not accept their religions
but go to the scaffolds because of You.<br>
And as for us,
our suffering is before You;
in the face of these things
will You refrain and be silent
at our affliction?
Even in the shadow of death
our eyes are turned to You.<br>
We are called by Your Name,
let it not be profaned,
in You, all of Israel is praised.
Even if our iniquities are so many
that the world is filled with them,
“I will blot out your transgressions,”
were the words spoken by You. (Isaiah 43:25)<br>
Regard our intentional sins as errors
and do not punish us,
beyond the letter of the law,
deal with us.
Because of Your everlasting truth,
may our oppressors be disgraced;
let the banner be raised,
and the scattered of Israel be gathered.<br>
Favor the daughters of my scattered ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i>
and accept their offerings;
gather the dispersed of the tenth exile
together with those of the previous nine exiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Before the destruction of the First Temple. See Abarbanel to the Book of Kings.</i>
Let sin be drowned,
and wickedness not be remembered,
O You Who forgives iniquity
and removes transgression.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite

Keeper of kindness

and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
We have no mouth [words] to answer,
nor the brazeness to lift our head.
A man will not redeem his brother,
neither can he give to God his ransom.
Redeem Israel, O God,
from all its anguish.
Be gracious to us Adonoy with Your kindness,
with Your abundant mercies, turn to us.
Adonoy redeems the soul of His servants,
and none are doomed
all who take refuge in Him.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,

because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 6

<small><i>This prayer was composed by R’ Shlomo Ibn Gabirol.</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
I am appalled in my great affliction,
for on the day when my sins are reckoned,
what will I plead before my Master?
I am desolate and speechless
when I remember how guilty I am,
I am ashamed and disgraced.<br>
My days are consumed in vanity;
because of the shame of my youth,
there is no peace in my bones,
I am burnt with fever
because the scroll [of my debts] is unfolded,
and the Creditor has come to collect.<br>
I held fast to my darkness,
and my soul did not consider
that I am a stranger and a sojourner here.
Woe unto me when my day comes,
then I will awake from my dream,
and return to my place.<br>
And then for the sins I did,
and the transgression I committed,
what excuse will I offer
to Him [God] Who sent me here?
The evil in my heart enticed me,
and for the iniquity which exhausted me,
I was met from the womb.<br>
The degenerate imagines in his soul
that he is like a tree planted by a brook,
while in fact he is carried to the grave.
A false allusion clings to him,
which melts away on his [final] journey,
and he looks from side to side.<br>
He is cast [into the grave]
like a silent stone,
and carries into the grave nothing
of all that he possessed.
His strength did not support him
even when his soul carried him,
how much less when the fires consume him.<br>
“My iniquity ensnared me,”
behold these are the words of my soul
during my existence on earth.
Therefore my soul is devastated;
and like a man lying in disgrace
I must return there naked.<br>
I was carried away by my sins
while in my heart I called out:
“I have sinned,”
that which is right, I did not desire,
and to the obstinacy of my heart, I clung,
to what avail is my crying now.<br>
Bear the punishment of your guilt, my soul
behold your sin confronts you,
so, therefore, bear your disgrace.
When I am perplexed about my iniquity,
my thoughts say to me [“don’t despair]
for we fall into the hand of Adonoy.”<br>
Turn from the Throne of Your Dwelling,
and open the door for me,
for there is none beside You.
O Rock, shield me,
redeem me from my iniquity
and teach me Your Torah.
Hear my voice according to Your kindness;
and on the day I stand before You
do not turn away Your servant in anger.<br>
See my affliction and answer me;
behold I am in Your hand,
and You Adonoy, be gracious to me.
Send Your truth and Your kindness
to the people [Israel] who cry unto You,
even to me, I am your servant.
Forgive our guilt,
and do not reckon the sins of our youth,
for our days are but a shadow.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,

Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Adonoy is great and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Beautiful in its panoramic vista,
the joy of all the earth is Mount Zion,
on the northern edge [of Jerusalem]
the city of the great King.
Do good as You see fit, to Zion,
may You rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
Turn away Your anger and Your rage
from Your city, Jerusalem,
Your holy mountain.
To recount in Zion, the Name, Adonoy,
and His praise in Jerusalem.
And may Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
as in the days of old and in earlier years.
The builder of Jerusalem is Adonoy,
the banished ones of Israel, He will gather.
For Adonoy will not cast off His people,
and His inheritance, He will not abandon.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 7


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
[Inhabitants] of Jerusalem, praise Adonoy.
O God, exalted with myriads of [angelic] hosts,
seeking its welfare
from the beginning to the end [of the year]
providing it with benevolent rain.
Your beautiful daughters [without sin]
are like the corner of a king’s palace
which are adorned with decorations.
Open your mouths and sing together
ruins of Jerusalem [when you are rebuilt].<br>
Let Jerusalem [on earth] be rebuilt
in the form of its twin [in heaven],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi to Psalms 122:3.</i>
this one and that one was born there<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">God will reveal the identity of the Jews living in exile.</i>
and He will establish its supremacy.
He will count and inscribe the [sins of] nations
the awesome One.
Remember Adonoy, the people Edom,
the day they destroyed Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem, shield
and save her for a balm and cure.
Be a canopy of honor for her,
You, Who measures
the depths with Your footsteps
protect her as birds who fly on high<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Who need no protection from man.</i>
so should Adonoy of Hosts
protect Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem, no one seeks you
those who loved you have forgotten you—
and no longer seek you.
Your advisors have ceased to exist.
Let Your promise be fulfilled:
“I shall return your judges,
because who will be merciful
upon you, Jerusalem, [except for God].”<br>
Jerusalem, mountains surround it.
As the walls of a fortress.
So, Adonoy envelopes His people,
He Who is the founder of the world.
Cast asunder the fastidious nations
so that they can no longer stand
and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem and Your people
became a disgrace amongst the nations.
They were cast into terror and fear.
O’ wall of Jerusalem,
shed your tears like a river
over the cities of your holiness
which became desolate and full of fear.
Zion becomes a ruin like a desert
like a desert [and so, too] Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem, remember the days of destruction,
when you were defiled.
In a group you can no longer
come and go [up to Jerusalem].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For the festivals.</i>
Why do You not see
Your weary inheritance?
Until when will You not have mercy
upon Jerusalem?<br>
The inhabitants of Jerusalem have sinned
and therefore have become wanderous.
Bring relief to Israel who sits abandoned—
how are You able to witness her destruction?
Then it will again become sweet to Adonoy
the sacrifices of Judah and Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem,
until when will your defilement
continue to remain in your midst.
They<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The nations.</i> consider as defiled
even your elders and rabbis.
Iniquity and hidden sin, you do in secret
Wash your heart from iniquity, Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem,
let those who love you live in peace
and let your ruins be rebuilt,
for which formerly you were praised
by people from afar and from near.
Let the prophecy be fulfilled,
for good deliverance:
that elderly people will again
reside in the streets of Jerusalem.<br>
Let Jerusalem be called the throne of God
in the coming times.
The precious stone (the Temple’s foundation)
will be recognized by throngs for its grace
when all Israel comes to be seen
when they beseech Adonoy of Hosts
[for His kindness] in Jerusalem.<br>
Let Jerusalem dwell confidently
and become a treasured land,
her children were exhausted in exile
as they went into captivity.
Bring Israel back to its city,
as the prophet spoke,
“Shake the dust off yourself, arise
and return to Jerusalem.”<br>
Jerusalem, its tremendous population
will cause people to live in open cities.
On that day you will be saved
and returned to your land,
after being forsaken and despised.
Don the clothes of your glory, O Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem, enemies have besieged you
to kindle the flame of altercation.
This was caused by your hidden evil inclination
which induced you to worship strange gods.
Adonoy should rebuke you, Satan,
He Who chooses Jerusalem.
And Adonoy should rebuke you,
He Who chooses Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem, rejoice with her<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When Satan is rebuked.</i>
all those who love her,
The children of Jacob and Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi, Amos 5:15.</i>
Do not remain silent from prayer
until He rebuilds the Holy Temple
and says: “Awaken, awaken<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">From the stupor of your exile.</i>
rise up Jerusalem.”<br>
Jerusalem, city of the Holy Sanctuary,
you are satiated with bitter grass—
because you denigrated His commandments
and the decree of reciprocity prevailed.
Your King, however, will still be for you
as a support in the coming days.
For the sake of the honor of Zion
I will not remain silent, [says God,]
and for the sake of Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem, (heed my rebuke)
lest My soul become detached from you,
says the Most High.
There will yet be a time
when He will rule with His good will.
On that day the moon will be embarrassed
and the sun will be ashamed
due to their dim light<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">That will not shine upon the nations because of the many retributions that will be inflicted upon them.</i>
because Adonoy of Hosts will rule
on Mount Zion and Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem, raise your voice in song

Don your strength and garment of glory.
Open your mouth in song

“Raise your voice with power!”
Heralds of the redemption of Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem will again become holy
and strangers will no longer traverse her.
The cup of poison
you will no longer drink.
your path will become sure

God will then comfort Zion

Jerusalem, sing and rejoice

will become exalted and supreme
when all people will come

on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem has become desolate
and its cities destroyed because of my sins.
Cast her sins
into the depths of the turbulent waters
and then raise her to the heights

The nations will then flock to her

to Jerusalem.<br>
Jerusalem,

Gifts and presentations will be brought
by Shva, Sva and the Kutites.
Come deliver us

Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
The [correct] offerings to God—
a broken spirit,
a broken and humbled heart;
God, [You] will not despise.
Then will You desire
the sacrifices of righteousness,
burnt offerings and whole offerings;
bullocks will then be offered upon Your altar.
And the kindness of Adonoy
is forever and ever
upon those who fear Him,
and His righteousness
upon children’s children.
And He said,
“I have sworn by Myself,” declares Adonoy
“that because you performed
this deed
and did not withhold
your only son.”<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 9


I have risen at dawn
to thank You, God of my praise,
I will sing to You in the morning
and make known to You my sins;
for this,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">My praise of You and my confession.</i> grant me
as a reward for my endeavor,
that my life be spared at my request,
and my people at my petition.<br>
In former days in Israel,
when sacrifices were offered,
though my sins were red as scarlet,
they turned completely white.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Through the sin-offering.</i>
Therefore, sleep escapes my eyes,
and I lament the destruction [of the Temple];
and I have nought but my words
and my prayer is my burnt-offering,
that my life be spared at my request,
and my people at my petition.<br>
When the Altar still existed,
and sacred offerings were slaughtered.
Each man brought his offering
and his sin was eradicated;
but now there is no Priest,
no sacrifice, no meal offering; [therefore]
let my confession be my sacrifice
and my prayer be my meal offering,
that my life be spared at my request,
and my people at my petition.<br>
Behold, when there was a sacrificial service<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the Temple.</i>
and the Priests served their turn,
the sin-offering atoned,
and the burnt-offering exonerated; [but now]
there is neither sin nor burnt-offering,
no fat and no liver-lobe; [instead]
I pour out my prayer
and present my supplication,
that my life be spared at my request,
and my people at my petition.<br>
Behold, in the Holy Temple of old,
when the zealous priests rose early,
the pure ones stood to draw lots,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This was done in order to assign the priests to the various services.</i>
but only new ones<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A priest could only perform the incense offering once in his lifetime because it enriched the one performing it.</i> offered the incense;
but now there is no frankincense
and no incense offering,
and I am left blackened with sin;
[therefore] when I confess my sins,
let my confession be accepted as an offering,
that my life be spared at my request,
and my people at my petition.<br>
See [O God] my Holy One,
that my hurt is greater than my groaning,
and there is none to stand by me,
and I have no House of Rest [the Temple];
only in You [I trust] and mention Your Name.
Strong Rock of my deliverance;
remove my guilt,
and then my righteousness will answer for me,
spare my life as my request
and my people as my petition.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,

Acting righteously

You instructed us to recite

the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,

“For You, my Master,

Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,<br>
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>

Chapter 10


[God] Who sits on high,
and gazes into the depths [of the earth]
and knows all that is hidden
and understands all mysteries.
Though our sins are overwhelming
and our iniquities have stained us,
please! let Your compassion withhold
Your anger and wrath,
God, King Who sits
on the Throne of Compassion.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
And though she has abundantly sinned,
[she],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. The nation of Israel.</i> the wretched and mournful one,
she has suffered enough of the wrath
of Your anger and fury.
She has become desolate,
mournful and devastated.
And from the time she was humiliated
she has not yet found compassion.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
The remnants of the Assyrian exile,
when they fell into the hands of the lion,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
he filled his treasures with their booty
and his dwellings with calves and fatted oxen.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">That he robbed from them.</i>
Soon afterwards [came] the wolf<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Persian exile.</i>
and the panther<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Rome.</i> allied with others
and the poisonous snake<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Edom.</i> biting angrily,
[there is] no dressing or balm [for the wound].<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
The face of one
guarded like the apple of one’s eye
has become [as blackened] as the
bottom of a cooking pot,
for the wretched one<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Nation of Israel.</i> has been left
without strength.
She has not hidden her face
from the humiliation and the wrath.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Nations.</i>
[The curses] recorded,
as well as those not recorded in the Torah,
[they all] befell her.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
Her life is precarious
because of the fears that come [upon her].
Like goats and sheep
among the lions,
in darkness and demeaned,
wounded and weakened.
Even the leprosied and contaminated
point their finger at us [in ridicule].<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
[Upon] the dispersion [of Israel]
into the world<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">“<span>הֲדוֹמְךּ</span>,” lit. Your footstool. The world is as a footstool for God.</i>
and the destruction of Your Palace<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Temple.</i>
gaze from on high.
And upon the nations [that brought this about]
pour out Your wrath.
Remember Your promise
that You uttered to Your people;
“Even if at the ends of the world
I will place you,
from there I will gather you
and console you.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
You affixed a time for those who are sold<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the Torah limits the selling of a person into slavery to six years.</i>
[to] double the time of hired workers.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">V. Isaiah 16, v. 14.</i>
Yet they<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Nation of Israel.</i> are dispersed to all corners,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Of the world.</i>
and after so many years
are still not remembered.
[Fulfill the promises] that were said to the Son of Amotz:<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Isaiah the son of Amotz.</i>
“Though mountains and mighty rocks
may move,
My benefaction and My covenant
will never be removed from You.”<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
Pardon us our Creator!<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will-return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 11

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Fourth Day of the Ten Days of Penitence



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>

Chapter 3


[Israel] beloved<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To God.</i> as the wife of one’s youth,
which You betrothed
with a great dowry and lavish gifts;
how she now sits in disgrace,
abominated, ugly and forsaken.<br>
She<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> who was bedecked
with precious ornaments,
with whom You made a covenant
and stipulations;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">To observe the Torah.</i>
how she now goes from door to door<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Like a poor beggar.</i>
and sleeps among the stone heaps.<br>
She who was garbed in linen and silks,
she who was
praised throughout the world;
how she is now considered profaned,
to be mocked, humiliated and cursed.<br>
She who was beautiful in her footsteps,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As she went up to the temple on the Pilgrimage Festivals.</i>
upon whom Your wings were spread;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">You protected her.</i>
how her feet are now wounded
as she walks the mountains after her young.<br>
Please,
You Who are enthroned on the Cherubim,
see how despite all this,
she has not turned to the arrogant [nations]
nor placed her trust on armed cavalry
or on their soldiers,
but only in Your abundant mercy.<br>
For in Your abundant mercy
we trust,
and on Your righteousness, we rely,
and for Your pardon, we hope,
and for Your deliverance, we yearn.
You are a King
Who loves righteousness from of old,
Who passes over the iniquities of His people,
and removes the sins of those who fear Him.
You made a covenant with the Patriarchs,
and will keep [Your] oath
with their descendants.
You are He Who descended
in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai,
and disclosed the ways of Your goodness
to Moses, Your servant.
The ways of Your kindliness,
You revealed to him;
and You made known to him
that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness,
and full of beneficence,
guiding the entire world
with the quality of mercy.
And so it is written:
“And He said:
‘I will cause to pass
all My goodness before you,
and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy
in your presence;
I will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious,
and I will be compassionate
to whom I will be compassionate.’”<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
There is none like You, Adonoy.
You are great,
and Your Name is great in its might.
God is known in Judah,
in Israel, His Name is great.
Help us, Adonoy, our God,
for upon You, we depend,
and in Your Name, do we come.
As Your Name, God, so is Your praise
to the ends of the earth;
Your hand is full of righteousness.
A tower of strength is the Name, Adonoy,
to Him rush the righteous and strong.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbenu Gershom, the “Light of the Exile.”</i></small><br>
Our God and God of our fathers!
Truly we have sinned
and caused others to sin,
we have surely betrayed You, our Father;
we were exiled because we lacked perception,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To follow Your paths.</i>
and we have suffered;
though we have been dispersed and oppressed,
we hope for Your deliverance.<br>
Remove, O Master, the iniquity of Your servant,
and do not turn away in anger
the children of Your loved one [the Patriarchs];
remember Your mercies, Adonoy
and Your kindnesses,
[grant them] kindness and truth
as You swore to Your loved ones.<br>
[They were punished with] exile and torture
because of their way of transgression,
and were afflicted
with the ninety eight curses<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 28:15–68.</i>
upon which You made a covenant
to admonish transgressors;
do not accuse Your people
who will be delivered through You.<br>
Acquit Your children of great transgression,
they are humble in their repentance
and entreat You with supplications;
cleanse the stain of their guilt
with Your Divine cleansers,
conceal their iniquities
and cast them into the depths
of Your raging waters.<br>
“Open their eyes,” release Your bound ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Isaiah 61:1. This is a plea for redemption.</i>
remove the stench of our iniquity,
as with nitre,
tear up our records [of guilt],
and waive our liabilities;
remember to show us compassion
even though Your Presence is concealed.<br>
Remember the oath and covenant of long ago,
be gracious in the merit of the Patriarchs,
who are listed backwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Leviticus 26:42. Jacob is written before Isaac and Isaac before Abraham.</i>
The platform upon which the Levites sang,
the blue-print of the Temple—
may it be Your will to return them to us,
with Your love of old.<br>
Take my revenge
from those who oppressed me,
they refused to free us,
and they held us with force;
the oppressed children of Judah of Israel—
God, bring back their exiles
like springs in the desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Revive them as springs can revive an arid desert.</i><br>
Look from the heavens,
from Your palace on high,
and let be revealed
the abundance of Your pity and compassion;
say: “Enough!” punishment for Your beloved,
do good, as You see fit
to Your city and Your people.<br>
Drown our sins in the depths of the sea,
Your Holy Palace [the Temple]
raise it above the high mountains,
[Israel] Your possession,
may they go with joyous hearts [to Jerusalem]
accompanied with flutes;
then You will desire their righteous offerings,
burnt-offerings and priest’s meal offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Which were totally consumed on the Altar.</i><br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,

Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
God!
Nations have entered into Your inheritance;
they have defiled
the Sanctuary of Your holiness,
they have made Jerusalem into heaps of ruins.
Pour out Your wrath upon them,
and let Your fierce anger overtake them.
Arise Judge of the earth,
repay the arrogant their just reward.
Give them according to their deeds,
and their evil deceptions;
according to their actions, grant them,
repay them their just reward.
Do good, as You see fit, to Zion
may You rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Who sits on the throne of mercy,

He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness

Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Let our prayer come before You,
and do not ignore our supplication.
Let come before You
the groaning of the prisoner [Israel];
according to the greatness of Your power
set free those condemned to death.
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 6


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
You are my portion
and the rock of my heart
I longed for You in the night
as I lay on my bed;
to You, Adonoy, I call when my heart is faint.<br>
We have betrayed You
and have thus increased Your fury and anger,
we have been stepped on and crushed,
for we have no good deeds.<br>
Our distress has greatly increased,
for we have erred in our vision [of truth]
and stumbled in our judgement, and [even]
all our righteous deeds are as filthy rags.<br>
We lack knowledge,
we are simpletons without wit,
even high angels, You charge with folly,
how much more so man, who is but a worm.<br>
Behold, You lift the isles as dust particles,
should You search and examine wrongdoings,
what could we speak
and how could we justify ourselves?<br>
I searched for one to set up the fence
and stand in the breach,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To protect us from destruction with his prayers and good deeds.</i>
but there is no upright one to appease You;
the pious man has perished from the earth.<br>
My destined time<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Of my redemption from exile.</i>
is hidden from my knowledge,
my iniquities have caused
my glory to be cut down;
indeed, I acknowledge my transgressions.<br>
I cry of violent robbery,
but there is none to deliver me;
why is the righteous surrounded by the wicked?
Your hand is not powerless to deliver us.<br>
Your lambs [Israel] are beaten by [the enemy]
who roar [with triumph] like the sea,
they are ravished and robbed
in the hands of the nations;
“Why have You forgotten us forever,
forsaken us for so long a time.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 5:20.</i><br>
Jacob has been given for a spoil,
and Israel to plunderers;
she who was honored
with a canopy of seven clouds<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When she left Egypt.</i>
is now dumb like a sheep before shearing.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Her crying is of no avail.</i><br>
The miser and degenerate [are seated]
like a king at his table,
while the generous and noble
are banished for their debt,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The sins of the vile and degenerate.</i>
like an unwanted vessel.<br>
Do not preserve [our iniquity] forever
to destroy us,
when Your left hand thrusts us away,
let Your right hand draw us near;
O Master, we are oppressed,
be our surety.<br>
We have had a bad name from long
and yet You have given hope to the repentant
with a generous spirit, [saying:]
“I will heal their rebelliousness,
I will love them in free-willed devotion.”<br>
My eyes flow like a stream with tears,
the mockers enjoy tranquility
while my gladness has ceased;
and as for me,
in an instant my feet would have slipped.<br>
Seek the lost sheep,
the people that will be saved [by You],
even though they have been found with sin
and transgression from the womb,
and the righteous man has fallen
before the wicked.<br>
[Your] testimony to Jacob
is sealed in the Torah,
that in the land of their enemy,
You promised to preserve them alive,
even were they to be so situated.<br>
Remove transgressions and erase guilt,
lest hell enlarges itself to squeeze in<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">To take in more souls.</i>
and opens its mouth without limit.<br>
Behold the storm<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The exile is compared to a storm.</i> and draw near to free us,
raise us and pull us from the muddy mire,
return, Adonoy, free our souls.<br>
We have sanctified a day of fasting,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Yom Kippur.</i>
to approach You in prayer,
prepare beforehand healing for our wounds,
remember Your congregation,
which You acquired of old.<br>
Lay aside anger, withhold wrath,
those who are held prisoners [Israel],
pull them out with bonds of love
from the dungeon, where they sit in darkness.<br>
Proclaim liberty
to the broken and desolate,
cut away the bars and break the yoke,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Of their exile.</i>
heal her fragments for she totters.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is a plea for the redemption of the Land of Israel.</i><br>
You have set repentance [as a remedy]
against the reptile and serpent,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the Evil Inclination.</i>
I hope in Him Who forgives and pardons,
and even should He slay me,
yet I trust in Him.<br>
Turn Your ear to us, O Creator,
hear O God those who seek You,
listen to those who entreat You,
accept my prayer as incense<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As an offering of incense.</i> before You.<br>
Strengthen the faint and fortify the feeble,
establish the Temple,
restore the canopy [Your Shechinah],
do good, as You see fit, to Zion.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Too long has our soul dwelt
with those who hate peace.
I am for peace;
but when I speak
they are for war.
Let there be peace within your moats
serenity withing your palaces.
Peace, peace to the far one
and to the near one,
says Adonoy, and I will heal him.
Adonoy, arrange peace for us,
for indeed all our works,
have You done for us.
Adonoy will give strength to His people,
Adony will bless His people with peace.
Rule and awe are with Him,
He Who makes peace in His high heavens.
For you will go out [of exile] with joy,
and be led forth in peace [to Zion].<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 7


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Establish peace for us,
seal our fate that we may live.
We will arrange a prayer before You,
[through] repentance, prayer, and charity,
we shall see Your countenance
so that we may cling to God,
and the result of the charity shall be
peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As a reward for our charity God will give us peace.</i><br>
Peace to the far one<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the penitent.</i> and the near one<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the righteous one.</i>,
to the besieged city;
a small city
and a great king has surrounded it
to prevent escape.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">“A small … escape.” A parable that compares man to a small city, the evil inclination—to a king and the good inclination to a wise and poor man.</i>
The poor wise one
will facilitate escape for the city
without need for fortifications.
The good inclination depends [on You],
[therefore] preserve [for him] peace.<br>
An abundance of peace [shall there be]
to those that love Your Torah
and no illness [shall befall them].
You Who saves Your nation,
and Who are their strength,
their escape and their hope—
judge Your people with compassion,
and command the deliverance of Jacob.
And let Your nation reside
in a dwelling of peace.<br>
We hoped for peace and goodness
but we suffered destruction and ruin.
To those who need to leave or to enter [the city]
they cannot enter or leave.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Out of fear.</i>
But, if He will forgive our sins
as a Kingly gift,
then I would be in His eyes
as one who [sought and] found peace.<br>
[Bring us] peace, charity and kindness
to whiten the red thread.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">On Yom Kippur a red thread was tied to a goat which was sent to Azazel and there pushed down the mountainside. The red thread would miraculously turn white as a sign of forgiveness from God.</i>
Adonoy, deliver Your people—
the remnant.
Establish a covenant with them
as the prophet foretold and engraved:
“And I will establish with them
a covenant of peace.”<br>
Call with peace
to Your perfect dove [saying:]
“Let Me hear your voice,
for the sound of your voice is sweet
and your vision is lovely,” when you pray.
He will expand the place of your dwelling,
the Protector of Jacob will redeem you,
the One Who makes your borders peaceful.<br>
The One Who makes peace above
will make peace for the humiliated people,
a denigrated and trampled nation
by an oppressor who plunders.
[A nation] dragged and plucked
will [eventually] present tribute,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. when the Temple will be rebuilt we will again offer sacrifices.</i>
as the prophet promised,
and that will be [real] peace.<br>
[God, whose Name is] ‘Sholom,’
will rest His Presence around his nation,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As their protector.</i>
and will serve as his support.
The ministers of Edom
will be gripped with trepidation.
And send to Your children.
Elijah the Gileadite,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">To herald the coming of the Messiah.</i>
[You, God] the Advisor, the Almighty
the Strong one, Who endures forever,
[let] peace rule!<br>
He is called “Sholom”
and He is master above all who rule.
He forgives the sins of His nation
and conceals their iniquities;
He accepts penitents
with an outstretched hand
and protects those who fear Him.
Dominion and fear are His,
He [is the One that] brings peace.<br>
“Sholom,” Who heralds good tidings
and proclaims salvation from on high.
He reigns over all
“Adonoy of Hosts,” is His Name.
When He speaks the entire world trembles
when it rises to be judged.
Adonoy will give strength to his people;
Adonoy will bless His people with peace.<br>
Peace be with you! do not fear,
for you shall yet come to see.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">During the Temple it was a Mitzvah to appear before God, in the <span>בֵּית הַמָקֽדָשׁ</span>, three times a year.</i>

Spread peace like a flowing river,

and gather her children [to her].
Sprinkle purifying water [upon her]
and cleanse the defilement of her skirts
and call to her in peace.<br>
We will lie together in peace
and sleep [without fear]
and Adonoy will watch over us.
Do not abandon us forever.
Why do You [seem to] sleep, awaken!
and bring our righteousness to light
and prepare our prophet<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Elijah.</i> [to come] speedily
so that we may increase our dominion
and [let there be] peace.<br>
[Grant] a good peace from a good Master
to those who come to You to be scrutinized.
Do not permit Your anger
to examine us in judgement.
Fulfill Your promise to Jacob
and [let] the benevolence of Abraham [serve—
as a merit] that we be judged favorably.
[When] benevolence and truth combine
[then there is] righteousness and peace.<br>
With peace and prime wheat,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Abundant and good quality crops.</i>
satiate the descendants of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">“<span>עֵבֶר</span>—Abraham who is called <span>הָעִבְרִי</span>.</i>
Those whose hope is to Adonoy,

Then their King will pass before them,
[the King] Who passes over their iniquity,
He will seek what is good for his nation
and address them in peace.<br>
Give peace to the children [of Israel]
who are blessed by [You], Adonoy.
The beautiful nation
that has been blackened.
Present her [to the nations] for praise,
for honor, and for splendor.
Fulfill for her the prophecy
that You engraved:
“And I shall reveal to them abundant peace.”<br>
Peace and an everlasting covenant

Peace has turned to bitterness for me

Chapter 8


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Abraham taught the knowledge of God
before it was known to all the world.
He expounded Your Name to all mankind,
and revealed what was hidden and unknown.<br>
He abhorred and broke the idols,
the misinformed, he attached to Your Name,
he chose the upright way [of life],
Torah and Mitzvos he kept without tarrying.<br>
You rescued him from the fire of the Chaldeans,
You protected him in the valley of Siddim,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When he battled the four kings in order to rescue Lot.</i>
You promised him:
“Your reward will be very great,”
and You distinguished him
with great wealth and honor.<br>
And when he replied, crying:
“What will You give me?
when I have neither root nor branch.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham had not yet been blessed with a child.</i>
You strengthened him in a vision,
telling him, “this one<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Eliezer. See Genesis 15:4.</i> shall not be your heir.”<br>
With his first fruit [Isaac]
You endowed him in his hundredth year,
and when You desired him<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac.</i> as an offering
both of them rejoiced with all their hearts,
and hastened to do Your will.<br>
As Abraham suppressed his compassion
to do Your will,
so may Your compassion suppress
Your anger from Your flock.
Their hearts and souls were ready,
so too, may our prayers before You
be accepted as an incense-offering.<br>
He hastened and took the knife,
therefore save their seed
from childless death;
the one son was bound
like a lamb for slaughter,
therefore favor our prayers
like a burnt-offering and sacrifice.<br>
He arranged the wood and kindled the fire,
therefore as we stand praying this day
let us not be put to shame.
You answered him from the highest heavens,
and You swore to him
twice by Your Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That You would remember his seed for good.</i><br>
You redeemed him [Isaac] with a ram
caught in a thicket,
therefore,
do not disgrace our petition and affliction.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Our fasting on Yom Kippur.</i>
Hear our cry and hearken to our entreaty,
in the merit of the Patriarch [Jacob]
who traveled to Succos.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 33:17.</i><br>
Let the voice of him who brings tidings<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Moshiach will bring tidings of our redemption.</i>
be heard in the world,
to redeem the people [who are]
the offspring of the everlasting hills.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Matriarchs were so called.</i>
Have mercy on the congregation
adorned [with Torah and Mitzvos],

turn to us with compassion,
for You are called

He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses];
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>

Chapter 10


I shall wail with my prayers,
with my prayers to my Creator.
To my Creator as I am bent [and submissive],
relying only on my spirit [prayers].<br>
With my spirit [prayers] and my tongue,
with my tongue I shall express my shame,
my shame before my Creator
until my throat becomes parched.<br>
My throat and my lips [can do good or evil],
the lips have two options,
there are two paths that they may follow,
doors are open to each one of those paths.<br>
The doors open to repentance
to repentance from a rebellious heart,
rebellious and wild,
for the daughter (Israel) who rebelled.<br>
Our Strength! we have sinned!
Our Creator! forgive us!<br>
The rebellious daughter’s body is bent,
bent and suffering from pain,
suffering and singed,
singed and marked
for destruction and death.<br>
Death and pain,
pain inflicting great suffering,
suffering which grips her,
as she goes forth in tears of anguish.<br>
Cries because of Your wrath,
from Your wrath and Your anger
Your anger and Your strength
gripped and leaned against me.<br>
Over Israel Your wrath is full,
full and weary,
[she is] weary and broken
and even defiled.<br>
Our Strength! we have sinned!
Our Creator! forgive us!<br>
Defiled as is a metzoraas
as a metzoraas whose hair is uncovered
vulnerable to afflictions<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">From the nations.</i>
and pretending to be unaware of them.<br>
She is aware of persecution but remains silent,
silent as if oblivious to a response,
as if totally unaware of their intentions
and covers her face from shame.<br>
Shame and disgrace
have clung to her,
clung and fused as one with her,
until she is ready for holocaust.<br>
Imprisoned, she is incinerated,
imprisoned she is decimated,
decimated and forsaken,
and divorced from her husband (God).<br>
Our Strength! we have sinned!
Our Creator! forgive us!<br>
From her husband she was cast in disgrace,
in disgrace for destruction,
for destruction in a land without shelter,
in which she cannot be exempt from suffering.<br>
Cleansed and atoned of her sins
complete atonement is not possible
for she lacks her Dwelling Place<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Temple.</i>
and is cast asunder like a rebellious cow.<br>
She rebels against her husband (God),
and was deceitful against Him,
she was so exceedingly deceitful
that there are not sufficient sacrifices for her.<br>
A sacrifice of either an “olah” or “mincha”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Burnt-offering or meal-offering.</i>
is no longer possible
for Israel is forsaken and bemoaning
as a leper whose disease spread all over her.<br>
Our Strength! we have sinned!
Our Creator! forgive us!<br>
The defilement of nations has spread upon us,
their defilement and jealousy.
Please, God, vent Your jealousy upon them
because Israel thirsts for You.<br>
My soul thirsts for You,
for you to provide tranquility for my soul,
to save me from the dung of exile,
my God, my Holy One.<br>
My Holy One, and my Savior,
my Savior from those who persecute me,
replace my persecutors by delighting me,
God, my Shepherd.<br>
My Shepherd and my God,
my God and my Rescuer.
Let my Rescuer permit me to inherit
[the land of Israel,] my vineyard.<br>
Our Strength! we have sinned!
Our Creator! forgive us!<br>
My disgrace is also Yours,
and Yours is obviously opposite You;
against You,
they have committed abominations
and their tongues were slanderous.<br>
The people for whom You split the Reed Sea,
and then passed them through,
thereby granting them added esteem,
this people that You created [to serve You].<br>
You created Your laws for me,
please choose the rightness of my prayers,
those prayers
with which I am entreating my God,
O God, Adonoy Who gives me strength.<br>
My God Who gives me strength, strengthen us,
strengthen us and fortify us.
Our King, please fortify us,
Adonoy Who rules over us.<br>
Our Strength! we have sinned!
Our Creator! forgive us!<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 11

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Chapter 12


King of Kings and loftiest of lofty,
resident of heaven and dweller on high
Who is praised
and glorified forever,
blessed and blessed
by all that exists—<br>
See the oppression of mourners, the worried.
Look, please,
at the denigration of the least of nations
who, dispersed and divided
among all peoples,
are shamefully, disdainfully,
shamed and disdained;<br>
mournful, isolated,
repulsed, and devastated
exposed to smiters,
their bodies to blows.
Mornings—”Wish it were night” they say;
nights—they say,
“Wish daylight were here!”<br>
They have no rest,
quiet, or peace—
nothing satisfying
to provide consolation.
Looking forward to peace,
they’re always at war;
hoping for good,
they’re paid with evil.<br>
So they prefer the sleep of death.
“Complain? Argue?
Our sins are the cause.
“We’ve erred, done evil,
ignored pleasant laws.”
Recall Your mercy, Adonoy,
and Your potent kindliness.<br>
Arise and pity us fully.
Gather our dispersed on land and sea
whom You sold for free to the Edomites.
Redeem us soon without money, bloodlessly.

O Rock of integrity,
for Yours, Master,
are forgiveness and mercy.<br>

Fifth Day of the Ten Days of Penitence



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You Who hears prayer,
unto You does all flesh come.
All flesh shall come
to prostrate themselves before You, Adonoy.
They will come and prostrate themselves
before You, my Master
and they will give honor to Your Name.
Come let us prostrate ourselves and bow;
let us kneel before Adonoy, our Maker.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
His courtyards with praise,
give thanks to Him, bless His Name.
As for us, through Your abundant kindness
we will enter Your House;
we will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.
Behold, bless Adonoy—
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy
in the night.
Lift your hands to the Sanctuary
and bless Adonoy.
Let us come to His Dwelling Places,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He!
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain,
for Adonoy our God is holy.
Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness,
tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth.
We will prostrate ourselves
toward Your Holy Sanctuary,
and give thanks to Your Name
for Your kindness and for Your truth;
for You have magnified
Your word far beyond Your Name.
Adonoy, God of Hosts,
who is like You, a mighty God;
and Your faithfulness is round about You.
For who in the skies
can be compared to Adonoy,
who can be likened to Adonoy
among the sons of the mighty?
For You are great
and do wondrous things;
You alone are God.
For great beyond the heavens
is Your kindness,
and until the skies is Your truth.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled,
and awesome is He above all gods.
For a great Almighty is Adonoy
and a great King over all gods.
For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth
that can duplicate Your works
and Your power.
Who would not fear You, King of nations?
For to You it is fitting;
for among all the wise ones of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms,
there is none like You.
There is none like You, Adonoy
great are You,
and great is Your Name in might.
Yours is an arm with might
strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand.
Yours is the day, also Yours is the night,
You established [the] luminary and [the] sun.
For in His hands are the depths of the earth,
and the heights of the mountains are His.
Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy,
or cause to be heard all His praise?
Yours Adonoy
is the greatness, the might, the glory,
the victory and the beauty,
for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; 
Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Yours are the heavens,
also Yours is the earth,
the inhabited world and its fullness;
You have founded them.
You set all the borders of the earth,
summer and winter, You formed them.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan,
You gave him as food to the people of legions.
You split open the fountain and brook,
You dried up mighty rivers.
You crumbled the sea with Your strength;
You shattered the heads of sea monsters
upon the waters.
You rule over the majesty of the sea;
when it raises its waves, You still them.
Great is Adonoy and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned upon the cherubim
You alone are God.
The Almighty is revered
in the great council of the holy ones
and is awe inspiring
over all that are about Him.
And the heavens will praise Your wonders,
Adonoy,
and Your faithfulness [will be praised]
in the assembly of holy ones.
Come let us sing to Adonoy,
let us sound the shofar
to the Rock of our deliverance.
Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving,
with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him.
Righteousness and justice
are the foundations of Your throne,
kindness and truth precede Your Presence.
For together let us take sweet counsel;
into the House of God
let us walk with the throngs.
For the sea is His, and He made it;
and the dry land, His hands formed.
For in His hand
is the soul of every living thing,
and the spirit of all human flesh.
The soul is Yours,
and the body is Your doing,
have pity on Your work.
The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
We have come [relying] on Your Name,
Adonoy! Act [on our behalf]
for the sake of Your Name.
For the sake of the glory of Your Name,
for gracious and merciful Almighty
is Your Name,
For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy,
pardon our iniquity, for it is great.<br>
Pardon us our Father,
because of our great foolishness,
we have sinned.
Forgive us our King,
for our iniquity is great.<br>

Chapter 3


(Adonoy’s) people, be strong; let us be strong
and call strongly to Adonoy.
The iniquitous will confess his sin,
and return to Adonoy who will pity him.<br>
Call to Him who neither sleeps nor slumbers,
Guardian of Israel,
“Wake up! Why’re you sleeping?
Recall uprightness and deeds well done!”
And Adonoy will do what He thinks best.<br>
God of truth, assured us,
“I do not desire a person’s death.”
Now that He’s available, seek Him out;
call to Him when He is near.<br>
Appease Him, beg Him, serve Him in awe;
all Jacob’s seed, honor Him!
Persist at the doors of the patient One,
lift our hearts as high as our hands.<br>
Whoever can appease [Him] effectively—
prepare [to pray] to your God, O Israel.
Arrange tearful prayers
because of Your tribulation;
designate a fast; call a [prayer] meeting.<br>
Let God’s servant beg, pray
that He turn from His wrath
lest we be lost.
Perhaps He will prefer those gifts
to fattened [animals]
and myriad streams of oil.<br>
Prefer [our] heeding to burnt offerings,
obeying to the fat of rams.
Refine and straighten the crooked—
recall these [to the seed] of Jacob.
Bring words with you,
and let us make up for bullocks with our lips.<br>
For in Your abundant mercy
we trust,
and on Your righteousness, we rely,
and for Your pardon, we hope,
and for Your deliverance, we yearn.
You are a King
Who loves righteousness from of old,
Who passes over the iniquities of His people,
and removes the sins of those who fear Him.
You made a covenant with the Patriarchs,
and will keep [Your] oath
with their descendants.
You are He Who descended
in the cloud of Your glory, on Mount Sinai,
and disclosed the ways of Your goodness
to Moses, Your servant.
The ways of Your kindliness,
You revealed to him;
and You made known to him
that You are Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to anger, Abounding in kindness,
and full of beneficence,
guiding the entire world
with the quality of mercy.
And so it is written:
“And He said:
‘I will cause to pass
all My goodness before you,
and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy
in your presence;
I will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious,
and I will be compassionate
to whom I will be compassionate.’”<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
And Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<br>
Give ear, O God, to my prayer,
and do not ingore my supplication.
May our prayers be considered
as incense-offerings before You,
the uplifting of our hands [in prayer]
as pleasant offerings.
Give ear, Adonoy, to our prayers,
listen to the sound of our supplications.
Listen to the sound of our cry,
our King and our God,
for [only] unto You do we pray.
Adonoy, God of Israel, You are righteous
for there is still a remnant of us
even to this day.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us!
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
<small><i>The Chazzan repeats after the congregation:</i></small><br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>The Congregation says:</i></small><br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over. Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


Adonoy, God of Israel,
You are righteous, God of forgiveness.
With subdued heart we come to beg of You,
with broken spirits;
we’ve adorned our thoughts
and prepared our hidden kidneys.
Lofty One, let Your ears heed,
let Your eyes perceive.<br>
Intertwining about me
are plague upon plague;
there’s no doctor, no specialist
to cure me.
The Evildoer digs a pit,
looking forward to trap the weak;
a smooth snare at his feet
[so the victim will] walk into the net.<br>
Your beloved are confused and broken,
they lack words and argument;
Judah and Israel
have had their supports removed.
Shriveled like a spike of grain,
their persons pained and oppressed,
their hunger sated with bitter herbs,
their thirst quenched with vermouth.<br>
From the deepest thoughts
of sage and rabbi alike
is hidden the length of the era,
is sealed the duration of ruin.
The daily atonements are gone,
sacrifice is abolished.
Your servants are impatient
while the prideful rebel is calm.<br>
Redeemer and Rescuer,
have You forgotten to commiserate,
to grant clemency?
Will You keep looking at our rebellion,
forever recall our putridity?
Are You so angry
that You’ve sealed off cries and prayers?
To Your myriad thousands return
and dwell amid their camps.<br>
Diminished is Israel’s pride,
the pride of Judah denigrated;
the Temple ruined,
unillumined, in darkness.
Light was turned to death’s shadow,
shine to cloudiness.
Where’s the forefather’s Support,
the merit of those who sleep in Machpela?<br>
Creator, when You judge
no man is favored, elevated;
The wealthy are leveled,
equated with the poor.
Why is the despicable one respected,
the little one raised and great?
While the desirable one, the play-child,
is imprisoned, prophecy gone!<br>
Your perfect ones do not rely on the sword
or on the spear.
They rely on fasting and sackcloth,
they lean on prayer and fast.
Reach out once more to
reacquire Your insulted ones
who aspire, look forward to You
from under the yoke of angry ones.<br>
Heed the looted and trampled,
suffering and desecrated people;
Merciful One, listen to cries
and willingly accept prayer.
May prayer be accepted in lieu of incense,
in place of offerings.
Hear the sound of my prayer, My king,
My God, for I am praying to You.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Why, Adonoy, do You stand at a distance,
ignoring those who are in trouble?
Why, Adonoy,
is Your fierce anger on Your people,
that You took out of the land of Egypt?
And now, let my Master’s power be great,
as You have spoken, saying.
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God
and accept
our prayers compassionately and willingly.
Why have You forgotten us forever,
forsaken us for so many days?<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 5


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Heed supplication and listen to prayer,
cancel anger and diminish fury.
The bitter-hearted who pray to You
will find help in Your great Name.<br>
Regard the cry of the groaning<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The groaning of the nation of Israel.</i>
behold their suffering;
do not disdain their bent stature.
Charge the insolent enemy for shaming them;
trample them and let their blood spurt.<br>
You have existed and still do,
and will exist in all Your glory.
You said
the seed of Your loyal ones would exist,
yet they are being wasted
by the power of Your fury.<br>
They angered You with their sins
and were evicted from their desire,
they were scattered all over without rest;
their spirit wounded, bent to the earth,
plowed upon
and deeply furrowed.<br>
Sunk in mud with no rescuer,
their predators at peace all around,
daily their enemy fights;
they spread their hands<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">To God in prayer.</i> to get out of trouble.<br>
Their lives are wasted
with agony and groans;
the weak are many and joy is gone.
They hope for salvation and end up crying;
they’re wearied by upstarts
who undermine them.<br>
They plot slyly to convert them from You,
weigh them down to weaken them.
They cry to You when exhausted
to find respite from their heavy burden.<br>
They express prayer, standing crowded,
request pardon with bowed head;
oppressors enrage them,
seeking their extermination;
may they be confounded and annihilated.<br>
Redeem Your followers from total destruction,
save them from enemies and elevate them,
command the salvation
of those who seek You in prayer,
justify them in judgment
from hidden and open [sins].<br>
Jealous avenger, be jealous for Your Name,
cut away the yoke thongs
from Your people’s neck.
See our suffering and repent from Your anger,
fight our battle
against the people You damned.<br>
Repay sevenfold those who anguish me,
besot Your arrows
with the blood of my oppressors.
Turn Your ear
to the sound of my supplications,
accept me when I call out, “Adonoy, Adonoy.”<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,

“For You, my Master,

For there is no righteous man on earth
who [always] does good and never sins.
For the inclination of man’s heart
leans to evil from his youth.
For You search out our iniquities,
and scrutinize our sins.
You have set our iniquities before You,
the sins of our youth
before the light of Your countenance.
As for man, his days are as grass;
as the flower of the field,
so he flourishes.
And You, Adonoy, are gracious and merciful,
slow to anger,
and abundant in kindness and truth.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,

Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.

Chapter 6


God, Adonoy, my power,
Creator, and Maker,
I am Yours with all I own;
when judging do not be harsh
lest You destroy
the soul approaching [You].<br>
In the dock to be judged,
the initial judgment is
fire of destruction.
You know my ways,
have brought to light my hidden sins;
do not destroy me.<br>
You, Who know the world’s ways,
including all hidden acts—
do not send the poor away in shame.
Though my wildnesses are many,
my mind misled me,
for my intent was not [to sin].<br>
I realize all is futility,
for every deed on earth
one’s soul is His assurance;
when man seeks to fill the desire,
the voice of my Beloved warns,
“Don’t carry out that evil.”<br>
You made Your creature undefiled,
heart’s evil misleads him;
so when You see sin cover it.
Tell my soul about Your salvation,
for we are hopelessly finished
if You keep track of our sins.<br>
My years are wasted on futility
the seriousness of my guilt
has terrified my bones.
Cleanse their redness,
the recent and the past,
the inclinations of man’s mind.<br>
You’ve searched all the chambers
of my crooked heart;
what have You found in me
of all You consider proper?
Sin is hidden within me,
my heart hot inside me.<br>
Keep my soul from destruction;
what will You gain
if I go to the grave?
In mercy turn to me,
for what worth has a soul
that goes and does not return?<br>
My wounds match my sins,
sack and ash are my bed;
my innards are in turmoil.
Anguish and troubles
come so thick
I cannot count them.<br>
I am bitter;
won’t You consider my suffering
when You examine my sin?
May my prayer please You,
be accepted by You,
that I be cleansed from great sin.<br>
Cleanse from sin the repentant
with broken, oppressed heart;
if he tarries, wait.
Look forward to his penance,
cover his errors,
and bend Satan secretly.<br>
Almighty Who bears iniquity and error;
should they increase,
conceal them.
Redeem us from being put to the sword.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The sword of the Angel of Death.</i>
Let my prayer succeed before You,
good and forgiving Almighty.<br>
Heed my prayer,
and wipe away sin like a cloud,
for You, Almighty do not want evil.
Adonoy will compensate me
according to His righteousness,
He will always hide me in His shelter—
the Almighty whose way is perfect.<br>
From the depths of the pit do I call You,
I pray to You with a pained heart,
for I always recall You.
Be clothed in mercy
and set aside my errors,
so that I need no longer be ashamed.<br>
Many say to me,
“Wallow in dust
and you still won’t be freed.”
May Your innards show mercy;
recall the kindliness of Your intimates;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Our forefathers.</i>
[as You have said:] how valuable to Me are your friends.<br>
Attack Your enemies heroically,
break the power of my enemies
who put me into the pit.
Use up Your arrows against them,
release Your prisoners from them.
And may these words of mine
be accepted pleasantly,
beloved and cherished,
Adonoy of Hosts
Who dwells between the cherubim.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,

Let the righteous hold to his way,
and the pure of hands gather strength.
Let your hearts be strong and with courage
all who hope in Adonoy[‘s redemption]
In our affliction we call to Adonoy,
and to our God, we cry,
and from His Sanctuary, He hears our voice,
and our cry is before Him.
Answer us, Adonoy,
for Your kindness is good;
in Your abundant mercy, turn to us.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,

My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,

Chapter 7


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
The pure-handed One will increase His force,
His power will grow and wax.
Were it not in Scripture
one could not say it:
The proud One wrapped Himself like a <i>chazan</i>
and declared the thirteen attributes.
He caused the words of His glory to pass
and showed Moshe the tied knot [of His T’filin].<br>
He prepared him and told him,
“So long as My sons sin,
let them perform this order before Me—
it is My attribute to forgive—
I am Adonoy, Adonoy,
gracious before you sin
and gracious after you sin and repent.
These are My ways and methods.”<br>
Good and forgiving, Master of kindliness,
Who tips<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The scales of justice are seen as two pans, one of strict justice and one of kindliness.</i> the scale toward kindliness,
again have mercy,
Withholder, Bearer, and Favorer.
It is Your policy
to eliminate sins one by one;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The first several sins are eliminated.</i>
to forgive and pardon,
increasing Your mercy and kindliness.<br>
Who like You teaches that penitence heals,
kindly One and master healer;
matching the size of the wound
is Your ready bandange,
though he has little money prepared—<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The sinner is described as a sick patient with few merits.</i>
the patient coming to you.
The balance grant us free,
Merciful, dependable One.<br>
Your cure [the Torah]
is the wonderful elixir of life
for the dark one;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish People (<i>Song of Songs</i>).</i>
the ingredients You blend are perfect
as is the lotion on the bandage.
Open swiftly, with Your hand,
the medicine kit
to provide balm
for the wounds of the lovesick one [Israel].<br>
When a laborer works for an employer,
in good faith, [though the employer]
expects to pay his wage,
that is not praiseworthy.
If he does damage or works lazily,
the master is praised if he’s generous.
Adonoy, our God,
is merciful and forgiving
though we rebelled against Him.<br>
Your veracious attributes
are supreme, most proper
as seen
from Your supplying food to the rebellious.
The remnant of Joseph<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Jewry is metaphorically called Joseph.</i>
hopes to find forgiveness from sin.
Grant good
like Joseph to his brothers,
forever to relate Your righteousness.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Then will You desire
the offerings of the righteous,
the burnt-offering—burnt meal-offering;
then upon Your altar will be brought up
[offerings of] bullocks.
You will grant truth to Jacob
kindliness to Abraham,
as You have sworn to our fathers,
from the days of old.
And the kindness of Adonoy
is forever and ever
upon those who fear Him
and His righteousness
upon children’s children.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;

Chapter 8


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Then on Mount Mor<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Poetic form of Moriah.</i>
the mute dove<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac who accepted his role silently.</i> rejoiced
when Ethan<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Literally “giant”—a reference to Abraham.</i> took him
as a burnt whole offering
the proud One tested him,
“Take this lad
as a raise-offering to Adonoy, sanctified.”<br>
“Like the law for the basket,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The basket of first fruits; see <i>Devorim</i> 26:4.</i>
place him before Me
your son here,
bring him as a bread offering;
I have chosen him, come anoint him
with the oil of sanctified anointment.”<br>
The pure one, upon hearing,
did not worry;
the will of His Rock was all he desired
united, both father and son
bowed to Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness.<br>
He prepared wood intending to kindle it.
The only son wondered and hoped
saying, “Where is the lamb of offering
sanctified sacred to Adonoy?”<br>
“The One Above will show the lamb,”
he replied,
“to satisfy, make happy the mother’s soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Sarah would rejoice if God would choose an animal and Isaac would return.</i>
He Who sees the hidden, my son,
will heed your prayer,
He’ll send you aid from the sanctified place.”<br>
“Stop, please, father and bind the sacrifice
lest I move in fear of the blade.
Tie me down lest I desecrate the offering
and spoil its sanctity.”<br>
Kofer Eshkol<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to Isaac. See <i>Shir HaShirim</i> Raba 1:14.</i> burst into tears
when he thought of his father
bereft of his son.
He grabbed the knife to perform
the entire sanctified service.<br>
Angels screamed up in Heaven,
“The mute dove’s slaughter,
who can watch?”
One to the other declared, “Don’t keep silent,
raise your hands in sanctity.”<br>
The One Above gazed at binder and bound,
the bound lamb and the burning flame.
The Tester of puremindedness
recalled the pitied
and His voice was heard
entering the Sanctum.<br>
Spoke the “advocate”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The angel in the Name of God.</i> as he took the knife,
“Spare your only one from going to death.
This is written before me,
clearly inscribed,
inscribed in sanctified etching.<br>
“I know the beautiful integrity of your way.
Rejoice and take a ram
instead of the buck.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to Isaac. See above.</i>
I’ve prepared a substitute
for the Eshkol Hakofer<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to Isaac. See <i>Shir HaShirim</i> Raba 1:14.</i>
and he and his replacement
will be sanctified.”<br>
The youngster was saved from the sharp blade;
from outstretched throat
his blood did not flow.
His right grasped the gripped ram,
to sanctify it holy to Adonoy.<br>
Merciful One!
You provided him a peaceful ending.
Till this day You recall
his covenant for his seed.
For the rest of the remnant,
what is left of his remainder,
let there be a haven in sanctity.<br>

for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>

and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>

Chapter 11

<small><i>This prayer was composed by Rabbi Gershom ben Yehudah (the Light of the Exile).</i></small><br>
Remember the covenant of Abraham
and the binding of Isaac,
and return the captives
of the tents of Jacob
and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.<br>
We lost the good land all too soon,
and the prophesied exile has lasted very long;
in Israel, they no longer live in open villages,
our plenty has been turned into famine.
Turn with compassion
to the remnant of Israel,
and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.<br>
Exile after exile,
has all of Judah been exiled,
grief and destruction is her lot each day,
and there is none to inquire or plead for her.
Return the captives
of the tents of Jacob

The city of holiness and its environs
had become disgraced and plundered;
all its treasures are buried and hidden,
and nothing remains except this Torah.
Turn with compassion
to the remnant of Israel,
and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.<br>
Mighty Redeemer, for Your sake redeem us,
see how helpless we are,
look, our pious men are gone,
and we have none to intercede for us.
Return the captives

The covenant with the Patriarchs
the Matriarchs
and the [twelve] tribes,
Your oft-repeated mercy and kindness—
remember [now] O God
to those who are stricken and tortured,
and for Your sake [they are ready]
to be killed all the day.
Turn with compassion
to the remnant of Israel,
and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.<br>
You Who avenge [innocent] blood,
judge our cause,
repay [punish] sevenfold

we have been sold for naught,
[therefore] redeem us without [ransom] money,
raise up Your ruined, Holy Temple,
before our [very] eyes,
and return the captives
of the tents of Jacob
and deliver us for the sake of Your Name.
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors,
as You promised,
“And I will remember for their sake,
the covenant with their ancestors,
whom I brought out
of the land of Egypt,
in the sight of the nations;
to be their God
I am Adonoy.”<br>

Chapter 12


Hear, Israel
Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is one!
In truth, the openings to repentance
are emphasized throughout the Torah.
I focus on it constantly.<br>
To specify [sin] is right for it,
with broken heart subdued
—yieldingly, unwearied—
to Him Who dons pride.
Hear Israel!
Adonoy is our God,
Adonoy is one!<br>
Dressed in pride and vengeance

He will heal your sadness
by giving what is sweeter than honey.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah.</i>

The guardian<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Almighty.</i> of communities gathered,

to illuminate darkness to light.
To the upright, praise is appropriate.<br>
Praise and power to our Redeemer,
the One Who shelters and protects us.
Show favor to us;
may Your kindliness, Adonoy, be upon us.<br>
Do unto us as You promised,
“And yet for all that,
when they are in the land of their enemies,
I will not reject them
and I will not abhor them, to destroy them,
to annul My covenant with them;
for I am Adonoy, their God.”
Be accessible to us when we seek You,
as it is written:
“And from there
you will seek Adonoy, your God,
and you will find Him;
if you search after Him
with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
Open our hearts
to love Your Name,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“And Adonoy, your God will open your heart,
and the heart of your descendants,
to love Adonoy, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
that you may live.”
Sprinkle clean water upon us,
and cleanse us, as it is written:
“And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you will be clean;
from all your defilements,
and from all your idols,
I will cleanse you.”
Sweep aside our transgressions
as a thick cloud and as a mist,
as You have promised:
“I have swept away like a thick cloud
your transgressions,
and like a mist, your sins;
return to Me, for I have redeemed You.”
Blot out our transgressions for Your sake,
as You promised:
“I, I [alone] am He
Who blots out your transgressions
for My own sake;
and your sins, I will not recall.”
Make our sins as white as snow or wool,
as it is written:
“Come now, let us reason together,
says Adonoy,
though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red as crimson,
they shall become [white] as wool.”
Have compassion on us and do not destroy us,
as it is written:
“For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy,
your God;
He will not abandon you or destroy you,
and He will not forget
the covenant of your fathers
which He swore to them.”
Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written:
“If your dispersed
are in the farthermost part of heaven,
from there Adonoy, your God will gather you,
and from there He will take you.”
Bring back our captivity
and have compassion on us,
as it is written:
“And Adonoy, your God will return
your captivity and have compassion on you;
and He will again gather you
from [among] all the peoples,
where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.”
Bring us to Your holy mountain,
and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer,
as it is written:
“And I will bring them to My holy mountain,
and make them joyful in My House of Prayer;
their burnt-offerings and sacrifices
will be accepted with favor on My Altar,
for My House,
will be called a House of Prayer
for all peoples.”<br>

Chapter 13

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped us
and comforted us.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.<br>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
We have trespassed
more than any other people,
we are more ashamed
than any other generation;
happiness has departed from us,
our hearts are miserable with our sins;
[the place of] our desire has been devastated,
[the place of] our glory has been humiliated,
the abode of our Holy Temple
has been destroyed because of our iniquities;
our Palace has become a desolation,
our beautiful land belongs to strangers,
our strength [wealth] to foreigners.
Still, we have not repented our errors,
so how can we be so insolent
and obstinate
as to say before You,
“Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
we are righteous and have not sinned.”
But indeed we and our fathers have sinned:<br>

Chapter 14


Hope of Israel,
its Savior at times of trouble;
its guardian, shelterer,
and rescuer on the day of fury—
have much mercy
on the storm-tossed, poor people,
isolated and looted,
pained and anguished.<br>
Trampled by enemies
and sullied in the dirt,
bereft of children and alone,
exiled and mourning,
by lions and bears
trampled and crushed,
like shepherdless sheep
wandering and scattered.<br>
Master! How long
will You disregard her anguish,
why forever leave her
in the hands of her provoker?
In Your mercy remove her
from darkness to light;
for Your Name’s sake do not shame her,
she who is luminous like the sun.<br>
You chose her from all the nations
with unique clarity.
Look, please, at her poverty,
and dust off her dirt.
Fight her battles and abhor her enemy;
avenge her vengeance
and that of Your Chosen House,<br>
which they smashed and ruined
and set afire,
desecrating and insulting
the honored and awesome Name.
Recall the insult of the loathsome one
who spoke insultingly against You.
Arise, Adonoy, in Your anger,
rise vigorously,
and do not forget
the constant noises of Your enemies.<br>
Destroy, cut down the cursed kingdom.
The heralder of peace
to Your people send soon
to console Zion
and to mend her breaches,
for Yours, Adonoy,
are greatness and power.<br>

Yom Kippur Eve



Chapter 1

Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;
may they continue to praise You, Selah.
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;
Fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will laud Your works
and declare Your mighty acts.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they will speak
and Your greatness I will recount.
They will make mention of Your bountifulness,
and joyfully exult in Your righteousness.
Adonoy is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.
Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,
to all who call upon Him in truth.
The will of those who fear Him He fulfills;
He hears their cry and delivers them.
Adonoy watches over all those who love Him,
and will destroy all the wicked.
Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare,
and all flesh will bless
His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God.
from now and forever.
Praise God.<br>
<small><i>The</i> Chazzan <i>recites the</i> Half-Kaddish:</small><br>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amen.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amen.<br>

Chapter 2

Righteousness is Yours, Adonoy
while shame is ours.
How can we complain?
What can we say?
What can we speak?
And how can we justify ourselves?
Let us search into our ways and examine them,
and return to You;
for Your right hand is extended
to receive those who repent.
Not with virtue nor with good deeds
do we come before You,
but like the poor and needy
we knock at Your door.
At Your door, do we knock,
Merciful and Gracious One.
Please do not turn us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.
From Your Presence our King
turn us not away empty-handed;
for You hear [our] prayers.<br>
You are Almighty, Slow to Anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance, You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindliness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made known
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah.
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“When Adonoy descended in the cloud.”
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He stood with him there.”
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
“And He proclaimed the Name, Adonoy”
And there it is said:<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Enter not into judgement with us
for no living soul will be justified before You.
For even His holy ones are not trusted,
and the heavens are not innocent in His eyes.
Certainly, man, who is deceitful
and the son of man who is but a worm.
Behold, we are before you with our guilt,
for how can we stand before You
because of this.
Who can say, “My heart is pure,
I have cleansed myself from my sins?”<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts!
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver us;
the King will answer us on the day we call.<br>
“Please pardon the sins of this nation
in accordance with the greatness
of Your lovingkindness;
and as You forgave this people
from when it left Egypt until now.”
And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 3


Master, when You call on man
each morning [for judgment]
do not press justice to its limits.
If You combine body and soul [in judgment]
they would be thrust down
and be unable to rise.<br>
Can man be innocent in judgement?
Is he possessed of deeds to justify him?
His birth stream is from a fetid drop,
his enemy is hidden within him
from the time of his birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Man.</i><br>
Lurking within him as a snare to his feet,
he entices him daily,
to make him fall into the abyss [of sin];
there is no power or might in the body
to stand firm and resist him.<br>
From the day he attains perception,
he puts his life in his hand
to gain his bread,
all his days are filled
with vexation and grief;
until he returns to his dust
he is not at rest.<br>
Regard O Master his sorrowful spirit,
look at his broken heart,
You are near to these who are afar,
You desire the repentance of the wicked.<br>
Mighty One! let Yourself be found
by those who seek You,
say: “Here I am,”
to those who petition You
let the tiding: “I have pardoned”—
be told to those who call in Your Name,
make righteous in judgment
the people who proclaim Your Unity.<br>
Muzzle the foul one [Satan]
that he may not condemn us,
rebuke the accuser that he not accuse us,
stand up for us an upright advocate;
“I have found atonement,”
let the penitent hear.<br>
We have cast our burden upon You
we beseech You to sustain us,
be pleased [accept] our prayer
our request and desire fulfull
with compassion.<br>
In You we place our trust,
let Your mercy come swiftly toward us;
Strong and Mighty One,
we have not forgotten Your Name,
we beseech You, never forget us.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses],
and proclaimed:<br>

Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,

and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,

and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God,
be not distant from us.
Be not distant from us,
for trouble is near,
for we have no helper [except You].
Our help is from You, Adonoy,
Creator of heaven and earth.
He will not let our feet slip,
He will not sleep, our Guardian.
Adonoy, deliver us!
The King will answer us
on the day we call.<br>
As a father has compassion on his children
so do You have compassion on us, Adonoy.
Deliverance is Adonoy’s;
upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah!

And there it is said:<br>
“And Adonoy said,
I have pardoned [them] as you have asked.”<br>
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear,
open Your eyes and behold our desolate places,
and the city which is called by Your Name;
for it is not on account of our righteousness
that we let fall our supplication before You,
but because of Your great mercy.
My Master, hear! My Master, pardon!
My Master, listen and take action,
do not delay!
For Your sake, my God,
because Your Name is proclaimed
over Your city and over Your people.<br>

Chapter 4


Our God and God of our fathers!<br>
Master, if You judge scrupulously,
examining actions meticulously,
no man will be found righteous before You.
You find fault with the hosts of Heaven,
faulting even Your angels—
certainly one<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Man.</i> who drinks wrong like water.<br>
Neither merit nor justice are in us,
we are totally sinful.
Good One,
enter not into judgement with us.
Let Your innards churn for us,
in Your abundant mercy turn to us,
Not to do as our evil deeds deserve.<br>
Our willful acts are too many to count.
There are no sweet savored offerings
to provide pardon for our iniquities.
On our righteousness
we do not rely;
we are sullied with iniquity and sin.
To find charity we come in prayer.<br>
Do not measure our ways strictly;
maggots and worms are our end,
vanity and emptiness our [lives] years.
Repent the evil, change Your mind.
That is Your way, merciful one;
with Your great mercies, have mercy on us.<br>
Your ways You instructed
the humble one<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Moses is referred to as the humble one.</i> to teach,
You informed him of the thirteen in sequence,
assured him they are never ineffective.
Our supplication
we have arranged accordingly before You.
Hear the cries of Your supplicants
and do not send us away empty-handed
from Your Presence.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,
as You made them known
to the humble Moses of old,
as it is written,
“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses];
and proclaimed:<br>
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness, and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.”
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.”<br>
Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>

Chapter 5


Accept Your people’s fast
who sprinkle their blood to You;
consider their fat as an offering,
do not disdain their sacrifice.
Set upon them the sign of life—
regard their prayer.
This sign will take place tomorrow.<br>
Gird Yourself with righteousness,
eternal and lofty Reposer.
Support the stumblers,
extend Your hand to lift them
whose tear is their drink,
whose groan is their bread.
Avenge the blood of Your servants
from their enemies, until they are no more.
Look at their blood that is shed
to know why and wherefore this.
This sign will take place tomorrow.<br>
Gracious One! grant Your people
who trust in Your Name;
appoint and advocate for me
who will hide my sin—
hide my debt in his left
and raise my merit in his right,
and bring up Isaac’s ashes]
so that He will say, “This is it!”
This sign will take place tomorrow.<br>
Come and hear my prayer;
open the gate before my cries
to cleanse me of sin
like a one-year-old.
And silence the tongue of my prosecutor;
let him not open his mouth.
Adonoy will shout at Satan,
“Get off this, immediately!”
This sign will take place tomorrow.<br>
How shall I greet, approach,
the One Who takes no bribe?
I have no deed in hand,
and my heart is therefore afraid.
But now that I mention
the kingship of Your unique Name,
on this I rely,
when we say “Adonoy is One”
in unison as one,
one on that side and one on this.
This sign will take place tomorrow.<br>
See, I have no one atoning for me,
no one to serve for me;
the priest, garbed in white, is no longer,
nor is the High Priest, adorned in glory,
nor is there an obligatory, sin-offering,
nor free-will and vow-offering;
so You will atone for me,
examiner of kidney and chamber.
Close the breaches of Your sheep
and make space for the flock.
Build them a fence
on that side and one on this.
This sign will take place tomorrow.<br>
Under Your shield have come the children
who were exiled;
Your children have gathered in Your house,
awed and upset.
Recall the kindliness of their forefathers
when they come to be judged;
in truth and peace they meet,
that one facing this one.
This sign will take place tomorrow.<br>
Almighty! King!
Who sits on the throne of mercy,
governs with kindness
forgives the iniquities of His people.
He removes their sins one by one,
increasing forgiveness to sinners,
and pardon to transgressors.
Acting righteously
with all who are of flesh and spirit;
not according to their wickedness
does He repay them.
Almighty!
You instructed us to recite
the thirteen Divine attributes;
remember unto us this day
the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes,

to the humble Moses of old,

“And Adonoy descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.<br>
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small><br>

Adonoy, Adonoy,

Slow to Anger,

Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity, and transgression,
and sin;
and Acquitter of those who repent.
“And pardon our iniquity and our sin,

Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us our King, for we have transgressed.
“For You, my Master,

and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.”<br>
Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
The sins of our youth and our transgressions,
remember not;
with Your kindliness remember us
for the sake of Your goodness, Adonoy.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindlinesses
for they are from the beginning of the world.
Remember us Adonoy
with favor for Your people
recall us with Your deliverance.
Remember Your congregation
which You have acquired of old,
You have redeemed the tribe
of Your inheritance,
this mountain of Zion where You have dwelled.
Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Jerusalem,
the love of Zion, forget not until eternity.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
“Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.”
You will arise
and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, Israel,
Your servants,
to whom You swore by Your very Self,
and You said to them:
“I will multiply your seed
as the stars of the heavens;
and all this land that I have promised,
I will give to your descendants,
and they will inherit it forever.”
Remember Your servants,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
do not regard the stubborness of this people,
or their wickedness, or their sin.<br>
Do not, we beseech You
place upon us this sin,
wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned.<br>
We have sinned, our Rock;
pardon us our Creator.<br>
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs,
as You promised,
“And I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham
will I remember,”
and the land I will remember.<br>

Chapter 6

<small><i>The following verses until “When our strength fails, do not forsake us” are chanted by the Chazzan and repeated by the Congregation.</i></small><br>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i></small><br>
Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;
spare us and have compassion on us,
and accept
our prayers mercifully and willingly.
Lead us back to You, Adonoy
and we shall find the way back;
renew our days as of old.
Cast us not away from Your Presence,
and Your holy spirit take not from us.
Do not cast us off in time of old age,
when our strength fails, do not forsake us.<br>
Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God
be not far removed from us.
Give us a sign of Your goodness
that our enemies may see it and be ashamed;
for You, Adonoy, have helped me
and comforted me.
Give ear to our words, Adonoy!
Consider our meditations.
May there be gracious acceptance
for the words of our mouth,
and the meditation of our heart,
before You,
Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
For to You Adonoy, we hope
You will answer us Adonoy, our God.
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
“We are righteous and have not sinned.”
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.<br>
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered;
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called <span>רֽשָׁעִים</span>, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other’s possessions
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God’s Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called <span>רָשָׁע</span>, [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.<br>
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.<br>
