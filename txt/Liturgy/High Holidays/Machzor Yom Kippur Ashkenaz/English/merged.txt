Machzor Yom Kippur Ashkenaz

Kaporos

<small>The traditional ritual of “kaporos,” atonement, is mentioned in the writings of the Ari Z'al and the Sh'lah haKodosh. It is the custom on the morning of the eve of the Day of Atonement (or even a day before) to ritually slaughter a chicken as a symbol of atonement. It is customary for a male to use a rooster and a female to use a hen. According to some, the slaughtered chickens are given to the poor, but others hold that it is more appropriate to give them the value of the chickens rather than the actual chickens. If there is no possibility of observing the ritual of kaporos with live chickens, you may use money instead and present the money to the poor.</small>
<small>The following verses which introduce the ritual itself are taken from Psalms 107:10, 14, 17-21, and the last two verses are from Job 33:23,24. These verses portray the misery and affliction which man creates for himself through his disobedience to God. Though his path of sin leads to self-destruction, God stands ready to save him and heal him if he but cries out in true repentance.</small>
<b>Children</b> of men! Those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death bound in affliction and [chains of] iron. He brought them out from darkness, from the shadow of death, and their shackles, He broke. They are fools— because of their transgression and their iniquities— they cause their own affliction. All manner of food is abhorred by their soul, and they draw near until the gates of death. [Then] they cried out to Adonoy in their distress; from their anguish, He delivered them. He sends His word and heals them, and delivers them from destruction. Let them thank Adonoy for His kindness, and for His wonders to the children of man. If there be for him an angel, one interceding angel among a thousand, to vouch for man's uprightness; then [God] is gracious unto him, and says: “Redeem him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom [for him.]” 
<small><i>A man should make the following declaration: (Each time you say, “This is my” revolve the rooster around your head)</i><br></small>
This is my exchange, this is my substitute, this is my atonement. This rooster shall go to its death, and I shall proceed to a good, long life and peace. 
<small><i>The entire sequence, beginning with “children of men” is repeated three times.</i><br></small>
<small><i>A woman makes the following declaration, following the procedure described above:</i><br></small>
This is my exchange, this is my substitute, this is my atonement. This hen shall go to its death, and I shall proceed to a good, long life and peace. 
<small><i>Repeat the entire sequence beginning “Children of men,” three times.</i><br></small>
<small><i>One who performs this ritual on behalf of a male makes the following declaration: (each time you say, “this is your,” revolve the rooster around the head)</i><br></small>
This is your exchange, this is your substitute, this is your atonement. This rooster shall go to it death, and you shall proceed to a good, long life and peace. 
<small><i>Repeat the entire sequence beginning “Children of men,” three times.</i><br></small>
<small><i>One who performs the ritual on behalf of a female makes the following declaration, following the procedure described above.</i><br></small>
This is your exchange, this is your substitute this is your atonement. This hen shall go to its death and you shall proceed to a good, long life and peace. 
<small><i>A pregnant woman makes the following declaration: (Each time you say “These are our,” revolve the chickens around your head)</i><br></small>
These are our exchanges, these are our substitutes, these are our atonements. These chickens shall go to their death and we shall proceed to a good, long life and peace.

<b>Kedushah</b>
<i>The Congregation says and the Chazzan repeats:</i><br> We will sanctify Your Name in the world, just as they sanctify it in the highest heavens; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And they called one to another, and said: 
<i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</i><br> ‘Holy, holy, holy, is Adonoy of Hosts, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.'” 
<i>The Chazzan says:</i><br> Those facing them say “Boruch...” 
<i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</i><br> “Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from its place.” 
<i>The Chazzan says:</i><br> And in Your holy words it is written:

<b>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</b> 
You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 
<small><i>If you mistakenly said, “the Almight-y” instead of “the King,” or if you are in doubt — if you realized your error after a lapse of time sufficient to utter a three word greeting (Shalom Aleichem Rebbe), or if you had already started the next blessing, you must repeat the Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If you became aware of your error before that, you should immediately say “the King the Holy One” and continue your prayers.</i><br></small>

Restore our judges as before and our counselors as at first. Remove from us sorrow and sighing, and reign over us You, Adonoy, alone with kindness and compassion; and make us righteous with justice. Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King of justice. 
<small><i>If you mistakenly said, “King, Lover of righteousness and justice” instead of “the King of justice,” or if you are in doubt — if you realized your error after a lapse of time sufficient to utter a three word greeting (Shalom Aleichem Rebbe), you should immediately say “the King of Justice.” If you remembered after that interval, you may continue the Shemoneh Esrei, since the word “King” was mentioned in the regular blessing.</i><br></small>

(You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<small><i>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon,” the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</i><br></small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and Holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due. 
And for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be Your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. 
Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</i><br></small>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity; the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise. 
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b> 
Abundant peace upon Yisrael, Your people bestow forever, for You are King Master of all peace. May it be good in Your eyes to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace.

<small><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah.</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>other conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace. 
May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 
You know the mysteries of the universe, and the hidden secrets of every individual. You search all our innermost thoughts, and probe our mind and heart. There is nothing hidden from You, and there is nothing concealed from Your sight. 
And so may it be Your will Adonoy our God and God of our fathers, that You pardon us for all our careless sins, and that You forgive us for all our deliberate sins, and that You grant us atonement for all our rebellious sins:

My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein. 
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Yehudah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years. 
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish:</i><br></small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Yisrael, and say, Amein. 

Aleinu

<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”

Blessing the Children

<small>It has become a widely accepted custom for the father to bless his children on the eve of the Day of Atonement. The placing of both hands upon the child's head when conferring the blessing, symbolizes that the blessing is bestowed with fullness of spirit and heart.</small>
<small><i>According to the Chayyei Odom, the proper text of the blessing is as follows:</i><br></small>
<small><i>For a son:</i><br></small>
<b>May</b> God make you like Ephraim and Menashe. May Adonoy bless you and guard you. May Adonoy shine His countenance upon you, and be gracious unto you. May Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace. 
<small><i>Continue “And may it be the will” below</i><br></small>
<small><i>For a daughter:</i><br></small>
<b>May</b> God make you like Sarah, Rivkah, Rachel and Leah. May Adonoy bless you and guard you. May Adonoy shine His countenance upon you, and be gracious unto you. May Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace. 
<small><i>(Continue:)</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> may it be the will of our Father in heaven, to place in your heart love and fear of Him. May the fear of Adonoy be upon your face all the days of your life, so that you will not sin. May your desire be for Torah and Mitzvos, may your eyes look straightforward, may your mouth speak [with] wisdom, may your heart meditate [with] reverence, may your hands be engaged in mitzvos, and may your feet hasten to do the will of our Father in heaven. May the Almighty grant you children who will [grow up to] be righteous, occupying themselves with Torah and mitzvos all their days. May your source be blessed, and may He grant that your livelihood come with honesty, ease and abundance, from His generous hand, and not from the gifts of men; a livelihood that will free you to serve God. May you be inscribed and sealed for good, long life together with all the righteous of Yisrael. Amein. 

Candle Lighting

Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the light of the Day of Atonement. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who has kept us alive and sustained us, and brought us to this season. 
<small><i>When the Day of Atonement falls on Shabbos say:</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the light of the Sabbath and [the light] of the Day of Atonement. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who has kept us alive and sustained us, and brought us to this season. 

Master of the Universe! Father of compassion and forgiveness, Your right hand is extended to receive the penitent. You created man in order to reward him at the end of his time. You created him with two impulses, the good and the evil; and gave him a choice between good and evil in order to reward him for choosing good. Your wisdom has so decreed, as it is written in Your Torah, “See, I have set before you this day, life and good, and death and evil; and you should choose life.” But now, my God, I have not listened to Your voice but have followed the advice of the Evil Impulse and the inclinations of my heart. I have despised that which is good and chosen that which is evil. Not only have I failed to sanctify the vital parts of my body but I have caused them to be impure. You created me with a mind and a heart, giving me the faculty of thought in order that I might think of what is good and pure, that I might understand Your holy Torah, that I might pray to You, and pronounce all the blessings with pure thoughts. But I have caused them to be impure with foreign thoughts and ideas. Not only that, but as a result of these evil thoughts, I have been brought to a state of bodily impurity, sometimes willfully and other times accidentally. Woe is to me! Instead of creating holy angels to defend me by possessing good and pure thoughts, I have created destroying angels to bring destruction upon myself. You created me with eyes, possessed with the faculty of vision, that I might see with them what is written in the Torah, and sanctify them by looking at things that are holy. You have warned in Your Torah: “Do not turn aside after your hearts and after your eyes.” Woe is to me, for I have followed my eyes and defiled them by gazing at all kinds of impurities. You created me with ears, that I might listen to holy words and to the words of Your Torah. Woe is to me for I have made them impure by listening to profanity, slander and other forbidden talk. Woe to the ears that have heard such things. You created me with a mouth, tongue, teeth, palate and throat, giving them the ability to utter the holy letters of the Aleph-Bais, with which You created heaven and earth and their fullness, with which You wrote Your holy Torah. It was with the faculty of speech that You distinguished between man and beast, but, alas, I have not proved to be as worthy as the beast, for I have defiled my mouth with profanity, slander, falsehood, scorn, libel, insults, curses, taking pleasure at someone else's degradation, conversing about business matters on the Sabbath and Festivals, and with oaths and vows. You created me with hands and a sense of touch in order to perform Your mitzvos with them, and I have made them impure by touching forbidden things, by striking with the fist, by raising them to hit someone, and by carrying or moving forbidden things on the Sabbath and Festivals. You created me with feet that I might walk to perform Your commandments, and I have made them impure by hastening to perform evil deeds. 
I have examined every part of my body and found them to be defective; from the sole of my foot to the top of my head, there is no soundness. I am ashamed and disgraced, unable to hold up my face to Your Presence, my God; for with the very same parts of my body and with the senses with which you endowed me, and the gift of life you granted me, have I done that which is evil in Your eyes, and transgressed Your will. Woe unto me, woe unto my soul.
And now Adonoy, my God, it is well known to You that I did not commit all these sins and iniquities with intention to anger You or to rebel against You. I did however follow the advice of my evil inclination, who each day spreads out his net to entrap me. And I, poor and wretched, a mere worm and not a man, have been too weak to stand up against it. The toil of earning a livelihood to support my family, and the vicissitudes of life, afflict me greatly. And since it is obvious to You that there is no righteous man on earth who does only good, who never sins; with Your great compassion, You have given us one day in the year, a great and holy day, this Day of Atonement, to return unto You in repentance, that You might atone our sins and cleanse us of all our impurities. It is thus written, “For on this day, He will make atonement for you to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy you will be cleansed.”
And now, see how Your people, Yisrael, whom You have taken unto Yourself for a people. Who, indeed can be likened unto Your people, Yisrael, so pure and holy, who wait and hope for Your forgiveness? We have come before You with broken hearts, like the poor and needy and impoverished, to beg of You forgiveness, pardon and atonement for having sinned before You. We know Adonoy, of our iniquity and the iniquity of our fathers; we are ashamed and disgraced even to raise our faces unto You, just as a thief is ashamed upon being caught in the act of stealing. How dare we open our mouth and raise our head, when by the multitude of our iniquities, we have removed from ourselves, the holy image, with which You have garbed us, and from which all the adversaries and accusers stand in fear, as it is written, “And all the peoples of the earth will see that the Name of Adonoy is called upon you and they will fear you.” We have exchanged this holy image for one that is impure, and garbed ourselves in unclean garments, and so how dare we enter the gate of the King (God) in sackcloth covered with filth. We are thunderstruck. How have we committed such abominations? We have abandoned the world of holiness and fled into a dark and desolate wilderness (of sin), a place of impurity and evil spirits. And now, Adonoy, our God, Who desires the repentance of the wicked as it is written, “Repent repent from your evil ways, and why should you perish, House of Yisrael.” And it is said, “For I do not desire the death of the wicked, says Adonoy, but rather should you repent and live,” we have resolved to repent and come shame-facedly before You. Our Father, our King, have compassion on us as a father has compassion on his son who rebelled and left his house. When the son returns to his father shamefacedly, weeping and crying, falling before him, it is natural for the father to have compassion on his son. If we are considered like slaves (and not like children) who are subject to corpo-real punishment for rebellion, behold, we have already been severely punished by being subjected to the oppression of exile, by the infliction of bodily torture, by poverty, the difficult travail of raising children and many other pains. Have compassion on us and command Your holy angels to remove the unclean garments from us and cleanse us of all our sins and clothe us, once again with robes of holiness, as it is written, “Remove the filthy garments from yourselves.” And clothe us with robes of purity, as King Dovid, may he rest in peace, prayed, “Restore to me the joy of Your deliverance, and with a generous spirit, support me.” Create a pure heart for us, O God, and renewed spirit set within us. If we have transgressed and rebelled as is likely for a being of flesh and blood; You O God, act in accordance with Your Divine attribute, which is to forgive and pardon. Do not let our sins prevent us from returning to You in repentance, for Your way is to accept the penitent. Strengthen our hearts in Your Torah and in fear of You, so that the fear of You will be steadfast in our hearts. Purify our thoughts and ideas that we may serve You, and observe from my broken heart how I regret the evil deeds I have committed to this day. I weep, lament and confess all my sins as I say, “I have erred, sinned deliberately and transgressed before You.” Please accept my repentance together with the repentance of all Your people, Yisrael, who repent before You with all their hearts, for I too am one of the children of Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov. Let my numerous sins not prevent me from returning to You with a whole heart. Grant that I may truly return unto You effecting complete repentance for my sins, and that I may abandon my evil deeds forever. Have compassion on me and save me forever from all sin and iniquity; for without Your great compassion and loving kindness it would be impossible to resist the Evil Inclination that burns like fire within me. Therefore, have compassion on me, give me strength to resist him, as our Sages said, “He who strives to cleanse himself receives Divine aid.” 
Behold, now, I accept upon myself the holiness of the Day of Atonement. I am prepared to fast and undergo the five deprivations which You commanded us through Your servant Moshe, in Your holy Torah: to deprive ourselves of eating and drinking, washing, anointing with oil, wearing shoes [of leather], and marital relations; and to abstain from all manner of work on this holy day. Because we deprive ourselves of food and drink, we pray that You will atone the sins we committed by partaking of forbidden food and drink; because we deprive ourselves of washing and anointing, may You atone the sins we committed by enjoying forbidden pleasures; because we deprive ourselves of wearing [leather] shoes, may You atone the sins we committed with our feet, hastening to do evil deeds, and also for having transgressed the twenty four precepts for which the Beth Din decrees a ban mandating that one must apppear barefoot; because we de prive ourselves of marital relations, may You atone the sins we committed in forbidden sexual matters. May the five prayers [of the Day of Atonement], and our supplications, make amends for sins we committed with the five components of speech: the palate, the throat, the tongue, the teeth and the lips, which I rendered unclean by uttering forbidden words (profanity etc.), vows and oaths. Through our embracing and kissing the Torah Scrolls, and in the merit of our prayers that we offer on this holy day, may the prayers we offered, without proper concentration and devotion, during the whole year, ascend and reach You, and be accepted together with the prayers of this holy day. May all our prayers go up to heaven and form a crown to adorn Your head. And may the tears that our eyes will shed, amend the sins we have committed with our eyes, looking at things which are unclean and impure. May the feverish heat of our bodies through fasting and praying, amend the blemishes we have caused the two hundred forty-eight organs and the three hundred sixty-five veins, of our body, with the fiery passion of the Evil Inclination. And because we allow our flesh and blood to be diminished by abstaining from food and drink, may we achieve atonement for all our errors, deliberate sins, and transgressions before You. May our fast be considered before You as though we have sacrificed ourselves upon the altar, and may it be accepted before You for a pleasing savor, as a sacrifice and a burnt-offering. 
We know according to the dictates of repentance, that we should fast for each and every sin we have committed, and that our suffering must be commensurate with the pleasure we have derived from such sins. But You know, O God, that we are too weak to fast even for one sin, certainly not for each and every sin; for they are too numerous and our strength is too feeble. Therefore, may it be Your will Adonoy, our God, that the fast on this holy day, this Day of Atonement, be an atonement for all our iniquities.
May it be Your will, Almighty, King, Who sits on the throne of mercy, Who desires the repentance of the wicked, that our love for You, and fear of You be instilled in our hearts and in the heart of all Your people Yisrael, that we may fear You all the days. Have compassion upon the transgressors among Your people, Yisrael, and instill in their hearts the fear of the glory of Your majesty; and humble their hearts of stone, that they may return to You [in repentance] with all their heart, as You promised by the hand of Your prophets, “That even the outcast will not be banished from Him.” Even if their guilt is so great that the ways of repentance are closed to them, with Your great compassion, open new channels for them beneath Your Divine throne, and accept their repentance. Have compassion on us and give us strength to serve You all the days, and remove from us all the obstacles and causes that prevent us from serving You. You are our Creator and You know all the faults of men and their nature which prevent them from serving You; and it is within Your power to remove all these obstacles. Do not let the troubled times and confusion prevent us from returning unto You with all our heart; and may all our days be filled with repentance and good deeds, until the very last moment; when it will be Your will to gather our souls unto You. At that time all our thoughts will be of You and then our souls will depart in holiness and purity; and may we merit that our souls be elevated on high. Give us strength to fast on this holy day, and may we complete the fast observing all the five deprivations; and may our misdeeds not cause us to fail in any one of them, for we are all the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, whom You loved. May we have the merit to raise our children to study Torah and perform good deeds, and may they not be ensnared, God forbid, because of our iniquity. Seal us in the Book of good life, a life in which we will fear Your Name, a life in which we will serve You with all our heart; a life in which we will not be entrapped, God forbid, in sin, iniquity or guilt; a life of sustenance with ease, dignity and honesty; and may our pursuit of a livelihood not be disturbed with the turbulence of the times. Grant us our sustenance in serenity and tranquility, and independence, so that we will be free to worship You. Purify our thoughts so that we may cling unto You always. Because I know that there is no righteous man in the world who has not wronged his fellow man, whether it be in regard to monetary matters, or in personal matters, whether through deeds or through words, my heart grieves, for the Day of Atonement does not atone for sins committed against a fellow man, unless the wronged person has been fully appeased. Knowing this, my heart is shattered and my bones tremble, for even the day of death does not atone for such sins. I therefore beseech You to have compassion on me and grant that I find favor and mercy in Your eyes, and in the eyes of all men. I hereby grant absolute forgiveness to anyone who has sinned against me, whether personally or with his money, whether with malicious gossip, or with slander. So too, I release anyone who has injured me either in person or in property, or anyone who has committed any manner of sin which is considered between man and man, except such money due me which is collectible according to the Halacha of Beth Din, and except the person who wronged me deliberately, thinking, “I will wrong him but he will eventually forgive me.” Except for these, I unconditionally forgive everyone; and may no one be punished because of me. And just as I forgive everyone, grant that I find favor in the eyes of all men, so that they will grant absolute forgiveness to me. 
May our prayer ascend, reach, be heard and accepted. Accept the prayer of Your people; strengthen us, purify us, Awesome One. May the holiness of the Day of Atonement arouse Your attributes of greatness, might, glory, victory and majesty, for all that is in heaven and on earth is Yours; for Yours Adonoy is the Kingdom. Light is sown for the righteous, and for the upright in heart—joy; and may the holiness of the Day of Atonement be spread over them to cause our sins to be atoned, as it is written, “For on this day He will make atonement for you to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy you will be cleansed.” “May the pleasantness of my Master, our God, be upon us, and the work of our hands established for us, and the work of our hands—establish it.” Remove the rule of evil from our heart, and reign over the entire world with Your glory, and be uplifted over all the earth with Your honor. Great joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, and flourishing pride to Dovid, Your servant. May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be accepted before You, Adonoy, my Rock and My Redeemer.

Adonoy had begun His reign He has clothed Himself with majesty; Adonoy has clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength. He has firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved. Your throne stands firm from of old, You are from eternity. The rivers have raised—Adonoy— the rivers have raised their voice, the rivers raise their raging waves. More than the sound of many waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea Mighty on high, are You, Adonoy. Your testimonies are extremely faithful, holiness is becoming to Your House, Adonoy—for the length of days.

<b>Hear, Yisrael:</b> Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One. 
<small><i>The following three lines are to be said aloud</i><br></small>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever. 
And you shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your possessions. And these words which I command you today, shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them sharply to your children. And you shall discuss them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for totafos between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways. 
<b>And it will be—</b> if you vigilantly obey My commandments which I command you this day, to love Adonoy your God, and serve Him with your entire hearts and with your entire souls— that I will give rain for your land in its proper time, the early (autumn) rain and the late (spring) rain; and you will harvest your grain and your wine and your oil. And I will put grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. Beware lest your hearts be swayed and you turn astray, and you worship alien gods and bow to them. And Adonoy's fury will blaze among you, and He will close off the heavens and there will be no rain and the earth will not yield its produce; and you will perish swiftly from the good land which Adonoy gives you. Place these words of Mine upon your hearts and upon your souls,— and bind them for a sign upon your hands, and they shall be for totafos between your eyes. And you shall teach them to your sons, to speak them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways. In order that your days be prolonged, and the days of your children, upon the land which Adonoy swore to your fathers to give them [for as long] as the heavens are above the earth. 
<b>And</b> Adonoy spoke to Moshe saying: Speak to the children of Yisrael, and tell them to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations; and they will place with the fringes of each corner a thread of blue. And it will be to you for fringes, and you will look upon it and you will remember all the commandments of Adonoy, and you will perform them; and you will not turn aside after your hearts and after your eyes which cause you to go astray. In order that you will remember and perform all My commandments; and you will be holy unto your God.

<b>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</b> You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. 
<b>And so,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The word וּבְכֵן, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i></b> grant<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The word תֵּן implies מַתָּנָה, a gift. We ask Hashem to grant us the feeling of reverence for Him, as a gift, knowing how difficult it is to attain such a high level of reverence completely on our own (Siach Yitzchok).</i> that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The word מַעֲשֶׂיךָ, lit., Your works, indicates that which has attained or is near perfection.

This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashanah—Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).</i> and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth.

This would have been our fate in accordance with the law of cause and effect which functions in Hashem’s world according to His will. It is only Hashem Himself, He Who originally ordained that law, Who in the omnipotence of His will, can also suspend that law. Only He can cause the wrong which was done to become as if it had never occurred. Only Hashem can uproot in its entirety the sin and consequential effect of sin. He has assured this wondrous power of His benevolent grace to every Jew who fulfills the true purpose of Yom Kippur by doing teshuva, true repentance. Thus we cry out to Him “Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes” for in the words of the prophet, Hashem alone blots out our transgressions.</i> from before Your eyes, as it is said: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake;<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Were Hashem to destroy us because of our transgressions, His Name would be desecrated among the nations of the world.

According to Targum Yonassan ben Uziel, however, the words מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם are joined to the previous words—לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם—changing the entire concept of the sentence. According to the Targum the sentence reads: כִּי בַיּוֹם הַזֶה יְכַפֵּר עֲלֵיכֶם לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם. “For on this day He will make atonement for you to cleanse you from all your sins”; and thus the final three words of the sentence לִפְנֵי ה' תִּטְהָרוּ represent a command to cleanse ourselves before Him, as the Targum says: וְאַתּוּן קָדָם ה' תּוֹדוּן סוּרְחָנוּתְכוֹן וְתִדְכּוּן “And you—confess your wrongdoings before Hashem, and then you will be cleansed.” Klei Yakar, obviously influenced by Targum explicitly states that this sentence is not a blanket promise of atonement, for Yom Kippur atones only for those who cleanse themselves with honest repentance.</i>

<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
<b>Be pleased,</b> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Yisrael and their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Yisrael; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Yisrael. And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon. 
<small><i>At the words, We are thankful, bend forward; at Adonoy return to an upright position.</i><br></small>
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<b>We</b> are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</i><br></small>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise. 
<small><i>Some have the custom of saying שים שלום “Grant peace” here, (see page 000) while others say שלום רב “Abundant peace” below.</i><br></small>
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Abundant peace upon Yisrael, Your people, bestow forever, for You King are Master of all peace. And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. 
<b>In the book</b> of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah.</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>(others conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace.) 
May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 
You know the mysteries of the universe, and the hidden secrets of every individual. You search all our innermost thoughts,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of חַדְרֵי בָטֶן is “chambers of the stomach,” but according to Ibn Ezra to Mishlei 20:27, from which the expression is taken, חַדְרֵי בָטֶן refers to the heart which is the innermost chamber of human thought.</i> and probe our mind<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of כְּלָיוֹת is “kidneys,” which are said to give counsel to the heart.— Avudraham</i> and heart.

May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, that I shall sin no more, and the sins I have committed before You, cleanse them in Your abundant mercies; but not through suffering and severe illness. 
My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. 
May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein. 
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Yehudah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years. 

Vayechulu

<small>When Yom Kippur falls on Shabbos, the entire congregation repeats וַיְכֻלּוּ, in testimony of our belief that God created Heaven and earth. According to the Halacha, when one is a witness, he must stand and declare his testimony aloud.</small>
<b>The heavens</b> and the earth were completed and [so were] all their hosts. And God completed by the seventh day His work which He had done, and He abstained on the seventh day, from all His work which He had done. And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it for on it He abstained from all His work which God had created to do. 
<small>The following prayer, בְּרָכָה מֵעֵין שֶׁבַע the abridged form of the seven blessings of the Maariv Amidah, is said only by the Chazzan.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, God of Avraham, God of Yitzchak, and God of Yaakov; the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, the most high Almighty, Possessor of heaven and earth. 
<small><i>The congregation may recite the following paragraph, which should then be repeated aloud and in its entirety by the Chazzan.</i><br></small>
Shield of [our] fathers with His word, Resurrector of the dead with His utterance; the King, the Holy One Who has no peer. He gives rest to His people on the day of His holy Shabbos for with them He was pleased to grant them rest. Before Him we will serve with fear and trepidation, and give thanks to His Name every day continuously, from the essence of the blessings. Almighty of thanksgiving, Master of peace, Sanctifier of the Shabbos, Who blesses the seventh day and grants rest in sanctity to a people sated with delight— in commemoration of the work of creation. 
Our God, and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest, sanctify us with Your commandments and give us our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, and purify our hearts to serve You in truth. And give us as our inheritance, Adonoy our God, in love and in pleasure Your holy Shabbos; and may Yisrael rest thereon— the sanctifiers of Your Name. Blessed are You Adonoy, Sanctifier of Shabbos.

Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the nights. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.

Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God.

For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth.

You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary.

We are Your dear ones and You are our Beloved. We are Your treasure; and You are our God. We are Your people; and You are our King. We are Your distinguished ones; and You are our Distinction. 
We are brazen-faced; and You are merciful and gracious. We are stiff-necked; and You are slow to anger. We are full of iniquity; and You are full of compassion. Our days are like a passing shadow; and You are the same and Your years will not end. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.” 
Our God, and God of our fathers! Forgive and pardon our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos say:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement, and permit Yourself to be petitioned by our prayer. Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes, and compel our Evil Inclination to be subservient to You, and subdue our stubborness, that we may return to You in truth; and renew our conscience that we may preserve Your precepts. Open our hearts that we may love and fear Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, Your God will open Your heart, and the heart of your descendants to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.” 
Our intentional and our unintentional sins— You recognize— [those committed] willfully or by compulsion, [those committed] openly or secretly— before Your Presence, they are [all] revealed and known. What are we? What is our life? What are our acts of kindness? What is our righteousness? What is our deliverance? What is our strength? What is our might? What can we say before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nothing before You? Famous men as though they had never been? The wise as if they were without knowledge? And men of understanding as if they were devoid of intelligence? For most of their actions are a waste and the days of their life are trivial in Your presence. The superiority of man over beast is nil for all is futile. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 

<b>Your Name</b> was always the “forbearer of transgression,” give ear to our plea as we stand before You in prayer. Forbear the transgression of a people who repent [their] transgression; blot out our transgression from before Your eyes. 
You know the mysteries of the universe, and the hidden secrets of every individual.

Do not forsake us, our Father, do not cast us off, our Creator, do not abandon us, our Maker, do not consume us on account of our sins.

... Dios mío, oye mi oración. Mira la desolación de la ciudad que ostenta Tu nombre. No invocamos nuestra rectitud, sólo a Tu clemencia apelamos. Adonai, oye y perdónanos. Acepta nuestras plegarias, acelera el plazo de nuestra liberación. Hazlo nor Tu causa y por el pueblo, y la ciudad que invoca Tu nombre.

<small>This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (Taanis 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered. Rabbi Akiva stepped down after him and exclaimed, “Our Father, our King, we have no king except You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake have mercy on us,” and rain fell. This prayer is not recited on Shabbos.</small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i><br></small>
Our Father, our King!<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as Hashem’s slaves (Vayikra 25:42), and as His children (Devorim 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King. Contrary to the view that Hashem the Father is so full of love for His children that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that Hashem the King must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to Hashem—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!</i> we have sinned before You. 
Our Father our King! we have no King except You.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Despite our physical banishment and spiritual estrangement—the result of our sins—we still have none other than Hashem to guide our lives and to shape our destiny.</i> 
Our Father, our King! deal with us [kindly] for the sake of Your Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">See Yechezkel 36.</i> 
Our Father, our King! renew for us a good year. 
Our Father, our King! annul all harsh decrees concerning us.

Aleinu

<small>Kol Bo writes that Yehoshua authored this prayer when he captured Yericho. Taken from the Musaf service of Rosh Hashana, it serves as the closing prayer of all the daily services. As ruled by Tur (Orach Chaim 133), it is said while standing.</small>
<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”

<small>The following Psalm (27) is recited at the conclusion of services, morning and evenings, from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres.</small>
<small>The Psalm voices our prayer that God will be our light on Rosh Hashana enabling us to repel the darkness of sin through true repentance, and that He will be our salvation on Yom Kippur, through His compassionate atonement of our sins.</small>

Adon Olam

Yigdal

<small>This hymn, written by Daniel ben Yehuda, who was a Dayan in Rome about 1300, is based on Maimonides' 13 principles of Judaism. According to Maimonides, failure to believe in a single one of these principles places one outside the pale of Judaism.</small>
<small>1) The existence of God</small>
<b>Exalted</b> is the living God, and praised He exists, and His existence transcends time. 
<small>2) God is One</small>
He is One, and there is no unity like His, He is invisible, His unity is infinite. 
<small>3) God is uncorporeal</small>
He is unlike the corporeal or even the non-corporeal,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem can also not be compared to the angels.</i> His holiness is beyond comparison. 
<small>4) God is Eternal</small>
He preceded every being that was created, He was First, and there was no genesis to His beginning. 
<small>5) God alone must be worshipped</small>
He is Master of the Universe to every creature, (all) proclaim His greatness and His majesty. 
<small>6) Truth of Divine Prophecy</small>
The fullness of His prophecy, He bestowed on those He treasured, and in whom He gloried. 
<small>7) Moshe was the greatest of all prophets</small>
There never arose in Yisrael another like Moshe, a prophet who beheld God's image. 
<small>8) Divine revelation of the Torah</small>
The Torah of truth the Almighty gave to His people through His prophet, the trusted one of His house. 
<small>9) The Torah is immutable</small>
The Almighty will not exchange nor alter His Law. Never will He offer any alternative. 
<small>10) God knows the acts and thoughts of man</small>
He scrutinizes and knows our secrets. He beholds the end of a thing at its beginning. 
<small>11) Divine reward and punishment</small>
He rewards man with kindness according to his deeds. He places evil on the wicked according to his wickedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The word deed is not applied to the wicked man. Since Divine reward and punishment are distributed with kindness, reward is granted to man not only for his deed which may itself be insignificant, but also for the long range effect of that deed. He is punished, however, only for his act of wickedness, not for the consequences of his deed.—Etz Yosef</i> 
<small>12) Belief in the coming of the Messiah</small>
He will send our Messiah at the end of days, to redeem all who await His final deliverance. 
<small>13) Divine resurrection of the dead</small>
The Almighty will revive the dead because of His abundant kindness: Blessed forever is His praised Name. 

Blessings Upon Arising

Akeidah (The Binding of Yitzchak)

<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, remember us favorably before You and be mindful of us for deliverance and compassion from the eternal high heavens. Remember in our behalf, Adonoy, our God: the love of our ancestors, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yisrael, Your servants; the covenant, the kindness, and the oath which You swore to our father Avraham on Mount Moriah, and the binding of Yitzchak, his son on the altar, as it is written in Your Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 22:1—19:</i>
<b>After</b> these events,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">These events refer to the previous nine tests by which Hashem tested Avraham. This was to be the tenth and the most difficult test of all.—Ha’amek Dovor</i> God tested Avraham and said to him, “Avraham!” and he [Avraham] said, “Here I am.” He said, “Please, take your son, your only one,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Yitzchok was Avraham’s only son by Sarah.</i> whom you love—Yitzchak— and go to the land of Moriah, and bring him up as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will designate to you. Avraham awoke early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took his two attendants<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Yishmael and Eliezer.—Rashi</i> with him, and also his son Yitzchak. He split the wood of the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went to the place that God had designated to him. On the third day, Avraham lifted his eyes and saw the place from afar. Avraham said to his attendants, “You stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go to that place. We will prostrate ourselves [in worship] and return<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Avraham prophesied that both of them would return.—Rashi</i> to you.” And Avraham took the wood of the burnt-offering and placed it on his son Yitzchak. In his hand he took the fire and the knife,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word is “maacheles” (root: אכל = to eat) which means that it renders meat fit for eating through slaughtering the animal. Another interpretation is: his knife is called maacheles because we still enjoy (eat) the reward of Avraham’s virtue when he agreed to use it to slaughter his son.—Rashi</i> and they both went together. Yitzchak spoke to Avraham his father and said, “Father,” and he said, “Here I am my son.” He said, “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?” Avraham said, “God Himself will show the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went together.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Although Yitzchok understood that he was going to be slaughtered, “They went together”— with like hearts.—Rashi</i> They came to the place that God had designated to him, and Avraham built the<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah says that he built “the” altar not just “an” altar, to indicate that Avraham rebuilt the same altar which was originally built by Adam and used by Kayin, Hevel and by Noach. —Targum Yonoson ben Uziel</i> altar there, and arranged the wood, and bound his son Yitzchak, and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood. Avraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. An angel of Adonoy called to him from heaven and said, “Avraham! Avraham!” and he said, “Here I am.” He [God] said, “Do not harm the boy, nor do anything to him; for now I know that you are one who fears God and have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me.” Avraham raised his eyes and beheld a ram<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Tradition tells us that this ram was prepared for this purpose from the time of creation. Rashi (from Maseches Avos 5:6)</i> after it had been caught in the thicket by its horns; and Avraham went and took the ram, and brought it up as a burnt-offering instead of his son. Avraham called the name of that place, “Adonoy will see”;<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets the following: “Hashem will see the binding of Yitzchok and through its merit He will pardon Yisrael every year and rescue them from trouble. It will thus be said, “On this day,” by all generations that the ashes of Yitzchok are seen by Hashem and serve as our atonement.—Rashi</i> as it is said [to] this day “On Adonoy's mountain, He will be seen.” An angel of Adonoy called to Avraham a second time from heaven, and said, “‘I have sworn by Myself,' declares Adonoy, ‘that because you performed this deed, and did not withhold your only son, I will greatly bless you and make your descendants as numerous<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">If these blessings were intended to increase the population of Avraham’s descendants, it was superfluous, since Hashem had previously blessed him for that purpose. Hashem here blessed the descendants of Avraham with the nobility of spirit and courage to fulfill the command to sanctify Hashem even when self-sacrifice is required. Only the nation of Yisrael, Avraham’s children, were commanded to fulfill this mitzvah, because of the legacy we inherited from him. —Ha’amek Dovor.</i> as the stars of the sky and like the sand on the seashore, and your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies. Through your children, will be blessed all the nations of the world, because you heeded My voice.'” Avraham returned to his attendants, and they rose and went together to Beer Sheva, and Avraham dwelt in Beer Sheva. 
Master of the Universe! May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to recall for our sake the covenant of our fathers. Just as our father, Avraham suppressed his compassion for his only son and would have slaughtered him to do Your will, so may Your compassion suppress Your anger against us; and may Your compassion prevail over Your [other] attributes,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Hashem’s attribute of stern justice.</i> to deal with us more leniently than the letter of Your law. Deal with us, Adonoy, our God, kindly and with compassion. In Your great goodness, turn Your fierce anger away from Your people, and from Your city, from Your land, and from Your territorial heritage. Fulfill for us, Adonoy, our God, the promise You made, through Your servant Moshe, as was said,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 26:42.</i> “I will recall My covenant with Yaakov, also My covenant with Yitzchak, and also My covenant with Avraham will I recall; and I will recall the land.” 
<b>A person</b> should always be in fear of God, privately as well as openly,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Some people conduct themselves in a God-fearing manner in the presence of others (in public), but in the privacy of their homes, do whatever they please. There are others who do just the opposite. In private they are governed by fear of Hashem, but in the presence of others they are too embarrassed or intimidated to be God-fearing. A Jew must always fear Hashem, in private as well as in public.—Si’ach Yitzchok</i> [he should] admit the truth,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Acknowledging the truth is fundamental to serving Hashem, and to all human behavior. One who is concerned merely with “winning the argument” will go to any extreme to come out on top. This attitude caused the downfall of the 250 leaders who joined Korach, rather than acknowledge the truth of Moshe’s declaration (Bamidbar 16:2—35).—Si’ach Yitzchok</i> and speak truth in his heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">It is not sufficient to merely acknowledge the truth verbally but one must speak truth in his heart as well. Rashi on the Talmud (Maseches Makos 24a) cites the following incident as an example of how one should speak truth in his heart: A buyer once offered to purchase an article from Rav Safra while he was reciting the Shema. Because he could not indicate his acceptance, the anxious purchaser increased his offer. Rav Safra refused the increment because in his heart he had already accepted the original offer.</i> and rise early and proclaim: Master of all the worlds! Not on account of our righteousness do we offer our supplications before You, but on account of Your abundant mercy. What are we? What is our life? What are our acts of kindness?

“Hear Yisrael, Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.” 
<small><i>The following three lines are to be said aloud</i><br></small>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever. 
You existed before the world was created. You exist [in the same way] now that the world has been created. You exist in this world, and You will exist in the World-to-Come. Sanctify Your Name through those who sanctifyYour Name and sanctify Your Name in Your world. And through Your deliverance You will be exalted and You will uplift our power.

Korbanos (Sacrificial Offerings)

<small>The Talmud (Maseches Menachos 110a) states: Rabbi Yitzchak asked, “Why does it say (Vayikra 6:18; 7:1) This is the law of the sin-offering, this is the law of the guilt-offering? To teach us that when one studies the law of the sin-offering, it is considered as though he had actually brought it on the Altar, and when one studies the law of the guilt-offering, it is as though he actually brought it on the Altar.”</small>
<small>Rather than merely recite the following portions, study them and attempt to learn about the laws and significance of the various sacrifices.</small>
<small><i>Shemos 30:17-21</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> Adonoy spoke to Moshe to say: Make a copper laver and a copper base, for washing; and place it between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar, and put water in it. Aharon and his sons will wash from it, their hands and their feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">His right hand was held above his right foot, the left hand above the left foot and all were washed simultaneously. Maseches Zevachim 59</i> Upon entering the Tent of Meeting they will wash with water that they not die, or whenever they approach the Altar to serve, to burn a fire-offering to Adonoy. They will wash their hands and feet that they not die; and this is for them a perpetual statute for him [Aharon], and his descendants for all their generations. 
<small>The following Scripture section describes the removal of the ashes which had accumulated on the Altar from the daily burnt-offering of the previous afternoon. This removal was performed prior to the daily morning burnt-offering. The passage below also describes the ritual of maintaining the wood pyres which were always burning on the Altar.</small>
<small><i>Vayikra 6:1</i><br></small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moshe to say: Command Aharon and his sons to say, this is the law of the burnt-offering. This is the burnt-offering [which must remain] on its pyre, upon the Altar all night, until morning, and the fire of the Altar will be kept burning on it. The Kohein will don his linen garment, and linen breeches upon his flesh, and he will remove the ashes when the fire consumes the burnt-offering on the Altar; and he will place it beside the Altar. He will remove his garments and don other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to an undefiled place. The fire upon the altar will be kept burning, it may not be extinguished. And the Kohein will burn wood on it every morning, and arrange on it the burnt-offering, and burn on it the fats of the peace-offerings. A constant fire will be kept burning on the Altar, it may not be extinguished. 

Korban Tamid (Daily Offering)

<small>The Tamid-offerings, two daily offerings of one lamb each, were offered once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The former was the first public-offering brought on the Altar each day. And the latter terminated the day's offerings. These animals were purchased from the annual half-shekel gifts of the people and were offered on behalf of the entire Jewish People. Before reading this passage we offer a brief prayer.</small>
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to have compassion on us, to forgive us all our sins, [done unknowingly], to atone all our iniquities, [done knowingly], to pardon all our [malicious] transgressions, and may You build the Holy Temple quickly, in our days, that we may offer, before You, the daily burnt-offering to atone for us, as You wrote for us in Your Torah by the hand of Moshe, Your servant, from the mouth of Your Reverence, as it is said: 
<small><i>Bamidbar 28:1-8</i><br></small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moshe to say: Command the Children of Yisrael,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Kohanim, Levites and Israelites were to be present at the offering of the two daily public burnt-offerings. The Sages instituted the program of Maamodoth, under which representatives of all 12 tribes of Yisrael were always present when these sacrifices were offered. These representatives were rotated each week.</i> and say to them: My offering, My food, to be consumed by My fires, a pleasing aroma to Me, You shall be diligent to bring unto Me, at its fixed time. And you will say to them: “This is the fire-offering that you will bring unto Adonoy: [male] lambs, in their first year, without blemish, two [of them] each day, as a constant burnt-offering. Offer one lamb in the morning, and the second lamb, offer in the afternoon. And a tenth of an ephah<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">A tenth of an ephah is the equivalent of 43-1/5 eggs.</i> of fine flour as a meal-offering, mixed with oil of crushed [olives] measuring one-fourth of a hin.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The hin is a liquid measure containing 12 logs, of which each log is approximately 6 eggs.</i> [This is] a constant burnt-offering as offered at Mount Sinai for a pleasing aroma, a fire-offering to Adonoy.

And the second lamb you will offer in the afternoon; as the meal-offering of the morning [together] with its libation, you shall offer a fire-offering of pleasing aroma to Adonoy. 
<small><i>Vayikra 1:11</i><br></small>
And he will slaughter it on the north side of the Altar, before Adonoy; and Aharon's sons, the Kohanim, will sprinkle its blood all around the Altar. 
<b>May</b> it be Your will, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, that this recitation be important, acceptable and desirable before You, as if we sacrificed the daily burnt-offering at its proper time, in its proper place and according to its laws. 

Ketores (Incense Offering)

<b>You are</b> Adonoy, our God, before Whom our fathers burned the incense of spices when the Holy Temple was standing, as You commanded them by the hand of Moshe Your prophet, as it is written in Your Torah: 
<small><i>Shemos 30:34-36</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> Adonoy said to Moshe, “Take for yourself spices— stacte, onycha, and galbanum—<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Galbanum has an offensive odor. The Torah includes it among the other spices to teach us to include even Jewish sinners among the rest of Jewry at our assemblies of fasting and prayers.—Rashi</i> spices, and pure frankincense, [they] shall be in equal weights. You will make it into incense, a compound mixed by a compounder, salted,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word, memulach is rendered by Onkelos as mixed, to indicate that the spices should be well mixed together.—Rashi</i> undefiled, and holy. You will pulverize some of it very fine, and place it before the [Ark of] Testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">This incense was offered each day upon the Innermost Altar which is inside the Tent of Meeting.—Rashi</i> in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it will be to you holy of holies.” 
It is also written: <br><i>Shemos 30:7-8</i><br> And Aharon shall burn upon it [the Altar] incense of spices every morning; when he cleans the lamps he will burn it. And when Aharon lights the lamps in the afternoon, he will burn it; a constant incense-offering before Adonoy throughout your generations. 
<small><i>Maseches Kreisos 6a; Talmud Yerushalmi, Maseches Yoma 4:5</i><br></small>
<b>The Rabbis taught:</b> How was the incense compounded? Three hundred and sixty-eight manim<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">A maneh is a weight; plural, manim.</i> were comprised therein, three hundred and sixty-five corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, one maneh for each day— half in the morning and half in the afternoon. From the three remaining manim the Kohein Gadol brought two handfuls [into the Holy of Holies] on Yom Kippur; [for which purpose] they were put back into the mortar on the eve of Yom Kippur, and ground [again] very thoroughly, in order to make them very fine. Eleven kinds of spices were used for it. They were: 1) balm, 2) onycha, 3) galbanum, 4) frankincense— by weight, seventy maneh of each; 5) myrrh, 6) cassia, 7) spikenard and 8) saffron— in weight sixteen maneh of each; 9) twelve maneh of costus, 10) three of aromatic bark, and 11) nine of cinnamon. [Also used in the incense compound were:] Nine kabin<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">A kav is a sixth of a se’ah.</i> of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three s'in and three kabin— if he had no Cyprus wine, he could use strong white wine— a fourth of a kab of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of maaleh ashan.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">This herb causes the smoke of the burning incense to ascend in a straight line.</i> Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, “Jordan amber was added of a minute quantity, and if one added honey,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Included are various sweeteners such as dates and other fruits.</i> it (the incense) became unfit; and if one omitted<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The same is true if one were to add to the prescribed number of eleven spices.—Etz Yosef</i> any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The death penalty was given only if the Kohein Gadol actually entered the Holy of Holies with incense which was unfit. This was considered as an unwarranted entry into the Holy of Holies which carried the death decree.—Rashi</i> 
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: “The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree. Why was the Carshina lye used? To refine the onycha in order to make it pleasant. Why was Cyprus wine used? The onycha was soaked in it to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">This water came from a well named Raglayim.—Kol Bo</i> was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Since Mai Raglayim (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple. Others hold that the term “waters of Raglayim” actually refers to urine, which could have been used as a soaking agent were it not indecent to bring it into a sacred place.—Kol Bo</i> 
It was taught in a Boraysa: Rabbi Nosson says, “While [the Kohein] ground [the incense] he would say, ‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,' because the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the sound of these specific words affects the spices.</i> is good for the spices. If half<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">184 manim instead of 368.</i> the quantity of incense was prepared it was acceptable, but if only a third or a fourth [of it was prepared] we have not heard<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we did not hear our teachers expound this question.</i> [whether it was acceptable.”] Rabbi Yehuda said, “This is the general rule: If [it was prepared with all its ingredients] in the correct proportion, it is acceptable even if only half was prepared; but if he left out any of its spices, he was liable for the death penalty. 
It was taught in a Boraysa: Bar Kappara says, “Once in sixty or seventy years<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The exact number of years varied with the size of the hands of the High Priests over the years, for the surplus was what remained of these three manim from which he took two handfuls each Yom Kippur.</i> the accumulated surplus was sufficient to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense.”] Bar Kappara also taught, “If he would have put into it a minute quantity of honey, no one could have withstood [resisted] the scent. Why was no honey mixed with it? Because the Torah says, (Vayikra 2:11) For any leaven or honey, do not burn from them, [as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.” 
<small><i>Recite each of these verses three times:</i><br></small>
Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Yaakov, Selah! 
Adonoy of Hosts, fortunate is the man who trusts in You. 
Adonoy, deliver [us]! The King will answer us on the day we call. 
You are my shelter; from distress You preserve me; with glad song of rescue, You envelop me, Selah! 
Let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Yehudah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Therefore let it be Your will Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, that the prayer of our lips be considered, and accepted and regarded favorably before You, as if we had offered the Daily offering at its appointed time, and stood in attendance at its service, 
<small><i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br></small>
On the Sabbath day [the offering is]: two male yearling lambs without blemish; two tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal-offering mixed with the [olive] oil, and its libation.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">All libations are of wine, measured according to the animal brought as a sacrifice.</i> This is the burnt-offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the daily burnt-offering and its libation. 
<small>The following sequence of Mishnahyos and the selection from Sifra “Rabbi Yishmael Says,” were inserted after the Scriptural selections dealing with daily offerings in order to give every Jew the opportunity to study/recite daily, the minimum of selections from Scripture, Mishnah, and Talmud. Even though Sifra is not actually a Talmudic tractate, it is a Tanaitic expansion of Mishnah. (See Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 50:1).</small>

<b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> says: through thirteen methods the Torah is expounded: 1) [A conclusion drawn] from a minor or lenient law, to a major or more strict one. 2) A clarification based on identical words or terms in the Biblical text. 3) A principle derived from one Biblical text or from two Biblical texts. 4) A rule followed by a detail. 5) A detail followed by a rule. 6) A rule followed by a detail, which is in turn followed by a rule, may infer only what is similar to the detail. 7) When a general rule requires an explicit rule; when an explicit rule requires generalization. 8) Something included in a general rule, which was singled out to teach— was not singled out to teach about itself, but to teach (something new) concerning the rule as a whole. 9) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out in a case similar to its rule, —it was singled out to lessen not to increase the severity of the case. 10) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out in a case which is not similar to its rule, —it was singled out either to lessen or to increase the severity of the case. 11) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out for a new stipulation— does not revert to its rule unless Scripture restores it to its rule expressly. 12) A matter deduced from its context, or from a subsequent expression. 13) Also, two passages that contradict each other until a third passage reconciles them. 
May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days: and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. 

Kaddish d'Rabanan

<small>Kaddish is not the name generally given to this prayer in the Talmud. It is referred to there as “May His great Name...”, because the congregational response beginning with these words is the heart of this prayer. Only in one minor tractate, (Maseches Soferim 16, 19, and 21) is it referred to as Kaddish.</small>
<small>Composed primarily in Aramaic, the language spoken and understood by most Jews in the Second Temple period (See Tosafos to Maseches Berachos 3a), nevertheless, several Hebrew phrases, which were familiar even to the unschooled, were also incorporated in the prayer.</small>
<small>This particular form of Kaddish d'Rabanan, is so named because of the insertion of the paragraph which begins with the words “Upon Yisrael and upon our Sages, etc.” This Kaddish is recited following the study of Talmud or Midrash and invokes God's blessings on the Sages of Jewry, the transmitters of the Oral Torah.</small>

Mizmor Shir

<small>Psalm 30, once used to inaugurate the Holy Temple, is used today to inaugurate our daily prayers, for the synagogue is a “Holy Temple in miniature” and our prayers take the place of the sacrifices. It is both a prayer for success and a declaration of thanksgiving.</small>
<b>A Psalm,</b> a song for the inauguration of the Temple, by Dovid.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was Solomon who built the Temple, why is its inauguration attributed to Dovid?

Pesukei Dezimrah

<small>The following sequence of prayers until Yishtabach (p. 94) is called Pesukei Dezimrah (verses of praise). These selected Scriptural passages were arranged by the Gaonim of the ninth century, in fulfillment of the Talmudic statement (Maseches Berachos 32a), “A person should always praise God first and make his requests [offer his prayers] afterwards.” Beginning with Baruch She'amar (p. 000), it is forbidden to interrupt your prayer with conversation until after the Shemoneh Esrei.</small>
<small>You are permitted to answer Amein, respond to Barechu, Kaddish and to say Kedushah even though you have passed Baruch She'amar. You are also permitted to say Modim d'Rabbonon and the first verse of the Shema together with the congregation.</small>
<small>If you are concerned that the saying of Kerias Shema will not be within the proper time should you follow the regular order of prayers, you are permitted to recite the entire Kerias Shema during the Pesukei Dezimrah.</small>

Baruch She'amar

<small>This blessing introduces the Pesukei Dezimrah. It was mentioned by Rabbi Yitzchak Alfasi (Rif) over 800 years ago in his commentary to Maseches Berachos 32. The Taz (Orach Chaim 51:1) states that this prayer was instituted by the “Men of the Great Assembly.” The blessing contains eighty-seven words suggesting the numerical value of פָּז poz, refined gold.</small>

You are awesome, God, from Your Sanctuaries,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">There is a spiritual Temple in the heavens which corresponds to the Temple on earth.—Radak. The Talmud (Maseches Zevachim 115b) notes that the word מִמִּקְדָּשֶׁיךָ may also be read מִמְקוּדָשֶׁיךָ, from Your holy people, indicating that Hashem is especially demanding of the most adherent to the Torah. When this occurs, the world is filled with awe and fear of Hashem.</i> Almighty of Yisrael— He grants might and power to the people; blessed is God. Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy, Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">These two verses (94:1—2) are an appeal to Hashem during a time fraught with the sufferings of exile, when it seems as if Hashem has forsaken His people. He is urged to reveal Himself as the Mighty champion of justice—S.R. Hirsch</i> Arise, Judge of the earth! Repay the arrogant their just reward. Deliverance is Adonoy's.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Only Hashem knows what is true deliverance for a person. Prayer is not always answered, because Hashem in His infinite wisdom knows that granting the request is not always for our benefit. We must therefore bless and offer thanks to Hashem regardless of whether our petition has been granted.—Siach Yitzchok</i> Upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah. Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Yaakov. Selah. Adonoy of Hosts! Fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver [us]. The King will answer us on the day we call. 
Deliver Your people and bless Your inheritance, tend them and uplift them forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Radak understands Dovid to be asking Hashem to raise the People of Yisrael above their enemies. Ibn Ezra says that Hashem is being asked to act like a shepherd who brings his flock to high ground to save them from beasts of prey.</i> Our soul yearned for Adonoy, our help and our shield is He. For in Him our hearts will rejoice, for in His Holy Name we trusted. May Your kindness, Adonoy, be upon us, as we have waited for You. Show us Your kindness, Adonoy, and grant<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">We hope to earn redemption through our deeds, but if we are found wanting, then “show us Your kindness”—overlook our deficiencies and “grant” us salvation.—Radak</i> us Your deliverance.

I am Adonoy, Your God, Who brought you up from the land of Mitzrayim; open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Request all that you desire and I will fulfill every request.—Ibn Ezra. The Yerushalayim Talmud (Maseches Taanis 3:6) indicates that the more one requests Hashem’s providence—the “wider he opens his mouth”—the more he shows his belief in Hashem’s ability to provide all of man’s needs.</i> Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus, fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. In Your loving kindness I trust, My heart will exult in Your deliverance; I will sing to Adonoy, for He dealt kindly with me.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The foremost level of man’s trust in Hashem is manifested in three situations: a)when he is confronted with trouble, b)when he seeks help, and c)after he has been helped. The Psalmist says: In my time of trouble, I trust in Your kindliness; I seek only Your help, for my heart exults in Your salvation; and I will sing to You afterwards for You have dealt kindly with me.—Siddur HaGra</i> 
<small>In this psalm, (19) Dovid sings the praises of the Torah. The Kuzari notes that even though the skies “proclaim God's glory” and the Psalmist describes the sun so glowingly, Dovid nevertheless concludes that in comparison to the Torah they are insignificant.</small>
<b>To the Chief Musician,</b> a Psalm of Dovid. The skies recount the glory of the Almighty, and His handiwork is related by the firmament.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">שָׁמַיִם, skies, refers to the heavenly regions beyond earth’s atmosphere, where the stars and planets orbit. רָקִיעַ, firmament, refers to the earth’s atmosphere where clouds form, and precipitation takes place. The verb לְסַפֵּר means to recount something which occurred in the past. Thus the stars and planets in the שָׁמַיִם recount the fact that long ago Hashem created a glorious universe. The רָקִיעַ, on the other hand, relates that Hashem’s handiwork is evidenced in the constant formation of clouds and in the precipitation of rain. The firmament enables man to recognize the constant renewal of Hashem’s providence.—Malbim</i> Day to day makes speech flow,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Daily renewal of the activities of creation, beginning with sunrise, stir mankind to proclaim Hashem’s praises.—Rashi</i> and night to night expresses wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Night after night the sun sets beneath the horizon only to rise and set again the following day. This unchanging pattern is evidence of the Divine wisdom implanted in Hashem’s creation.—Rashi</i> There is no speech, and there are no words; their voice is never heard.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Though the heavens have no means of verbal communication, the soul of man, with its sensitivity and perception, can understand their message clearly.—Ibn Ezra</i> Throughout the earth, their line extends, and to the edge of the inhabited world their words, for the sun He has set a tent in their midst.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem provided the sun a permanent residence in the heavens. Dovid describes this point to which the sun returns daily as its ‘tent’—its residence in the sky.—Metsudas Yehoshua</i> And it [the sun] is like a groom departing his bridal chamber,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">When the groom steps out of the bridal chamber, everyone rushes to greet him with great joy. Analogously, when the sun rises each day, all of creation rejoices.—Radak</i> happy as a warrior to run on course.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">A warrior is happy for the opportunity to go into battle because he has confidence in his skill and strength. Similarly, the sun rejoices knowing it will serve its Creator’s goals by running its course.—Metsudas Dovid.</i> From one end of the skies is its rising and its circuit is to their [other] end; there is no escaping its heat. The Torah of Adonoy, is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Adonoy, is trustworthy, making wise the simple [man]. The precepts of Adonoy, are upright, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of Adonoy, is lucid, enlightening the eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Every command of Hashem is flawless, lighting the way for those who walk in His way.

Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me. Also from willful [sins] spare Your servant, let them not rule me,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid’s request is paraphrased in the concluding blessing of the בִּרְכוֹת הַשַּׁחַר, where we say וְאַל יִשְׁלֹט בָּנוּ יֵצֶר הָרַע, “Let us not be ruled by the Evil Inclination.” Dovid knows full well that Hashem does not interfere with man’s free choise; he only asks for Divine help to keep him from becoming a prisoner of evil.—Gaon of Vilna</i> then I will be strong and will be cleansed of gross transgression. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
<small>This psalm (34) is based entirely on an event that took place in Dovid's personal life as related in 1 Shmuel 21:11-16. Forced to flee from Saul, he took refuge among the Philistines, where he was recognized as the slayer of Goliath. In order to escape death at the hands of his foes, Dovid pretended to be an imbecile, and was sent away unharmed by King Avimelech.</small>
<b>Of Dovid,</b> When he acted insane in the presence of Avimelech and he [Avimelech] drove him away, and he [Dovid] left. I will bless Adonoy at all times constantly is His praise in my mouth. In Adonoy does my soul take pride,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid is proud that he is worthy of uttering Hashem’s Name.</i> the humble will hear [this] and rejoice. Declare the greatness of Adonoy with me, and let us exalt His Name together. I sought Adonoy and He responded to me; and from all my fears He saved me. [Those who] look to Him are enlightened and their faces are never darkened [humiliated]. This poor man<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid describes himself as a helpless indigent waiting for Hashem’s compassion.—Radak</i> called and Adonoy heard; and from all his troubles, He delivered him. The angel of Adonoy encamps around those who fear Him and sets them free. Taste and see that Adonoy is good;<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Seporno says that taste refers to the senses whereas “see” refers to the intellect.</i> fortunate is the man who takes refuge in Him. Fear Adonoy, [you] His holy ones, for there is no deprivation for those who fear Him. Young lions feel want and hunger, but those who seek Adonoy will not lack any good thing. Come children, listen to me, fear of Adonoy will I teach you. Who is the man who desires life,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid does not say הֶחָפֵץ בַּחַיִּים ‘he who takes pleasure in life’ but הֶחָפֵץ חַיִּים, ‘he who desires life,’ whose only goal is life; that is, he desires to attain such a level of existence as can truly be called life.—S.R. Hirsch</i> and loves days that he may see good? Guard your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceitfully. Turn from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of Adonoy are toward the righteous, and His ears [are open] to their cry. The face<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The expression פְּנֵי ה', Face of Hashem, describes Divine anger. See Vayikra 20:5, וֵשַׂמְתִּי אֲנִי אֶת פָּנַי בָּאִישׁ הַהוּא, “And I will set My Face against that man.”</i> of Adonoy is set against evildoers to excise from earth, their memory. They<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">They refers to the righteous ones (Rashi) and to the repentant sinners (Ibn Ezra).</i> cry out and Adonoy hears and from all their troubles, He saves them. Adonoy is close to the broken-hearted and those crushed in spirit, He delivers. Many evils befall a righteous man, and from all of them, Adonoy saves him. He preserves all his bones, not one of them is broken. The cause of death of the wicked is evil; and the haters of the righteous are doomed. Adonoy liberates the soul of His servants, and none are doomed who take refuge in Him. 
<small>According to our Sages, Psalms 90 through 101, were said by Moshe. According to Radak, Dovid actually found this psalm in its written form and knowing it to be the prayer of Moshe, included it in his book of psalms. It speaks of the frailty of man and the brevity of his life and asks for God's compassion and favor despite his wrongdoings.</small>
<b>A prayer of Moshe,</b> the man of God: My Master a dwelling[-place] have You been for us in every generation. Before the mountains were born, and You brought forth the earth and the inhabited world; from world to world<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">From before this world to the next world You are Almighty.</i> You are Almighty. You push man down until the crushing point<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">You permit the sinner to return in penitence even till the very last moment of his life.—Iyun Tefiloh</i> and You say, “Return, children of man!”<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">You constantly call the sinner to return, reminding him of the brevity of his life.—Iyun Tefiloh</i> For a thousand years are in Your eyes like the yesterday that has just passed, and like a night watch. The stream of their life is [but] slumber, in the morning they are as grass, freshly grown. [If] in the morning it blossoms, and grows afresh by evening it is cut off and shriveled. So are we consumed by Your anger and by Your rage are we terrified. You have set our iniquities before You, the sins of our youth<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate ‘our hidden sins [are exposed]’ see Metsudas Dovid</i> before the light of Your countenance. For all our days vanish in Your wrath; we terminate our years like an unspoken word. The days of our years in them<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">‘In them’ refers to the iniquities and the youth mentioned in the two preceding verses. —Rashi</i> [total] seventy years, and with strength, eighty years, and their pride is frustration and falsehood; for, cut off quickly, we fly away.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Not only is the span of our lives brief, but our few allotted years fly by swiftly.—Iyun Tefiloh</i> Who can [get to] know the force of Your anger?

<small>This Psalm, (91) composed by Moshe on the day the Tabernacle was completed, is a source of inspiration to all who seek the Almighty as their refuge and fortress.</small>
<b>He who dwells</b> in the shelter of the Supreme One, under the protection of Shadai he will abide. I say of Adonoy, [He is] my refuge and my stronghold, my God in Whom I trust. For He will save you from the snare-trap, from destructive pestilence. With His wings He will cover you and beneath His wings, you will find refuge; His truth is a shield, a full shield. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day. The pestilence that prowls in darkness, nor the deadly plague that ravages at noon. A thousand will fall at your [left] side, and ten thousand at your [right] side but it<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">‘It’ refers to ‘arrow,’ pestilence,’ and ‘plague’ mentioned in the preceding two verse.</i> shall not come near you. Only<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">You will only see the destruction but you will not be harmed by it.</i> with your eyes will you behold and see the punishment of the wicked. For you [have proclaimed]: “Adonoy is my refuge,” the Supreme One you have made your dwelling. No evil shall befall you, and no plague shall come near your tent. For His angels He will command on your behalf— to guard you in all your ways. They will carry you upon their hands, lest you hurt your foot on a rock. You will tread upon lion and snake, you will trample young lion and serpent. Because he clings to Me with desire, I will save him; I will strengthen him, for he knows My Name. When he calls upon Me, I will answer him; I am with him in distress, I will free him and honor him. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance. 
<small>In this psalm, (135) Dovid praises God for choosing the people of Israel as His treasured people. He also speaks of those who will ultimately be worthy of serving Him, in the rebuilt House of God, in the Messianic era.</small>
<b>Praise God,</b> Praise the Name of Adonoy, Praise [Him], servants of Adonoy. [You] who stand in the House of Adonoy, in the courtyards of the House of our God. Praise God, for Adonoy is good, sing to His Name which is pleasant. For God chose Yaakov to be His, Yisrael for His treasure. For I know that Adonoy is great, our Master [is greater] than all gods. All that was desired by Adonoy, He has done in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths. He causes clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; lightning for the rain He makes; He brings forth winds from His vaults. He struck down the firstborn of Mitzrayim both man and beast. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of Mitzrayim, upon Pharaoh and upon all his servants. For He smote many nations, and slew mighty kings: Sichon, King of the Amorites, and Og, King of the Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan. And He gave their lands as an inheritance, an inheritance to Yisrael, His people. Adonoy is Your Name forever, Adonoy is Your mention for generations. For Adonoy judges His people,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">According to Seporno, the verse is translated, ‘When Adonoy judges on behalf of His people,’ referring to the judgement of all who oppressed the Jewish people.</i> and upon His servants will He relent. The idols<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">עֲצַבֵּי is related to עֶצֶב which means ‘sadness’ or ‘grief.’ Idols bring only grief to those who depend on them.—Radak</i> of the nations, are of silver and gold, products of human hands: They have a mouth but do not speak; they have eyes but do not see. They have ears but do not listen; nor is there any breath in their mouth. Like them let their makers be— all who trust in them. House of Yisrael, bless Adonoy!<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The entire house of Yisrael is urged to bless Hashem Who set us apart from the other nations and made us His people. Yisrael is told to bless Hashem for its own unique position and manner of serving Him.— Ibn Ezra</i> House of Aharon, bless Adonoy! House of Levi, bless Adonoy! [You] who fear Adonoy,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to those among the nations who converted to Judaism because of their fear and recognition of Hashem.</i> bless Adonoy! Blessed is Adonoy from Tziyon, He Who dwells in Yerushalayim. Praise God. 
<small>The Talmud (Pesachim 118a) calls this psalm (136) הַלֵל הַגָדוֹל, the great praise, because it describes how God, enthroned on high, sustains every living creature. The first twenty-four verses call on us to thank God, the Master of the Universe, Who created it, redeemed us from Mitzrayim, caused us to inherit the lands of Sichon and Og, and delivered us from our enemies. The twenty-fifth verse, נוֹתֵן לֶחֶם לְכָל בָּשָׂר, He gives food to all flesh, is viewed as the climax of the entire psalm. Feeding every creature, day in and day out, is the greatest manifestation of God's provident kindliness. Though He rules in supreme splendor, God is close to the needs of every creature.</small>
<b>Thank</b> Adonoy for He is good, for His kindliness endures forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This refrain is repeated in all twenty-six verses of the Psalm. We thereby declare that each act of kindliness for which we thank Hashem is not of a temporary nature, lasting merely a day or a year. The effect of His kindliness endures forever, and we continually reap the benefits of every act of Divine kindliness.—Sfas Emes</i> 
Thank the God of gods, for His kindliness endures forever. 
Thank the Master of masters, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who does great wonders, alone, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who makes the heavens, with understanding, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who spreads the earth over the waters, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who makes the great luminaries, for His kindliness endures forever. 
The sun to rule by day, for His kindliness endures forever. 
The moon and stars to rule by night, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who struck Mitzrayim through their firstborn, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He brought Yisrael out of their midst, for His kindliness endures forever. 
With a strong hand and outstretched arm, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who parted the Sea of Reeds into parts,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The sea was divided into twelve parts, so that each tribe crossed on its own route.</i> for His kindliness endures forever. 
And He made Yisrael pass through it for His kindliness endures forever. 
And He threw Pharaoh and his army into the Sea of Reeds, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who led His people through the wilderness for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who struck great kings, for His kindliness endures forever. 
And He slew mighty kings, for His kindliness endures forever. 
Sichon, king of the Amorites, for His kindliness endures forever. 
And Og, king of the Bashan, for His kindliness endures forever. 
And gave their land as an inheritance, for His kindliness endures forever. 
An inheritance to Yisrael, His servant, for His kindliness endures forever. 
In our lowliness, He remembered us, for His kindliness endures forever. 
And He freed us from our oppressors, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He gives food to all flesh, for His kindliness endures forever. 
Thank the Almighty of heaven for His kindliness endures forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The twenty-six verses in this psalm symbolize the twenty six generations of man from Creation till the Torah was given. These generations were sustained solely by virtue of Hashem’s kindliness even though they did not have the merit of Torah.</i> 
<small>In this psalm, (33) Dovid expresses the joy of the righteous in the Divine Providence of God in every aspect of the world and in the affairs of man. For the righteous see the “laws of nature” only as an external cloak, concealing the true supervision of God. They see through the laws of nature and perceive the Divine order and providence of the Creator.</small>
<b>Joyfully exult</b> in Adonoy—righteous ones— for the upright, praise is fitting. Thank Adonoy with the harp, with the ten-stringed lyre sing to Him. Sing Him a new song, play skillfully with jubilation. For upright is the word of Adonoy and all His deeds [are done] with faithfulness. He loves righteousness and justice the kindliness of Adonoy fills the earth. By the word of God, the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth, all their hosts. He gathers like a mound the waters of the sea, He places in vaults the deep waters. Fear Adonoy, all the earth, of Him, be in dread all dwellers of the inhabited world. For He spoke and it became; He commanded and it stood. Adonoy annuls the counsel of nations, He disrupts the intention of peoples. The counsel of Adonoy will stand forever, the thoughts of His heart throughout all generations. Fortunate is the nation for whom Adonoy is their God, the people He chose as His heritage. From the heavens, Adonoy looks [down], He sees all mankind. From His dwelling place, He watches intently all the inhabitants of the earth. He forms their hearts all together;<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud (Sanhedrin 37a) states: When a man mints many coins from the same mold, they are all exactly alike, but Hashem formed all of mankind from Adam and no two men look exactly alike. The Sages in Berachos 58a add: just as no two faces are alike, so are no two personalities alike. Thus even though Hashem made them all together, each has his own unique personality.</i> He perceives all their doings. A king is not saved by a great army; a mighty man is not rescued with [his] great strength. A horse is deceptive [assurance] for deliverance, and with its great strength it provides no escape. Behold, the eye of Adonoy is on those who fear Him, on those who wait for His kindliness. To rescue their soul from death, and to keep them alive during famine. Our soul yearned for Adonoy, our help and our shield is He. For in Him our heart will rejoice, for in His Holy Name we trust, May Your kindliness, Adonoy, be upon us, as we have waited for You. 
<b>A Psalm,</b> a song for the Shabbos day. It is good to thank<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbos, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to Hashem. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life.

<b>Adonoy</b> had begun His reign He has clothed Himself with majesty; Adonoy has clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength. He has firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved. Your throne stands firm from of old, You are from eternity. The rivers have raised—Adonoy— the rivers have raised their voice, the rivers raise their raging waves. More than the sound of many waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea Mighty on high, are You, Adonoy. Your testimonies are extremely faithful, holiness is becoming to Your House, Adonoy—for the length of days.

Ashrei

<small>Rav S.R. Hirsch writes that the six concluding chapters of the Book of Psalms are the most important gift of Dovid's Divinely-inspired hymns that Yisrael treasures so greatly. These six psalms, 145-150, are an essential component of our daily prayers. Our Sages attach much significance to Psalm 145 in particular, and stated: “Whoever recites ‘A praise by Dovid' three times a day is assuredly worthy of a share in the world to come” (Maseches Berachos 4b). When recited in prayer, this psalm is always introduced with two verses from other Psalms (84:5 and 144:15). These verses contain the word fortunate three times, an allusion to this psalm being recited three times a day. These verses are so closely identified with Psalm 145 that it is commonly referred to as Ashrei (Fortunate).</small>
<b>Fortunate</b> are those who dwell in Your house;<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">This verse referred to the Kohanim and the Levites who served (dwelt) in the Holy Temple (Your House); it is at all times applicable to scholars and devout men who study and pray in houses of worship and study.</i> may they continue to praise You, Selah.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 84:5</i> Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 144:15</i> A praise by Dovid!

<small>This Psalm acclaims God's loving care as experienced by each Jew in his own life.</small>
<b>Praise God!</b> My soul, praise Adonoy. I will praise Adonoy with my life; I will sing to my God as long as I live. Do not place your trust [even] in noble men,<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Sages, it is implied that one should not rely even on the merit of his sainted ancestors, the Patriarchs, for deliverance.</i> in man who has no [power of] deliverance.

Adonoy protects strangers; the orphan and widow He enables to stand firm; and the way of the wicked He thwarts. Adonoy will reign forever; your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God. 
<small>In this Psalm, Dovid imparts the knowledge to sustain and uphold the Jewish People, during their bitter exile. He tells them of their special and enduring relationship with God and of their role as permanent messengers of the word of God to all mankind.</small>
<b>Praise God!</b> for it is good to sing to our God; for [His] praise is pleasant, befitting. The builder of Yerushalayim is Adonoy; the banished ones of Yisrael He will gather. [He is] the Healer of the broken-hearted and [also] binds up their wounds.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Others render “their sorrows.” Both translations co-exist!

Adonoy causes the humble to stand firm; He casts down the wicked to the ground. Cry out to Adonoy in thanksgiving; sing to our God with the harp.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Each musical instrument has its unique function. In the times of King Dovid, the harp was used to arouse those who slept. The psalmist may be indicating that the harp arouses the sleeping soul of man to recognition of the miraculous ways in which Hashem shows His Divine Providence for us every day.—Siach Yitzchok</i> [He] Who covers the heaven with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth; Who causes grass to grow upon the hills. Who gives the animal its fodder; [also] to the young ravens which call. Not the power of the horse does He desire, nor the thighs of man does He want.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem does not delight in those who place their trust in the strength of horses or in their own strength.—Tzelosa d’Avraham</i> Adonoy wants those who fear Him, those who hope for His kindliness. Yerushalayim, praise Adonoy; Tziyon, extol your God.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">The Psalmist addresses the dwellers in Yerushalayim and Tziyon, not the city itself. —Tzelosa d’Avraham</i> For He has fortified the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children in your midst.

He hurls His ice like crumbs; who can withstand His cold? He dispatches His word and melts them; He blows His wind, they flow as water. He declares His word to Yaakov, His statutes and His laws to Yisrael.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Yisrael is the receiver and preserver of Hashem’s divine Law, the Torah, which includes chukim, statutes which confine the physical, sensual aspects of man within the bounds of moral purity, and also mishpotim, laws which govern communal life. Among the nations, law is determined by the views they hold at a given time and place concerning the needs of a society, and so their laws are based on expediency.—S.R. Hirsch</i> He did not do so to any [other] nation; and of His laws they were not informed. Praise God. 
<small>In this psalm, Dovid sings of the moment when all the world will be imbued with the knowledge of God's all-embracing providence. All living creatures—from the infinite heights of heaven above (verses 1-7) down to the depths of the earth below (verses 7-12)—will join together in one great hymn of praise to their Creator, and acknowledge the uniqueness of Yisrael over all other nations.</small>
<b>Praise God.</b> Praise Adonoy from the sky; Praise Him in the heights! Praise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His hosts! Praise Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all the stars of light. Praise Him, skies of skies, and the waters that are above the skies.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 1:6—7 indicates that there are waters above the heavens.</i> They will praise the Name of Adonoy, for He commanded it and they were created.

The sun never violates its mandate to serve by day or the moon by night. According to Ibn Ezra, the verse might also be translated “He issued a decree which will not pass away,” for Hashem’s decree is permanent and immutable.</i> Praise Adonoy from the earth, sea-monsters and all [that dwell in] the depths. Fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormwind, [all] fulfilling His word. The mountains and all the hills, fruit trees and all cedars. Wild beasts and all animals, creeping things and winged fowl.

<small>The custom of reciting the following additions to Pesukei Dezimrah is mentioned as early as the Gaonic era, specifically by Rav Amram Gaon. These verses were incorporated into our daily prayers because they speak so eloquently of God's majesty, and of the Divine providence which is the source of the power, riches, might, and honor of all human beings.</small>
<small>The first four verses (1 Chronicles 29:10-13) relate Dovid's blessing to God, when he presented the gold, silver, and jewels he amassed for the construction of the Holy Temple. It was a day of great rejoicing as, following Dovid's example, the leaders and princes also presented generous gifts for the construction of the Temple.</small>
<small><i>The following until after ישתבח should be said standing. (Some sit for Nishmas.)</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> Dovid blessed Adonoy in the presence of all the assembly; and Dovid said, Blessed are You, Adonoy, God of Yisrael, our Father,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid singles out Yaakov because he was the first Patriarch to mention building a house of Hashem (Bereishis 28:22), “Then shall this stone which I have set for a pillar be Hashem’s house.”—Radak</i> forever and ever. Yours, Adonoy, is the greatness, the might, the glory the victory and the beauty,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid thus renders unto Hashem the greatness Hashem has given him.

Shiras Hayam

<small>In Temple times Shiras Hayam, the Song of the Sea, was sung by the Levites when the daily afternoon sacrifice was offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Rosh Hashanah 31a, mentions that the Ode was sung at Minchah on Shabbos.</i> After the destruction, the Jews of the Holy Land continued the tradition, reciting the Shira at the end of the Pesukei Dezimrah. The custom spread to Italy and from there to other Jewish communities. This daily recital is mentioned by Rav Saadya Gaon but not as an obligatory part of the service. Rambam calls it a “custom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Hilchos Tefillah 7:13.</i> Subsequently adopted by all communities, reciting the Shira became an integral part of our daily prayers.</small>
<small>Some hold that the Shira should be chanted aloud while standing. It should be sung with joy as at the time of the Exodus. “Sheloh” writes that reciting the Shira atones for sin, so that if one wishes to repent a serious sin, he should recite the Shira every day with great fervor. The Zohar says, “If one recites this song with elation and joy, he will be worthy to sing it in the next world. He will also be worthy to sing it when he greets the Mashiach.”</small>
<b>On that day,</b><sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Even though they had been free a week earlier, they were insecure, fearing that the Egyptians would capture and re-enslave them.

Nishmas

<small>The Mishnah, (Maseches Pesachim 117b) refers to the following prayer as בִּרְכַּת הַשִּׁיר, the blessing of song. Some commentaries suggest that it is so named because it forms a lengthy song that concludes with the blessing of יִשְׁתַּבַּח on page 000. On weekdays, when there is not sufficient time to concentrate adequately on our prayers, we merely recite the concluding blessing of יִשְׁתַּבַּח, but on Sabbath and Festivals we recite the prayer in its entirety.</small>
<b>The soul</b> of every living thing shall bless Your Name, Adonoy, our God; and the spirit of all flesh shall glorify and exalt Your mention, our King, continually. From world to world,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">See note 55 on תפילה למשה, page 000.</i> You are Almighty; and besides You we have no king, redeemer, or deliverer, [who] liberates, rescues, maintains and is compassionate in all times of trouble and distress. We have no king, helper, supporter but You. God of the first and last [generations], God of all created things, Master of all begotten things,<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Yosef assumes that תּוֹלָדוֹת refers to events that occur in time. [See Mishlei 27:1, כִּי לֹא תֵדַע מַה יֻלַּד יוֹם, for you do not know what a day may bring forth.] Thus Hashem is Master of all events. Iyun Tefiloh says that בְּרִיוֹת, created beings, refers to everything Hashem created during the six days of creation, whereas תּוֹלָדוֹת refers to those things that come forth, i.e., were “born” from the original created things. Thus He is God of all created things and Master of all begotten things even though they appear as products of nature.</i> Who is extolled with a multitude of praises, Who conducts His world with kindliness and His creatures with compassion. Adonoy neither slumbers nor sleeps. He arouses those who sleep and awakens those who slumber, and He gives speech to the mute, and releases the imprisoned.

Even if our mouths were filled with song like the sea,<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Just like the sea is filled with water.</i> and our tongues with exultation like the roaring of its waves, and our lips with praise like the breadth of the firmament, and our eyes were radiant like the sun and the moon, and our hands outspread like [the] eagles of the sky, and our feet light as the deer— we would never sufficiently thank You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, and bless Your Name for even one thousandth of the billions and trillions of favors which You did for our fathers and for us: from Mitzrayim You redeemed us, Adonoy, our God; from the house of bondage, You liberated us; in famine You nourished us, and in [times of] plenty, You fed us; from the sword You saved us and from pestilence You removed us, and from severe and lingering sicknesses, have You withdrawn us. Until now Your compassion has helped us and Your kindliness has not forsaken us. Do not abandon us, Adonoy, our God, for eternity. Therefore, the limbs which You apportioned for us, and the spirit and soul that You have breathed into our nostrils, and the tongue You have set in our mouth— behold, they will thank, bless, praise, glorify, exalt revere, sanctify, and proclaim the sovereignty of Your Name, our King. For every mouth will thank You, and every tongue will swear allegiance to You, and every knee will bend to You, and all that stand up will prostrate themselves before You; all hearts will fear You, and all innards and kidneys will sing to Your Name as is written, “All my bones will say: Adonoy! who is like unto You?” You save the poor man from one stronger than he, and the poor and needy from one who would rob him.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 35:10.</i> Who is like You?

The King

<b>The King</b> Who sits on a throne [that is] exalted and uplifted.
<b>He Who dwells</b> in eternity, exalted and holy is His Name. And it is written: “Joyfully exult in God, [you] righteous ones, for the upright, praise is fitting. Through the mouth of the upright, You are exalted, and with the words of the righteous You are blessed; and by the tongue of the pious, You are sanctified; and in the midst of the holy, You are extolled. 
<b>And in the assemblies</b> of myriads of Your people, the House of Yisrael; with joyful song glorified will be Your Name, our King, in every generation. For it is the duty of all beings, before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to thank, to extol, and to praise; to glorify, to exalt, and to honor; to bless, to elevate, and to acclaim [You,] even beyond all the words of song and praise of Dovid, son of Yishai, Your servant, Your anointed. 

Yishtabach

<small>Rabbeinu Alfasi (Maseches Berachos 32) refers to Baruch She'amar as the opening blessing of the Pesukei Dezimrah, and Yishtabach as the concluding blessing.</small>
<b>Praised be</b> Your Name forever, our King, Almighty the great and holy King in heaven and on earth. For to You it is fitting [to offer] Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, song and praise, glorification and hymns, [to proclaim your] strength and dominion, victory, grandeur, and might, praise and glory, holiness and sovereignty, blessings and thanksgivings, from now, forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Almighty, King [Who is] great in [our] praise Almighty, of [to Whom we offer our] thanksgiving, Master of [Whom we praise for His] wonders, the Selector of song-hymns, King, Almighty, Life of [all] the worlds. 
<small><i>The following Psalm (130) is said responsively:</i><br></small>
<small>In this Psalm, the Jewish soul sings of the Jewish spirit ascending from the depths of the deepest misery of all, the burden of sin and guilt.</small>
<b>A Song of Ascents.</b> Out of the depths I have called to You, Adonoy. My Master, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If You God should take account of iniquities, my Master, who could survive? For with You is forgiveness, in order that You be feared. I hope for Adonoy, my soul hopes; and for His word, I wait. My soul [waits] for my Master more than the watchman [waits] for the morning, [more than] the watchman [waits] for the morning. Wait, Yisrael, upon Adonoy, for with Adonoy there is loving-kindness, and with Him there is much redemption. And He will redeem Yisrael from all its iniquities. 
<small><i>The Half-Kaddish is recited by the Chazzan</i><br></small>
<small>Here, as elsewhere in the Liturgy, the Half-Kaddish marks the end of a distinct section of the prayers, in this case, the Pesukei Dezimrah.</small>
<small>It is called the Half-Kaddish, the final three verses of the complete Kaddish having been omitted.</small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. 
<small>It has become a universally accepted custom to recite Barechu before proceeding to the blessings of Shema. Barechu, like Kaddish and Kedushah, cannot be recited unless a quorum—a minyan of ten adult males—is present. Barechu is also said by one who is called upon to read from the Torah.</small>
<small>The practice of saying Barechu is mentioned numerous times in the Talmud. It is even cited in the Mishnah (Maseches Berachos 49b) in the names of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael.</small>
<small><i>The Chazzan says:</i><br></small>
<b>Bless</b> Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small><i>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</i><br></small>
<b>Blessed</b> is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever. 
<small>The two blessings יוֹצֵר אוֹר “Former of light” and אַהֲבָה רַבָּה “[With] unbounded love,” are referred to as the blessings preceding Shema (Maseches Berachos 11a). According to Rambam they were formulated by Ezra and his Court (Laws of Shema 1:7).</small>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who opens for us the gates of mercy and enlightens the eyes of those who yearn for His pardon. Former<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Forming, יוצֵר, is the act of refining or modifying an original substance, whereas, creating, בּורֵא, refers to creating the original substance from nothing. For example, when one shapes a wooden table, to make it round, he “forms” the wood, the original substance which was “created.” Similarly, Hashem “forms the light” which is His act of modifying or limiting the darkness He created. —Siddur HaGra</i> of light Creator of darkness, Maker<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Making, עושֶׂה, is the act of completion, such as when one completes a table by painting it. Similarly, Hashem’s finishing touch of creation is “making peace,” the vessel that holds it all together, as stated in the Mishnah, “Hashem found no vessel to contain blessing other than peace.” לֹא מָצָא הקב"ה כְּלִי מַחְזִיק בְּרָכָה אֶלָא הַשָּׁלום— Siddur HaGra</i> of peace Creator<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Yeshaya (45:7) on which this blessing is based concludes with the words, “and creates evil.” In His original creation Hashem created the potential for evil, which He constantly limits and controls as the Former and Maker.—Siddur HaGra</i> of all things.

After seven years, the owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchos told him, “Come I will show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” Hashem does the same with the good and righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive his reward, Hashem returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated dividends.

<small>In the second of the blessings that precede Shema we praise God for His goodness in giving us His Torah, and pray for His help in the study of Torah. None of our petitions for the material goods of life approaches the fervor of this prayer for knowledge of the Torah and steadfastness in obeying it.</small>
<b>[With]</b> unbounded love You have loved us<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The Kuzari writes, “When reciting the blessing ‘Unbounded Love’ אַהֲבָה רַבָּה, one should bear in mind that Hashem’s Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of Hashem’s will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called love.”</i> Adonoy, our God; [With] great and abundant pity<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem bestowed His great and abundant pity on us after we sinned in making the golden calf.

Our Father, our King! for the sake of our forefathers who trusted in You, and whom You taught statutes of life, so too, be gracious to us and teach us.

Recitation of Shema

<small>The recitation of Shema was part of the daily worship in the Holy Temple, and our Sages ordained that it be recited in the synagogue service, providing it a central place in the morning and evening prayers of each Jew. Its importance may be judged from the fact that the very first Mishnah in the Oral Torah opens with the question, “From what time may the evening Shema be read?”</small>
<small>In reading Shema, bear in mind that you are performing a Scriptural commandment. All three paragraphs should be read with kavanah, concentrated intention, on what you are saying. The entire Shema should be recited in awe and reverence as it proclaims the existence and unity of God; the Jews' complete dedication to God and His commandments; the belief in Divine justice; the remembrance of the Exodus and the selection of the Jews as God's Chosen People. These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָל֯־לְ֯בָבְךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, and the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.</small>
<small><i>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</i><br></small>
(Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Yisrael:</b> Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שְׁמַע and last letter of אֶחָד are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עֵד “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to Hashem’s unity. —Avudraham<br>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on Hashem’s unity. The last word, אֶחָד “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that Hashem, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Yisrael, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i> 
<small><i>The following three lines are to be said aloud</i><br></small>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Yisrael” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Yaakov said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moshe did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Yaakov ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a.<br>When Moshe went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise Hashem by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם aloud.—Midrash Rabba to Devorim</i>

I have loved Hashem with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.</i> and with all your possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to Hashem and to Torah might entail.</i> And these words which I command you today,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The teachings of the Torah should be ever fresh in your minds, as though you received it today.—Ibid.</i> shall be upon your heart.

You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. 
<b>And so,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The word וּבְכֵן, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i></b> grant<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The word תֵּן implies מַתָּנָה, a gift.

It will then be apparent to all that Yisrael alone carried the yoke of Hashem’s Kingdom throughout the bitter years of exile, giving Him obedience despite its suffering and persecution and the taunts of those who cynically asked, “Where is Your God?” (Etz Yosef).</i> praise to those who fear You,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Those who fear Hashem will then be praiseworthy in the eyes of all men.</i> good hope to those who seek You<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Those who seek Hashem and search for ways to serve Him will no longer be considered ridiculous.</i> confident speech to those who yearn for You,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Those who wait upon Him will no longer be subdued but will voice their convictions freely.</i> joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Tehillim 132:17. The climax of this spiritual renaissance will be the restoration of our people to our land under the scepter of the Moshiach, descendant of Dovid, the anointed of Hashem.</i> 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The entire universe was created for the sake of Yisrael in order that Hashem’s Divine Influence be attached to it. This essence (Yisrael) was created for the sake of an even more treasured essence, namely the prophets and the pious among them. This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashanah—Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).</i> and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One.

<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, forgive our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement. Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Were it not for the intervention of the wondrous power of Hashem’s grace, our moral and physical entity would have long ceased, as a consequence of our transgressions. This would have been our fate in accordance with the law of cause and effect which functions in Hashem’s world according to His will. It is only Hashem Himself, He Who originally ordained that law, Who in the omnipotence of His will, can also suspend that law. Only He can cause the wrong which was done to become as if it had never occurred. Only Hashem can uproot in its entirety the sin and consequential effect of sin. He has assured this wondrous power of His benevolent grace to every Jew who fulfills the true purpose of Yom Kippur by doing teshuva, true repentance. Thus we cry out to Him “Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes” for in the words of the prophet, Hashem alone blots out our transgressions.</i> from before Your eyes, as it is said: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake;<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Were Hashem to destroy us because of our transgressions, His Name would be desecrated among the nations of the world. Thus says the prophet, He blots out our transgressions for His own sake.—Metsudas Dovid<br>According to Malbim, “for My own sake” implies for the sake of the favor and lovingkindness which is His attribute (כִּי חָפֵץ חֶסֶד אָנִי).</i> and your sins, I will not recall.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshaya 42:25. This implies that our sins will be blotted out so thoroughly that not even the slightest trace will remain. Thus says Hashem, “and your sins, I will not recall” because there will be nothing left to recall.—Metsudas Dovid</i> And it is said, “I have swept away like a thick cloud<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The word פְּשָׁעֶיךָ, your transgressions, which implies a wanton disregard of Hashem’s will is compared to an עָב, a thick cloud.

So too, our sins do not create such severe blackness in our lives.—Malbim</i> your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshaya 44:22</i> And it is said, “For on this day He will make atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy, you will be cleansed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In our translation, the words, מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם are joined with the words לִפְנֵי ה' תִּטְהָרוּ, thus reading “from all your sins before Adonoy, you will be cleansed”; implying that the entire sentence is a statement of fact, i.e., that Yom Kippur is a day in which Hashem atones our sins. According to Targum Yonassan ben Uziel, however, the words מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם are joined to the previous words—לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם—changing the entire concept of the sentence. According to the Targum the sentence reads: כִּי בַיּוֹם הַזֶה יְכַפֵּר עֲלֵיכֶם לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם. “For on this day He will make atonement for you to cleanse you from all your sins”; and thus the final three words of the sentence לִפְנֵי ה' תִּטְהָרוּ represent a command to cleanse ourselves before Him, as the Targum says: וְאַתּוּן קָדָם ה' תּוֹדוּן סוּרְחָנוּתְכוֹן וְתִדְכּוּן “And you—confess your wrongdoings before Hashem, and then you will be cleansed.” Klei Yakar, obviously influenced by Targum explicitly states that this sentence is not a blanket promise of atonement, for Yom Kippur atones only for those who cleanse themselves with honest repentance.</i>

<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
<b>Be pleased,</b> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Yisrael and their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Yisrael; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Yisrael. And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon. 
<small><i>At the words, We are thankful, bend forward; at Adonoy return to an upright position.</i><br></small>
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<b>We</b> are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</i><br></small>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise. 
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. In the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. <br><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah.</i><br> Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>(others conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace.) 
May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 
You know the mysteries of the universe, and the hidden secrets of every individual. You search all our innermost thoughts, and probe our mind and heart. There is nothing hidden from You, and there is nothing concealed from Your sight. 
And so may it be Your will Adonoy our God and God of our fathers, that You pardon us for all our careless sins, and that You forgive us for all our deliberate sins, and that You grant us atonement for all our rebellious sins: 
For the sin we committed before You under compulsion<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Even a sin committed under duress needs to be forgiven, because many times a person allows himself to be placed in a predicament in which he is compelled to sin (e.g., leaving the office at a very late hour on the eve of Shabbos or Festival).—Siddur HaGra</i> and willingly.

For [transgressing] positive commandments, and for [transgressing] prohibitive commandments, whether the prohibition can be corrected by a specifically prescribed act,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">For example returning the stolen money would be a corrective measure for the prohibition of stealing.</i> or whether it cannot be corrected by a specifically prescribed act, for those of which we are aware and for those of which we are not aware. For those of which we are aware, we have already declared before You and confessed them unto You; and for those of which we are not aware, before You they are revealed and known, as it is said, “The hidden things belong to Adonoy, our God, but the revealed things are for us and for our children forever, that we might fulfill all the words of this Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 29:28.</i> For You are the Pardoner of Yisrael, and the Forgiver of the tribes of Yeshurun in every generation, and beside You, we have no King Who forgives and pardons—only You! 
God, before I was formed, I was unworthy [to be created]. And now that I have been formed, it is as if I had not been formed. I am like dust while I live, how much more so when I am dead. Here I am before You like a vessel filled with shame. May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, that I shall sin no more, and the sins I have committed before You, cleanse them in Your abundant mercies; but not through suffering and severe illness. 
My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein. 
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Yehudah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years.

<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Avraham, God of Yitzchak, and God of Yaakov, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children's children, for the sake of His Name, with love. 
Invoking the doctrines of our wise and understanding Sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Chazzan requests permission to interrupt the blessings of Shemoneh Esreh with the insertion of the piyyutim, declaring that the custom to do so is based on the teaching of our Sages.</i> and with the teachings [acquired] from their perceptive intuition, I open my mouth in prayer and supplication to plead and seek favor before the presence of the King, Forgiver and Pardoner of iniquities. 
I bear Your awe as I set forth my plea, in the service of Your people, I bend my knees. You [Who] took me out of the womb, brighten my darkness; let me speak clearly, and lead me in Your truth. Teach me to pour forth sweet meditation, and shelter me in Your shadow; bring me near to You. My cry comes forth with deep concentration; I seek Your Presence; and may Your righteousness be near. [God], Pure of sight and greatly exalted, grant me understanding to set forth my prayer, properly to entreat You—without fault, to find healing relief for those who sent me. The opening [words] of my lips, purify and set straight. [With] the offerings of my mouth, be pleased, and make them worthy; may the order of my prayer, be pleasing as a sacrifice, may my plea be [welcome] as raindrops. Direct my steps that my speech not falter, [my] Rock, support my steps from falling; uphold and strengthen me from weakness and exhaustion, be pleased with my words and let me not stumble. Preserve me as the apple of Your eye, [keep me] from trembling and terror; regard my low state and come [be my] deliverance. Be gracious to me for my spirit is broken, as You spoke to Your prophet, have compassion on the son You strengthened.

Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God. 
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Avraham. 
<b>DIVINE MIGHT</b> 
You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the Powerful One to deliver us. Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth. 
 
Until the day of his death, You wait for him to repent; that he may turn to the way of righteousness, and be worthy of [immortal] life. 
¿Cómo puede el hombre ser meritorio ante Ti, pues aún Tus huestes angelicales no logran Tu beneplácito? Cuando los árboles lozanos son presa de llamas, ¿qué podrá hacer el heno fenecido? Tu omnisciencia todo devela, Tu luz ilumina todo lo tenebroso. Tu morada es objeto de misterio, mas Tú develas nuestros más ocultos designios. Sólo Tú eres juez Único, Tu voluntad es única, ¿quién osaría contrariarla? Tú sometes a pueblos e individuos a Tu justicia, ¿quién podría impugnar Tu justicia? Tenga presente todo ser esta enseñanza, para que su corazón no se desvíe en pos de sus instintos para que no erre ante su Creador: ¿De dónde procede, cuál es su origen? ¿Hacia dónde va? ¡Ante Dios su creador tendrá que rendir cuentas! ¿Cuál es el sentido de su vida? Sus días carecen de sentido, sus noches no tienen significado. ¡Todos sus proyectos vanidad! Cual sueño fugaz es su vida, cual pesadilla que con constancia lo atormenta. De noche no encuentra quietud, de día no reposa, y así transcurre su vida hasta que desciende al sepulcro. Mas ¿por qué habrá de quejarse el hombre mientras vive? La vida debería bastarle. Pues aunque su tarea es ardua, e ímproba su labor, feliz el hombre que se entrega a la ley y a la verdad. Su mismo fin testifica su origen ¿por qué habrá de vivir en ficción? Él mismo rubrica sus actos, ¿cómo podrá disimularlos? Únicamente sus buenas acciones lo conducirán hasta su eterna morada. Si la sabiduría él ha buscado, ella lo acompañará hasta el fin de sus días. Mas si el engaño y la perfidia él ha sembrado, su vida él ha condenado. Mas una vida de virtud, proporciona una vejez lozana y próspera. 
Hasta sus últimos días, Tú esperas el retorno del pecador, pues Tú quieres brindarle la vida.
Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy. 
And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.

<small>Piut compuesto por Meshulam Ben Kalonymus. Siglo X.</small><br>Atribuid a Dios el poder. ¡Su gloria resplandece sobre Israel!
Él reveló a Israel Su verdad, Les concedió Su bendición, les manifestó Su gloria. Él reveló a Israel Su verbo, Les manifestó Su resplandor, ellos son Sus testigos. Él recuerda a Israel, Su misericordia los ampara. Su pureza canta Israel, Su rectitud Él les develó. Israel es Su pueblo,·Su heredad. Su Reino, Su Congregación amada. Israel es Su elegido, Su asamblea a Él consagrada, Israel es testigo de Su obra, de Su justicia. Israel proclama Su Santidad, Su magnificencia. Israel percibe Su Divinidad, Su gloria.




Por eso proclamamos todos: “Ningún poder se iguala a Ti, Adonai, Ninguna obra s.e asemeja a Tu creación”. 
Nadie se iguala a Ti, ni en los cielos, ni en la tierra. Nadie Te iguala en las huestes angelicales, Nadie emula Tus obras entre los pobladores del Universo. Nadie se asemeja a Ti, en las multitudes celestiales, Nadie se asemeja a Ti, en las congregaciones terrenales. Nadie, aún en los cielos, iguala Tu pureza, Nadie en la tierra emula Tu poder. Nadie entre los ángeles Te iguala, Nadie entre Tus amados en la tierra iguala Tu grandeza. 
¡Glorifiquemos pues, al Eterno! A Ti pertenecen, oh Eterno:

Mighty One, our Mighty One, Adonoy, our Master, How mighty is Your Name throughout the earth. And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One, and His Name One. 
And in Your holy words it is written:
<small><i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats</i><br></small>
“Adonoy will reign forever; your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations; praise God.” 
<small><i>The Chazzan concludes</i><br></small>
From generation to generation we will declare Your greatness, and to all eternity we will sanctify Your holiness; and Your praise, our God will not depart from our mouth forever and ever; because You are the Almighty Who is King, Great and Holy! 
<b>Have</b> compassion upon Your works, and rejoice in Your works; and let those who trust in You say— when You justify those borne by You— “Be sanctified, [our] Master over all Your works.” For those who sanctify You are themselves hallowed in Your holiness; becoming to the Holy One is the glory of those who are holy. 
<b>When</b> there is no one to plead [our] righteousness against the testimony of the accuser, speak on behalf of Yaakov regarding the statute and law, and make us righteous with justice, [You, Who are the] King of justice. 
<b>It</b> will yet be remembered in our behalf,— the love of Avraham,— by our Master; and for the sake of the son [Yitzchak] who let himself be bound on the altar, he will put an end to our struggle; and in the merit of the perfect one [Yaakov], the Revered One will bring forth our judgment to a righteous conclusion; for this day is holy to our Master. 
<b>And thus</b> may Your Name be hallowed Adonoy, our God, over Yisrael, Your people, over Yerushalayim, Your city, over Tziyon, the dwelling place of Your glory, over the kingship of the House of Dovid, Your anointed, and over Your [holy] Dwelling, and Your Sanctuary. 


































You alone will be exalted, and reign over all in unity; as it is said by the hand of Your prophet, “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One. 
<b>And so,</b> grant that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works, and Your dread upon all You have created; and [then] all [Your] works will fear You, and prostrate before You will be all [Your] created beings. And may they all form a single band to do Your will with a perfect heart. For we know Adonoy, our God that rulership is Yours, strength is in Your hand, might is in Your right hand and Your Name is awesome over all You have created. 
<b>And so,</b> grant honor, Adonoy, to Your people, praise to those who fear You, good hope to those who seek You confident speech to those who yearn for You, joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days. 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice, and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 

Sanctification of the Day

<b>You</b> chose us from [among] all the peoples; You loved us and took pleasure in us; You exalted us above all tongues, and You sanctified us with Your commandments; You drew us near, our King, to Your servitude and Your great and Holy Name, You have pronounced upon us. 
<b>And</b> You gave us Adonoy, our God, in love, 
<small><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br></small>
(this Shabbos Day and)
this Day of Atonement, for forgiveness, pardon and atonement, and to forgive thereon all our iniquities; 
<small><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br></small>
(with love)
a day of holy assembly commemorating the exodus from Mitzrayim. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of Dovid, Your servant; the remembrance of Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Yisrael, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for life and peace on this Day of Atonement. Remember us Adonoy, our God on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty, Who is King, Gracious and Merciful. 
<b>Remember</b> Your mercies, Adonoy and Your kindnesses, for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your compassion come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Tziyon where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Yerushalayim, the love of Tziyon, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Yerushalayim, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Tziyon, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Avraham, Yitzchak, Yisrael, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin 
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan</i><br></small>
Do not, we beseech You place upon us the sin, wherein we have acted foolishly and sinned. We have sinned, our Rock; Pardon us our Creator. 


















Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Yaakov, and also my covenant with Yitzchak, and also my covenant with Avraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember. 
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Mitzrayim, in the sight of the nations; to be their God, I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Atone our sins on this day, and cleanse us, as it is written: “For on this day He will make atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins before Adonoy you will be cleansed.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.” 
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i><br></small>
<b>Hear</b> our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May the words of our mouths be acceptable — and the thoughts of our hearts—before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us. Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God, be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For You, Adonoy, do we wait, You will answer us, our Master, our God. 
<small><i>The Ark is closed.</i><br></small>
Our God and God of our fathers! Do not forsake us, do not cast us off, and do not disgrace us; and do not nullify Your covenant with us. Draw us near to Your Torah, teach us Your commandments, direct us to Your ways. Incline our hearts to fear Your Name, and open our hearts to Your love, and may we return to You in truth, and with a perfect heart. And for the sake of Your great Name, forgive and pardon our iniquity, as it is written in the words of Your holiness, “For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon my iniquity for it is great.” 
Our God, and God of our fathers! Pardon us, forgive us, atone for us. 
<small><i>Chazzan and congregation responsively:</i><br></small>
For we are Your people; and You are our God. We are Your children; and You are our Father. We are Your servants; and You are our Master. We are Your congregation; and You are our Portion. We are Your inheritance; and You are our Destiny. We are Your flock; and You are our Shepherd. We are Your vineyard; and You are our Keeper. We are Your work; and You are our Creator. We are Your dear ones and You are our Beloved. We are Your treasure; and You are our God. We are Your people; and You are our King. We are Your distinguished ones; and You are our Distinction. 
We are brazen-faced; and You are merciful and gracious. We are stiff-necked; and You are slow to anger. We are full of iniquity; and You are full of compassion. Our days are like a passing shadow; and You are the same and Your years will not end. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.” 
Our God, and God of our fathers! Forgive and pardon our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos say:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement, and permit Yourself to be petitioned by our prayer. Blot out and remove our transgressions from before Your eyes, and compel our Evil Inclination to be subservient to You, and subdue our stubborness, that we may return to You in truth; and renew our conscience that we may preserve Your precepts. Open our hearts that we may love and fear Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, Your God will open Your heart, and the heart of your descendants to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.” 
Our intentional and our unintentional sins— You recognize— [those committed] willfully or by compulsion, [those committed] openly or secretly— before Your Presence, they are [all] revealed and known. What are we? What is our life? What are our acts of kindness? What is our righteousness? What is our deliverance? What is our strength? What is our might? What can we say before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nothing before You? Famous men as though they had never been? The wise as if they were without knowledge? And men of understanding as if they were devoid of intelligence? For most of their actions are a waste and the days of their life are trivial in Your presence. The superiority of man over beast is nil for all is futile. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 

<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan</i><br></small>
Your Name was always the “forbearer of transgression,” give ear to our plea as we stand before You in prayer. Forbear the transgression of a people who repent [their] transgression; blot out our transgression from before Your eyes. 
You know the mysteries of the universe, and the hidden secrets of every individual. You search all our innermost thoughts, and probe our mind and heart. There is nothing hidden from You, and there is nothing concealed from Your sight. And so may it be Your will Adonoy our God and God of our fathers, that You pardon us for all our careless sins, and that You forgive us for all our deliberate sins, and that You grant us atonement for all our rebellious sins:

For [transgressing] positive commandments, and for [transgressing] prohibitive commandments, whether the prohibition can be corrected by a specifically prescribed act, or whether it cannot be corrected by a specifically prescribed act, for those of which we are aware and for those of which we are not aware. For those of which we are aware, we have already declared before You and confessed them unto You; and for those of which we are not aware, before You they are revealed and known, as it is said, “The hidden things belong to Adonoy, our God, but the revealed things are for us and for our children forever, that we might fulfill all the words of this Torah.” 
And You, Merciful One, accept the penitent. Concerning repentance, You promised us from the very beginning; and because of our repentance our eyes look hopefully to You. Dovid, Your servant, said before You, “Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” 
No temas, oh Jacob, retornad de vuestra rebeldía; retorna, oh Israel. Pues he aquí que no duerme ni dormita el guardián de Israel. Así dijo Tu profeta: Retorna, oh Israel, a Adonai tu Dios, pues has tropezado por tus errores. Proveéos de palabras, y volved a Adonai. Decidle: “Perdona nuestros delitos y acepta el bien. Te ofreceremos las palabras de nuestros labios a modo de ofrenda”. Tú eres clemente, oh Dios, aceptas el arrepentimiento de los que retornan a Ti. Tú nos aseguraste aceptar nuestro arrepentimiento, pues por eso depositamos nuestra esperanza en el arrepentimiento que Tú estableciste. Es por Tu amor Adonai, Dios nuestro, que conferiste a Tu pueblo Israel, y por la compasión que otorgaste a todos Tus hijos, que nos concediste Adonai, Dios nuestro este Día (de Shabat para santidad y quietud y este día) del Perdón, para absolver todos nuestros errores y culpas. 








¿Quién Te iguala, oh Dios? Quiero elevar mis preces y loarte, protector de Abraham. En Tus manos está nuestra vida, Tú concedes la vida eterna. Oh Rey Santo, humildemente yo inquiero Tu grandeza. Tú amas la sabiduría y el conocimiento, Tú nos dotas de sapiencia. Tú nos llamas diciendo: Retornad. Tú aceptas nuestro arrepentimiento; Tú prodigas el perdón, concedes la absolución. Te dirigimos cánticos y agradecimientos, cuán bueno es elevarte loores. Oh Altísimo, bendice a Tu pueblo, a Tus multitudes. Pues así está dicho en Tu Torá: “Adonai te bendiga”. Tu presencia es la paz, Tú eres hacedor de la paz. Derrama Tu bendición sobre Tus fieles así todos oraremos al unísono y diremos: ¿Quién Te iguala, oh Dios? Perdona, oh Dios, a Tu pueblo, acepta su arrepentimiento. 
Pues así dijo Tu profeta: “¿Quién te iguala, oh Dios?” Tú perdonas la iniquidad y omites la rebeldía del remanente de Tu pueblo. Su ira es efímera, pues Él ama la misericordia. Él volverá a tener piedad de nosotros, hollará nuestras iniquidades. Y arrojará a las profundidades del mar todos nuestros pecados. Todos los errores de Tu pueblo Israel, habrás de arrojar a lugar remoto y recóndito para que sean olvidados para siempre. “Concederás Tu verdad a Jacob, Tu merced a Abraham. Así lo prometiste a nuestros padres en días pretéritos.” 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, forgive our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement. Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes, as it is said: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” And it is said, “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.” And it is said, “For on this day He will make atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy, you will be cleansed.” 
<i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (Our God and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest) Sanctify us with Your commandments and give us our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (And give us as our inheritance Adonoy our God with love and with pleasure Your holy Sabbath; and may Yisrael rest thereon— [they who are] sanctifiers of Your Name) and purify our hearts to serve You in truth, For You are the Pardoner of Yisrael, and the Forgiver of the tribes of Yeshurun in every generation, and beside You, we have no king who forgives and pardons, only You! Blessed are You, King Who forgives and pardons our iniquities, and the iniquities of His people, the House of Yisrael; and Who removes our trespasses each year; King over the whole earth, Sanctifier <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (of the Shabbos and) of Yisrael and the Day of Atonement. 

Avodah

<b>Be pleased,</b> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Yisrael and their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Yisrael; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Yisrael. And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon. 
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<b>We</b> are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<small><i>When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon,” the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.</i><br></small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and Holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be Your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. Our Father, our King! remember Your mercies, and suppress Your anger, and remove pestilence, sword, famine, captivity, destruction, iniquity, plague, misfortune, every disease, every stumbling-block, every contention, every type of disorder; every evil decree and groundless hatred, from us, and from all the children of Your covenant. Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant. And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise. 
<b>Priestly Blessings</b> Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing, of the Torah written by the hand of Moshe, Your servant, pronounced from the mouth of Aharon and his sons, the kohanim, Your holy people; as it is said: Adonoy bless you and guard you. Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you. Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace. 
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
<b>Grant peace,</b> goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. 
<b>In the book</b> of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>(others conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace.) 

Avinu Malkenu

<small>This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (Taanis 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered. Rabbi Akiva stepped down after him and exclaimed, “Our Father, our King, we have no king except You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake have mercy on us,” and rain fell. This prayer is not recited on the Sabbath.</small>
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i><br></small>
Our Father, our King!<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as Hashem’s slaves (Vayikra 25:42), and as His children (Devorim 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King. Contrary to the view that Hashem the Father is so full of love for His children that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that Hashem the King must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire.

On Monday: 
Today is the second day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: A song, a psalm by the sons of Korach. Adonoy is great and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Beautiful in its panoramic vista, the joy of all the earth is Mount Tziyon, on the northern extremities (of Yerushalayim); the city of the great King. God, in its palaces, has become known as a Stronghold. For behold, the kings assembled, they passed by together. They saw and were astounded, they panicked and fled in haste. Trembling siezed them there, like the pangs of a woman in labor. With an east wind You smashed the ships of Tarshish. As we heard, so we saw in the city of Adonoy of Hosts, in the city of our God; may God establish it for eternity, Selah. We hoped, God, for Your lovingkindness in the midst of Your Sanctuary. As Your Name, God, so is Your praise— to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness. Let Mount Tziyon rejoice, let the daughters of Yehudah exult, because of Your judgments. Rally around Tziyon and encircle her, count her towers. Consider well her ramparts, raise high her citadels, that you may recount it to future generations. That this is God, our God forever and ever, He will lead us like children. 
On Wednesday: 
Today is the fourth day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy, Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself. Arise Judge of the earth, repay the arrogant their just reward. How long shall the wicked— Adonoy— how long shall the wicked exult? They express, they speak with arrogance; all the evildoers are boastful. Adonoy, they crush Your people and Your heritage they oppress. The widow and stranger they kill, and orphans they murder. And they say, “God does not see, the God of Yaakov is not concerned.” Consider, [you] stupid [ones] among the people,— and you fools when will you become wise? He Who implanted the ear, does He not hear? He Who formed the eye, does He not see? He Who chastises nations, does He not reprove— He that teaches man knowledge? Adonoy knows the thoughts of men, that they are vanity. Fortunate is the man whom You chastise, God, and whom You instruct from Your Torah. To grant him tranquility from days of evil, until the pit is dug for the wicked. for Adonoy will not abandon His people and His inheritance, He will not forsake. For justice shall return unto righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it. Who will rise up for me against the wicked, who will stand up for me against the evildoers? Had Adonoy not been my help, in an instant my soul would have dwelt in the silent grave If [Whenever] I said, my foot has slipped, Your kindliness, Adonoy upheld me. When (worrisome) thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations soothe my soul. Can a tribunal of evil have accord with You— [a tribunal] that makes iniquity into law? They gang up against the life of the righteous, and blood of the innocent they condemn. Adonoy has been my stronghold, my God the Rock of my refuge. He turns their violence against them, and with their own wickedness, destroys them; Adonoy, my God, destroys them. Come let us sing to Adonoy; let us shout for joy to the Rock of our Deliverance. Let us greet Him with thanksgiving; with song let us shout for joy to Him. for a great Almighty is Adonoy; a great King over all godlike beings. 
On Thursday: 
Today is the fifth day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: To Him Who grants victory— upon the Gittis, a psalm of Assaf: Sing joyously to God, our strength, shout for joy to the God of Yaakov. Take up the hymn, sound the drum, the pleasant harp and the lute. Blow the shofar on the Rosh Chodesh, at the appointed time for our festive day. For it is a statute for Yisrael, a [day of] judgement of the God of Yaakov. As a testimony for Yehosef, He ordained it when he went out over the land of Mitzrayim, [where] an unfamiliar language I heard. From the burden, I removed his shoulder, his hands were removed from the cauldron. In distress you called out, and I released you, I answered you [though you called] in secret [I answered you] thunderously; I tested you at the waters of Merivah. Selah. Hear, My people, I will testify about you, Yisrael, if you would just listen to Me. Let no strange god be within you, nor bow before a foreign god. I am Adonoy, your God, Who brought you up from the land of Mitzrayim, open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. But My people did not heed My voice, and Yisrael did not want Me. So I sent them to follow their heart's desires, let them follow their own devices. If only My people would heed Me, if Yisrael would walk in My ways. I would immediately subdue their enemies, and turn My hand against their tormentors. Those who cause hate of Adonoy deceive [pretend obedience to] Him, but their time (of punishment) will be forever. But He would feed him (Yisrael) from the cream of the wheat, and from the rock, I would sate you with honey. 
On Shabbos: 
Today is the holy Shabbos on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: A psalm, a song for the Shabbos day. It is good to thank Adonoy, and sing praise to Your Name, Most High. To relate Your kindliness in the morning, and Your faithfulness in the nights. Upon a ten-stringed instrument and lute, in meditation upon the harp. For You have given me joy, Adonoy, with Your deeds, at the work of Your hands I sing joyously. How great are Your works, Adonoy; how infinitely profound are Your thoughts. An empty-headed man cannot know, nor does a fool understand this: When the wicked bloom like grass, and all the evildoers blossom— it is so that they may be destroyed forever. But You will remain on high forever, Adonoy, For behold, Your enemies, Adonoy; behold, Your enemies shall perish; dispersed shall be all evildoers. You uplifted my horn like that of a unicorn; I am saturated with fresh oil. My eye has seen [the defeat of] those who spy on me; of the wicked who rise against me, my ears have heard [that they are doomed]. The righteous will blossom like a date palm, like a cedar in Lebanon, he will grow tall. Planted in the House of Adonoy, in the Courtyards of our God they will blossom. They will still be fruitful in old age; they will be full of sap and freshness. To declare that Adonoy is upright; He is my Stronghold; in Whom there is no injustice.
<small>The following Psalm (27) voices our prayer that God will be our light on Rosh Hashana enabling us to repel the darkness of sin through true repentance, and that He will be our salvation on Yom Kippur, through His compassionate atonement of our sins.</small>
By Dovid: Adonoy is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? Adonoy is the strength<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Rav S.R. Hirsch translates, “Adonoy is the source of my life’s strength,” thus Dovid declares that Hashem is the fount from which his life derives its power to resist all foes.</i> of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?

For He will hide me in His Tabernacle<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The Vilna Gaon comments that the commandment of Succos is implied in this verse and the next.</i> on the day of distress, He will conceal me in the shelter of His Tent, upon a rock He will lift me.

Adonoy, hear my voice<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">This verse alludes to Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. “Hear my voice,” refers to Rosh Hashana when we sound the shofar.

Of You, my heart has said, “Seek My Presence”; Your Presence, Adonoy I will seek. Conceal not Your Presence from me, do not turn away Your servant in anger.

Altough my father and mother abandon<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Even if I were so depraved that my own mother and father would abandon me to my own devices, Hashem would still gather me up and believe in my ability to mend my ways.—S.R.

Adonoy, teach me Your way, and lead me in the path of uprightness, because of my watchful foes.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">His enemies.

<small>The following prayer is taken from the Zohar (Parshas Vayakhail), the basic text of Kabbalah which was written by the Mishnahic sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The Zohar states, “When the Torah is taken out to be read before the congregation, the heavenly gates of mercy are opened, and the Divine love is aroused; therefore one should say the following prayer.</small>
<b>Blessed</b> is the Name of the Master of the Universe. Blessed is Your crown and Your place. May Your good will [be] with Your people Yisrael forever.

Let me be counted among the righteous, so that You will have compassion on me and protect me and all that is mine, and all that belongs to Your people, Yisrael. You are He Who nourishes all and maintains all; You are He Who rules over all; You are He Who rules over kings, and the kingdom is Yours. I am a servant of the Holy One, blessed is He, I bow before Him and before the honor of His Torah at all times. Not in man do I put my trust, nor do I rely on any angel; but only in the God of heaven Who is the true God, Whose Torah is truth, Whose prophets are true, and Who performs many deeds of goodness and truth. In Him I put my trust and to His holy, honored Name I utter praises. May it be Your will to open my heart to Torah, and to fulfill the desires of my heart and of the heart of Your people Yisrael for goodness, for life, and for peace.

Reading for Yom Kippur Morning

<small>Vayikra 16:1-34</small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moshe after the death of Aharon's two sons, who brought an [unauthorized] offering before Adonoy and died. And Adonoy spoke to Moshe: speak to your brother Aharon that he should not enter at all times the [inner] Sanctuary that is beyond the curtain, before the Ark-cover, which is on the Ark, so that he may not die, for in the cloud, I appear over the Ark-covering. When Aharon enters this inner Sanctuary, it must be with a young bullock for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering. He must put on a sanctified, white linen tunic; and have linen pants on his body; and with a linen sash, he must gird himself, and with a linen turban, he must cover his head. These are sacred vestments, and [therefore], he must immerse himself in a mikveh before putting them on. And from the congregation of the children of Yisrael, he shall take two he-goats for sin-offerings, and one ram for a burnt-offering. And Aharon shall [begin by] presenting his own bullock for a sin-offering, and make atonement<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Atonement was made by confessing his sins, and the sins of his household.—Rashi</i> for himself and his household.
He shall then take the two he-goats and stand them before Adonoy, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. And Aharon shall place lots on the two he-goats, one lot [marked] “for Adonoy” and one lot [marked] “for Azazel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Azazel denotes a hard, rocky cliff from which the goat was pushed off to its death.—Rashi</i> And Aharon shall present the goat that has the lot “for Adonoy,” which he will [later] prepare as a sin-offering. And the goat that has the lot “for Azazel” shall remain alive before Adonoy, for [Aharon to make] atonement on it and send it to Azazel in the desert. And Aharon shall present his bullock for a sin-offering and make atonement for himself and for his [priestly-family] household,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This second confession was for himself and his fellow priests.—Rashi</i> and he shall then slaughter his bullock as a sin-offering.
And he shall take a fire pan full of burning coals from the [western] side of the [outer] Altar which is toward Adonoy, and a double handful of finely pulverized sweet incense, and bring them into the [inner Sanctuary] within the curtain. And he shall place the incense on the fire, before Adonoy, so that the smoke from the incense covers the Ark-cover that is upon the [tablets of] testimony, and [then] he will not die. And he shall take of the blood of the bullock and with his forefinger, sprinkle it [once] above the east side of the Ark-cover; and [then] directly toward the Ark-cover, he shall sprinkle the blood seven times with his forefinger. And then he shall slaughter the goat of the sin-offering that is for the people,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the goat chosen by lot “for Adonoy.”—Rashi</i> and bring its blood [into the inner Sanctuary] within the curtain and he shall do the same with this blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and he shall sprinkle it above the Ark-cover and directly toward the Ark-cover. And he shall make atonement on the holy [Ark] for the defilement<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to defilement caused by those who entered the Sanctuary in an unclean state. —Rashi</i> of the children of Yisrael and for their transgressions and all their sins; and so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting that dwells with them in the midst of their uncleanliness. No one else shall be in the Tent of Meeting from the time that he [Aharon] enters the Sanctuary to make atonement until he leaves; and thus shall he make atonement for himself, and for his household, and for the entire community of Yisrael.
He shall then go out to the Altar that is before Adonoy,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Golden Altar upon which the incense was burned.—Rashi</i> and make atonement on it; he shall [do so by] taking some of the blood of the bullock and of the goat, and placing the mitxure on the horns of the Altar, all around. He shall sprinkle the blood on it<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This blood was sprinkled on the top of the Altar itself.—Rashi</i> seven times with his forefinger; and thus he shall purify and sanctify<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">He shall purify it of the sins which occupied in the past and he shall sanctify it against sin in the future.—Rashi in the name of Sifrah.</i> it from any defilement on the part of the Children of Yisrael. When he finishes making atonement of the [inner] Sanctuary, of the Tent of Meeting and of the Altar, he shall present the live goat. And [then] Aharon shall lean both his hands on the head of the live goat, and he shall confess on it all the iniquities of the Children of Yisrael, and all their transgressions, all their sins; and he shall place them on the goat's head and send it to the desert with a man, specially designated [for this purpose]. The goat will thus carry all their iniquities to a desolate area, and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness. And Aharon shall then come into the Tent of Meeting and take off the white linen garments that he wore when he entered the [inner] Sanctuary; and he shall leave them there. And he shall immerse his body in a mikveh in the sanctified area and [then] he shall put on his [regular] vestments; and he shall go out and offer his own burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and he shall make atonement for himself and for the people.
And the fat of the sin-offering he shall burn upon the Altar. And the one who sends the goat to Azazel shall immerse his clothing and his body in a mikveh, and [only] then may he enter the camp. And the bullock and the goat presented as sin offerings, whose blood was brought into the [inner] Sanctuary to make atonement, shall be brought outside the camp; and they shall burn their skin, flesh, and entrails in fire. And the one who burns them shall immerse his clothing and his body in a mikveh, and he may then come back into the camp. This shall be an eternal statute for you; [each year] on the tenth day of the seventh month, you shall fast and not do any work, [this applies] to the native born and to the proselyte who joins you. For on this day He will make atonement for you to cleanse you; from all your sins before Adonoy, you will be cleansed.
It is a Sabbath of Sabbaths to you, and you must fast; it is an eternal statute. And the priest who is anointed and consecrated to be [the high] priest in his father's place, shall make this atonement, wearing the sacred linen vestments. And he shall make atonement for the holy [inner] Sanctuary, the Tent of Meeting and for the Altar; and for the priests and for all the people of the community he shall make atonement. And this shall be for you an eternal statute to achieve atonement for the Children of Yisrael for all their sins once each year; and he [Aharon] did<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">When the Day of Atonement arrived, he performed the services in the order proscribed by Hashem.</i> as Adonoy commanded Moshe.

Long life is at its right, at its left, riches and honor. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it. 

Maftir Reading from the Second Sefer Torah

<small>Bamidbar 29:7-11</small>
And on the tenth [day] of this seventh month, a day of holy assembly it shall be for you, and you shall fast; all manner of work you shall not do. And as a burnt-offering for a pleasing savor to Adonoy, you shall present one young bullock, one ram; seven male yearling lambs, without blemish, they shall be for you. And their meal-offerings of fine flour mixed with [olive] oil shall be three tenths [of an epha] for the bullock, two tenths [of an epha] for the ram. One tenth [of an epha] for each of the seven lambs. [There shall also be] one he-goat for a sin-offering; [these are all] in addition to the sin-offering of atonement, and the regular daily burnt-offering and their meal-offerings and libations.

Berachos for the Haftarah

<small>The Haftarah, a selected reading from the Prophets, usually contains some reference to the text or theme of the Sidrah, the Torah Reading, which precedes it. According to Avudraham, the recitation of the Haftarah, was instituted during the period of persecution preceding the revolt of the Maccabees, when the actual Torah reading was prohibited. Readings from the Prophets were then substituted in order to review some of the teachings contained in the Torah itself. The word הַפְטָרָה is derived from the root פטר, which means to discharge or conclude. By reading the Haftarah, we conclude the reading of the Torah.</small>
<small><i>Berachah recited before the reading of the Haftarah:</i><br></small>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who chose good prophets,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The true prophet must be genuinely tov “good” and a friend to all men both in his attitude and in his conduct. The heart of a true prophet in Yisrael must be capable of genuine rejoicing when individuals and mankind flourish, and of sincere sorrow when they go into decline.

According to the Sages אֵין שְׁנֵי נְבִיאִים מִתְנַבְּאִין בְּסִגְנו‍ֹן אֶחָד, each prophet has a style, peculiar to him alone, hence a prophet requires the gift of eloquence. Hashem chooses as His prophets only such men whose words are נֶאֱמָרִים בֶּאֱמֶת, spoken in truth.—S. R. Hirsch</i> which were spoken in truth. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who chooses the Torah and Moshe, His servant, and Yisrael, His people, and the prophets of truth and righteousness. 

Haftarah for Yom Kippur Morning

<small>Yeshaya 57:14-21, 58:1-14 </small>
And He said: Pave the way, clear the path, lift up the stumbling-blocks from the path of My people. For thus spoke the High and Lofty One, Who dwells in eternity, Whose Name is the Holy One: Though I dwell in the high and holy place, I am with the lowly and those of humble spirit; to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the hearts of the contrite. For I will not contend forever, nor forever shall I be wroth. For man's spirit that enwraps him is from Me; and the souls, I have made. I was angered by the sin of his greed (unjust gain) and I struck him; I concealed Myself from him and was wroth; yet still he went rebelliously after his heart's desires. I have seen his ways and healed him; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners. I will create a new speech (for him) and they shall say: “Peace, peace to the estranged (far off) and to the near, said Adonoy.” And I will heal him. But the wicked are like the stormy sea; it cannot rest and its waves cast up mire and mud. “There is no peace,” said my God, “for the wicked.” Cry out loud and do not refrain, raise your voice like the shofar and tell My people of their transgressions, and the House of Yaakov of their sins. Yet they seek Me daily and desire to know My ways; like a righteous nation who has not forsaken the law of their God; they ask Me about righteous laws, they desire to draw near to God. (They ask) Why do You not see when we fast; we afflict our souls and You do not notice? For on your fast day you seek business and oppress your labourers. You fast for strife and contention; to smite with a fist of wickedness; you do not fast this day to make your voices heard on high. Can this then be the fast that I have chosen—a day when man afflicts his soul, to bow down his head like a reed, to sit in sackcloth and ashes? Is this what you call a fast, an acceptable day to Adonoy? Behold, this is the fast that I have chosen—loosening the bonds of wickedness, undoing the straps of the yoke, sending the oppressed free and breaking every yoke (of tyranny). Break your bread with the hungry, and bring the impoverished into your home; clothe the naked when you see them and do not hide from your own flesh (relatives). Then will your light break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall come quickly; your righteousness will go before you and the Glory of Adonoy will gather you up. Then when you call out, Adonoy will answer; when you cry out, He shall say: “I am here.” If you remove from your midst the yokes, the stretching out of a finger and wrongful speech. If you reach out to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light shall shine forth in the darkness; and your deep darkness shall be as light as noon. Adonoy will always guide you and satisfy your soul from thirst and make strong your bones. And you shall be like a watered garden, and like a never failing spring of water. And from you shall they build up the old ruins; you shall raise up the foundations of generation after generation; and they shall call you: the repairer of the breach, the restorer of the path to dwell in. If you will keep back your foot because of Shabbos, and not pursue your business on My Holy Day, and if you will call Shabbos, a delight, holy to Adonoy and honoured, and honor it by refraining from doing your ways and pursuing your desires or speaking of them, Then shall you delight in Adonoy and I will set you on the high places of the earth and you shall enjoy the heritage of Yaakov, your father, for the mouth of Adonoy has spoken it.
<small><i>Berachos recited after the reading of the Haftarah:</i><br></small>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Rock of all the worlds, Righteous in all generations, the Almighty, the Faithful One, Who says and does, Who speaks and fulfills, for all His words are true and right. Dependable are You, Adonoy, our God, and dependable are Your words, and not one of Your words is ever retracted unfulfilled, for You are the Almighty, a King who is dependable and merciful.

Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your Kingship, they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His Kingship. Your Kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him, He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare and all flesh will bless His Holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now forever. Praise God. 
<small><i>The Chazzan takes the Torah and says:</i><br></small>
<b>They</b> will praise the Name of Adonoy for His Name alone is exalted.
<small><i>The congregation then says:</i><br></small>
His majesty is over the earth and the skies. He will raise the might of His people, [which is] praise for all His pious ones, for the Children of Yisrael, the people near to Him. Praise God. 
<small><i>On a weekday, continue:</i><br></small>
A Psalm of Dovid: the earth is Adonoy's and the fullness thereof, the inhabited world and those who dwell in it. For He founded it upon the seas, and established it upon rivers. Who may ascend the mountain of Adonoy, and who may stand in the place of His holiness? The clean of hands and the pure of heart, who has not borne My soul in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully. He will bear Adonoy's blessing and righteousness from the God of his deliverance. This is the generation of those who seek Him, the seekers of Your Presence, [God of] Yaakov, selah. Lift up your heads, gates, and be uplifted [you] entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is this King of Glory? Adonoy, strong and mighty; Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle. Lift up your heads, gates, and lift up, entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is He, this King of Glory? Adonoy Tzevaos, He is the King of Glory, selah. 
<small><i>Continue with “And when it rested,” on page 000.</i><br></small>
<small><i>On Shabbos, say:</i><br></small>
A Psalm to Dovid. Ascribe to Adonoy—you sons of the mighty— ascribe to Adonoy glory and might. Ascribe to Adonoy the glory due His Name, prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness. Adonoy's voice is upon the waters. Almighty of glory thunders, Adonoy is upon [the] many waters. The voice of Adonoy is in power, the voice of Adonoy is in beauty. The voice of Adonoy breaks cedars, Adonoy shatters the cedars of Lebanon. He makes them leap like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like unicorns. The voice of Adonoy hews out flames of fire. The voice of Adonoy makes the desert tremble, Adonoy makes the desert of Kadesh tremble. The voice of Adonoy causes hinds to calve, and strips the forests bare; and in His Sanctuary all proclaim [His] glory. Adonoy sat enthroned (even) at the flood, Adonoy is enthroned as King forever. Adonoy will give strength to His people; Adonoy will bless His people with peace. 
<small><i>As the Torah is returned to the Ark the following is said:</i><br></small>
And when it rested, he would say: Return, Adonoy, to the myriads and thousands of Yisrael. Arise, Adonoy unto Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your strength. Let Your priests clothe themselves in righteousness, and let Your devoted ones sing in joy. For the sake of Dovid, Your servant, do not reject Your anointed. For I have given you good instruction, do not forsake My Torah. It is a tree of life to those who grasp it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return; renew our days as of old. 

Musaf for Yom Kippur

Hineni

<small><i>This prayer is said by the Chazzan before the Musaf Service.</i><br></small>
<b>Behold,</b> I stand here, impoverished in good deeds, perturbed and frightened in fear [of Him,] Who is enthroned upon the praises of Yisrael. I have come to stand and to plead before You on behalf of Your people, Yisrael, who have appointed me their messenger; even though I am not worthy or qualified for the task. I therefore beseech You, God of Avraham, God of Yitzchak and God of Yaakov; Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Compassionate and Gracious, God of Yisrael, Shaddai, Eminent and Awesome, please, help me succeed in the mission which I have undertaken to stand [before You] and to seek mercy for myself and for those who have appointed me. Do not hold them responsible for my sins, nor condemn them for my iniquities, as I am a sinner and a transgressor. Let them not be disgraced through my transgressions; may they not be ashamed of me, nor may I be ashamed of them. Accept my prayer as the prayer of one who is mature and experienced [in prayer], and as one who is respected, whose beard is full-grown, whose voice is pleasant, and who is pleasing to his fellow man. Rebuke Satan that he not accuse me, and may our assembling [be acceptable] to You with love; and may all [our] transgressions be covered over with [Your] love. All our troubles and afflictions; please turn them for us and all Yisrael into happiness and joy, life and peace. May they love truth and peace, and may there be no impediment in my prayer. And may it be Your will, Adonoy, God of Avraham, God of Yitzchak and God of Yaakov; the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high, Almighty, [Who is known by the Name]: “I am that I am” that all the angels who convey prayers, may they bring my prayers to the presence of Your glorious throne, and spread them to You for the sake of all those who are righteous, pious, pure and upright, and for the sake of Your glorious Name, [which is] great and awesome; for You hear the prayers of Your people, Yisrael, with compassion. Blessed are You Who hears prayers. 

<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Half-Kaddish:</i><br></small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

<b>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</b> 
You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. 
<b>And so,</b> grant that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works, and Your dread upon all You have created; and [then] all [Your] works will fear You, and prostrate before You will be all [Your] created beings. And may they all form a single band to do Your will with a perfect heart. For we know Adonoy, our God that rulership is Yours, strength is in Your hand, might is in Your right hand and Your Name is awesome over all You have created. 
<b>And so,</b> grant honor, Adonoy, to Your people, praise to those who fear You, good hope to those who seek You confident speech to those who yearn for You, joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days. 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice, and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 
<b>SANCTIFICATION OF THE DAY</b>
<b>You</b> chose us from [among] all the peoples; You loved us and took pleasure in us; You exalted us above all tongues, and You sanctified us with Your commandments; You drew us near, our King, to Your servitude and Your great and Holy Name, You have pronounced upon us. 
<b>And</b> You gave us Adonoy, our God, in love, 
<i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (this Shabbos Day and) this Day of Atonement, for forgiveness, pardon and atonement, and to forgive thereon all our iniquities; <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (with love) a day of holy assembly commemorating the exodus from Mitzrayim. 
<b>But because</b> of our sins, we were exiled from our land, and driven far away from our soil; and we are unable, and to perform our obligatory offerings in Your chosen House, in the great and holy House upon which Your Name is proclaimed, because of the hand [of violence] that was sent against Your Sanctuary. May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, merciful King, to once again have compassion on us and on Your Sanctuary in Your abundant mercy; and rebuild it soon and greatly enhance its glory. Our Father, our King! reveal the glory of Your Kingship upon us soon, appear and be uplifted over us before the eyes of all living things. Bring near our scattered [people] from among the nations, and gather our dispersed from the ends of the earth. Bring us to Tziyon, Your city, with joyous song,— to Yerushalayim, House of Your Sanctuary, with everlasting joy. And there we will offer before You our obligatory sacrifices— the daily [burnt] offerings in their order, and the Musaf offerings according to their rule. 
And the Musaf offering of <br><i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br> (and the Musaf offerings of this Shabbos day and) this Day of Atonement, we will prepare and bring before You with love according to the command of Your will; as You wrote for us in Your Torah, through the hands of Moshe, Your servant, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said: 
<i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br> (“And on the Sabbath day [the offering is]: two male yearling lambs without blemish; two tenths [of an epha] of fine flour for a meal-offering, mixed with the [olive] oil, and its libation.” [This is] the burnt-offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the daily burnt-offering and its libation; [wine-offering].) 
<b>And</b> on the tenth [day] of this seventh month, a day of holy assembly it shall be for you and you shall fast; all manner of work, you shall not do; And you shall present a burnt-offering to Adonoy for a pleasing savour— one young bullock, one ram, seven male yearling lambs without blemish, they shall be for you. And their meal-offerings and libations as stated: three tenths [of an epha of fine flour] for the bullock, two tenths for the ram, and one tenth for each lamb, and wine according to each libation; and two he goats for atonement, and the two daily burnt-offerings according to their law. 
<i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br> (They will rejoice in Your Kingship— those who preserve the Sabbath— and call it a delight. The people who sanctify the seventh [day] will all be satisfied and delighted with Your goodness. And the seventh [day]— You took pleasure in it, and You hallowed it. “Most desirable of days,” You called it— a commemoration of the work of creation.) 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, forgive our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement. Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes, as it is said: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” And it is said, “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.” And it is said, “For on this day He will make atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy, you will be cleansed.” 
<i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (Our God and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest) Sanctify us with Your commandments and give us our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (And give us as our inheritance Adonoy our God with love and with pleasure Your holy Sabbath; and may Yisrael rest thereon— [they who are] sanctifiers of Your Name) and purify our hearts to serve You in truth, For You are the Pardoner of Yisrael, and the Forgiver of the tribes of Yeshurun in every generation, and beside You, we have no king who forgives and pardons, only You! Blessed are You, King Who forgives and pardons our iniquities, and the iniquities of His people, the House of Yisrael; and Who removes our trespasses each year; King over the whole earth, Sanctifier <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (of the Shabbos and) of Yisrael and the Day of Atonement. 
<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
<b>Be pleased,</b> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Yisrael and their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Yisrael; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Yisrael. And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon. 
<small><i>At the words, We are thankful, bend forward; at Adonoy return to an upright position.</i><br></small>
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<b>We</b> are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. 
Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</i><br></small>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise. 
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
<b>Grant peace,</b> goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. 
In the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah.</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>(others conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace.) 
May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 
You know the mysteries of the universe, and the hidden secrets of every individual. You search all our innermost thoughts, and probe our mind and heart. There is nothing hidden from You, and there is nothing concealed from Your sight. And so may it be Your will Adonoy our God and God of our fathers, that You pardon us for all our careless sins, and that You forgive us for all our deliberate sins, and that You grant us atonement for all our rebellious sins:

My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein. 
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Yehudah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years. 

Reader's Repetition of the Amidah

<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i><br></small>
My Master, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise. 
<b>THE VIRTUE OF OUR FOREFATHERS</b>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Avraham, God of Yitzchak, and God of Yaakov, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children's children, for the sake of His Name, with love. 
Invoking the doctrines of our wise and understanding Sages, and with the teachings [acquired] from their perceptive intuition, I open my mouth in prayer and supplication to plead and seek favor before the presence of the King, Forgiver and Pardoner of iniquities. 
<small><i>The Ark is closed:</i><br></small>
 
Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God. 
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Avraham. 
<b>DIVINE MIGHT</b> 
You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the Powerful One to deliver us. Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth. 
 
While his soul is yet in him, God hopes for the repentance [of man] who was formed from His earth; to grant him life, to grant him goodness at his end. 
¿Cómo puede el ser humano alegar rectitud ante Su Creador, quien conoce todos sus designios, y aún sus más ocultos secretos? Mas es con el arrepentimiento que puede lograr la absolución por sus delitos y la curación para su espíritu. Torna a Dios, oh hombre, antes que tu vida cual débil luz, deje de flamear. 
La oscuridad no podrá amparar tus acciones, pues Él las penetra con Su luz. Tu propio mal se erige en testigo contra Ti, oh ser mortal. Tu única ventaja es: reconocer la perfidia de tus acciones mientras la vida anima tu ser. 
Aun los cielos con su pureza no son perfectos ante Dios, ¿podrás serlo tú, hombre recubierto de culpa y error? ¿Por qué eres presuntuoso, por qué no entiendes que el final de tus días no es tan remoto? 
Tu oro y tus apreciadas riquezas no podrán rescatar tu alma en el día aciago. Mas si la bondad y la rectitud son tus cualidades durante tu vida, ellas te acompañarán, hasta la gloria de tu Creador que te acogerá. 
Feliz es el hombre que acepta los deberes que la Torá le impone, quien con amor sus preceptos observa, quien la venera con la pureza de sus actos. Pues la Torá lo conducirá por la senda de la rectitud durante ésta, su vida terrena, y lo ayudará a merecer la vida eterna. 
Oh Dios Todopoderoso, henos en Tus manos cual arcilla en manos del alfarero. Tu deseo es concedernos la vida, y no la muerte y el fin. 
Danos firmeza durante nuestra vida para que cantemos Tu gloria hasta la eternidad, diciendo:  
While his soul is yet in him, God hopes for the repentance [of man] who was formed from His earth; to grant him life, to grant him goodness at his end. 
Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy. 
And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead. 

<small><i>Chazzan and congregation:</i><br></small>
Adonoy will reign forever; your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations! Praise God. And You, Holy One, are enthroned upon the praises of Yisrael. Almighty, we beseech You. 
May we be considered as he [the High Priest] as he stood at the [Temple] entrance to push off the serpent [Satan] with prayer; and we will sanctify You on this Sabbath of Sabbaths; Holy One. 
On this day, when You open the books, be gracious to the people who glorify Your Name; and we will sanctify You on this Day of Atonement, Holy One. 
Bind the accuser [Satan] in chains, and the hopes of the imprisoned [Yisrael] fulfill with glad tidings; and we will sanctify You on this fast of the tenth day. Holy One.

Recuerda, oh Dios, la rectitud de nuestros antecesores, hazlo por ellos y perdona a las generaciones postreras, hazlos retornar a la tierra de Israel, cual palomas que regresan a sus nidos. 
Apiádate de Tu pueblo, que antaño condujeras, bendice a Tu heredad, enséñales de nuevo los preceptos de Tu ley, oh Dios. 
Con Tu pureza, manifiéstanos Tu gloria, haznos ver Tu esplendor, para que aceptemos Tu fe y proclamemos Tu Unicidad. 
Tus creyentes se regocijarán, a diario se prosternarán ante Ti; toda nación, todo reino, a Ti Te servirán. 
Retribúyenos de acuerdo a Tu misericordia, pues todos los días Te invocamos diciendo: “Adonai Tsebaot está con nosotros”. 
Sólo Tú reinarás como antaño, con Tu Providencia, restaurarás el Santuario que desde el principio para morada de Tu gloria elegiste. 
Manifiéstanos Tu reino, haznos ver Tus maravillas. Desde Sión, de nuevo con Tu misericordia Te revelarás.
Condúcenos con Tu verdad, regocíjanos con Tu salvación, pues somos Tu pueblo y Tu heredad. 
Tórnanos en bendición de la tierra, desarraiga a los impíos de la tierra, para que vivamos en paz en la tierra. 
Respóndenos con Tu verbo y Tu verdad, sálvanos por amor a Tu fe, pues somos los hijos de Tu Providencia. 
Ilumina con Tu Presencia a Sión, muéstranos Tu esplendoroso reino. Purifica con Tu Santidad a Sión. 
Todas Tus sendas son justas, Tu magna benevolencia concedes a toda Tu creación, prodigas todo, pues todo Te pertenece. 
Tú estás cercano a los que Te invocan. Manifiesta Tu clemencia a los que proclaman Tu Reino, pues ellos son la obra de Tu creación. 
Perdona nuestros errores con Tu indulgencia, pues todo mortal en pecado incurre, mas Tú absuelves el error. No nos desampares, pues nosotros portamos 
Tu nombre, cuando Te invoquemos, respóndenos. Hazlo por Tu causa, ilumina nuestros ojos con Tu luz. 
Revélanos la gloria de Tu Presencia, otórganos la sapiencia de Tu Torá. Concédenos nuestro sustento con Tu abundancia, con Tu clemencia, perdónanos, oh Dios.

There is a famous legend behind this stirring prayer as recorded in the thirteenth century work, Ohr Zerua, by Rabbi Yitzchak of Vienna. In the section dealing with laws of Rosh Hashana (Section 276), he writes, “I found a letter from Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn, in which he wrote that Rabbi Amnon of Mayence authored the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף as a result of a tragic incident in his life.” This is the story as recorded in the letter: 
<small>Rabbi Amnon of Mayence, a great scholar, a person of wealth, a handsome man of noble ancestry was under great pressure from the lords and Archbishop of the city to change his faith and adopt their religion. He repeatedly ignored them but on one occasion, in order to put them off, he asked for three days to consider their request. Afterwards he was heartbroken because he had given the impression that he might actually consider renouncing his belief in the One Living God. He refused food or drink; weeping bitterly over his lapse, he refused to accept the sympathy and consolation of friends and relatives.</small>
<small>At the end of the three days he was summoned by the Archbishop, but he ignored the summons. A distinguished delegation was sent to ask him to appear at the court but he refused them. Finally, he was brought before the court by force, and the Archbishop demanded, “Why did you not come and answer me as you promised?” Rabbi Amnon answered, “As a punishment, you should have my tongue cut out, because my tougue deceived you.” Rabbi Amnon thought to sanctify God's Name in this manner, since his tongue had uttered such a promise. The Archbishop replied, “No, I will not cut out your tongue for it spoke well, instead, I will cut off your feet for they did not bring you to me.” The tyrant ordered that his hands and feet be cut off in piecemeal fashion; asking him at each interval if he was willing to renounce his faith. He was finally released and sent home with his severed and mutilated limbs aside him in bed.</small>
<small>The holiday of Rosh Hashana was at hand, and the Rabbi, dying from the effects of his wounds, was at his own request carried into the synagogue, bringing his severed limbs with him. When the Chazzan was about to recite the Kedushah, Rabbi Amnon asked him to stop, saying, “Pause that I may sanctify His Most Holy Name,” and he said in a loud voice: וּבְכֵן וּלְךָ תַעֲלֶה קְדֻשָּׁה, and thus may this sanctification ascend to You, inferring that with his terrible suffering, he had sanctified God's Name. He then began reciting the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף, and with the words אֱמֶת כִּי אַתָּה הוּא דַיָּן וּמוֹכִֽיח, true that You are Judge and Admonisher, he indicated his acceptance of God's Divine judgment, and with the words וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם, and You recorded the decree of their judgments, he manifested his belief that his fate had been decreed on Rosh Hashana. No sooner had he finished the prayer when he expired. Three days later, he appeared to Rabbi Kolonymus ben Meshullam in a dream and taught him this prayer, asking him to introduce it to all congregations as a testimonial and as a memorial for him. This prayer has formed a portion of our Service ever since.</small>
<b>Let us describe</b> the great holiness of this day, for it is awesome and frightening.

<b>On Rosh Hashana</b> their decree is inscribed, and on Yom Kippur it is sealed,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This formula of judgment is only for those who are considered בֵּינו‍ֹנִים, neither righteous nor wicked.

Thus it is only the בֵּינו‍ֹנִי, one in between, who is given time until Yom Kippur to mend his ways and be judged for life. Talmud Yerushalmi, Maseches Rosh Hashana 1:3.</i> how many will pass away and how many will be created, who will live and who will die; who will come to his timely end, and who to an untimely end; who will perish by fire and who by water; who by the sword and who by beast; who by hunger and who by thirst; who by earthquake and who by the plague; who by strangling and who by stoning; who will be at rest and who will wander about; who will have serenity and who will be confused; who will be tranquil and who will be tormented; who will become poor and who will become wealthy; who will be brought to a low state and who will be uplifted.

Man, his beginning is from dust and ends in dust; risking his life, he gets his bread, he is like a potsherd that is breakable, like grass that withers, like the flower that fades, like the shadow that passes, like the cloud that vanishes, like the wind that blows, like the dust that flies, and like a fleeting dream.

<b>And so,</b> grant that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works, and Your dread upon all You have created; and [then] all [Your] works will fear You, and prostrate before You will be all [Your] created beings. And may they all form a single band to do Your will with a perfect heart. For we know Adonoy, our God that rulership is Yours, strength is in Your hand, might is in Your right hand and Your Name is awesome over all You have created. 
<b>And so,</b> grant honor, Adonoy, to Your people, praise to those who fear You, good hope to those who seek You confident speech to those who yearn for You, joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days. 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice, and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And</b> all shall come to serve You and bless Your glorious Name, and throughout the isles they shall declare Your righteousness. And peoples will seek You, who knew You not before; and they will praise You, those who live in every part of the earth, and they will say, always, “Magnified be Adonoy.” And they will offer to You their sacrifices, and they will abandon their idols, and they will be humiliated with their graven images, and they will turn with unanimous accord to worship You. And they will fear You— as long as sun is upon them— those who seek Your Presence, and they will realize the power of Your Kingship, and they will teach— those who have gone astray— understanding [of God]. And they will speak of Your might, and they will uplift You causing You to be uplifted above all, and they will fervently beseech Your Presence and crown You with a crown of glory. And the mountains will burst out in joyous song, and the isles will exult in Your Kingship, and they will accept the yoke of Your kingdom, and they will exalt You in the assembly of peoples. Those from far-off lands will hear of this and they will come, and they will tender unto You the crown of sovereignty. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 
<b>SANCTIFICATION OF THE DAY</b>

a day of holy assembly commemorating the exodus from Mitzrayim. 
<b>But because</b> of our sins, we were exiled from our land, and driven far away from our soil; and we are unable, and to perform our obligatory offerings in Your chosen House, in the great and holy House upon which Your Name is proclaimed, because of the hand [of violence] that was sent against Your Sanctuary. May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, merciful King, to once again have compassion on us and on Your Sanctuary in Your abundant mercy; and rebuild it soon and greatly enhance its glory. Our Father, our King! reveal the glory of Your Kingship upon us soon, appear and be uplifted over us before the eyes of all living things. Bring near our scattered [people] from among the nations, and gather our dispersed from the ends of the earth. Bring us to Tziyon, Your city, with joyous song,— to Yerushalayim, House of Your Sanctuary, with everlasting joy. And there we will offer before You our obligatory sacrifices— the daily [burnt] offerings in their order, and the Musaf offerings according to their rule. 
And the Musaf offering of <br><i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br> (and the Musaf offerings of this Shabbos day and) this Day of Atonement, we will prepare and bring before You with love according to the command of Your will; as You wrote for us in Your Torah, through the hands of Moshe, Your servant, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said: 
<i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br> (“And on the Sabbath day [the offering is]: two male yearling lambs without blemish; two tenths [of an epha] of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with the [olive] oil, and its libation.” [This is] the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the daily burnt offering and its libation; [wine offering].) 
<b>And</b> on the tenth [day], of this seventh month, a day of holy assembly it shall be for you and you shall fast; all manner of work, you shall not do; And you shall present a burnt-offering to Adonoy for a pleasing savour— one young bullock, one ram, seven male yearling lambs without blemish, they shall be for you. And their meal-offerings and libations as stated: three tenths [of an epha of fine flour] for the bullock, two tenths for the ram, and one tenth for each lamb, and wine according to each libation; and two he goats for atonement, and the two daily burnt-offerings according to their law. 
<i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br> (They will rejoice in Your Kingship— those who preserve the Sabbath— and call it a delight. The people who sanctify the seventh [day] will all be satisfied and delighted with Your goodness. And the seventh [day]— You took pleasure in it, and You hallowed it. “Most desirable of days,” You called it— a commemoration of the work of creation.) 
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i><br></small>
<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of [the world in] the beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in the heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftier heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.”

Our God and God of our fathers, be with the mouths of those who have been sent by Your people the House of Yisrael, who stand to offer fervent prayer and supplication before You, on behalf of Your people, the House of Yisrael. Instruct them what to say, teach them what they shall speak, disclose to them what they shall ask, make known to them how they may glorify You. May they walk in the light of Your countenance [their] knee, unto You may they bend, Your people, with their mouths, may they bless, and from the blessings of Your mouth, may they all be blessed. Your people, they lead into Your Presence, and from their midst, they approach You; the eyes of Your people are fixed on them, and their eyes look longingly to You. They approach the Holy Ark in awe, to appease anger and wrath; and Your people surround them like a wall, and You, from the heavens look upon them with compassion. They lift their eyes to You in heaven, their hearts are poured out before You as water, and You, [please] hear [their prayer] from the heavens. May they not stammer with their tongue, nor become entangled in their speech, may they not be ashamed of those who rely on them, and may they not bring disgrace to their multitude [their congregation]; and may their mouths never say a word that is not according to Your will. For those to whom You are favorably disposed, Adonoy, our God, they have truly found favor, and those upon whom You have compassion, they have truly found compassion. For we know, Adonoy, our God, that You will show favor to whom You will show favor, and that You will be compassionate to whom You will be compassionate. As it is written in Your Torah: And He said: “I will cause to pass over all My goodness before you, and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy in your presence; “I will show favor to whom I show favor, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate.” And it is said: “Let them not be ashamed through me those who wait for You, my Master, God of Hosts; let them not be disgraced through me, those who seek You, God of Yisrael.” 
<small><i>The Ark is opened and the Chazzan continues</i><br></small>
<b>I hope</b> in Almighty, I implore His Presence, I ask of Him to grant me eloquent speech, so that in the congregation of the people, I might sing of His might and utter joyful songs praising His deeds. The arrangements of thoughts belong to man, but [only] from God, comes eloquent speech. My Master, open my lips and my mouth will declare Your praise. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.

Each day he was visited by wise men, the elders of the Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Yoma Ch. 1:3.</i> who said to him, “Please study [the order of the Daily Service.]”<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.

It is a tradition of the oral law that the incense should be placed on the pan of coals inside the Holy of Holies and not outside, as the Sadducees contended. The oath was administered because there were priests who were suspected of being Sadducees (see Rambam 1:7). They made him swear in the Name of Hashem, that he would not change anything of what he was instructed.</i> His flesh crept [with fear]; and he cried because he was suspected. The elders of Sanhedrin turned aside and also wept for having suspected him.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Yoma ch. 1:5.

For at midnight, the service of Yom Kippur begins with the Terumas HaDeshen, which consisted of removing some of the burnt coals and placing them on the floor next to the Altar.

According to the Talmud, Yoma 24b, the four choosing’s were not held at one time because they wanted to summon a crowd four times during the day.

The third lot to determine who would burn the incense on the inner Altar was drawn just among the new priests who had not yet performed that service. The reason for this, explains the Talmud, is that this service increases the wealth of the priest who performed it. Therefore, care was taken to give every priest an opportunity to partake of the blessing. It should be noted that all commentaries agree that on Yom Kippur, only the High Priest could burn incense on the inner Altar.</i> Bringing up the limbs to the Altar, was the fourth choosing.

The High Priest performed his service during the entire year with eight garments, four which were worn by regular priests, and four additional ones. On Yom Kippur he wore two types of clothing. For those services which were not specially performed for Yom Kippur, he wore his usual eight garments. For those services, however, which were performed especially in the Holy of Holies for Yom Kippur, he wore only four white garments (shirt, pants, belt, and hat). Before commencing service, he wore “everyday” clothes, and put on the eight garments of “gold” for the opening service which was the slaughtering of the daily morning sacrifice.</i> He washed his hands and feet<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. It is a positive commandment in the Torah for a priest to wash his hands and feet from a special laver.

The High Priest performed the minimal cut; the major part of each of the two “signs” which characterize the slaughter of an animal according to the Torah: the gullet and trachea (Rambam 4:1).

Since the burning of incense in the Kodesh HaKodashim on Yom Kippur was a totally different procedure than the usual incense burning (even for that very day), the High Priest used a specially designed shovel to facilitate his work. Unlike the usual twice-daily incense service, this special burning required that the High Priest himself stir the coals, and carry them in the shovel into the Sanctuary and finally into the Kodesh HaKodashim. Thus the shovel was made especially light. It had an extra long handle so that the High Priest could rest the handle under his arm as he carried it, taking some of its weight off his hands (see Rambam 2:5).</i> The shovel held three kavim of coals. He was then brought a ladle<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">After taking some coals in the shovel, the High Priest laid the shovel on the floor, temporarily, while he proceeded with the taking of incense.

The High Priest, as he entered, would be standing between the two long handles, and would place the shovel upon the Foundation Stone which protruded a bit from under the Ark. Since there was no Ark in the Second Temple, the Peitan describes the High Priest’s location only by correspondence.</i> The incense he placed between the poles<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">After placing the shovel with the coals in the area corresponding to “between the poles,” he heaped the incense upon the coals which caused tremendous smoke.</i> and caused them to rise in smoke<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">From the burning incense.</i> and he left.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">The service of burning the incense in the Holy of Holies was completed.</i> From the young boy priest who had been stirring the blood, he now took the vessel of blood.

The “upper” sprinkling was done by moving the hand up, whereby the blood would rise in an arcwise motion and fall to the floor. The seven “lower” sprinklings were done by a downward movement of the hand; in each case the movement originating at a lower level, with the blood falling straight down to the floor (Rambam 3:5).

All this took place when the Temple was on its foundation, and the Holy Sanctuary was on its site, and the High Priest stood and served. His generation saw and rejoiced. Fortunate is the eye that saw all of this. For to mention it makes our souls grieve. 
Happy is the eye that saw our Temple amidst the joy of our people; for to mention it makes our souls grieve.

But the iniquities of our fathers destroyed our home, and our sins have prolonged its period of captivity; yet may the mention of these things bring us pardon, and the affliction of our souls be our atonement. 
Therefore, with Your great mercy You have given us this Day of Atonement and this Day of forgiveness of iniquity to pardon inquity and to atone rebellion; a day on which it is forbidden to eat, a day on which it is forbidden to drink, a day on which it is forbidden to wash a day on which it is forbidden to apply ointments, a day on which it is forbidden to engage in marital relations, a day on which it is forbidden to wear leather shoes. A day for restoring love and brotherhood, a day of abandoning envy and strife, a day which You will forgive all our iniquities.

The Ten Martyrs

The majority of executions, however, took place during the reign of Hadrian at the instigation of Tornasropos, during the time of the destruction of the Second Temple.</i> there was no remedy [reprieve] for the ten martyrs, doomed to death by the [Roman] government. 
Having learned the Written law from those who are compared to heaps of grain<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash Tanchuma compares Torah Sages to heaps of grain.</i> [Torah Scholars], who understand how to examine the Written Law; He began to study “These are the Laws,”<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 21; the sixth chapter in the book of Shemos which details many of the laws dealing with criminal behavior.</i> and with malicious intent, read the verse: “If one kidnaps a person and sells him, if he is found in his hands, he shall be put to death.”<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 21:16. In the “Midrash of the ten murdered martyrs” (version III) it is written, “Once Luliano Caesar decided (to study the Torah), he brought ten Sages to interpret the Scriptures for him. He read about the sale of Yosef (by his brothers) and also that if one kidnaps a person, he is put to death.”</i> 
The head of the idolator swelled with malice and commanded to fill his palace with shoes<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">In the Midrash (version II), it is stated that he “lined the entire palace with shoes in order that they should recognize for what item Yosef was sold, as it says: “For shoes”: for money to buy shoes (Amos 2:6).</i> He summoned ten great scholars who understood the Law and all of its intricacies. 
[He ordered]: “decide this case objectively and don't distort it with intentional trickery, but rather bring it out to its true light:<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash (version I), first the Sages agreed to judge the case objectively, after which the question was posed.</i> If a man was found to have kidnapped one of his brothers, from among the Children of Yisrael; treating him as a slave and selling him.” 
They answered him:<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash (version I), the dialogue proceeds as follows: “If so, then you deserve the death penalty.” They asked “Why?” He answered, “For the sale of Yosef, who was sold by his brothers.”</i> “The kidnapper should be put to death.” He then exclaimed “Where are your fathers, who sold their brother and dealt him to a caravan of Ishmaelites for pairs of shoes.”<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">The source is the verse in Amos (2:6) “For you have sold a righteous man for money, and a pauper for shoes”; the Midrash Pirke De’Rabi Eliezer (38) explains that each brother took two silver coins to buy himself a pair of shoes.</i> 
You, therefore, must accept the law of God upon yourselves, for from the time of your fathers there has been none like yourselves<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">In the Midrash (version III) it is written that Rabbi Yishmael asked the Angel Micha’el, “Hasn’t Hashem found anyone else from whom to take punishment for Yosef other than us?” He answered him “It is your good fortune that Hashem has not found any righteous among the sons of Yaakov but you.”</i> For if they were still living, I would judge them before you, but now, you must bear the guilt of the sin of your fathers. 
They answered,<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">In the Midrash (version I) it says “Give us three days to find some merit for reprieve; if none is found, do what you want.”</i> “Give us time, three days until we can determine if this has been decreed from heaven. For if we are guilty then we will accept the decree of He who is all merciful.” 
Trembling and shaking with fear They all turned to Rabbi Yishmael the High Priest<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash (version I) states that they beseeched Rabbi Yishmael to do so. In version II, however, Rabbi Yishmael first volunteered, saying, “If you will agree to share the sin with me, I will mention the explicit Name and ascend to heaven and we will know; if it is decreed from heaven, we will accept it upon ourselves, but if it is not, I will nullify it with the explicit Name.” They answered, “Your sin is divided among us.”</i> and cast their eyes on him, to mention the explicit Name of God and thereby ascend to his Master, to know if the decree has come from God. 
Rabbi Yishmael purified himself<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash (version I), “Rabbi Yishmael purified himself with immersion and sanctifications, wrapped himself in his Talis, put on his Tefillin, and then pronounced the explicit Name of Hashem.”</i> and, trembling, uttered the Name, and ascended to heaven,<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash (versions II, III) says that immediately thereafter a wind carried him up to the sixth heaven.</i> and asked the man who wore garments of linen.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">According to the first Midrash, this person is identified as the angel, Gavri’el, but in the second and third Midrashim, it refers to Matatron, the “angel of the interior.”</i> He answered him, “Accept it upon yourselves beloved, righteous ones, for I have heard from behind the separation<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">The term “פַּרְגוֹד” “Pargod” refers to the separation between the sky and Hashem’s Presence, the “Shechina.” (Maseches Berachos 18b). According to the Midrash, version II, Matatron told him, “I heard from behind the ‘pargod’ a voice saying, ten of Yisrael’s scholars will be handed over to the emperor. An argument had taken place in Hashem’s Presence, between the angels, Micha’el, and Samo’el. Samo’el said, “Master of the World, You have surely not written one letter in the entire Torah for nothing, and yet it is written ‘if a man kidnaps’ etc.; and the sons of Yaakov have still not been punished for selling Yosef. Immediately Hashem decreed that ten of Yisrael’s sages would be killed.”</i> that this will be your demise.” 
He descended and told his friends the words of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">In the Midrash (version III): He found his friends fasting and praying. They asked him, “What do you have to tell us?” He answered them “Go, wash yourselves, purify yourselves, and put on your white garments” (referring to garments placed on the deceased) for this has been decreed by Hashem.” When R’ Yishmael told them that they were considered equal to the sons of Yaakov, they rejoiced, and made a feast.</i> The evil tyrant then commanded to kill them with force and strength. The two which were taken first were great ones in Yisrael, Rabbi Yishmael, the High Priest, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, the head of the High Court.<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">The word “Nasi” used literally means “prince” of Yisrael, referring to the fact that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel was a direct descendant of King Dovid, as well as head of the Jewish High Court.</i> 
“Take off my head first he (R' Yishmael) pleaded<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash (version I), he argued, “I am a High Priest, the son of a High Priest, a direct descendant of Aharon the priest. Let me die first and not see the death of my friend.”</i> while (Raban Shimon ben Gamliel) asked, “let me be killed first,<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Rabban Shimon argued likewise, “I am a prince, the son of a prince, direct descendant of King Dovid.”</i> so I will not have to see the death of one who serves God.” The wicked snake thus decided to draw lots and the lot fell on Rabbi Shimon. 
He hastened to shed his blood as though it was that of an ox. When his head was severed R' Yishmael<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash (version II) relates, when R’ Yishmael was ordered to bare his neck, he pleaded to be given one minute to cry over his murdered friend.

How he wept over him trembling [with grief] the daughter of the evil tyrant, upon [hearing] the cry of R' Yishmael, stood and, seeing his beauty,<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash (version II) relates, “It was said on R’ Yishmael the son of Elisha, the High Priest, that he was one of the seven handsomest men that ever lived: Adam, Yaakov, Yosef, Shaul, Avshalom, Rabbi Avahu, and R’ Yishmael. When he was brought to Rome, he was brought before the king, who asked him, “Are there any of your nation who are like you or even more beautiful?” When he answered, “No,” he was immediately condemned to death.</i> coveted him and asked her father if he would spare him. 
But the evil tyrant refused. Tear off the skin<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash (version I) relates that she desired this “in order to use his skin in place of a mirror” (inferring that his skin was so clear, it reflected like a mirror.)</i> of his face, she asked him, and this he agreed to do.

The angels above cried out bitterly Is this the reward for Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash (versions I, II) they asked, “Will this righteous man to whom you have revealed all the mysteries of the heavens die such a death?”</i> God Almighty, Creator of light?

A voice answered from heaven, “If I hear another sound I will turn the world to water, to its [original] emptiness and desolation will I return the world for it is My decree; accept it, all of you who love the Torah [that preceded creation] by two thousand years.”<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">In Vayikra Raba 19:1, Rav Huna said in the name of Raish Lakish, “The Torah preceded the creation by two thousand years.” The use of the word “Yomayim,” meaning literally “two days” is based on the version in Tehillim 90:4, that a “thousand years in the eyes of Hashem is like one day.”</i> 
The princes of the Jewish people were killed, those who spent long hours in the synagogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">This is based upon the verse in Tehillim 127:2.</i> They were filled with mitzvos like a pomegranate is filled with seeds, and like the corners [of the Altar were filled with blood.] They then brought out Rabbi Akiva, who expounded upon the crowns of the letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud Menachos 29b relates as follows: When Moshe ascended to heaven he saw Hashem sitting and placing crowns on top of the Hebrew letters.

And I would wonder, when will the time come for me to fulfill this commandment? Now that the time has come, shouldn’t I fulfill it?” (Midrash version II, Berachos)</i> 
He commanded them to bring out Rabbi Chananya ben Tradyon<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">It was said about Rabbi Chananya ben Tradyon that he was pleasant in the presence of Hashem and man, and that he never spoke ill of his fellow man.

Then the officer threw himself into the fire and was burnt.

Mourn, oh people who are not forsaken, for over insignificant matters was their blood spilt. To sanctify the Name of God they sacrificed their lives, as through the murder of Rabbi Chutzpis, the interpreter.<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">When sentenced to die, Rabbi Chutzpis was one hundred and thirty years old minus one day, but was very handsome, with a face resembling “an angel of Hashem.” When the Ceasar was asked to spare the life of this old man, he asked him, “How old are you?” He replied, “One hundred thirty less a day, and I beseech you let me live one more day.” The Ceasar asked him “What difference does it make if you die today or tomorrow?”, to which he answered, “So that I will be able to fulfill two more mitzvoth.” “Which mitzvoth would you like to fulfill” asked the king. He answered “To read the Shema in the morning and evening and to accept upon myself the Kingdom of heaven.” (Midrash version I).</i> 
Let trembling seize all who hear and each eye flow with tears and all joy be turned to mourning because of the murder of Rabbi Eleazar ben Shamua.<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">It was said of Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua, that he was one hundred five years old, and that from the time he was a young lad until his very last days, no one had ever heard him utter an unnecessary word.

Our oppressors have slaughered us, and satisfied themselves with my delicacies.

The day he was killed was Shabbos eve. He commenced to sanctify the day and recite the Kiddush, and reached “And Hashem sanctified it (the seventh day).” They did not let him continue further and killed him. A voice called out from heaven “How fortunate are you, Rabbi Chanina ben Chachinai, for you were holy and your soul left in holiness with the word “sanctification.” (Midrash version I).</i> 
They tortured us [that we should] reject the commandments; and refused to accept neither bribe nor ransom. Only the lives of those who studied the Torah [would they take] like that of Rabbi Yeshaivav, the scribe. 
The children of Edom<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">The Romans, according to the Talmud, are descendant from Esau, whose name was Edom.</i> have desolated us. They have oppressed us more then all the kings on the earth; and have slaughtered so many of us, as they killed Rabbi Yehuda ben Damah.<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">They brought out Rabbi Yehuda ben Damah to be executed on the eve of the holiday of Shavuos. He pleaded with the Ceasar, “Give me just a little more time that I may be able to sanctify the holiday and praise Hashem for giving us the Torah.” The Ceasar asked him, “Do you still trust in the Torah and in Hashem who gave it?” He replied, “Yes.” He then asked him, “What is the reward for studying Torah?” to which Rabbi Yehuda replied, “King Dovid said of it, ‘How greatly abundant is the goodness which awaits those who fear You.’” The Ceasar then exclaimed, “There aren’t any idiots in the world like you who believe there is another world.” He then countered, “There aren’t any idiots like yourselves who deny the living Hashem, and it will be your misfortune when you meet us in the next world, for you will dwell at the lowest level of hell.” The Ceasar exploded with anger, and commanded to tie his hair to the tail of a horse, and have him dragged through the streets of Rome, after which he had him cut up limb by limb. But the prophet Eliyahu came and took his limbs and buried them (Midrash version I).</i> 
You have said The house of Yaakov is fire and the house of Yosef a flame; but for now the straw has extinguished the fire. Eternal God! crush their arrogance, and bring swiftly the day of their destruction for they agreed to execute ten righteous men, including Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava. 
All this happened to us and we tell it over again. We pour out [our] hearts of grief and depression. Hear our supplication from above Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful and Gracious. 
Gracious One! Look down from Heaven at the spilled blood of the righteous, [even] their life blood. Look from the place of Your holy Presence and remove all stains [of guilt]. Almighty, King Who sits upon a throne of mercy. 
Remember to us the covenant of the Patriarchs, as You promised, “And I will remember my covenant with Yaakov, and also my covenant with Yitzchak, and also my covenant with Avraham will I remember,” and the land I will remember. 
Remember to us the covenant of the ancestors, as You promised, “And I will remember for their sake, the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Mitzrayim, in the sight of the nations; to be their God, I am Adonoy.” Do unto us as You promised, “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them and I will not abhor them, to destroy them, to annul My covenant with them; for I am Adonoy, their God.” Have compassion on us and do not destroy us, as it is written: “For an Almighty of mercy is Adonoy, your God; He will not abandon you or destroy you, and He will not forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.” Open our hearts to love Your Name, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will open your heart, and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.” Bring back our captivity and have compassion on us, as it is written: “And Adonoy, your God will return your captivity and have compassion on you; and He will again gather you from [among] all the peoples, where Adonoy, your God has scattered you.” Gather our dispersed ones, as it is written: “If your dispersed are in the farthermost part of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.” Be accessible to us when we seek You, as it is written: “And from there you will seek Adonoy, your God, and you will find Him; if you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” Blot out our transgressions for Your sake, as You promised: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” Sweep aside our transgressions as a thick cloud and as a mist, as You have promised: “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed You.” Make our sins as white as snow or wool, as it is written: “Come now, let us reason together, says Adonoy, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall become [white] as wool.” Sprinkle clean water upon us, and cleanse us, as it is written: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.” Atone our sins on this day, and cleanse us, as it is written: “For on this day He will make atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins before Adonoy you will be cleansed.” Bring us to Your holy mountain, and make us joyful in Your House of Prayer, as it is written: “And I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House, will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.” 
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i><br></small>
<b>Hear</b> our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers mercifully and willingly. Lead us back to You, Adonoy and we shall find the way back; renew our days as of old. Give ear to our words, Adonoy! Consider our meditations. May the words of our mouths be acceptable — and the thoughts of our hearts—before You, Adonoy, our Rock, and our Redeemer. Cast us not away from Your Presence, and Your holy spirit take not from us. Do not cast us off in time of old age, when our strength fails, do not forsake us. Forsake us not, Adonoy, our God, be not far removed from us. Give us a sign of Your goodness that our enemies may see it and be ashamed; for You, Adonoy, have helped us and comforted us. For You, Adonoy, do we wait, You will answer us, our Master, our God. 
<small><i>The Ark is closed:</i><br></small>
Our God and God of our fathers! Do not forsake us, do not cast us off, and do not disgrace us; and do not nullify Your covenant with us. Draw us near to Your Torah, teach us Your commandments, direct us to Your ways. Incline our hearts to fear Your Name, and open our hearts to Your love, and may we return to You in truth, and with a perfect heart. And for the sake of Your great Name, forgive and pardon our iniquity, as it is written in the words of Your holiness, “For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon my iniquity for it is great.” 
Our God, and God of our fathers! Pardon us, forgive us, atone for us. 
<small><i>Chazzan and congregation responsively:</i><br></small>
For we are Your people; and You are our God. We are Your children; and You are our Father. We are Your servants; and You are our Master. We are Your congregation; and You are our Portion. We are Your inheritance; and You are our Destiny. We are Your flock; and You are our Shepherd. We are Your vineyard; and You are our Keeper. We are Your work; and You are our Creator. We are Your dear ones and You are our Beloved. We are Your treasure; and You are our God. We are Your people; and You are our King. We are Your distinguished ones; and You are our Distinction. 
We are brazen-faced; and You are merciful and gracious. We are stiff-necked; and You are slow to anger. We are full of iniquity; and You are full of compassion. Our days are like a passing shadow; and You are the same and Your years will not end. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.” 
Our God, and God of our fathers! Forgive and pardon our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos say:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement, and permit Yourself to be petitioned by our prayer. Blot out and remove our transgressions from before Your eyes, and compel our Evil Inclination to be subservient to You, and subdue our stubborness, that we may return to You in truth; and renew our conscience that we may preserve Your precepts. Open our hearts that we may love and fear Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, Your God will open Your heart, and the heart of your descendants to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.” 
Our intentional and our unintentional sins— You recognize— [those committed] willfully or by compulsion, [those committed] openly or secretly— before Your Presence, they are [all] revealed and known. What are we? What is our life? What are our acts of kindness? What is our righteousness? What is our deliverance? What is our strength? What is our might? What can we say before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nothing before You? Famous men as though they had never been? The wise as if they were without knowledge? And men of understanding as if they were devoid of intelligence? For most of their actions are a waste and the days of their life are trivial in Your presence. The superiority of man over beast is nil for all is futile. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 

Your Name was always the “forbearer of transgression,” give ear to our plea as we stand before You in prayer. Forbear the transgression of a people who repent [their] transgression; blot out our transgression from before Your eyes. 
You know the mysteries of the universe, and the hidden secrets of every individual. You search all our innermost thoughts, and probe our mind and heart. There is nothing hidden from You, and there is nothing concealed from Your sight. And so may it be Your will Adonoy our God and God of our fathers, that You pardon us for all our careless sins, and that You forgive us for all our deliberate sins, and that You grant us atonement for all our rebellious sins: 
<b>For the sin</b> we committed before You under compulsion and willingly.

And for the sin we committed before You with an utterance of the lips.

And for the sin we committed before You with knowledge and with deceit. 
For the sin we committed before You by improper thoughts. 
And for the sin we committed before You by cheating a fellow-man. 
For the sin we committed before You with [mere] verbal confession. 
And for the sin we committed before You by joining in a lewd gathering. 
For the sin we committed before You intentionally and unintentionally. 
And for the sin we committed before You by insufficient respect for parents and teachers. 
For the sin we committed before You by using coercion [to harm others]. 
And for the sin we committed before You by desecrating the Divine Name. 
For the sin we committed before You with foolish talk. 
And for the sin we committed before You with impurity of the lips. 
For the sin we committed before You with the Evil Inclination. 
And for the sin we committed before You knowingly and unknowingly. 
And for all of these, God of pardon, pardon us, forgive us, grant us atonement. 
For the sin we committed before You by forcing someone to give or take bribes. 
And for the sin we committed before You by false denial and false promise. 
For the sin we committed before You by evil talk [slander]. 
And for the sin we committed before You by scoffing. 
For the sin we committed before You in business dealings. 
And for the sin we committed before You in eating and drinking. 
For the sin we committed before You by [taking or giving] interest and by usury. 
And for the sin we committed before You by haughtily stretching forth the neck. 
For the sin we committed before You with gazing of the eyes. 
And for the sin we committed before You by the prattle of our lips. 
For the sin we committed before You with haughty eyes. 
And for the sin we committed before You with impudence. 
And for all of these, God of pardon, pardon us, forgive us, grant us atonement. 
For the sin we committed before You by throwing off the yoke [of heaven]. 
And for the sin we committed before You in passing judgment. 
For the sin we committed before You by entrapping a fellowman. 
And for the sin we committed before You by a begrudging eye. 
For the sin we committed before You by lightmindedness. 
And for the sin we committed before You by being stiff-necked [stubborn]. 
For the sin we committed before You by running to do evil. 
And for the sin we committed before You by talebearing. 
For the sin we committed before You by swearing in vain. 
And for the sin we committed before You by unwarranted hatred. 
For the sin we committed before You by breach of trust. 
And for the sin we committed before You by a confused heart. 
And for all of these, God of pardon, pardon us, forgive us, grant us atonement. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a burnt-offering. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a sin-offering. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a “fluctuating” offering. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a guilt-offering for certain or for doubtful trespasses. 
And for sins for which we incur the penalty of lashing for violations of Rabbinic law. 
And for sins for which we incur the penalty of forty lashes. 
And for sins for which we incur the penalty of death at the hand of Heaven. 
And for sins for which we incur the penalty of excision and childlessness. 
And for sins for which we are liable to any of the four death penalties inflicted by the [Rabbinic] Court [which are]: stoning, burning, beheading or strangulation. 
For [transgressing] positive commandments, and for [transgressing] prohibitive commandments, whether the prohibition can be corrected by a specifically prescribed act, or whether it cannot be corrected by a specifically prescribed act, for those of which we are aware and for those of which we are not aware. For those of which we are aware, we have already declared before You and confessed them unto You; and for those of which we are not aware, before You they are revealed and known, as it is said, “The hidden things belong to Adonoy, our God, but the revealed things are for us and for our children forever, that we might fulfill all the words of this Torah.” 
And You, Merciful One, accept the penitent. Concerning repentance, You promised us from the very beginning; and because of our repentance our eyes look hopefully to You. Dovid, Your servant, said before You, “Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.”
No temas, oh Jacob, retornad de vuestra rebeldía; retorna, oh Israel. Pues he aquí que no duerme ni dormita el Guardián de Israel. Así dijo Tu profeta: Retorna, oh Israel, a Adonai tu Dios, pues has tropezado por tus errores. Proveéos de palabras, y volved a Adonai. Decidle: “Perdona nuestros delitos y acepta el bien. Te ofreceremos las palabras de nuestros labios a modo de ofrenda”. Tú eres clemente, oh Dios, aceptas el arrepentimiento de los que a Ti retornan. Tú nos aseguraste aceptar el arrepentimiento, pues por eso depositamos nuestra esperanza en el arrepentimiento que Tú estableciste. Es por Tu amor Adonai, Dios nuestro, que conferiste a Tu pueblo Israel, y por la compasión que otorgaste a todos Tus hijos: que nos concediste Adonai, Dios nuestro este Día (de Shabat para santidad y quietud y este día) del Perdón, para absolver todos nuestros errores y culpas. 




¿QUIÉN TE IGUALA, OH DIOS? Tú eres el Todopoderoso y Glorioso, creador de los cielos y la tierra. Tú nos revelaste Tus profundas enseñanzas, Tu palabra es la rectitud. La magnificencia Te circunda, nadie puede emularte. Tú levantas a los sometidos, agracias a los débiles. Tu Providencia es la pureza que Te circunda en los cielos, Tu morada. Tú desde Tus alturas sostienes a los íntegros. Tú perdonas los errores y omites las transgresiones. ¿QUIÉN TE IGUALA, OH DIOS? 
Tú perdonas la iniquidad y omites la rebeldía del remanente de Tu pueblo. Su ira es efímera, pues Él ama la misericordia. Él volverá a tener piedad de nosotros, hollará nuestras iniquidades. Y arrojará a las profundidades del mar todos nuestros pecados. Todos los errores de Tu pueblo Israel, habrás de arrojar a lugar remoto y recóndito para que sean olvidados para siempre. “Concederás Tu verdad a Jacob, Tu merced a Abraham. Así lo prometiste a nuestros padres en días pretéritos.” 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, forgive our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement. Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes, as it is said: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” And it is said, “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.” And it is said, “For on this day He will make atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy, you will be cleansed.” 
<i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (Our God and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest) Sanctify us with Your commandments and give us our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (And give us as our inheritance Adonoy our God with love and with pleasure Your holy Sabbath; and may Yisrael rest thereon— [they who are] sanctifiers of Your Name) and purify our hearts to serve You in truth, For You are the Pardoner of Yisrael, and the Forgiver of the tribes of Yeshurun in every generation, and beside You, we have no king who forgives and pardons, only You! Blessed are You, King Who forgives and pardons our iniquities, and the iniquities of His people, the House of Yisrael; and Who removes our trespasses each year; King over the whole earth, Sanctifier <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (of the Shabbos and) of Yisrael and the Day of Atonement. 

Avodah

<b>Be pleased,</b> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Yisrael and their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Yisrael; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Yisrael. 
<small><i>When there are no Kohanim present to recite the Priestly Blessings, the Chazzan recites the following paragraph.</i><br></small>
And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon. 
<small><b>Priestly Blessings</b></small>
<small>Even though the kohanim are commanded to bless Yisrael every day (according to some authorities) nevertheless, the custom outside the Holy Land is that kohanim bless the people only during the Musaf Service of the Festivals, and the High Holidays. One reason given is that the Priestly Blessings are pronounced only in a festive atmosphere. Thus on weekdays when people are troubled with the difficulties of earning a livelihood, and even on the Sabbath when people are disturbed by thoughts of their economic plight, the blessings are not pronounced.</small>
<small>During the Musaf Service of the Festivals, however, which precedes the festive meal of the holiday, a joyous atmosphere does prevail and the Priestly Blessing is pronounced.</small>
<small>After the Chazzan's recital of ‘רְצֵה, be pleased,' the following prayer is recited by the Congregation and kohanim, and repeated by the Chazzan:</small>
<b>May</b> our prayer be sweet unto You from behind the separation<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">The term “פַּרְגוֹד” “Pargod” refers to the separation between the sky and Hashem’s Presence, the “Shechina.” (Maseches Berachos 18b). According to the Midrash, version II, Matatron told him, “I heard from behind the ‘pargod’ a voice saying, ten of Yisrael’s scholars will be handed over to the emperor. An argument had taken place in Hashem’s Presence, between the angels, Micha’el, and Samo’el. Samo’el said, “Master of the World, You have surely not written one letter in the entire Torah for nothing, and yet it is written ‘if a man kidnaps’ etc.; and the sons of Yaakov have still not been punished for selling Yosef. Immediately Hashem decreed that ten of Yisrael’s sages would be killed.”</i> Please, Merciful One, in Your abundant mercy return Your Divine Presence to Tziyon, Your city, and the order of the [Temple] Service to Yerushalayim. And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. 
<small><i>The Chazzan concludes:</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, You alone, in reverence do we serve. 
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<b>We</b> are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<small><i>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon,” the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</i><br></small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and Holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be Your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. 
<b>Our Father,</b> our King! remember Your mercies, and suppress Your anger, and remove pestilence, sword, famine, captivity, destruction, iniquity, plague, misfortune, every disease, every stumbling-block, every contention, every type of disorder; every evil decree and groundless hatred, from us, and from all the children of Your covenant. 
<b>Inscribe</b> for a good life all the children of Your covenant. 
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise. 
<small><b>Priestly Blessings</b></small>
<small><i>The congregation and Kohanim say the following prayer silently.</i><br></small>
May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and the God of our fathers, that this blessing <br><i>When said by the kohanim:</i><br> which You have commanded us <br><i>When said by the Congregation:</i><br> which You have commanded to bless Your people Yisrael, be a perfect blessing; that there be in it neither stumbling nor iniquity from now, forever. 
<small><i>The Chazzan then says:</i><br></small>
kohanim
<small><i>The Congregation responds:</i><br></small>
Your holy people, as it is said.
<small><i>The Kohanim begin:</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with the holiness of Aharon and commanded us to bless His people, Yisrael, with love.<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">The kohanim are commanded to bless the people out of their feeling of love for the congregation of Hashem.</i> 
<small><i>The Congregation but not the Chazzan answer:</i><br></small>
Amein
<small>The Chazzan chants each word of the Birchas Kohanim and the kohanim pronounce it after Him. The Congregation should concentrate on their words, but not repeat them.</small>
May [He] bless you Adonoy and guard you. 
<small><i>While the kohanim sing an extended chant before saying וְיִשְׁמְרֶֽךָ, the congregation says the following prayer in an undertone. This prayer is not said on the Sabbath.</i><br></small>

If they are good dreams, strengthen and reinforce them and may they be fulfilled in me and in them, like the dreams of Yosef, the righteous.

<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
<b>Grant peace,</b> goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance.

And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. 
<b>In the book</b> of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. 
And it is said: “Through me [the Torah], shall your days be multiplied, and increased for you will be the years of your life.” For a good life, inscribe us, living God; inscribe us in the Book of Life, as it is written: “And You who cling to Adonoy, your God, are all alive today.”

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Yisrael before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein.

<small><i>When the Holy Ark is opened, the following is said:</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> whenever the Ark traveled Moshe would say: “Rise, Adonoy and let Your enemies be scattered, and those who hate You, flee before You.” For from Tziyon will go forth the Torah, and the word of Adonoy from Yerushalayim.

Berich Shemei

<small>The following prayer is taken from the Zohar (Parshas Vayakhail), the basic text of Kabbalah which was written by the Mishnahic sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The Zohar states, “When the Torah is taken out to be read before the congregation, the heavenly gates of mercy are opened, and the Divine love is aroused; therefore one should say the following prayer.</small>
<b>Blessed</b> is the Name of the Master of the Universe. Blessed is Your crown and Your place. May Your good will [be] with Your people Yisrael forever. The redemption of Your right hand, show Your people in Your Holy Temple. Bestow on us Your excellent light, and accept our prayer with compassion. May it be Your will to prolong our lives in well-being. Let me be counted among the righteous, so that You will have compassion on me and protect me and all that is mine, and all that belongs to Your people, Yisrael. You are He Who nourishes all and maintains all; You are He Who rules over all; You are He Who rules over kings, and the kingdom is Yours. I am a servant of the Holy One, blessed is He, I bow before Him and before the honor of His Torah at all times. Not in man do I put my trust, nor do I rely on any angel; but only in the God of heaven Who is the true God, Whose Torah is truth, Whose prophets are true, and Who performs many deeds of goodness and truth. In Him I put my trust and to His holy, honored Name I utter praises. May it be Your will to open my heart to Torah, and to fulfill the desires of my heart and of the heart of Your people Yisrael for goodness, for life, and for peace. 
<small><i>The Chazzan says:</i><br></small>
Declare the greatness of Adonoy with me, and let us exalt His Name together. 
<small><i>The Congregation responds:</i><br></small>
Yours, Adonoy, is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory, and the beauty, for everything in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours, Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He. Exalt Adonoy, Our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain for Adonoy, our God, is holy. 
May the Father of mercy have compassion on the people borne by Him, and may He remember the covenant with the patriarchs; may He rescue our souls from evil times; and may He rebuke the Evil Impulse from those who have been carried by Him; and may He graciously grant us eternal survival; and fulfill our requests in beneficent measure, [for] deliverance and compassion. 
<small><i>When the Torah is unrolled, the Reader says:</i><br></small>
May His sovereignty be revealed and visible to us, soon; and may He be gracious to our remnant and the remnant of His people, the House of Yisrael; [granting them] favor, kindness, compassion and goodwill, and let us say Amein. Let us all ascribe greatness to our God and give honor to the Torah. Let the Kohein come forward. Arise, son of , the Kohein, Blessed is He Who gave the Torah to His people, Yisrael, in His holiness.

And you who cling to Adonoy, Your God, are all alive today. 
<small><i>(The following blessings are recited by every person called to the Torah.)</i><br></small>
<small><i>The Kohein walks up to the Torah, and says:</i><br></small>

Torah Reading for Mincha Service

And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying: Speak to the children of Yisrael and say to them: I am Adonoy, your God. You shall not imitate the practice of the land of Mitzrayim where you lived nor the practice of the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you; and their statutes [customs] you shall not follow. You shall observe my mandates and preserve my statutes and follow them; I am Adonoy, your God. My statutes and My mandates, which if man obeys, he shall live through them; I am Adonoy.
No man shall come near to those of [his] close kin, to reveal their nakedness, I am Adonoy. The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you shall not reveal; she is your mother, you shall not reveal is your father's nakedness. The nakedness of your sister, [whether she is] your father's daughter, or your mother's daughter, whether she was born of a legitimate marriage or not; you shall not reveal their nakedness. The nakedness of your son's daughter or of your daughter's daughter, you shall not reveal their nakedness; for their nakedness is your own. The nakedness of the daughter of your father's wife, born to your father, she is your sister; you shall not reveal her nakedness. The nakedness of your father's sister, you shall not reveal; she is your father's close kin. The nakedness of your mother's sister, you shall not reveal, she is your mother's close kin. The nakedness of your father's brother [i.e. his wife] you shall not reveal; you shall not come near to his wife [for] she is your aunt. The nakedness of your daughter-in-law, you shall not reveal; she is your son's wife, you shall not reveal her nakedness. The nakedness of your brother's wife, you shall not reveal; it is your brother's nakedness. The nakedness of a woman and her daughter, you shall not reveal; you shall not take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter to reveal her nakedness, they are close kin, it is lewdness. You shall not take [your] wife's sister to be her rival, to reveal her nakedness, in her lifetime. You shall not come near to a woman at her time of [menstrual] uncleanliness, to reveal her nakedness. You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, to defile yourself with her. And you shall not cause any of your offspring to pass through fire [which is a form of idol worship] to Molech; and you shall not profane the Name of your God, I am Adonoy.
You shall not lie with a man [carnally] as with a woman; it is an abomination. You shall not lie with any beast to defile yourself; neither shall a woman place herself before a beast, to lie with it, it is a perversion. Do not defile yourselves by doing any of these things; for the nations which I [will] cast out from before you, are defiled by [doing] all these things. This caused the land to become defiled and I therefore caused it to punish their iniquity; and the land expelled its inhabitants. You shall preserve my statutes and my mandates, and you shall not do any of these abominable things; neither the native-born nor the stranger who lives among you. For all these abominations were practiced by the inhabitants of the land, which lived there before you, and the land is defiled. [You shall therefore take heed] that the land not expel you, should you [also] defile it, as it expelled the nation that lived there before you. For whoever practices any of these abominations; their souls shall be cut off from among their people. And you shall preserve my ordinance, not to practice any of the abominable customs which were practiced before you, and that you do not defile yourselves [by doing them], I am Adonoy, your God.
<small><i>When the reading of the Torah is concluded, the Torah is raised so that the congregation can see the script, and the congregation exclaims:</i><br></small>
<b>This</b> is the Torah which Moshe placed before the children of Yisrael. at Adonoy's command by the hand of Moshe. It is a tree of life to those who grasp to it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Long life is at its right, at its left, riches and honor. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it. 
<small><i>Berachah recited before the reading of the Haftarah:</i><br></small>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who chose good prophets, and was pleased with their words which were spoken in truth. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who chooses the Torah and Moshe, His servant, and Yisrael, His people, and the prophets of truth and righteousness. 
<small><b>Haftarah — The Book of Yonah</b></small>
<small>The afternoon Haftarah is the Book of Yonah. Its selection was prompted by the need to impress upon the worshipper that there is no escape from God's judgment, and that such judgment may only be averted by sincere repentance. The Book of Yonah also proclaims that repentance is never too late and that God's mercy knows no bounds. “Should I have no pity on Ninveh” — God asks Yonah — “that great city wherein are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well.”</small>
And the word of Adonoy came to Yonah, the son of Amittai, saying: Rise up and go to Ninveh, the great city, and call upon her; for their evil has come before Me.” And Yonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from before Adonoy,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah’s flight was not an attempt to deny or break his loyalty and dedication as Hashem’s prophet. On the contrary, because he recognized the sovereignty of Hashem, he did not want to embarrass Yisrael by the comparison of its stubborn refusal to repent, with the obedience of Ninveh, to the warning of Hashem.</i> and he went to Yaffo and found a ship bound to Tarshish and he paid the fare and boarded it to go with them to Tarshish from before Adonoy. And Adonoy sent a strong wind out to see and it became a mighty storm in the sea and the ship threatened to fall (break) apart. And the sailors were frightened, and each of them prayed to his own god and cast the ship's wares into the sea to lighten it for them. But Yonah went down to the ship's hold, and lay down and fell fast asleep. And the captain approached him and said to him: “How can you sleep now? Rise up, call upon your God. Perhaps God will give thought (pay heed) to us and we will not perish!” And they said one to another: “Let us go and cast lots so that we may know who is responsible for the trouble that has befallen us.” So they cast lots and the lot fell upon Yonah. And they said to him: “Tell us, please, why this evil has befallen us! What is your occupation and from where do you come? Where is your land and from which nation do you come?” And He said to them: “I am an Ivri and Adonoy, the God of the Heavens I fear, Who made the sea and the dry land.” Then the men were filled with great fear and they said to him: “What have you done?” For the men knew that from before Adonoy he was fleeing, for he had told them. And they said to him: What shall we do with you so that the sea will no longer threaten us—for the sea grows stormier!” And he said to them: “Pick me up and cast me into the sea, so that it will quiet down for you. For I know that it is because of me that this great storm is upon you.” Yet still the men rowed (trying) to get back to the dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more violent against them. And they called out to Adonoy and said: “Please Adonoy let us not perish because of this man and do not reckon it upon us as having shed innocent blood; for You, Adonoy, as You desired, You have done!” And they lifted Yonah and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased its raging. Then the men feared Adonoy greatly, and they offered a sacrifice to Adonoy and made vows. And Adonoy prepared a great fish to swallow Yonah, and Yonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights. And Yonah prayed to Adonoy his God, from the belly of the fish. And he said: “Out of my anguish I called to Adonoy and He answered me. From the belly of the grave I cried; You heard my voice. You cast me into the depths, into the heart of the seas, and there the river surrounded me; all of Your waves and breakers swept over me. And I had said, ‘I have been banished from Your eyes'—but, now, I shall again gaze at Your Holy Temple. The waters surrounded me to the soul, and the deep whirled around me; seaweed was wrapped about my head. To the very roots of the mountains I sank; the earth had barred itself against me forever. But You lifted me out of the deepest pit, Adonoy, my God! When my soul grew faint within me, I remembered Adonoy; and my prayer reached You—to Your Holy Temple. They that preserve vanities and futility, forsake [the Source of] their kindness. And I, with a voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You; and that which I vowed, I shall fulfill, for salvation is Adonoy's.” And Adonoy spoke to the fish; and it ejected Yonah on to the dry land. And the word of Adonoy came to Yonah a second time, saying: “Rise up and go to Ninveh, the great city, and call out to her, the proclamation which I tell you!” And Yonah rose up and went to Ninveh, as Adonoy instructed. And Ninveh was a great city to Adonoy, a three-day journey across. When he entered the city and had gone the distance of one day's journey, he called out and said: “In another forty days Ninveh will be overturned!” And the people of Ninveh believed in God and they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them. And when the word reached the king of Ninveh, he stood up from his throne and removed his robe and covered himself with sackcloth and sat on ashes. And he had an order proclaimed in Ninveh by the decrees of the king and his nobles, saying: “Man and cattle, herd and flock, are not to taste anything, nor shall they graze or drink water! And they shall cover themselves with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them call out earnestly to God, and let each man turn back from his evil way and from the robbery which is in their hands. Who knows, but Adonoy may relent and turn away from His burning wrath and we shall not perish.” And God saw their deeds, that they repented from their evil ways. And God relented about the evil which He said He would do to them and He did not do it. And Yonah was displeased and it grieved him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It grieved him that the Jewish people would not heed the prophets call for repentance as did the people of Ninveh, and he was upset over the fact that he himself helped bring about this indictment as a result of his mission to Ninveh.</i> He prayed to Adonoy and said, “Was this not my rationale when I was still on my own soil? I therefore hastened to flee to Tarshish, for I knew You are Almighty, Gracious and Merciful, Abounding in kindness and relenting of evil. And so now Adonoy, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.” And Adonoy said [to him], “Are you correct in being so grieved?” Yonah left the city and positioned himself on the east side of the city. He made a booth for himself and sat under it in the shade, waiting to see what would happen in the city. Then Adonoy, God, caused a kikayon<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi identifies kikayon as a plant of many leaves which provide shade. Ibn Ezra, identifies as a gourd.</i> to grow and rise up over Yonah, to shade his head, to alleviate his discomfort. And Yonah rejoiced greatly over the kikayon. Then God caused a worm to attack the kikayon at the dawn of the next day, and it [the kikayon] withered. At sunrise, God caused a hot—stifling east wind [to blow]; the sun beat upon Yonah's head and he felt faint. He asked for death, saying, “It is better for me to die than to live.” And God said to Yonah, “Are You correct in being so grieved over the kikayon?” And he answered, “I am so grieved that I can die.” And Adonoy said, “You had pity for the kikayon for which you did not toil nor did you cause it to grow, it sprang up overnight and it perished overnight. And I, shall I not have pity upon Ninveh, the great city of more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well?” 
<small><i>Michah 7:18-20</i><br></small>
Who is Almighty like You, Forbearer of iniquity and Forgiver of transgression to the remnant of His heritage? He does not maintain His anger forever, for He delights in lovingkindness. He will again have compassion on us, He will suppress our iniquities, and will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. You will grant truth to Yaakov, kindliness to Avraham, as You have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
<small><i>Berachos recited after the reading of the Haftarah:</i><br></small>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Rock of all the worlds, Righteous in all generations, the Almighty, the Faithful One, Who says and does, Who speaks and fulfills, for all His words are true and right. Dependable are You, Adonoy, our God, and dependable are Your words, and not one of Your words is ever retracted unfulfilled, for You are the Almighty, a King who is dependable and merciful. Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Almighty Who is dependable in all His words. 
Have compassion on Tziyon for it is the home of our life, and the one whose soul is humiliated, deliver speedily, in our days. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who causes Tziyon to rejoice with her children. 
Cause us to rejoice, Adonoy, our God, with Elijah the prophet, Your servant, and with the kingdom of the House of Dovid, Your anointed. Speedily may he come and cause our heart to exult. Upon his throne, no stranger shall sit, and others will no longer inherit his honor. For by Your Holy Name, You swore to him, that his light will never be extinguished. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Dovid. 
<small><i>The Chazzan takes the Torah and says:</i><br></small>
<b>They</b> will praise the Name of Adonoy for His Name alone is exalted.
<small><i>The congregation then says:</i><br></small>
His majesty is over the earth and the skies. He will raise the might of His people, [which is] praise for all His pious ones, for the Children of Yisrael, the people near to Him. Praise God. 
A Psalm of Dovid: the earth is Adonoy's and the fullness thereof, the inhabited world and those who dwell in it. For He founded it upon the seas, and established it upon rivers. Who may ascend the mountain of Adonoy, and who may stand in the place of His holiness? The clean of hands and the pure of heart, who has not borne My soul in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully. He will bear Adonoy's blessing and righteousness from the God of his deliverance. This is the generation of those who seek Him, the seekers of Your Presence, [God of] Yaakov, selah. Lift up your heads, gates, and be uplifted [you] entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is this King of Glory? Adonoy, strong and mighty; Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle. Lift up your heads, gates, and lift up, entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is He, this King of Glory? Adonoy Tzevaos, He is the King of Glory, selah. 
<small><i>As the Torah is returned to the Ark the following is said:</i><br></small>
And when it rested, he would say: Return, Adonoy, to the myriads and thousands of Yisrael. Arise, Adonoy unto Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your strength. Let Your priests clothe themselves in righteousness, and let Your devoted ones sing in joy. For the sake of Dovid, Your servant, do not reject Your anointed. For I have given you good instruction, do not forsake My Torah. It is a tree of life to those who grasp it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return; renew our days as of old. 
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Half-Kaddish:</i><br></small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 
You know the mysteries of the universe, and the hidden secrets of every individual. You search all our innermost thoughts, and probe our mind and heart. There is nothing hidden from You, and there is nothing concealed from Your sight. And so may it be Your will Adonoy our God and God of our fathers, that You pardon us for all our careless sins, and that You forgive us for all our deliberate sins, and that You grant us atonement for all our rebellious sins: 
<b>For the sin</b> we committed before You under compulsion and willingly. 
And for the sin we committed before You by callously hardening the heart. 
For the sin we committed before You inadvertently. 
And for the sin we committed before You with an utterance of the lips. 
For the sin we committed before You openly and secretly. 
And for the sin we committed before You in sexual immorality. 
For the sin we committed before You through [misuse of our power of] speech. 
And for the sin we committed before You with knowledge and with deceit. 
For the sin we committed before You by improper thoughts. 
And for the sin we committed before You by cheating a fellow-man. 
For the sin we committed before You with [mere] verbal confession. 
And for the sin we committed before You by joining in a lewd gathering. 
For the sin we committed before You intentionally and unintentionally. 
And for the sin we committed before You by insufficient respect for parents and teachers. 
For the sin we committed before You by using coercion [to harm others]. 
And for the sin we committed before You by desecrating the Divine Name. 
For the sin we committed before You with foolish talk. 
And for the sin we committed before You with impurity of the lips. 
For the sin we committed before You with the Evil Inclination. 
And for the sin we committed before You knowingly and unknowingly. 
And for all of these, God of pardon, pardon us, forgive us, grant us atonement. 
For the sin we committed before You by forcing someone to give or take bribes. 
And for the sin we committed before You by false denial and false promise. 
For the sin we committed before You by evil talk [slander]. 
And for the sin we committed before You by scoffing. 
For the sin we committed before You in business dealings. 
And for the sin we committed before You in eating and drinking. 
For the sin we committed before You by [taking or giving] interest and by usury. 
And for the sin we committed before You by haughtily stretching forth the neck. 
For the sin we committed before You with gazing of the eyes. 
And for the sin we committed before You by the prattle of our lips. 
For the sin we committed before You with haughty eyes. 
And for the sin we committed before You with impudence. 
And for all of these, God of pardon, pardon us, forgive us, grant us atonement. 
For the sin we committed before You by throwing off the yoke [of heaven]. 
And for the sin we committed before You in passing judgment. 
For the sin we committed before You by entrapping a fellowman. 
And for the sin we committed before You by a begrudging eye. 
For the sin we committed before You by lightmindedness. 
And for the sin we committed before You by being stiff-necked [stubborn]. 
For the sin we committed before You by running to do evil. 
And for the sin we committed before You by talebearing. 
For the sin we committed before You by swearing in vain. 
And for the sin we committed before You by unwarranted hatred. 
For the sin we committed before You by breach of trust. 
And for the sin we committed before You by a confused heart. 
And for all of these, God of pardon, pardon us, forgive us, grant us atonement. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a burnt-offering. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a sin-offering. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a “fluctuating” offering. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a guilt-offering for certain or for doubtful trespasses. 
And for sins for which we incur the penalty of lashing for violations of Rabbinic law. 
And for sins for which we incur the penalty of forty lashes. 
And for sins for which we incur the penalty of death at the hand of Heaven. 
And for sins for which we incur the penalty of excision and childlessness. 
And for sins for which we are liable to any of the four death penalties inflicted by the [Rabbinic] Court [which are]: stoning, burning, beheading or strangulation. 
For [transgressing] positive commandments, and for [transgressing] prohibitive commandments, whether the prohibition can be corrected by a specifically prescribed act, or whether it cannot be corrected by a specifically prescribed act, for those of which we are aware and for those of which we are not aware. For those of which we are aware, we have already declared before You and confessed them unto You; and for those of which we are not aware, before You they are revealed and known, as it is said, “The hidden things belong to Adonoy, our God, but the revealed things are for us and for our children forever, that we might fulfill all the words of this Torah.” For You are the Pardoner of Yisrael, and the Forgiver of the tribes of Yeshurun in every generation, and beside You, we have no King Who forgives and pardons—only You! 
God, before I was formed, I was unworthy [to be created]. And now that I have been formed, it is as if I had not been formed. I am like dust while I live, how much more so when I am dead. Here I am before You like a vessel filled with shame. May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, that I shall sin no more, and the sins I have committed before You, cleanse them in Your abundant mercies; but not through suffering and severe illness. 
My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein. 
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Yehudahim and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Reader's Repetition of the Amidah

<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i><br></small>
My Master, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise. 
<b>THE VIRTUE OF OUR FOREFATHERS</b>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Avraham, God of Yitzchak, and God of Yaakov, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children's children, for the sake of His Name, with love. 
Invoking the doctrines of our wise and understanding Sages, and with the teachings [acquired] from their perceptive intuition, I open my mouth in prayer and supplication to plead and seek favor before the presence of the King, Forgiver and Pardoner of iniquities. 
<small><i>The Ark is closed:</i><br></small>
The valiant one [Avraham] recognized Your truth,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Avraham, often referred to as אֵיתָן, the valiant one, recognized the existence and providence of Hashem at the age of three. See Maseches Nedarim 32a</i> [though he lived] in a generation that knew not how to please You.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Avraham’s generation and in fact his entire family were steeped in idolatry.</i> He rejoiced in You and taught others to fear You. He took pleasure in proclaiming Your majesty, to all mankind. Those who strayed, he led in Your path; and he was called the father of Your nation. He was diligent to obey Your word. He desired the shelter of Your Presence. He refreshed the wayfarers with Your food. He taught the penitent that there is none but You. Because he believed in You, he entreated You; He planted an aishel to proclaim Your might.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The word אֵשֶׁל has been defined as an abbreviation of the word אֲכִילָה, food, שְׁתִיָה drink, and לִנָה shelter. These were provided by Avraham to all men and he sought to win them over to the belief and acceptance of the One God.</i> 
May it be accounted to us for righteousness; through the righteousness of the Patriarch, pardon us. Do not deal with us according to our sins, You are our shield, for we hope in You. 
Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God. King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Avraham. 
<b>DIVINE MIGHT</b> 
You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the Powerful One to deliver us. Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth. 
When he who was loved, [Yitzchak], the only child of his mother, surrendered himself for an offering, the Seraphim cried out from the heavens, saying to the merciful Almighty: “Spare him.” The Redeemer and Deliverer had compassion on him; and commanded that a ram be taken in his stead. He [Avraham] heard a voice calling, “Do not shed his blood.” The merciful One hovered over him, to exalt him, He preserved him and sustained him, for His Name's sake; He made him radiant like the rising sun. Regard him on this day, as if he were offered in the Temple; recall his binding and pity his people. 
In His Presence, He will sustain us, and we shall live. Through the righteousness of the Patriarch we shall live. Adonoy causes death and restores life, with his dew, he will revive those asleep. 
Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy. And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.

He will adorn the humble, who knock [at His gates] with prayers of penitence, from early in the morning. With His goodness and pardon, He agrees to their request. May He cause them to hear— “The downtrodden will not be ashamed.” May this be said to those who wait hopefully. 
<small><i>Chazzan and congregation:</i><br></small>
Adonoy will reign forever; your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations! Praise God. And You, Holy One, are enthroned upon the praises of Yisrael. Almighty, we beseech You. 
The people [Yisrael] who preserve its faith, for Your sake, help their remnant, accept their cry as an incense-offering. Holy One! 
Atone and pardon Almighty, Who is beneficent and ready to pardon Awesome and Holy One! 
From the heavens, may our prayer be accepted as sacrificial offerings Almighty, Holy One. 
[The angel] Michael [sings] praises at His right, Gabriel acclaims at His left [saying]: In heaven, there is none like the Almighty, and on the earth there is none like Your people Yisrael.” 





as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And they called one to another and said: 

Kedushah

<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan</i><br></small>
‘Holy, holy, holy is Adonoy Tzevaos, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.'” 
His glory fills the world, His ministering angels ask one another— “Where is the place of His glory?” those facing them say, “Blessed.” 
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan</i><br></small>
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from His place.” 
From His place, He will turn in compassion and favor the people who proclaim the Oneness of His Name evening and morning, each day continually twice each day, with love, they recite, “Shema.” 
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan</i><br></small>
Hear Yisrael, Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One. 
He is our God, He is our Father, He is our King, He is our Deliverer, and He will let us hear in His mercy a second time in the presence of all the living [His promise] “to be your God.” “I am Adonoy, your God.” 
Mighty One, our Mighty One, Adonoy, our Master, How mighty is Your Name throughout the earth. And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One, and His Name One. 
<small><i>The Chazzan says:</i><br></small>
And in Your holy words it is written:
<small><i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats</i><br></small>
“Adonoy will reign forever; your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations; praise God.” 
<small><i>The Chazzan concludes</i><br></small>
From generation to generation we will declare Your greatness, and to all eternity we will sanctify Your holiness; and Your praise, our God will not depart from our mouth forever and ever; because You are the Almighty Who is King, Great and Holy! 
<b>Have</b> compassion upon Your works, and rejoice in Your works; and let those who trust in You say— when You justify those borne by You— “Be sanctified, [our] Master over all Your works.” For those who sanctify You are themselves hallowed in Your holiness; becoming to the Holy One is the glory of those who are holy. 
<b>When</b> there is no one to plead [our] righteousness against the testimony of the accuser, speak on behalf of Yaakov regarding the statute and law, and make us righteous with justice, [You, Who are the] King of justice. 
<b>It</b> will yet be remembered in our behalf,— the love of Avraham,— by our Master; and for the sake of the son [Yitzchak] who let himself be bound on the altar, he will put an end to our struggle; and in the merit of the perfect one [Yaakov], the Revered One will bring forth our judgment to a righteous conclusion; for this day is holy to our Master. 
<b>And thus</b> may Your Name be hallowed Adonoy, our God, over Yisrael, Your people, over Yerushalayim, Your city, over Tziyon, the dwelling place of Your glory, over the kingship of the House of Dovid, Your anointed, and over Your [holy] Dwelling, and Your Sanctuary. 
<b>And so,</b> grant that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works, and Your dread upon all You have created; and [then] all [Your] works will fear You, and prostrate before You will be all [Your] created beings. And may they all form a single band to do Your will with a perfect heart. For we know Adonoy, our God that rulership is Yours, strength is in Your hand, might is in Your right hand and Your Name is awesome over all You have created. 
<b>And so,</b> grant honor, Adonoy, to Your people, praise to those who fear You, good hope to those who seek You confident speech to those who yearn for You, joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days. 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice, and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 
<b>SANCTIFICATION OF THE DAY</b>
<b>You</b> chose us from [among] all the peoples; You loved us and took pleasure in us; You exalted us above all tongues, and You sanctified us with Your commandments; You drew us near, our King, to Your servitude and Your great and Holy Name, You have pronounced upon us. 
<b>And</b> You gave us Adonoy, our God, in love, <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (this Shabbos Day and) this Day of Atonement, for forgiveness, pardon and atonement, and to forgive thereon all our iniquities; <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (with love) a day of holy assembly commemorating the exodus from Mitzrayim. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of Dovid, Your servant; the remembrance of Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Yisrael, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for life and peace on this Day of Atonement. Remember us Adonoy, our God on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty, Who is King, Gracious and Merciful. 
<b>Remember</b> Your mercies, Adonoy and Your kindnesses, for they are from the beginning of the world. Remember not the sins of our ancestors; let Your compassion come swiftly toward us, for we have been brought very low. Remember us Adonoy with favor for Your people recall us with Your deliverance. Remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, You have redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, this mountain of Tziyon where You have dwelled. Remember, Adonoy, the affection of Yerushalayim, the love of Tziyon, forget not until eternity. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom, the day of Yerushalayim, [it was they] who said, “Raze it, raze it to its very foundations.” You will arise and have compassion on Tziyon, for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come. Remember Avraham, Yitzchak, Yisrael, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your very Self, and You said to them: “I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have promised, I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.” Remember Your servants, Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov; do not regard the stubborness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin

For we are Your people; and You are our God. We are Your children; and You are our Father. We are Your servants; and You are our Master. We are Your congregation; and You are our Portion. We are Your inheritance; and You are our Destiny. We are Your flock; and You are our Shepherd. We are Your vineyard; and You are our Keeper. We are Your work; and You are our Creator. We are Your dear ones and You are our Beloved. We are Your treasure; and You are our God. We are Your people; and You are our King. We are Your distinguished ones; and You are our Distinction. 
We are brazen-faced; and You are merciful and gracious. We are stiff-necked; and You are slow to anger. We are full of iniquity; and You are full of compassion. Our days are like a passing shadow; and You are the same and Your years will not end. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
We have acted wickedly and have transgressed; we have therefore not been delivered. Grant that our hearts [be inspired to] abandon the path of wickedness, and hasten our deliverance; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “Let the wicked man abandon his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto Adonoy, and He will have compassion on him, and unto our God for He pardons abundantly.” 
Our God, and God of our fathers! Forgive and pardon our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos say:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement, and permit Yourself to be petitioned by our prayer. Blot out and remove our transgressions from before Your eyes, and compel our Evil Inclination to be subservient to You, and subdue our stubborness, that we may return to You in truth; and renew our conscience that we may preserve Your precepts. Open our hearts that we may love and fear Your Name, as it is written in Your Torah: “And Adonoy, Your God will open Your heart, and the heart of your descendants to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.” 
Our intentional and our unintentional sins— You recognize— [those committed] willfully or by compulsion, [those committed] openly or secretly— before Your Presence, they are [all] revealed and known. What are we? What is our life? What are our acts of kindness? What is our righteousness? What is our deliverance? What is our strength? What is our might? What can we say before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nothing before You? Famous men as though they had never been? The wise as if they were without knowledge? And men of understanding as if they were devoid of intelligence? For most of their actions are a waste and the days of their life are trivial in Your presence. The superiority of man over beast is nil for all is futile. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. <b>Your Name</b> was always the “forbearer of transgression,” give ear to our plea as we stand before You in prayer. Forbear the transgression of a people who repent [their] transgression; blot out our transgression from before Your eyes. 
You know the mysteries of the universe, and the hidden secrets of every individual. You search all our innermost thoughts, and probe our mind and heart. There is nothing hidden from You, and there is nothing concealed from Your sight. And so may it be Your will Adonoy our God and God of our fathers, that You pardon us for all our careless sins, and that You forgive us for all our deliberate sins, and that You grant us atonement for all our rebellious sins:

For the sin we committed before You by swearing in vain. 
And for the sin we committed before You by unwarranted hatred. 
For the sin we committed before You by breach of trust.

And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a burnt-offering. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a sin-offering. 
And for sins for which we are obligated to bring a “fluctuating” offering.

For [transgressing] positive commandments, and for [transgressing] prohibitive commandments, whether the prohibition can be corrected by a specifically prescribed act, or whether it cannot be corrected by a specifically prescribed act, for those of which we are aware and for those of which we are not aware. For those of which we are aware, we have already declared before You and confessed them unto You; and for those of which we are not aware, before You they are revealed and known, as it is said, “The hidden things belong to Adonoy, our God, but the revealed things are for us and for our children forever, that we might fulfill all the words of this Torah.”
 Dovid, Your servant, said before You, “Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me.” Cleanse us, Adonoy, our God, from all our transgressions, and purify us from all our defilement. Sprinkle clean waters on us and cleanse us, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your defilements, and from all your idols, I will cleanse you.”
No temas, oh Jacob, retornad de vuestra rebeldía; retorna, oh Israel. Pues he aquí que no duerme ni dormita el guardián de Israel. Así dijo Tu profeta: Retorna, oh Israel, a Adonai tu Dios, pues has tropezado por tus errores. Proveéos de palabras, y volved a Adonai. Decidle: “Perdona nuestros delitos y acepta el bien. Te ofreceremos las palabras de nuestros labios a modo de ofrenda”. Tú eres clemente, oh Dios, aceptas el arrepentimiento de los que retornan a Ti. Tú nos aseguraste aceptar nuestro arrepentimiento, pues por eso depositamos nuestra esperanza en el arrepentimiento que Tú estableciste. Es por Tu amor Adonai, Dios nuestro, que conferiste a Tu pueblo Israel, y por la compasión que otorgaste a todos Tus hijos, que nos concediste Adonai, Dios nuestro este Día (de Shabat para santidad y quietud y este día) del Perdón, para absolver todos nuestros errores y culpas.

... Hazlo por Tu nombre, oh Dios clemente y misericordioso, oye nuestras oraciones.
... Hazlo por Tu nombre, oh Dios clemente y misericordioso, oye nuestras oraciones.

Oh Dios Todopoderoso, Tus obras son magnas. Tú revelaste los profundos pensamientos de Tu Torá, pues Tu palabra es la rectitud. Tus obras, oh Protector, son perfectas, magna es Tu misericordia. Tú eres benévolo con Tu pueblo, Tu justicia siempre nos ampara. Pues así dijo Tu profeta: “¿Quién Te iguala, oh Dios?”. Tú perdonas la iniquidad y omites la rebeldía del remanente de Tu pueblo. Su ira es efímera, pues Él ama la misericordia. Él volverá a tener piedad de nosotros, hollará nuestras iniquidades. Y arrojará a las profundidades del mar todos nuestros pecados. Todos los errores de Tu pueblo Israel, habrás de arrojar a lugar remoto y recóndito para que sean olvidados para siempre. “Concederás Tu verdad a Jacob, Tu merced a Abraham. Asi lo prometiste a nuestros padres en días pretéritos. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, forgive our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement. Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes, as it is said: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” And it is said, “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.” And it is said, “For on this day He will make atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy, you will be cleansed.”

(You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<small><i>When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon,” the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.</i><br></small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning.

Our Father, our King! remember Your mercies, and suppress Your anger, and remove pestilence, sword, famine, captivity, destruction, iniquity, plague, misfortune, every disease, every stumbling-block, every contention, every type of disorder; every evil decree and groundless hatred, from us, and from all the children of Your covenant. 
Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant. 
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise.

Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you. Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace. 
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance.

Avinu Malkenu

<small>This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (Taanis 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered.

Neilah; Concluding Service

Ashrei

<small>The concluding Service of Yom Kippur forms the climax of Jewish devotion on this holiest day of the year. The literal meaning of the word Neilah is “the closing of the gates.” In ancient times, there was a daily prayer in the Temple just before the closing of the gates in the evening. Outside the Temple there was a similar closing prayer on public fast-days. At the urging of Rav, who had a decisive influence on the Yom Kippur liturgy, this special prayer was instituted in the form of a new Amidah. In later times the word neilah was taken to mean “closing of the Heavenly Gates.” Thus we have the prayer, “Open for us the gate at the time of closing the gate, for the day has declined.” The key-note of the Neilah Service is the prayer אַתָּה נוֹתֵן יַד, “You are willing to meet even [those who deliberately transgressed Your Law]. You give them the call and the opportunity to return to You, and You are ready at all times to receive those who return. Let no one, therefore say, “it is too late.”</small>
<b>Fortunate</b> are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by Dovid! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works, and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak, and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your Kingship, they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His Kingship. Your Kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him, He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare and all flesh will bless His Holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now forever. Praise God. 
<b>The Redeemer</b> shall come to Tziyon and to those of Yaakov who repent from sin, says Adonoy. As for Me, this is My covenant with them, said Adonoy: My spirit which is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your children, nor from the mouth of your children's children, said Adonoy— from now to eternity. And You, Holy One, are enthroned upon the praises of Yisrael. And [the angels] call one to another and say: “Holy, holy, holy is Adonoy of Hosts: the fullness of all the earth is His glory.” And they receive [sanction] one from another, and say, “Holy in the highest heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His mighty power; holy forever and to all eternity— is Adonoy of Hosts; the whole earth is filled with the radiance of His glory.” And a wind lifted me; and I heard behind me the sound of a great rushing; “Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from His place.” “And a wind lifted me and I heard behind me a sound of a great rushing of those who uttered praises and said, “Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from the place, the abode of His Divine Presence.” Adonoy will reign forever and ever. Adonoy, His Kingdom is established forever and to all eternity. Adonoy, God of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yisrael, our fathers, keep this forever as the intention of the hearts of Your people, and direct their hearts to You. And He, the merciful One, atones iniquity and does not destroy; He frequently withdraws His anger and does not arouse all His rage. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You. Your righteousness is everlasting and Your Torah is truth. You will grant truth to Yaakov kindliness to Avraham, as You have sworn to our fathers from the days of old. Blessed is my Master day by day; He loads us, [with blessings] the Almighty Who is our deliverance, forever. Adonoy of Hosts is with us a stronghold for us is the God of Yaakov, selah. Adonoy of Hosts, fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver [us]; the King will answer us on the day we call. Blessed is He, our God, Who created us for His glory, and set us apart from those who go astray; and gave us the Torah of truth, and eternal life He implanted within us. May He open our heart to His Torah, and instill in our heart love and awe of Him, to do His will and serve Him with a perfect heart, so that we shall not labor in vain nor bring forth that which causes dismay. May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, that we keep Your statutes in this world, and [thus] be privileged to live and behold, and to inherit the goodness and blessing of the Messianic days and in the life of the World to Come. In order that my soul sing to You and not be stilled; Adonoy, my God, forever will I thank You. Blessed is the man who trusts in Adonoy, so that Adonoy is his security. Trust in Adonoy until the end of days, for in God, Adonoy, is the strength of the worlds. Those who know your Name will trust in You, for You have never forsaken those who seek You, Adonoy. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it. 
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the following Half-Kaddish:</i><br></small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world and say Amein. 

Amidah for Neilah

When I proclaim Adonoy's Name attribute greatness to our God. 
My Master, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise. 
<b>THE VIRTUE OF OUR FOREFATHERS</b>

Remember us for life King, Who desires life; 
<b>and seal us in the Book of Life,</b> for Your sake, Living God. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing, you should recite it. If you have already said “Blessed are You, Adonoy,” you must continue the prayers without saying “Remember.”</i><br></small>
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Avraham. 
<b>DIVINE MIGHT</b> 
You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the Powerful One to deliver us. Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth. 
Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning “Remember us for life.”</i><br></small>
And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead. 
<b>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</b> 
You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. 
<b>And so,</b> grant that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works, and Your dread upon all You have created; and [then] all [Your] works will fear You, and prostrate before You will be all [Your] created beings. And may they all form a single band to do Your will with a perfect heart. For we know Adonoy, our God that rulership is Yours, strength is in Your hand, might is in Your right hand and Your Name is awesome over all You have created. 
<b>And so,</b> grant honor, Adonoy, to Your people, praise to those who fear You, good hope to those who seek You confident speech to those who yearn for You, joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days. 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice, and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 
<b>SANCTIFICATION OF THE DAY</b>

<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of Dovid, Your servant; the remembrance of Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Yisrael, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for life and peace on this Day of Atonement. Remember us Adonoy, our God on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty, Who is King, Gracious and Merciful. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, forgive our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement. Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes, as it is said: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” And it is said, “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.” And it is said, “For on this day He will make atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy, you will be cleansed.”

<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
<b>Be pleased,</b> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Yisrael and their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Yisrael; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Yisrael. And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon. 
<small><i>At the words, We are thankful, bend forward; at Adonoy return to an upright position.</i><br></small>
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<b>We</b> are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. 
<b>And seal for a good life</b> all the children of Your covenant.
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</i><br></small>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise. 
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
<b>Grant peace,</b> goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. 
In the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and sealed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah.</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>(others conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace.) 
May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 
<b>You</b> reach out Your hand to transgressors, and Your right hand is extended to receive those who [truly] repent. You have taught us, Adonoy, our God, to confess before You all our iniquities so that we may refrain from the injustice of our hands; so that You will accept us in perfect repentance before You, [as You would accept] fire-offerings and sweet savours, for the sake of Your word which You spoke.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Hashem’s promise, made through the prophets, that He will accept Yisrael’s whole-hearted repentance.</i> There is no end to the fire-offerings required [to atone] for our faults, and there is no number for the sacrifices, required [to atone] for our guilt. But You know that our ultimate end is the worm, and therefore You have increased the means of our pardon. What are we? What is our life? What are our acts of kindness? What is our righteousness? What is our deliverance? What is our strength? What is our might? What can we say before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nothing before You? Famous men as though they had never been? The wise as if they were without knowledge? And men of understanding as if they were devoid of intelligence? For most of their actions are a waste and the days of their life are trivial in Your presence. The superiority of man over the beast is nil for all is futile. 
<b>[Nevertheless],</b> You have set man apart from the beginning, and recognized him [as worthy] to stand before You. For who could tell You what You should do, and even if he be righteous, what [benefit] does he give You? And You, Adonoy, our God, gave us with love, this Day of Atonement to be the end [of sin] forgiveness, and pardon for all our iniquities, so that we may refrain from the injustice of our hands; and return to You, to fulfill the statutes of Your will with a perfect heart. And You in Your abundant mercy, have compassion on us, for You do not desire the destruction of the world; as it is stated: “Seek Adonoy while He may be found, call to Him while He is near.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshaya 55:6</i> And it is said: “Let the wicked abandon his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts, and let him return to Adonoy and He will have compassion on him, and to our God, for He pardons abundantly.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshaya 55:7</i> And You, God of pardon, are gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abundant in kindness and truth, and abounding in goodness. You want the repentance of the wicked, and do not desire their death. As it is stated: “Say to them, as truly as I live, declares the Master, Adonoy, I have no desire for the death of the wicked, but only that the wicked return from his [evil] path and live; And it is said, “Return, return, from your evil ways, why should you die House of Yisrael?”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkel 33:11</i> And it is said, “Do I desire the death of the wicked? declares the Master, Adonoy; [I desire rather]that he return from his [evil] way and live.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkel 18:23</i> And it is said: “For I do not desire the death of him who deserves death, declares the Master, Adonoy; [therefore] return and live.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkel 18:32</i> For You are the Pardoner of Yisrael, and the Forgiver of the tribes of Yeshurun in every generation; and besides You we have no King Who forgives and pardons only You. 
God, before I was formed, I was unworthy [to be created]. And now that I have been formed, it is as if I had not been formed. I am like dust while I live, how much more so when I am dead. Here I am before You like a vessel filled with shame. May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, that I shall sin no more, and the sins I have committed before You, cleanse them in Your abundant mercies; but not through suffering and severe illness. 
My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein. 
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Yehudah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years. 

Reader's Repetition of the Amidah

<small><i>The Ark is opened for the entire service</i><br></small>
My Master, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise. 
<b>THE VIRTUE OF OUR FOREFATHERS</b>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Avraham, God of Yitzchak, and God of Yaakov, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children's children, for the sake of His Name, with love. 
Invoking the doctrines of our wise and understanding Sages, and with the teachings [acquired] from their perceptive intuition, I open my mouth in prayer and supplication to plead and seek favor before the presence of the King, Forgiver and Pardoner of iniquities. 
Our father [Avraham] knew You from his youth, You put him to the test ten times, he did not trespass even a hairsbreadth. He came to entreat You, as a youth, and not as one who is uninstructed, to let his descendants enter this gate. 
The faithful have come to praise You, they praised You all day; now as the day declines, shield us through the righteous [merits] of [Avraham] who sat waiting for wayfarers, in the heat of the day. Remember us for life King, Who desires life; 
<b>and seal us in the Book of Life,</b> for Your sake, Living God. King, 
Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Avraham. 
<b>DIVINE MIGHT</b> 
You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the Powerful One to deliver us. Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth. 
[Yitzchak] was called his father's heir, and turned away the snares of evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He abandoned the company of Avimelech. See Midrash, Bereishis Rabba, 64:2</i> He cried, he pleaded, sparing no prayer, there was great blessing in his crops.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereishis 26:12, “And Yitzchok sowed in the land and received in that year a hundred-fold, and Adonoy blessed him.”</i> 
God! Let Your Name be intermingled with ours, and bring near Your deliverance for us. Redeem us quickly— revive us with Your dew, as You revived him who prayed at evening. 
Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy. 
And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead. 
The radiant image of the patriarch Jacob, God, has engraved on His glorious throne. When waking up from the vision of him, Jacob, shaken and trembling, said: "How venerable is this place."
<small><i>Chazzan and congregation:</i><br></small>
Adonoy will reign forever; your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations! Praise God. And You, Holy One, are enthroned upon the praises of Yisrael. Almighty, we beseech You. 
Hear us, we beseech You, please pardon us this day, even now as the day declines; and we will praise You, Awesome and Mighty One, Holy are You. 
And thus unto You may [our] sanctification ascend, for You our God are King, Forgiver and Pardoner. 
<small>Composed by Eleazar Kalir <br><i>Congregation:</i> <br></small>O God, open the gates of Your Sanctuary; for them, Your children, who meditate on Your truth. O God, open the hidden doors; for them, Your children, who cling to Your belief. O God, open the beautiful doors of Your Sanctuary; for them, Your children who are gathered before You. O God, open the gates of heaven, residence of Your angelic hosts, for them, Your children, pure in their faith. O God, open the doors of purity, for Your pure people, with the beauty of their faith. O God, open the doors of Your Kingdom, and of Your truth; for them, Your children, who place their hopes in You. They, therefore, will sanctify and adore You. As do the angelic hosts that proclaim Your Holiness.
as it is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And they called one to another and said: 

Kedushah

<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan</i><br></small>
‘Holy, holy, holy is Adonoy Tzevaos, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.'” 
His glory fills the world, His ministering angels ask one another— “Where is the place of His glory?” those facing them say, “Blessed.” 
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan</i><br></small>
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from His place.” 
From His place, He will turn in compassion and favor the people who proclaim the Oneness of His Name evening and morning, each day continually twice each day, with love, they recite, “Shema.” 
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan</i><br></small>
Hear Yisrael, Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One. 
He is our God, He is our Father, He is our King, He is our Deliverer, and He will let us hear in His mercy a second time in the presence of all the living [His promise] “to be your God.” “I am Adonoy, your God.” 
<small><i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats</i><br></small>
Mighty One, our Mighty One, Adonoy, our Master, How mighty is Your Name throughout the earth. And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One, and His Name One. 
<small><i>The Chazzan says:</i><br></small>
And in Your holy words it is written:
<small><i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats</i><br></small>
“Adonoy will reign forever; your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations; praise God.” 
<small><i>The Chazzan concludes</i><br></small>
From generation to generation we will declare Your greatness, and to all eternity we will sanctify Your holiness; and Your praise, our God will not depart from our mouth forever and ever; because You are the Almighty Who is king, Great and Holy! 
<b>Have</b> compassion upon Your works, and rejoice in Your works; and let those who trust in You say— when You justify those borne by You— “Be sanctified, [our] Master over all Your works.” For those who sanctify You are themselves hallowed in Your holiness; becoming to the Holy One is the glory of those who are holy. 
When there is no one to plead [our] righteousness against the testimony of the accuser, speak on behalf of Yaakov regarding the statute and law, and make us righteous with justice, [You, Who are the] King of justice. It will yet be remembered on our behalf,— the love of Avraham,— by our Master; and for the sake of the son [Yitzchak] who let himself be bound on the altar, He will put an end to our struggle; and in the merit of the perfect one [Yaakov], the Revered One will bring forth our judgment to a righteous conclusion; for this day is holy to our Master. 
<b>And thus,</b> may Your Name be hallowed Adonoy, our God, over Yisrael, Your people, over Yerushalayim, Your city, over Tziyon, the dwelling place of Your glory, over the kingship of the House of Dovid, Your anointed, and over Your [holy] Dwelling, and Your Sanctuary. 
<b>And so,</b> grant that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works, and Your dread upon all You have created; and [then] all [Your] works will fear You, and prostrate before You will be all [Your] created beings. And may they all form a single band to do Your will with a perfect heart. For we know Adonoy, our God that rulership is Yours, strength is in Your hand, might is in Your right hand and Your Name is awesome over all You have created. 
<b>And so,</b> grant honor, Adonoy, to Your people, praise to those who fear You, good hope to those who seek You confident speech to those who yearn for You, joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days. 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice, and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 

Sanctification of the Day

<b>You</b> chose us from [among] all the peoples; You loved us and took pleasure in us; You exalted us above all tongues, and You sanctified us with Your commandments; You drew us near, our King, to Your servitude and Your great and Holy Name, You have pronounced upon us. 
<b>And</b> You gave us Adonoy, our God, in love, <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (this Shabbos Day and) this Day of Atonement, for forgiveness, pardon and atonement, and to forgive thereon all our iniquities; <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (with love) a day of holy assembly commemorating the exodus from Mitzrayim. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of Dovid, Your servant; the remembrance of Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Yisrael, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for life and peace on this Day of Atonement. Remember us Adonoy, our God on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty, Who is King, Gracious and Merciful.

Who could live if You preserved sin? Who could exist if You executed sentence? Pardon is Yours, “I have pardoned” is Your word. Compassion is also Yours, Your attribute is mercy. Look upon our crushing poverty and do not disgrace us. Grant us knowledge to know Your ways fulfill our desire. Endow both young and old with intelligence, those who are mighty [to do Your will]— may it be Your will to grant them strength and might. In Your shadow, shelter all who repent, receive them as a free-will offering. Let them flourish in Your House, and sorrow no more. [For] those who are lost and dispersed, abolish [their] oppressors. Then they will go up and appear with a generous spirit.

Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity, and transgression, and sin; and Acquitter of those who repent. “And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.” Pardon us our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us our King, for we have transgressed. “For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.” 
Many are the needs of Your people but their mentality is shrunken— their wants and wishes, they are unable to declare. We beseech You therefore, understand our thoughts before we call, [You Who are] the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, and the Awesome. 
Consumed and vanished are those who knew how to pray, the order of prayers, they eloquently expressed. We have been left [spiritually] naked and evil has increased, we have therefore not achieved deliverance. 
We lack the courage to plead before You. We have transgressed, and rebelled, and corrupted [our] ways. Therefore, your righteousness is all we seek with the order of our praise [prayers], we who stand in the House of Adonoy— in the evenings. 
<small><i>Some add “Almighty! King!” here:</i><br></small>
Holy One, behold, they have vanished those who were fit to plead [before You]; accept my words as a great offering, may my prayer this day be attached to Your crown, Almighty, Who is girded with power. 
Regard my plea, and may my prayer be pleasant, hear my supplication, [accept it] as though it is perfect and proper. Inscribe us for life, and make good for us, the seal, [God] Who suspends the earth in space.

He removes their sins one by one, increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors.

You instructed us to recite the thirteen Divine attributes; and remember unto us this day the covenant of thirteen Divine attributes, as You made them known to the humble Moshe of old, as it is written, “And Adonoy descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name, Adonoy.

<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers! Pardon us, forgive us, atone for us. 
<i>Chazzan and congregation responsively:</i><br> For we are Your people; and You are our God. We are Your children; and You are our Father. We are Your servants; and You are our Master. We are Your congregation; and You are our Portion. We are Your inheritance; and You are our Destiny. We are Your flock; and You are our Shepherd. We are Your vineyard; and You are our Keeper. We are Your work; and You are our Creator. We are Your dear ones and You are our Beloved. We are Your treasure; and You are our God. We are Your people; and You are our King. We are Your distinguished ones; and You are our Distinction. 
We are brazen-faced; and You are merciful and gracious. We are stiff-necked; and You are slow to anger. We are full of iniquity; and You are full of compassion. Our days are like a passing shadow; and You are the same and Your years will not end. 
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, “We are righteous and have not sinned.” But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned. 
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken others' possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; We have joined with evil individuals or groups; We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; we have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God's Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that our suffering is caused by our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע, [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray. 
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly. 
What shall we say before You, Who dwells on high; and what shall we relate to You Who dwells in the heavens? For everything, both hidden and revealed, You know. 
<b>You</b> reach out Your hand to transgressors, and Your right hand is extended to receive those who [truly] repent. You have taught us, Adonoy, our God, to confess before You all our iniquities so that we may refrain from the injustice of our hands; so that You will accept us in perfect repentance before You, [as You would accept] fire-offerings and sweet savours, for the sake of Your word which You spoke. There is no end to the fire-offerings required [to atone] for our faults, and there is no number for the sacrifices, required [to atone] for our guilt. But You know that our ultimate end is the worm, and therefore You have increased the means of our pardon. What are we? What is our life? What are our acts of kindness? What is our righteousness? What is our deliverance? What is our strength? What is our might? What can we say before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nothing before You? Famous men as though they had never been? The wise as if they were without knowledge? And men of understanding as if they were devoid of intelligence? For most of their actions are a waste and the days of their life are trivial in Your presence. The superiority of man over the beast is nil for all is futile. 
<b>[Nevertheless],</b> You have set man apart from the beginning, and recognized him [as worthy] to stand before You. For who could tell You what You should do, and even if he be righteous, what [benefit] does he give You? And You, Adonoy, our God, gave us with love, this Day <br><i>On Shabbos the Chazzan adds:</i><br> of Shabbos, and this Day) of Atonement to be the end [of sin] forgiveness, and pardon for all our iniquities, so that we may refrain from the injustice of our hands; and return to You, to fulfill the statutes of Your will with a perfect heart. And You in Your abundant mercy, have compassion on us, for You do not desire the destruction of the world; as it is stated: “Seek Adonoy while He may be found, call to Him while He is near.” And it is said: “Let the wicked abandon his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts, and let him return to Adonoy and He will have compassion on him, and to our God, for He pardons abundantly.” And You, God of pardon, are gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abundant in kindness and truth, and abounding in goodness. You want the repentance of the wicked, and do not desire their death. As it is stated: “Say to them, as truly as I live, declares the Master, Adonoy, I have no desire for the death of the wicked, but only that the wicked return from his [evil] path and live; And it is said, “Return, return, from your evil ways, why should you die House of Yisrael?” And it is said, “Do I desire the death of the wicked? declares the Master, Adonoy; [I desire rather] that he return from his [evil] way and live.” And it is said: “For I do not desire the death of him who deserves death, declares the Master, Adonoy; [therefore] return and live.” For You are the Pardoner of Yisrael, and the Forgiver of the tribes of Yeshurun in every generation; and besides You we have no King Who forgives and pardons only You. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, forgive our iniquities <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (on this Shabbos day, and) on this Day of Atonement. Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes, as it is said: “I, I [alone] am He Who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and your sins, I will not recall.” And it is said, “I have swept away like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a mist your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.” And it is said, “For on this day He will make atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy, you will be cleansed.” 
<i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (Our God and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest) Sanctify us with Your commandments and give us our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (And give us as our inheritance Adonoy our God with love and with pleasure Your holy Sabbath; and may Yisrael rest thereon— [they who are] sanctifiers of Your Name) and purify our hearts to serve You in truth, For You are the Pardoner of Yisrael, and the Forgiver of the tribes of Yeshurun in every generation, and beside You, we have no king who forgives and pardons, only You! Blessed are You, King Who forgives and pardons our iniquities, and the iniquities of His people, the House of Yisrael; and Who removes our trespasses each year; King over the whole earth, Sanctifier <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (of the Shabbos and) of Yisrael and the Day of Atonement.

(You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<small><i>When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon,” the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.</i><br></small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and Holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. 
Our Father, our King! remember Your mercies, and suppress Your anger, and remove pestilence, sword, famine, captivity, destruction, iniquity, plague, misfortune, every disease, every stumbling-block, every contention, every type of disorder; every evil decree and groundless hatred, from us, and from all the children of Your covenant. 
<b>And seal for a good life</b> all the children of Your covenant. 
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise. 
<b>Priestly Blessings</b> Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing, of the Torah written by the hand of Moshe, Your servant, pronounced from the mouth of Aharon and his sons, the kohanim, Your holy people; as it is said: Adonoy bless you and guard you. Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you. Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace. 
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
<b>Grant peace,</b> goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. 
In the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and sealed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>(others conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace.) 

Avinu Malkenu

<small>This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (Taanis 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered. Rabbi Akiva stepped down after him and exclaimed, “Our Father, our King, we have no king except You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake have mercy on us,” and rain fell. This prayer is recited during Neilah even if Yom Kippur falls on the Shabbos.</small>
