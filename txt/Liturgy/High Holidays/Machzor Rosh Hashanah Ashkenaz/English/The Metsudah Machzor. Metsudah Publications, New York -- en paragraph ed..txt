Machzor Rosh Hashanah Ashkenaz

Annullment of Vows

<small>The Talmud (Maseches Nedarim) says, “Whoever does not want his vows, made during the year, to remain in force, should declare: “Any vows that I make during the coming year are hereby nullified.” The Tur writes that it has become a widespread custom to recite the “Kol Nidrei” before Yom Kippur for the purpose of nullifying all such vows. He further writes that since זְרִיזִין מַקְדִימִין לְמִצְוֹת, the diligent come early to perform their religious duties. It is commendable to invalidate one’s vows before Rosh Hashana with the declaration contained in the “הַתָּרַת נְדָרִים,” the Annulment of Vows.</small>
<small>The Talmud and Halachic sources explain that the annulment of vows or oaths, applies only to those which one imposed on himself, such as, “I will eat” or “I will not eat”; “I will sleep” or “I will not sleep,” and other such vows or oaths. But for that which one vows or swears to his fellow, or if someone places him under oath, regardless of that person’s nationality or religion, no annulment, invalidation or absolvement is ever possible.</small>
<small>One should therefore stand before a minimum of three adult males and declare:</small>
Listen my masters, expert judges! Any vow, oath, or prohibition, konom-vow,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud, a vow is when one says that such is forbidden to me as is—a קָרְבָּן, a sacrifice. In place of the word korban, the word konom was frequently used. There is a dispute in Maseches Nedarim as to the origin of the word.</i> or consecration, that I have vowed or sworn, while awake or [even] in a dream, or which I swore [using] any of the hallowed Names [of God], [those] which are forbidden to be erased, or in the Ineffible Name of God, blessed is He; or any form of abstinence that I have accepted upon myself, even the nazirite abstinence of Shimshon, or any prohibition; even a prohibition to derive benefit, which I have imposed upon myself or upon others, by any expression of prohibition, whether as an expression of prohibition, consecration or konom-vow, or any type of commitment, even a commitment to perform a “mitzvah” whether in the form of a vow or as a free-will option, as an oath or abstinence, or in any other form; and also such commitments which were confirmed with a hand-shake; any vow or free-will option and any customs based on commandments which I have already practiced, and any expression I may have uttered, vowed or resolved in my heart, even to perform a certain commandment, or any good practice, or any worthwhile endeavor, which I performed three times but did not expressly state that I am doing so without the imposition of a vow, whether it is a commitment concerning myself, or concerning others, both those which are known to me or those which I have already forgotten— regarding all of these— I regret them in retrospect. And now I ask and request your excellencies for nullification for them, because I am afraid that I might stumble and become entangled God forbid, in the sin of [violating] vows, oaths, consecrations, prohibitions, konom-vows, or agreements. I do not regret, God forbid, the performance of good deeds which I have done, but I regret only my commitment to do these things in the form of a vow, oath, abstinence, prohibition, consecration; konom-vow, agreement, or resolutions. I regret therefore that I did not explicitly state, “I will do this thing without assuming the obligation of a vow, oath, abstinence, consecration, prohibition, konom-vow, or resolution. Therefore, I ask for annulment; I regret all of them, all that was previously enumerated— whether these were things that concerned financial matters, physical matters, or spiritual matters. Regarding all of them— I regret using the expression of a vow, of an oath, of abstinence, of prohibition, of consecration, of konom-vow, or resolution. Now, according to the law, one who regrets [his vows, oaths etc.] and seeks annulment, must state the particulars of the vow, however, please realize, my masters, that it is impossible to specify them for they are many— and I do not request annulment for those vows which cannot be annulled— therefore let them be considered, in your eyes, as though I had specified them. 
<small><i>Those who participate in the annulment respond with the following declaration which they repeat three times:</i><br></small>
They shall all be annulled for you, they shall all be absolved for you, they shall all be permitted to you. There is no vow, no oath, no abstinence, no consecration, no prohibition, no konom-vow, no excommunication, no banishment, and no damnation; but there is forgiveness, pardon, and atonement. Just as annulment is granted by [us] the court here on earth, so shall annulment be granted by the Heavenly Court. 
<small><i>He who has asked for annulment then makes this public declaration:</i><br></small>
I hereby declare before you, that I nullify from now on all vows, all oaths, abstinences, prohibitions, konom-vows, consecrations, agreements and resolutions that I might accept upon myself, while awake or [even] in a dream; except the vows to fast which are made at the Mincha prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The vow to fast is made at the Mincha service of the day preceding the fast day.</i> And should I forget the stipulations of this declaration and make any vow from this day on, from this moment I regret them, and stipulate that they are all null and void; they are not binding or lasting, and they have no effect whatsoever; regarding all of them—I regret them, from now, forever. 

Eiruv Tavshilin

<small>When Rosh Hashana occurs on Thursday and Friday, an eiruv tavshilin must be prepared on the preceding Wednesday. The head of the family should take bread or matzoh and an item of cooked food such as meat or fish, put them on a plate and say the following berachah:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the mitzvah of eiruv. 
By means of this eiruv it will be permissible for us to bake, cook, keep dishes warm,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Keeping dishes warm” means that we are permitted to place cooked foods on a covered stove in order to preserve their heat. An example of this is the traditional Cholent.</i> to kindle a light (from an existing flame), and to prepare and do all our necessities on the Festival for the needs of Shabbos, for us and for all Jews<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rav of the community usually includes the community in his eiruv. This can be done however by anyone. It is done by handing over the cooked food to another person through whom he grants a share of the food (of the eiruv) to the entire community. This person raises the eiruv a tefach, (handsbreadth) and returns it to the one making the eiruv.</i> who live in this city. 

Lighting the Candles

<i>The food of the eiruv should be eaten at one of the Shabbos meals.</i><br> Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Yom Tov light. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who has kept us alive and sustained us and brought us to this season. 
<small><i>When Rosh Hashana occurs on Shabbos:</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Shabbos light and the Yom Tov light. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who has kept us alive and sustained us and brought us to this season.

<b>Fortunate</b> are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by Dovid! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works, and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak, and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His Kingship.

The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him, He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare and all flesh will bless His Holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now forever. Praise God. 
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the following half-Kaddish</i><br></small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

Aleinu

<small>Kol Bo writes that Joshua authored this prayer when he captured Jericho. Taken from the Musaf service of Rosh Hashana, it serves as the closing prayer of all the daily services. As ruled by Tur (Orach Chaim 133), it is said while standing.</small>
<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” 
And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”

Mourner's Kaddish

<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Yisrael, and say, Amein.

Kabbalas Shabbos

<small><i>When Rosh Hashana occurs on either Friday or on Shabbos, the Kabbalas Shabbos service begins here.</i><br></small>
A Psalm, a song for the Shabbos day. It is good to thank<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbos, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to Hashem. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. These pursuits lead him to serve Hashem and to praise Him.—Radak</i> Adonoy, and sing praise to Your Name, Most High. To relate Your kindliness in the morning, and Your faithfulness in the nights.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">We will proclaim His kindliness in the morning of redemption.

How great are Your works, Adonoy; how infinitely profound are Your thoughts.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem’s ‘works’ are the visible creation, while His ‘thoughts’ are the Divine purpose behind each created thing.—Seporno</i> An empty-headed man cannot know, nor does a fool understand this: When the wicked bloom like grass, and all the evildoers blossom— it is so that they may be destroyed forever. But You will remain on high forever Adonoy. For behold, Your enemies, Adonoy; For behold, Your enemies shall perish; dispersed shall be all evildoers. You uplifted my horn<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate, ‘You have increased my might like that of the wild ram.’</i> like that of a unicorn; I am saturated with fresh oil.

The righteous will blossom like a date palm, like a cedar<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The palm and the cedar both enjoy a long life span and flourish during all seasons.

To declare that Adonoy is upright; He is my Stronghold; in Whom there is no injustice. 
Adonoy had begun His reign He has clothed Himself with majesty; Adonoy has clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength. He has firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved. Your throne stands firm from of old, You are from eternity. The rivers have raised—Adonoy— the rivers have raised their voice, the rivers raise their raging waves. More than the sound of many waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea Mighty on high, are You, Adonoy. Your testimonies are extremely faithful, holiness is becoming to Your House, Adonoy—for the length of days. 
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Yisrael, and say, Amein.

<small><i>The following three lines are to be said silently:</i><br></small>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever. 
And you shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your possessions. And these words which I command you today, shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them sharply to your children. And you shall discuss them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise.

<b>And it will be—</b> if you vigilantly obey My commandments which I command you this day, to love Adonoy your God, and serve Him with your entire hearts and with your entire souls— that I will give rain for your land in its proper time, the early (autumn) rain and the late (spring) rain; and you will harvest your grain and your wine and your oil. And I will put grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. Beware lest your hearts be swayed and you turn astray, and you worship alien gods and bow to them.

And it will be to you for fringes, and you will look upon it and you will remember all the commandments of Adonoy, and you will perform them; and you will not turn aside after your hearts and after your eyes which cause you to go astray. In order that you will remember and perform all My commandments; and you will be holy unto your God.

<b>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</b> 
You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. 
<b>And so,</b><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The word וּבְכֵן, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ ‘and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusiouns of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i> grant<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The word תֵּן implies מַתָּנָה, a gift. We ask Hashem to grant us the feeling of reverence for Him, as a gift, knowing how difficult it is to attain such a high level of reverence completely on our own (Siach Yitzchak).</i> that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The word מַעֲשֶׂיךָ, lit., Your works, indicates that which has attained or is near perfection. Thus Yisrael is called His works since we have accepted His kingship and His Torah which is the fulfillment of Hashem’s creation (Siach Yitzchak).</i> and Your dread upon all You have created;<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">All you have created, שֶׁבָּרָאתָ, indicates that which has not attained its fulfillment, thus we ask Hashem to cast His dread even on those people who have not yet accepted His Divine Kingdom (Siach Yitzchak).</i> and [then] all [Your] works will fear You,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The nation of Yisrael will fear You.</i> and prostrate before You will be all [Your] created beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The nations of the world will finally prostrate themselves before You, i.e. submit to You and accept the yoke of Your Kingship.</i> And may they all form a single band to do Your will with a perfect heart.

<b>And so,</b> grant honor, Adonoy, to Your people,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Once all of Your works and created beings have submitted themselves to Your rule and formed a single bond to do Your will, the honor of Yisrael will be established and raised to new heights. It will then be apparent to all that Yisrael alone carried the yoke of Hashem’s kingdom throughout the bitter years of exile, giving Him obedience despite its suffering and persecution and the taunts of those who cynically asked, “Where is Your God” (Etz Yosef).</i> praise to those who fear You,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Those who fear Hashem will then be praiseworthy in the eyes of all men.</i> good hope to those who seek You<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Men will no longer consider as ridiculous those who seek Hashem and search for ways to serve Him.</i> confident speech to those who yearn for You,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Those who wait upon Him will no longer be subdued but will voice their convictions freely.</i> joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See Tehillim 132:17. The climax of this spiritual renaissance will be the restoration of our people to our land under the scepter of the Moshiach, descendant of Dovid, the anointed of Hashem.</i> 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The entire universe was created for the sake of Yisrael in order that Hashem’s Divine Influence be attached to it. This essence (Yisrael) was created for the sake of an even more treasured essence, namely the prophets and the pious among them. This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashana-Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).</i> and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 
<b>SANCTIFICATION OF THE DAY</b>

And You gave us, Adonoy our God, upright judgments and teachings of truth, statutes and commandments that are good. You have given us as a heritage seasons of happiness, appointed festivals of holiness, and festivals for voluntary offerings, and You bequeathed to us the sanctity of Shabbos, the glory of appointed festivals, and the feasts of the pilgrimage festival. You have made a distinction Adonoy, our God, between the sacred and the unhallowed, between light and darkness, between Yisrael and the peoples; between the seventh day and the six work days; between the sanctity of Shabbos and the sanctity of the Holiday have You distinguished, and the seventh day from the six work days have You sanctified. You have distinguished and sanctified Your people Yisrael with Your holiness.

My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name.

Aleinu

<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.” 
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Yisrael, and say, Amein. 
<small>The following Psalm (27) is recited at the conclusion of services, morning and evenings, from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres.</small>
<small>The Psalm voices our prayer that God will be our light on Rosh Hashana enabling us to repel the darkness of sin through true repentance, and that He will be our salvation on Yom Kippur, through His compassionate atonement of our sins.</small>
By Dovid: Adonoy is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? Adonoy is the strength<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rav S.R.

Adon Olam

<small>This hymn has been attributed to R’ Shlomo ibn Gabirol who lived in Spain during the eleventh century.</small>
<b>Master</b> of the Universe Who reigned before any creature was created. At the time when all was made by His will, then was His Name proclaimed King. And after all things shall cease to be, the Awesome One will reign alone. He was, He is, and He shall be in glory. He is One, and there is no second to compare to Him, to associate [with Him]. Without beginning, without end, power and dominion are His. He is my God and my ever-living Redeemer, the Rock of my destiny in times of distress. He is my flag and my refuge; He is the portion of my cup on the day I call. Into His hand I entrust my spirit [both] when I sleep and when I awaken. And with my spirit my body [too], Adonoy is with me, I shall not fear. 
<small>After the services it is customary to greet friends with the following greeting</small>
<small><i>To one person say:</i><br></small>
May you be inscribed for a good year.
<small><i>To several people say:</i><br></small>

Kiddush

<small><i>When Rosh Hashana occurs on Shabbos, begin here:</i><br></small>
<small><i>Recite quietly:</i><br></small>
And evening came, then morning came: <br><i>Recite aloud:</i><br> the sixth day. 
The heavens and the earth were completed and [so were] all their hosts. And God completed, by the seventh day, His work which He had done; and He abstained on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, for on it He abstained from all His work which God had created to do. 
<small><i>On weekdays, begin here:</i><br></small>

Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Creator of the lights of fire. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who has made a distinction between the sacred and the unhallowed, between light and darkness, between Yisrael and the peoples, between the seventh day and the six work days. Between the sanctity of Shabbos and the sanctity of the Holiday have You distinguished, and the seventh day [from] the six work days have You sanctified. You have distinguished and sanctified Your people Yisrael with Your holiness. Blessed are You, Adonoy Who distinguished between sacred and sacred.

<small><b>Customs of the Rosh Hashana Meal</b></small>
<small>On the first night of Rosh Hashana, it is customary to perform several symbolic rituals, to serve as good omens for the coming new year. At the beginning of the evening meal it is customary to dip a portion of the challah in honey and after eating a piece, the weight of an olive, say: “יְהִי רָצוֹן מִלְפָנֶיךָ שֶׁתְּחַדֵשׁ עָלֵינוּ שָׁנָה טוֹבָה וּמְתוּקָה—May it be Your will to renew for us a good and sweet year.” Then, take a piece of sweet apple and dip it in honey. First make the blessing, “בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָעֵץ—Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the universe, Who creates the fruit of the tree.” After tasting it, repeat the above prayer, “יְהִי רָצוֹן—May it be Your will to renew for us a good and sweet year.” It is also a custom to eat a piece of the head of some animal, (preferably a sheep) and say: “יְהִי רָצוֹן שֶׁנִהְיֶה לְראשׁ—May it be Your will that we be at the head.” We also eat certain vegetables, the names of which convey the connotations of good fortune, such as carrots which in Yiddish are called mehren (increase), and we say: “יְהִי רָצוֹן שֶׁיִרְבּוּ זְכוּיוֹתֵינוּ—May it be Your will that our merits increase.”</small>

Adon Olam

<small>This hymn has been attributed to R’ Shlomo ibn Gabirol who lived in Spain during the eleventh century. While praising God’s omnipotence and providence, it clarifies the meaning of the name Adonoy so that before proceeding to pray, each worshiper understands the significance of the God he is addressing.</small>
Master of the Universe Who reigned before any creature was created. At the time when all was made by His will, then was His Name proclaimed King. And after all things shall cease to be, the Awesome One will reign alone. He was, He is, and He shall be in glory. He is One, and there is no second to compare to Him, to associate [with Him].

Yigdal

<small>This hymn, written by Daniel ben Yehuda, who was a Dayan in Rome about 1300, is based on Maimonides’ 13 principles of Judaism. According to Maimonides, failure to believe in a single one of these principles places one outside the pale of Judaism.</small>
<small>1) The existence of God</small>
<b>Exalted</b> is the living God, and praised He exists, and His existence transcends time. 
<small>2) God is One</small>
He is One, and there is no unity like His,
He is invisible, His unity is infinite.
<small>3) God is uncorporeal</small>
He is unlike the corporeal
or even the non-corporeal,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem can also not be compared to the angels.</i>
His holiness is beyond comparison.
<small>4) God is Eternal</small>
He preceded every being that was created,
He was First,
and there was no genesis to His beginning.
<small>5) God alone must be worshipped</small>
He is Master of the Universe to every creature,
(all) proclaim His greatness and His majesty.
<small>6) Truth of Divine Prophecy</small>
The fullness of His prophecy, He bestowed
on those He treasured,
and in whom He gloried.
<small>7) Moshe was the greatest of all prophets</small>
There never arose in Yisrael
another like Moshe,
a prophet who beheld God’s image.
<small>8) Divine revelation of the Torah</small>
The Torah of truth
the Almighty gave to His people
through His prophet,
the trusted one of His house.
<small>9) The Torah is immutable</small>
The Almighty will not exchange
nor alter His Law.
Never will He offer any alternative.
<small>10) God knows the acts and thoughts of man</small>
He scrutinizes and knows our secrets.
He beholds the end of a thing
at its beginning.
<small>11) Divine reward and punishment</small>
He rewards man with kindness
according to his deeds.
He places evil on the wicked
according to his wickedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The word deed is not applied to the wicked man. Since Divine reward and punishment are distributed with kindness, reward is granted to man not only for his deed which may itself be insignificant, but also for the long range effect of that deed. He is punished, however, only for his act of wickedness, not for the consequences of his deed.—Etz Yosef</i>
<small>12) Belief in the coming of the Messiah</small>
He will send our Messiah at the end of days,
to redeem all who await His final deliverance.
<small>13) Divine resurrection of the dead</small>
The Almighty will revive the dead
because of His abundant kindness:
Blessed forever is His praised Name.

Akeidah (The Binding of Yitzchak)

<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, remember us favorably before You and be mindful of us for deliverance and compassion from the eternal high heavens. Remember in our behalf, Adonoy, our God: the love of our ancestors, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yisrael, Your servants; the covenant, the kindness, and the oath which You swore to our father Avraham on Mount Moriah, and the binding of Yitzchak, his son on the altar, as it is written in Your Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 22:1-19:</i>
<b>After</b> these events,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">These events refer to the previous nine tests by which Hashem tested Avraham. This was to be the tenth and the most difficult test of all.—Ha’amek Dovor</i> God tested Avraham and said to him, “Avraham!” and he [Avraham] said, “Here I am.” He said, “Please, take your son, your only one,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Yitzchak was Avraham’s only son by Sarah.</i> whom you love—Yitzchak— and go to the land of Moriah, and bring him up as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will designate to you. Avraham awoke early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took his two attendants<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Yishmael and Eliezer.—Rashi</i> with him, and also his son Yitzchak. He split the wood of the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went to the place that God had designated to him. On the third day, Avraham lifted his eyes and saw the place from afar. Avraham said to his attendants, “You stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go to that place. We will prostrate ourselves [in worship] and return<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Avraham prophesied that both of them would return.—Rashi</i> to you.” And Avraham took the wood of the burnt-offering and placed it on his son Yitzchak. In his hand he took the fire and the knife,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word is “maacheles” (root: אכל = to eat) which means that it renders meat fit for eating through slaughtering the animal. Another interpretation is: his knife is called maacheles because we still enjoy (eat) the reward of Avraham’s virtue when he agreed to use it to slaughter his son.—Rashi</i> and they both went together. Yitzchak spoke to Avraham his father and said, “Father,” and he said, “Here I am my son.” He said, “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?” Avraham said, “God Himself will show the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went together.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Although Yitzchak understood that he was going to be slaughtered, “They went together”— with like hearts.—Rashi</i> They came to the place that God had designated to him, and Avraham built the<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah says that he built “the” altar not just “an” altar, to indicate that Avraham rebuilt the same altar which was originally built by Adam and used by Kayin, Hevel and by No’ach.—Targum Yonoson ben Uziel</i> altar there, and arranged the wood, and bound his son Yitzchak, and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood. Avraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. An angel of Adonoy called to him from heaven and said, “Avraham! Avraham!” and he said, “Here I am.” He [God] said, “Do not harm the boy, nor do anything to him; for now I know that you are one who fears God and have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me.” Avraham raised his eyes and beheld a ram<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Tradition tells us that this ram was prepared for this purpose from the time of creation. Rashi (from Maseches Avos 5:6)</i> after it had been caught in the thicket by its horns; and Avraham went and took the ram, and brought it up as a burnt-offering instead of his son. Avraham called the name of that place, “Adonoy will see”;<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets the following: “Hashem will see the binding of Yitzchak and through its merit He will pardon Yisrael every year and rescue them from trouble. It will thus be said, “On this day,” by all generations that the ashes of Yitzchak are seen by Hashem and serve as our atonement.—Rashi</i> as it is said [to] this day “On Adonoy’s mountain, He will be seen.” An angel of Adonoy called to Avraham a second time from heaven, and said, “‘I have sworn by Myself,’ declares Adonoy, ‘that because you performed this deed, and did not withhold your only son, I will greatly bless you and make your descendants as numerous<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">If these blessings were intended to increase the population of Avraham’s descendants, it was superfluous, since Hashem had previously blessed him for that purpose. Hashem here blessed the descendants of Avraham with the nobility of spirit and courage to fulfill the command to sanctify Hashem even when self-sacrifice is required. Only the nation of Yisrael, Avraham’s children, were commanded to fulfill this mitzvoh, because of the legacy we inherited from him.—Ha’amek Dovor.</i> as the stars of the sky and like the sand on the seashore, and your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies. Through your children, will be blessed all the nations of the world, because you heeded My voice.’” Avraham returned to his attendants, and they rose and went together to Beer Sheva, and Avraham dwelt in Beer Sheva. 
Master of the Universe! May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to recall for our sake the covenant of our fathers. Just as our father, Avraham suppressed his compassion for his only son and would have slaughtered him to do Your will, so may Your compassion suppress Your anger against us; and may Your compassion prevail over Your [other] attributes,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Hashem’s attribute of stern justice.</i> to deal with us more leniently than the letter of Your law. Deal with us, Adonoy, our God, kindly and with compassion. In Your great goodness, turn Your fierce anger away from Your people, and from Your city, from Your land, and from Your territorial heritage. Fulfill for us, Adonoy, our God, the promise You made, through Your servant Moshe, as was said,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 26:42.</i> “I will recall My covenant with Yaakov, also My covenant with Yitzchak, and also My covenant with Avraham will I recall; and I will recall the land.” 
<b>A person</b> should always be in fear of God, privately as well as openly,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Some people conduct themselves in a God-fearing manner in the presence of others (in public), but in the privacy of their homes, do whatever they please. There are others who do just the opposite. In private they are governed by fear of Hashem, but in the presence of others they are too embarrassed or intimidated to be God-fearing. A Jew must always fear Hashem, in private as well as in public.—Si’ach Yitzchak</i> [he should] admit the truth,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Acknowledging the truth is fundamental to serving Hashem, and to all human behavior. One who is concerned merely with “winning the argument” will go to any extreme to come out on top. This attitude caused the downfall of the 250 leaders who joined Korach, rather than acknowledge the truth of Moshe’ declaration (Bamidbar 16:2-35).—Si’ach Yitzchak</i> and speak truth in his heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">It is not sufficient to merely acknowledge the truth verbally but one must speak truth in his heart as well. Rashi on the Talmud (Maseches Makos 24a) cites the following incident as an example of how one should speak truth in his heart: A buyer once offered to purchase an article from Rav Safra while he was reciting the Shema. Because he could not indicate his acceptance, the anxious purchaser increased his offer. Rav Safra refused the increment because in his heart he had already accepted the original offer.</i> and rise early and proclaim: 
Master of all the worlds! Not on account of our righteousness do we offer our supplications before You, but on account of Your abundant mercy. What are we? What is our life? What are our acts of kindness? What is our righteousness? What is our deliverance?<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Of ourselves or others.</i> What is our strength? What is our might? What can we say before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nothing before You? Famous men as though they had never been?

We are fortunate that we rise early and stay late evening and morning, and say twice each day: “Hear Yisrael, Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.” 
<small><i>The following three lines are to be said silently</i><br></small>

Korbanos (Sacrificial Offerings)

<small>The Talmud (Maseches Menachos 110a) states: Rabbi Yitzchak asked, “Why does it say (Vayikra 6:18; 7:1) This is the law of the sin-offering, this is the law of the guilt-offering? To teach us that when one studies the law of the sin-offering, it is considered as though he had actually brought it on the Altar, and when one studies the law of the guilt-offering, it is as though he actually brought it on the Altar.”</small>
<small>Rather than merely recite the following portions, study them and attempt to learn about the laws and significance of the various sacrifices.</small>
<small><i>Shemos 30:17-21</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> Adonoy spoke to Moshe to say: Make a copper laver and a copper base, for washing; and place it between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar, and put water in it. Aharon and his sons will wash from it, their hands and their feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">His right hand was held above his right foot, the left hand above the left foot and all were washed simultaneously. Maseches Zevachim 59</i> Upon entering the Tent of Meeting they will wash with water that they not die, or whenever they approach the Altar to serve, to burn a fire-offering to Adonoy. They will wash their hands and feet that they not die; and this is for them a perpetual statute for him [Aharon], and his descendants for all their generations. 
<small>The following Scripture section describes the removal of the ashes which had accumulated on the Altar from the daily burnt-offering of the previous afternoon. This removal was performed prior to the daily morning burnt-offering. The passage below also describes the ritual of maintaining the wood pyres which were always burning on the Altar.</small>
<small><i>Vayikra 6:1</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> Adonoy spoke to Moshe to say: Command Aharon and his sons to say, this is the law of the burnt-offering. This is the burnt-offering [which must remain] on its pyre, upon the Altar all night, until morning, and the fire of the Altar will be kept burning on it. The Kohein will don his linen garment, and linen breeches upon his flesh, and he will remove the ashes when the fire consumes the burnt-offering on the Altar; and he will place it beside the Altar. He will remove his garments and don other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to an undefiled place. The fire upon the altar will be kept burning, it may not be extinguished. And the Kohein will burn wood on it every morning, and arrange on it the burnt-offering, and burn on it the fats of the peace-offerings. A constant fire will be kept burning on the Altar, it may not be extinguished. 

Korban Tamid (Daily Offering)

<small>The Tamid-offerings, two daily offerings of one lamb each, were offered once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The former was the first public-offering brought on the Altar each day. And the latter terminated the day’s offerings. These animals were purchased from the annual half-shekel gifts of the people and were offered on behalf of the entire Jewish People. Before reading this passage we offer a brief prayer.</small>
<b>May</b> it be Your will, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to have compassion on us, to forgive us all our sins, [done unknowingly], to atone all our iniquities, [done knowingly], to pardon all our [malicious] transgressions, and may You build the Holy Temple quickly, in our days, that we may offer, before You, the daily burnt-offering to atone for us, as You wrote for us in Your Torah by the hand of Moshe, Your servant, from the mouth of Your Reverence, as it is said: 
<small><i>Bamidbar 28:1-8</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> Adonoy spoke to Moshe to say: Command the Children of Yisrael,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Kohanim, Levites and Yisraelites were to be present at the offering of the two daily public burnt-offerings. The Sages instituted the program of Maamodoth, under which representatives of all 12 tribes of Yisrael were always present when these sacrifices were offered.

And you will say to them: “This is the fire-offering that you will bring unto Adonoy: [male] lambs, in their first year, without blemish, two [of them] each day, as a constant burnt-offering. Offer one lamb in the morning, and the second lamb, offer in the afternoon. And a tenth of an ephah<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">A tenth of an ephah is the eqivalent of 43-1/5 eggs.</i> of fine flour as a meal-offering, mixed with oil of crushed [olives] measuring one-fourth of a hin.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The hin is a liquid measure containing 12 logs, of which each log is approximately 6 eggs.</i> [This is] a constant burnt-offering as offered at Mount Sinai for a pleasing aroma, a fire-offering to Adonoy.

And the second lamb you will offer in the afternoon; as the meal-offering of the morning [together] with its libation, you shall offer a fire-offering of pleasing aroma to Adonoy. 
<small><i>Vayikra 1:11</i><br></small>
And he will slaughter it on the north side of the Altar, before Adonoy; and Aharon’s sons, the Kohanim, will sprinkle its blood all around the Altar. 
<b>May</b> it be Your will, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, that this recitation be important, acceptable and desirable before You, as if we sacrificed the daily burnt-offering at its proper time, in its proper place and according to its laws. 

Ketores (Incense Offering)

<b>You are</b> Adonoy, our God, before Whom our fathers burned the incense of spices when the Holy Temple was standing, as You commanded them by the hand of Moshe Your prophet, as it is written in Your Torah: 
<small><i>Shemos 30:34-36</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> Adonoy said to Moshe, “Take for yourself spices— stacte, onycha, and galbanum—<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Galbanum has an offensive odor. The Torah includes it among the other spices to teach us to include even Jewish sinners among the rest of Jewry at our assemblies of fasting and prayers.—Rashi</i> spices, and pure frankincense, [they] shall be in equal weights. You will make it into incense, a compound mixed by a compounder, salted,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word, memulach is rendered by Onkelos as mixed, to indicate that the spices should be well mixed together.—Rashi</i> undefiled, and holy. You will pulverize some of it very fine, and place it before the [Ark of] Testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">This incense was offered each day upon the Innermost Altar which is inside the Tent of Meeting.—Rashi</i> in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it will be to you holy of holies.” 
It is also written: <br><i>Shemos 30:7-8</i><br> And Aharon shall burn upon it [the Altar] incense of spices every morning; when he cleans the lamps he will burn it. And when Aharon lights the lamps in the afternoon, he will burn it; a constant incense-offering before Adonoy throughout your generations. 
<small><i>Maseches Kreisos 6a; Talmud Yerushalmi, Maseches Yoma 4:5</i><br></small>
<b>The Rabbis taught:</b> How was the incense compounded? Three hundred and sixty-eight manim<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">A maneh is a weight; plural, manim.</i> were comprised therein, three hundred and sixty-five corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, one maneh for each day— half in the morning and half in the afternoon. From the three remaining manim the Kohein Gadol brought two handfuls [into the Holy of Holies] on Yom Kippur; [for which purpose] they were put back into the mortar on the eve of Yom Kippur, and ground [again] very thoroughly, in order to make them very fine. 
Eleven kinds of spices were used for it. They were: 1) balm, 2) onycha, 3) galbanum, 4) frankincense— by weight, seventy maneh of each; 5) myrrh, 6) cassia, 7) spikenard and 8) saffron— in weight sixteen maneh of each; 9) twelve maneh of costus, 10) three of aromatic bark, and 11) nine of cinnamon. [Also used in the incense compound were:] Nine kabin<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">A kav is a sixth of a seah.</i> of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three s’in and three kabin— if he had no Cyprus wine, he could use strong white wine— a fourth of a kab of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of maaleh ashan.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">This herb causes the smoke of the burning incense to ascend in a straight line.</i> Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, “Jordan amber was added of a minute quantity, and if one added honey,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Included are various sweeteners such as dates and other fruits.</i> it (the incense) became unfit; and if one omitted<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The same is true if one were to add to the prescribed number of eleven spices.—Etz Yosef</i> any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty.”<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The death penalty was given only if the Kohein Gadol actually entered the Holy of Holies with incense which was unfit. This was considered as an unwarranted entry into the Holy of Holies which carried the death decree.—Rashi</i> 
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: “The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree. Why was the Carshina lye used? To refine the onycha in order to make it pleasant. Why was Cyprus wine used? The onycha was soaked in it to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">This water came from a well named Raglayim.—Kol Bo</i> was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Since Mai Raglayim (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple. Others hold that the term “waters of Raglayim” actually refers to urine, which could have been used as a soaking agent were it not indecent to bring it into a sacred place.—Kol Bo</i> 
It was taught in a Boraysa: Rabbi Nosson says, “While [the Kohein] ground [the incense] he would say, ‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,’ because the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the sound of these specific words affects the spices.</i> is good for the spices. If half<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">184 manim instead of 368.</i> the quantity of incense was prepared it was acceptable, but if only a third or a fourth [of it was prepared] we have not heard<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we did not hear our teachers expound this question.</i> [whether it was acceptable.”] Rabbi Yehuda said, “This is the general rule: If [it was prepared with all its ingredients] in the correct proportion, it is acceptable even if only half was prepared; but if he left out any of its spices, he was liable for the death penalty. 
It was taught in a Boraysa: Bar Kappara says, “Once in sixty or seventy years<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The exact number of years varied with the size of the hands of the High Priests over the years, for the surplus was what remained of these three manim from which he took two handfuls each Yom Kippur.</i> the accumulated surplus was sufficient to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense.”] 
Bar Kappara also taught, “If he would have put into it a minute quantity of honey, no one could have withstood [resisted] the scent. Why was no honey mixed with it? Because the Torah says, (Vayikra 2:11) For any leaven or honey, do not burn from them, [as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.” 
<small><i>Recite each of these verses three times:</i><br></small>
Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Yaakov, Selah! 
Adonoy of Hosts, fortunate is the man who trusts in You. 
Adonoy, deliver [us]! The King will answer us on the day we call. 
You are my shelter; from distress You preserve me; with glad song of rescue, You envelop me, Selah! Let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Yehudah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years.

<small><i>The following is the prayer of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah:</i><br></small>
Please, by the force of Your great right hand, release the bound one. Accept the prayer of Your people; strengthen us, purify us, Awesome One! Please!

Mighty, Holy One, in Your abundant goodness, lead Your community. Unique One, Exalted, turn to Your people who are mindful of Your holiness. Accept our prayer and hear our cry, [You] Who knows hidden thoughts. Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever. 
<b>Master</b> of the Worlds, You commanded us to bring the Daily offering at its appointed time; and have the Kohanim perform their service, and the Levites [sing and play music] on the platform, and the Yisraelites [attend] at their Ma’amad.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">All of Yisrael was divided into twenty-four divisions.

<small>The following sequence of Mish-nayos and the selection from Sifra “Rabbi Yishmael Says,” were inserted after the Scriptural selections dealing with daily- offerings in order to give every Jew the opportunity to study/ recite daily, the minimum of selections from Scripture, Mishnah, and Talmud. Even though Sifra is not actually a Talmudic tractate, it is a Tanaitic expansion of Mishnah. (See Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 50:1).</small>
<small>The following are Mishnahyos found in the fifth chapter of Maseches Zevachim.</small>

<b>MISHNAH III</b> The communal and individual sin-offerings— these are the communal sin-offerings: The he-goats offered on Rosh Chodesh and on the Festivals are slaughtered on the north side, and their blood must be received in a sacred vessel, on the north side; their blood requires four applications [one] on each of the four corners.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Outer Altar.</i> How [was this done]?

<b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> says: through thirteen methods the Torah is expounded: 1) [A conclusion drawn] from a minor or lenient law, to a major or more strict one. 2) A clarification based on identical words or terms in the Biblical text. 3) A principle derived from one Biblical text or from two Biblical texts. 4) A rule followed by a detail. 5) A detail followed by a rule. 6) A rule followed by a detail, which is in turn followed by a rule, may infer only what is similar to the detail. 7) When a general rule requires an explicit rule; when an explicit rule requires generalization. 8) Something included in a general rule, which was singled out to teach— was not singled out to teach about itself, but to teach (something new) concerning the rule as a whole. 9) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out in a case similar to its rule, —it was singled out to lessen not to increase the severity of the case. 10) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out in a case which is not similar to its rule, —it was singled out either to lessen or to increase the severity of the case. 11) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out for a new stipulation— does not revert to its rule unless Scripture restores it to its rule expressly. 12) A matter deduced from its context, or from a subsequent expression. 13) Also, two passages that contradict each other until a third passage reconciles them. 
May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days: and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. 

Kaddish d'Rabanan

<small>Kaddish is not the name generally given to this prayer in the Talmud. It is referred to there as “May His great Name...”, because the congregational response beginning with these words is the heart of this prayer. Only in one minor tractate, (Maseches Soferim 16, 19, and 21) is it referred to as Kaddish.</small>
<small>Composed primarily in Aramaic, the language spoken and understood by most Jews in the Second Temple period (See Tosafos to Maseches Berachos 3a), nevertheless, several Hebrew phrases, which were familiar even to the unschooled, were also incorporated in the prayer.</small>
<small>This particular form of Kaddish d’Rabanan, is so named because of the insertion of the paragraph which begins with the words “Upon Yisrael and upon our Sages, etc.” This Kaddish is recited following the study of Talmud or Midrash and invokes God’s blessings on the Sages of Jewry, the transmitters of the Oral Torah.</small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">These opening words refer to the fulfillment of Hashem’s prophecy, through Yechezkel (38:23) “And I will thus exalt Myself and sanctify Myself; and I will be known in the eyes of the many nations, and they will know that I am Adonoy.”—Levush, Siddur HaGra<br>(One should be very careful to emphasize the letter gimel (ג) when saying the word “yisgadal (יִתְגַּדַּל),” in order that it not be heard as “Yiskadal (יִתְקַּדַל),” from the word קְדָל which means neck.—Mishnah Berurah 56:2</i> be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">May His sovereignty be revealed.</i> in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">We pray that the redemption will come speedily and that the process of the redemption itself will not be prolonged.—Siddur HaGra</i> — and say Amein.

May there be abundant peace from heaven and a good life for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, in His mercy, make peace for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. 

Mizmor Shir

<small>Psalm 30, once used to inaugurate the Holy Temple, is used today to inaugurate our daily prayers, for the synagogue is a “Holy Temple in miniature” and our prayers take the place of the sacrifices. It is both a prayer for success and a declaration of thanksgiving.</small>
<b>A Psalm,</b> a song for the inauguration of the Temple, by Dovid.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was Shlomo who built the Temple, why is its inauguration attributed to Dovid?

Mourner's Kaddish

<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein.

Pesukei Dezimrah

<small>The following sequence of prayers until Yishtabach (p. 94) is called Pesukei Dezimrah (verses of praise). These selected Scriptural passages were arranged by the Gaonim of the ninth century, in fulfillment of the Talmudic statement (Maseches Berachos 32a), “A person should always praise God first and make his requests [offer his prayers] afterwards.” Beginning with Baruch She’amar (p. 80), it is forbidden to interrupt your prayer with conversation until after the Shemoneh Esreh.</small>
<small>You are permitted to answer Amein, respond to Barechu, Kaddish and to say Kedushah even though you have passed Baruch She’amar. You are also permitted to say Modim d’Rabbonon and the first verse of the Shema together with the congregation.</small>
<small>If you are concerned that the saying of Kerias Shema will not be within the proper time should you follow the regular order of prayers, you are permitted to recite the entire Kerias Shema during the Pesukei Dezimrah.</small>

Baruch She'amar

<small>This blessing introduces the Pesukei Dezimrah. It was mentioned by Rabbi Yitzchak Alfasi (Rif) over 800 years ago in his commentary to Maseches Berachos 32. The Taz (Orach Chaim 51:1) states that this prayer was instituted by the “Men of the Great Assembly.” The blessing contains eighty-seven words suggesting the numerical value of פָּז poz, refined gold.</small>

<b>Blessed</b> is He Who spoke, and the world came into being, blessed is He; blessed is He Who maintains the creation; blessed is He Who says and does;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem’s saying and doing are synonymous and simultaneous as it is said, “By the word of Hashem the heavens were made” (Tehillim 33:6).—Etz Yosef</i> blessed is He Who decrees and fulfills;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“Says and does” refers to those things that are not lasting and must be renewed whereas, “He decrees and fulfills,” refers to those things that have קִיוּם, and last forever.—Tzelosa d’Avraham</i> blessed is He Who has compassion on the earth; blessed is He Who has compassion on the creatures;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Not only is Hashem’s compassionate providence concerned with the earth and enduring things, but His compassion and providence extend even to those creatures which are destined to perish.—Avudraham</i> blessed is He Who rewards well those who fear Him, blessed is He Who lives forever and exists eternally; blessed is He Who redeems and saves<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem redeems those who are in captivity and saves others from being taken in captivity.</i> blessed is His Name. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, the Almighty, the merciful Father, Who is verbally extolled by His people, praised and glorified by the tongue of His pious ones, and His servants, and through the songs of Dovid Your servant, we will extoll You, Adonoy our God, with praises and psalms; we will exalt, praise, and glorify You; we will mention Your Name, and proclaim You our King, our God. Unique One, Life of the worlds, King, praised and glorified forever is His great Name. Blessed are You, Adonoy, King, Who is extolled with praises.

When this occurs, the world is filled with awe and fear of Hashem.</i> Almighty of Yisrael— He grants might and power to the people; blessed is God. Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy, Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">These two verses (94:1-2) are an appeal to Hashem during a time fraught with the sufferings of exile, when it seems as if Hashem has forsaken His people. He is urged to reveal Himself as the Mighty champion of justice—S.R. Hirsch</i> Arise, Judge of the earth! Repay the arrogant their just reward. Deliverance is Adonoy’s.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Only Hashem knows what is true deliverance for a person. Prayer is not always answered, because Hashem in His infinite wisdom knows that granting the request is not always for our benefit. We must therefore bless and offer thanks to Hashem regardless of whether our petition has been granted.—Siach Yitzchak</i> Upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah. Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Yaakov. Selah. Adonoy of Hosts! Fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver [us]. The King will answer us on the day we call. Deliver Your people and bless Your inheritance, tend them and uplift them forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Radak understands Dovid to be asking Hashem to raise the People of Yisrael above their enemies. Ibn Ezra says that Hashem is being asked to act like a shepherd who brings his flock to high ground to save them from beasts of prey.</i> Our soul yearned for Adonoy, our help and our shield is He. For in Him our hearts will rejoice, for in His Holy Name we trusted. May Your kindness, Adonoy, be upon us, as we have waited for You. Show us Your kindness, Adonoy, and grant<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">We hope to earn redemption through our deeds, but if we are found wanting, then “show us Your kindness”—overlook our deficiencies and “grant” us salvation.—Radak</i> us Your deliverance.

I am Adonoy, Your God, Who brought you up from the land of Mitzrayim; open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Request all that you desire and I will fulfill every request.—Ibn Ezra. The Yerushalayim Talmud (Maseches Taanis 3:6) indicates that the more one requests Hashem’s providence—the “wider he opens his mouth”—the more he shows his belief in Hashem’s ability to provide all of man’s needs.</i> Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus, fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. In Your loving kindness I trust, My heart will exult in Your deliverance; I will sing to Adonoy, for He dealt kindly with me.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The foremost level of man’s trust in Hashem is manifested in three situations: a)when he is confronted with trouble, b)when he seeks help, and c)after he has been helped. The Psalmist says: In my time of trouble, I trust in Your kindliness; I seek only Your help, for my heart exults in Your salvation; and I will sing to You afterwards for You have dealt kindly with me.—Siddur HaGra</i> 
<small>In this psalm, (19) Dovid sings the praises of the Torah. The Kuzari notes that even though the skies “proclaim God’s glory” and the Psalmist describes the sun so glowingly, Dovid nevertheless concludes that in comparison to the Torah they are insignificant.</small>
<b>To the Chief Musician,</b> a Psalm of Dovid. The skies recount the glory of the Almighty, and His handiwork is related by the firmament.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">שָׁמַיִם, skies, refers to the heavenly regions beyond earth’s atmosphere, where the stars and planets orbit. רָקִיעַ, firmament, refers to the earth’s atmosphere where clouds form, and precipitation takes place. The verb לְסַפֵּר means to recount something which occurred in the past. Thus the stars and planets in the שָׁמַיִם recount the fact that long ago Hashem created a glorious universe. The רָקִיעַ, on the other hand, relates that Hashem’s handiwork is evidenced in the constant formation of clouds and in the precipitation of rain. The firmament enables man to recognize the constant renewal of Hashem’s providence.—Malbim</i> Day to day makes speech flow,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Daily renewal of the activities of creation, beginning with sunrise, stir mankind to proclaim Hashem’s praises.—Rashi</i> and night to night expresses wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Night after night the sun sets beneath the horizon only to rise and set again the following day. This unchanging pattern is evidence of the Divine wisdom implanted in Hashem’s creation.—Rashi</i> There is no speech, and there are no words; their voice is never heard.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Though the heavens have no means of verbal communication, the soul of man, with its sensitivity and perception, can understand their message clearly.—Ibn Ezra</i> Throughout the earth, their line extends, and to the edge of the inhabited world their words, He has set a tent in their midst for the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem provided the sun a permanent residence in the heavens. Dovid describes this point to which the sun returns daily as its ‘tent’—its residence in the sky.—Metsudas Yehoshua</i> And it [the sun] is like a groom departing his bridal chamber,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">When the groom steps out of the bridal chamber, everyone rushes to greet him with great joy. Analogously, when the sun rises each day, all of creation rejoices.—Radak</i> happy as a warrior to run on course.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">A warrior is happy for the opportunity to go into battle because he has confidence in his skill and strength. Similarly, the sun rejoices knowing it will serve its Creator’s goals by running its course.—Metsudas Dovid.</i> From one end of the skies is its rising and its circuit is to their [other] end; there is no escaping its heat. The Torah of Adonoy, is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Adonoy, is trustworthy, making wise the simple [man]. The precepts of Adonoy, are upright, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of Adonoy, is lucid, enlightening the eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Every command of Hashem is flawless, lighting the way for those who walk in His way.

Errors—who can comprehend? From hidden [faults], cleanse me. Also from willful [sins] spare Your servant, let them not rule me,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid’s request is paraphrased in the concluding blessing of the בִּרְכוֹת הַשַּׁחַר, where we say וְאַל יִשְׁלֹט בָּנוּ יֵצֶר הָרַע, “Let us not be ruled by the Evil Inclination.” Dovid knows full well that Hashem does not interfere with man’s free choise; he only asks for Divine help to keep him from becoming a prisoner of evil.—Gaon of Vilna</i> then I will be strong and will be cleansed of gross transgression. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
<small>This psalm (34) is based entirely on an event that took place in Dovid’s personal life as related in 1 Shmuel 21:11-16. Forced to flee from Saul, he took refuge among the Philistines, where he was recognized as the slayer of Goliath. In order to escape death at the hands of his foes, Dovid pretended to be an imbecile, and was sent away unharmed by King Avimelech.</small>
<b>Of Dovid,</b> When he acted insane in the presence of Avimelech and he [Avimelech] drove him away, and he [Dovid] left. I will bless Adonoy at all times constantly is His praise in my mouth. In Adonoy does my soul take pride,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid is proud that he is worthy of uttering Hashem’s Name.</i> the humble will hear [this] and rejoice. Declare the greatness of Adonoy with me, and let us exalt His Name together. I sought Adonoy and He responded to me; and from all my fears He saved me. [Those who] look to Him are enlightened and their faces are never darkened [humiliated]. This poor man<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid describes himself as a helpless indigent waiting for Hashem’s compassion.—Radak</i> called and Adonoy heard; and from all his troubles, He delivered him. The angel of Adonoy encamps around those who fear Him and sets them free. Taste and see that Adonoy is good;<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Seporno says that taste refers to the senses whereas “see” refers to the intellect.</i> fortunate is the man who takes refuge in Him. Fear Adonoy, [you] His holy ones, for there is no deprivation for those who fear Him. Young lions feel want and hunger, but those who seek Adonoy will not lack any good thing. Come children, listen to me, fear of Adonoy will I teach you. Who is the man who desires life,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid does not say הֶחָפֵץ בַּחַיִּים ‘he who takes pleasure in life’ but הֶחָפֵץ חַיִּים, ‘he who desires life,’ whose only goal is life; that is, he desires to attain such a level of existence as can truly be called life.—S.R. Hirsch</i> and loves days that he may see good? Guard your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceitfully. Turn from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of Adonoy are toward the righteous, and His ears [are open] to their cry. The face<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The expression פְּנֵי ה', Face of Hashem, describes Divine anger. See Vayikra 20:5, וְשַׂמְתִּי אֲנִי אֶת פָּנַי בָּאִישׁ הַהוּא, “And I will set My Face against that man.”</i> of Adonoy is set against evildoers to excise from earth, their memory. They<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">They refers to the righteous ones (Rashi) and to the repentant sinners (Ibn Ezra).</i> cry out and Adonoy hears and from all their troubles, He saves them. Adonoy is close to the broken-hearted and those crushed in spirit, He delivers. Many evils befall a righteous man, and from all of them, Adonoy saves him. He preserves all his bones, not one of them is broken. The cause of death of the wicked is evil; and the haters of the righteous are doomed. Adonoy liberates the soul of His servants, and none are doomed who take refuge in Him. 
<small>According to our Sages, Psalms 90 through 101, were said by Moshe. According to Radak, Dovid actually found this psalm in its written form and knowing it to be the prayer of Moshe, included it in his book of psalms. It speaks of the frailty of man and the brevity of his life and asks for God’s compassion and favor despite his wrongdoings.</small>
<b>A prayer of Moshe,</b> the man of God: My Master a dwelling[-place] have You been for us in every generation. Before the mountains were born, and You brought forth the earth and the inhabited world; from world to world<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">From before this world to the next world You are Almighty.</i> You are Almighty. You push man down until the crushing point<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">You permit the sinner to return in penitence even till the very last moment of his life.—Iyun Tefiloh</i> and You say, “Return, children of man!”<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">You constantly call the sinner to return, reminding him of the brevity of his life.—Iyun Tefiloh</i> For a thousand years are in Your eyes like the yesterday that has just passed, and like a night watch. The stream of their life is [but] slumber, in the morning they are as grass, freshly grown. [If] in the morning it blossoms, and grows afresh by evening it is cut off and shriveled. So are we consumed by Your anger and by Your rage are we terrified. You have set our iniquities before You, the sins of our youth<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate ‘our hidden sins [are exposed]’ see Metsudas Dovid</i> before the light of Your countenance. For all our days vanish in Your wrath; we terminate our years like an unspoken word. The days of our years in them<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">‘In them’ refers to the iniquities and the youth mentioned in the two preceding verses. —Rashi</i> [total] seventy years, and with strength, eighty years, and their pride is frustration and falsehood; for, cut off quickly, we fly away.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Not only is the span of our lives brief, but our few allotted years fly by swiftly.—Iyun Tefiloh</i> Who can [get to] know the force of Your anger? And like the fear of You so is Your wrath.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Just as Hashem is feared, so too is His wrath harsh when He punishes sinners.—Rashi</i> To count our days, teach us and we will acquire a heart of wisdom.

<small>This Psalm, (91) composed by Moshe on the day the Tabernacle was completed, is a source of inspiration to all who seek the Almighty as their refuge and fortress.</small>
<b>He who dwells</b> in the shelter of the Supreme One, under the protection of Shadai he will abide. I say of Adonoy, [He is] my refuge and my stronghold, my God in Whom I trust. For He will save you from the snare-trap, from destructive pestilence. With His wings He will cover you and beneath His wings, you will find refuge; His truth is a shield, a full shield. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day. The pestilence that prowls in darkness, nor the deadly plague that ravages at noon. A thousand will fall at your [left] side, and ten thousand at your [right] side but it<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">‘It’ refers to ‘arrow,’ pestilence,’ and ‘plague’ mentioned in the preceding two verse.</i> shall not come near you. Only<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">You will only see the destruction but you will not be harmed by it.</i> with your eyes will you behold and see the punishment of the wicked. For you [have proclaimed]: “Adonoy is my refuge,” the Supreme One you have made your dwelling. No evil shall befall you, and no plague shall come near your tent. For His angels He will command on your behalf— to guard you in all your ways. They will carry you upon their hands, lest you hurt your foot on a rock. You will tread upon lion and snake, you will trample young lion and serpent. Because he clings to Me with desire, I will save him; I will strengthen him, for he knows My Name. When he calls upon Me, I will answer him; I am with him in distress, I will free him and honor him. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance. 
<small>In this psalm, (135) Dovid praises God for choosing the people of Israel as His treasured people. He also speaks of those who will ultimately be worthy of serving Him, in the rebuilt House of God, in the Messianic era.</small>
<b>Praise God,</b> Praise the Name of Adonoy, Praise [Him], servants of Adonoy. [You] who stand in the House of Adonoy, in the courtyards of the House of our God. Praise God, for Adonoy is good, sing to His Name which is pleasant. For God chose Yaakov to be His, Yisrael for His treasure. For I know that Adonoy is great, our Master [is greater] than all gods. All that was desired by Adonoy, He has done in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths. He causes clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; lightning for the rain He makes; He brings forth winds from His vaults. He struck down the firstborn of Mitzrayim both man and beast. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of Mitzrayim, upon Pharaoh and upon all his servants. For He smote many nations, and slew mighty kings: Sichon, King of the Amorites, and Og, King of the Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan. And He gave their lands as an inheritance, an inheritance to Yisrael, His people. Adonoy is Your Name forever, Adonoy is Your mention for generations. For Adonoy judges His people,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">According to Seporno, the verse is translated, ‘When Adonoy judges on behalf of His people,’ referring to the judgement of all who oppressed the Jewish people.</i> and upon His servants will He relent. The idols<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">עֲצַבֵּי is related to עֶצֶב which means ‘sadness’ or ‘grief.’ Idols bring only grief to those who depend on them.—Radak</i> of the nations, are of silver and gold, products of human hands: They have a mouth but do not speak; they have eyes but do not see. They have ears but do not listen; nor is there any breath in their mouth. Like them let their makers be— all who trust in them. House of Yisrael, bless Adonoy!<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The entire house of Yisrael is urged to bless Hashem Who set us apart from the other nations and made us His people. Yisrael is told to bless Hashem for its own unique position and manner of serving Him.— Ibn Ezra</i> House of Aharon, bless Adonoy! House of Levi, bless Adonoy! [You] who fear Adonoy,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to those among the nations who converted to Judaism because of their fear and recognition of Hashem.</i> bless Adonoy! Blessed is Adonoy from Tziyon, He Who dwells in Yerushalayim. Praise God. 
<small>The Talmud (Pesachim 118a) calls this psalm (136) הַלֵל הַגָדוֹל, the great praise, because it describes how God, enthroned on high, sustains every living creature. The first twenty-four verses call on us to thank God, the Master of the Universe, Who created it, redeemed us from Mitzrayim, caused us to inherit the lands of Sichon and Og, and delivered us from our enemies. The twenty-fifth verse, נוֹתֵן לֶחֶם לְכָל בָּשָׂר, He gives food to all flesh, is viewed as the climax of the entire psalm. Feeding every creature, day in and day out, is the greatest manifestation of God’s provident kindliness. Though He rules in supreme splendor, God is close to the needs of every creature.</small>
<b>Thank</b> Adonoy for He is good, for His kindliness endures forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This refrain is repeated in all twenty-six verses of the Psalm. We thereby declare that each act of kindliness for which we thank Hashem is not of a temporary nature, lasting merely a day or a year. The effect of His kindliness endures forever, and we continually reap the benefits of every act of Divine kindliness.—Sfas Emes</i> 
Thank the God of gods, for His kindliness endures forever. 
Thank the Master of masters, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who does great wonders, alone, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who makes the heavens, with understanding, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who spreads the earth over the waters, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who makes the great luminaries, for His kindliness endures forever. 
The sun to rule by day, for His kindliness endures forever. 
The moon and stars to rule by night, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who struck Mitzrayim through their firstborn, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He brought Yisrael out of their midst, for His kindliness endures forever. 
With a strong hand and outstretched arm, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who parted the Sea of Reeds into parts,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The sea was divided into twelve parts, so that each tribe crossed on its own route.</i> for His kindliness endures forever. 
And He made Yisrael pass through it for His kindliness endures forever. 
And He threw Pharaoh and his army into the Sea of Reeds, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who led His people through the wilderness for His kindliness endures forever. 
He Who struck great kings, for His kindliness endures forever. 
And He slew mighty kings, for His kindliness endures forever. 
Sichon, king of the Amorites, for His kindliness endures forever. 
And Og, king of the Bashan, for His kindliness endures forever. 
And gave their land as an inheritance, for His kindliness endures forever. 
An inheritance to Yisrael, His servant, for His kindliness endures forever. 
In our lowliness, He remembered us, for His kindliness endures forever. 
And He freed us from our oppressors, for His kindliness endures forever. 
He gives food to all flesh, for His kindliness endures forever. 
Thank the Almighty of heaven for His kindliness endures forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The twenty six verses in this psalm symbolize the twenty six generations of man from Creation till the Torah was given. These generations were sustained solely by virtue of Hashem’s kindliness even though they did not have the merit of Torah.</i> 
<small>In this psalm, (33) Dovid expresses the joy of the righteous in the Divine Providence of God in every aspect of the world and in the affairs of man. For the righteous see the “laws of nature” only as an external cloak, concealing the true supervision of God. They see through the laws of nature and perceive the Divine order and providence of the Creator.</small>
<b>Joyfully exult</b> in Adonoy—righteous ones— for the upright, praise is fitting. Thank Adonoy with the harp, with the ten-stringed lyre sing to Him. Sing Him a new song, play skillfully with jubilation. For upright is the word of Adonoy and all His deeds [are done] with faithfulness. He loves righteousness and justice the kindliness of Adonoy fills the earth. By the word of God, the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth, all their hosts. He gathers like a mound the waters of the sea, He places in vaults the deep waters. Fear Adonoy, all the earth, of Him, be in dread all dwellers of the inhabited world. For He spoke and it became; He commanded and it stood. Adonoy annuls the counsel of nations, He disrupts the intention of peoples. The counsel of Adonoy will stand forever, the thoughts of His heart throughout all generations. Fortunate is the nation for whom Adonoy is their God, the people He chose as His heritage. From the heavens, Adonoy looks [down], He sees all mankind. From His dwelling place, He watches intently all the inhabitants of the earth. He forms their hearts all together;<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud (Sanhedrin 37a) states: When a man mints many coins from the same mold, they are all exactly alike, but Hashem formed all of mankind from Adam and no two men look exactly alike. The Sages in Berachos 58a add: just as no two faces are alike, so are no two personalities alike. Thus even though Hashem made them all together, each has his own unique personality.</i> He perceives all their doings. A king is not saved by a great army; a mighty man is not rescued with [his] great strength. A horse is deceptive [assurance] for deliverance, and with its great strength it provides no escape. Behold, the eye of Adonoy is on those who fear Him, on those who wait for His kindliness. To rescue their soul from death, and to keep them alive during famine. Our soul yearned for Adonoy, our help and our shield is He. For in Him our heart will rejoice, for in His Holy Name we trust, May Your kindliness, Adonoy, be upon us, as we have waited for You. 
<b>A Psalm,</b> a song for the Shabbos day. It is good to thank<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbos, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to Hashem. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life.

<b>Adonoy</b> had begun His reign He has clothed Himself with majesty; Adonoy has clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength. He has firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved. Your throne stands firm from of old, You are from eternity. The rivers have raised—Adonoy— the rivers have raised their voice, the rivers raise their raging waves. More than the sound of many waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea Mighty on high, are You, Adonoy. Your testimonies are extremely faithful, holiness is becoming to Your House, Adonoy—for the length of days.

<small>Rav S.R. Hirsch writes that the six concluding chapters of the Book of Psalms are the most important gift of Dovid’s Divinely-inspired hymns. They are an essential component of our daily prayers. Our Sages attach much significance to Psalm 145 in particular, and stated: “Whoever recites ‘A praise by Dovid’ three times a day is assuredly worthy of a share in the World to Come” (Berachos 4b). When recited in prayer, this psalm is always introduced with two verses from other Psalms (84:5 and 144:15). These verses contain the word fortunate three times, an allusion to this psalm being recited three times a day. These verses are so closely identified with Psalm 145 that it is commonly referred to as Ashrei (Fortunate).</small>
<b>Fortunate</b> are those who dwell in Your house;<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">This verse referred to the Kohanim and the Levites who served (dwelt) in the Holy Temple (Your House); it is at all times applicable to scholars and devout men who study and pray in houses of worship and study.</i> may they continue to praise You, Selah.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 84:5</i> Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 144:15</i> A praise by Dovid!

<small>This Psalm acclaims God’s loving care as experienced by each Jew in his own life.</small>
<b>Praise God!</b> My soul, praise Adonoy. I will praise Adonoy with my life; I will sing to my God as long as I live.

<small>In this Psalm, Dovid imparts the knowledge to sustain and uphold the Jewish People, during their bitter exile. He tells them of their special and enduring relationship with God and of their role as permanent messengers of the word of God to all mankind.</small>
<b>Praise God!</b> for it is good to sing to our God; for [His] praise is pleasant, befitting. The builder of Yerushalayim is Adonoy; the banished ones of Yisrael He will gather.

Cry out to Adonoy in thanksgiving; sing to our God with the harp.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Each musical instrument has its unique function. In the times of King Dovid, the harp was used to arouse those who slept. The psalmist may be indicating that the harp arouses the sleeping soul of man to recognition of the miraculous ways in which Hashem shows His Divine Providence for us every day.—Siach Yitzchak</i> [He] Who covers the heaven with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth; Who causes grass to grow upon the hills. Who gives the animal its fodder; [also] to the young ravens which call. Not the power of the horse does He desire, nor the thighs of man does He want.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem does not delight in those who place their trust in the strength of horses or in their own strength.—Tzelosa d’Avraham</i> Adonoy wants those who fear Him, those who hope for His kindliness.

He declares His word to Yaakov, His statutes and His laws to Yisrael.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Yisrael is the receiver and preserver of Hashem’s divine Law, the Torah, which includes chukim, statutes which confine the physical, sensual aspects of man within the bounds of moral purity, and also mishpotim, laws which govern communal life. Among the nations, law is determined by the views they hold at a given time and place concerning the needs of a society, and so their laws are based on expediency.—S.R. Hirsch</i> He did not do so to any [other] nation; and of His laws they were not informed. Praise God. 
<small>In this psalm, Dovid sings of the moment when all the world will be imbued with the knowledge of God’s all-embracing providence. All living creatures—from the infinite heights of heaven above (verses 1-7) down to the depths of the earth below (verses 7-12)—will join together in one great hymn of praise to their Creator, and acknowledge the uniqueness of Yisrael over all other nations.</small>
<b>Praise God.</b> Praise Adonoy from the sky; Praise Him in the heights! Praise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His hosts! Praise Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all the stars of light. Praise Him, skies of skies, and the waters that are above the skies.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 1:6-7 indicates that there are waters above the heavens.</i> They will praise the Name of Adonoy, for He commanded it and they were created.

According to Ibn Ezra, the verse might also be translated “He issued a decree which will not pass away,” for Hashem’s decree is permanent and immutable.</i> Praise Adonoy from the earth, sea-monsters and all [that dwell in] the depths. Fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormwind, [all] fulfilling His word. The mountains and all the hills, fruit trees and all cedars. Wild beasts and all animals, creeping things and winged fowl.

<small>The custom of reciting the following additions to Pesukei Dezimrah is mentioned as early as the Gaonic era, specifically by Rav Amram Gaon. These verses were incorporated into our daily prayers because they speak so eloquently of God’s majesty, and of the Divine providence which is the source of the power, riches, might, and honor of all human beings.</small>
<small>The first four verses (1 Chronicles 29:10-13) relate Dovid’s blessing to God, when he presented the gold, silver, and jewels he amassed for the construction of the Holy Temple. It was a day of great rejoicing as, following Dovid’s example, the leaders and princes also presented generous gifts for the construction of the Temple.</small>
<small><i>The following until after ישתבח should be said standing.</i><br></small>
<b>And</b> Dovid blessed Adonoy in the presence of all the assembly; and Dovid said, Blessed are You, Adonoy, God of Yisrael, our Father,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid singles out Yaakov because he was the first Patriarch to mention building a house of Hashem (Bereishis 28:22), “Then shall this stone which I have set for a pillar be Hashem’s house.”—Radak</i> forever and ever. Yours, Adonoy, is the greatness, the might, the glory the victory and the beauty,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid thus renders unto Hashem the greatness Hashem has given him.

Shiras Hayam

<small>In Temple times Shiras Hayam, the Song of the Sea, was sung by the Levites when the daily afternoon sacrifice was offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Rosh Hashana 31a, mentions that the Ode was sung at Minchah on Shabbos.</i> After the destruction, the Jews of the Holy Land continued the tradition, reciting the Shira at the end of the Pesukei Dezimrah. The custom spread to Italy and from there to other Jewish communities. This daily recital is mentioned by Rav Saadya Gaon but not as an obligatory part of the service. Rambam calls it a “custom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Hilchos Tefillah 7:13.</i> Subsequently adopted by all communities, reciting the Shira became an integral part of our daily prayers.</small>
<small>Some hold that the Shira should be chanted aloud while standing. It should be sung with joy as at the time of the Exodus. “Sheloh” writes that reciting the Shira atones for sin, so that if one wishes to repent a serious sin, he should recite the Shira every day with great fervor. The Zohar says, “If one recites this song with elation and joy, he will be worthy to sing it in the next world. He will also be worthy to sing it when he greets the Mashiach.”</small>

Nishmas

<small>The Mishnah, (Maseches Pesachim 117b) refers to the following prayer as בִּרְכַּת הַשִּׁיר, the blessing of song. Some commentaries suggest that it is so named because it forms a lengthy song that concludes with the blessing of יִשְׁתַּבַּח on page 185. On weekdays, when there is not sufficient time to concentrate adequately on our prayers, we merely recite the concluding blessing of יִשְׁתַּבַּח, but on Sabbath and Festivals we recite the prayer in its entirety.</small>
<b>The soul</b> of every living thing shall bless Your Name, Adonoy, our God; and the spirit of all flesh shall glorify and exalt Your mention, our King, continually. From world to world,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">See note 55 on תפילה למשה, page 145.</i> You are Almighty; and besides You we have no king, redeemer, or deliverer, [who] liberates, rescues, maintains and is compassionate in all times of trouble and distress.

Iyun Tefiloh says that בְּרִיוֹת, created beings, refers to everything Hashem created during the six days of creation, whereas תּוֹלָדוֹת refers to those things that come forth, i.e., were “born” from the original created things.

First Day of Rosh Hashana

The King

<b>The King</b> Who sits on a throne [that is] exalted and uplifted.
<b>He Who dwells</b> in eternity, exalted and holy is His Name. And it is written: “Joyfully exult in God, [you] righteous ones, for the upright, praise is fitting. Through the mouth of the upright, You are exalted, and with the words of the righteous You are blessed; and by the tongue of the pious, You are sanctified; and in the midst of the holy, You are extolled. 
<b>And in the assemblies</b> of myriads of Your people, the House of Yisrael; with joyful song glorified will be Your Name, our King, in every generation. For it is the duty of all beings, before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to thank, to extol, and to praise; to glorify, to exalt, and to honor; to bless, to elevate, and to acclaim [You,] even beyond all the words of song and praise of Dovid, son of Yishai, Your servant, Your anointed. 

Yishtabach

<small>Rabbeinu Alfasi (Maseches Berachos 32) refers to Baruch She’amar as the opening blessing of the Pesukei Dezimrah, and Yishtabach as the concluding blessing.</small>
<b>Praised be</b> Your Name forever, our King, Almighty the great and holy King in heaven and on earth. For to You it is fitting [to offer] Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, song and praise, glorification and hymns, [to proclaim your] strength and dominion, victory, grandeur, and might, praise and glory, holiness and sovereignty, blessings and thanksgivings, from now, forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Almighty, King [Who is] great in [our] praise Almighty, of [to Whom we offer our] thanksgiving, Master of [Whom we praise for His] wonders, the Selector of song-hymns, King, Almighty, Life of [all] the worlds. 
<small><i>The following Psalm (130) is said responsively:</i><br></small>
<small>In this Psalm, the Jewish soul sings of the Jewish spirit ascending from the depths of the deepest misery of all, the burden of sin and guilt.</small>
<b>A Song of Ascents.</b> Out of the depths I have called to You, Adonoy. My Master, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If You God should take account of iniquities, my Master, who could survive? For with You is forgiveness, in order that You be feared. I hope for Adonoy, my soul hopes; and for His word, I wait. My soul [waits] for my Master more than the watchman [waits] for the morning, [more than] the watchman [waits] for the morning. Wait, Yisrael, upon Adonoy, for with Adonoy there is loving-kindness, and with Him there is much redemption. And He will redeem Yisrael from all its iniquities. 
<small><i>The Half-Kaddish is recited by the Chazzan</i><br></small>
<small>Here, as elsewhere in the Liturgy, the Half-Kaddish marks the end of a distinct section of the prayers, in this case, the Pesukei Dezimrah.</small>
<small>It is called the Half-Kaddish, the final three verses of the complete Kaddish having been omitted.</small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. 
<small>It has become a universally accepted custom to recite Barechu before proceeding to the blessings of Shema. Barechu, like Kaddish and Kedushah, cannot be recited unless a quorum—a minyan of ten adult males—is present. Barechu is also said by one who is called upon to read from the Torah.</small>
<small>The practice of saying Barechu is mentioned numerous times in the Talmud. It is even cited in the Mishnah (Maseches Berachos 49b) in the names of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael.</small>
<small><i>The Chazzan says:</i><br></small>
<b>Bless</b> Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small><i>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</i><br></small>
<b>Blessed</b> is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever. 
<small>The two blessings יוֹצֵר אוֹר “Former of light” and אַהֲבָה רַבָּה “[With] unbounded love,” are referred to as the blessings preceding Shema (Maseches Berachos 11a). According to Rambam they were formulated by Ezra and his Court (Laws of Shema 1:7).</small>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Former<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Forming, יוצֵר, is the act of refining or modifying an original substance, whereas, creating, בּורֵא, refers to creating the original substance from nothing. For example, when one shapes a wooden table, to make it round, he “forms” the wood, the original substance which was “created.” Similarly, Hashem “forms the light” which is His act of modifying or limiting the darkness He created.—Siddur HaGra</i> of light, Creator of darkness, Maker<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Making, עושֶׂה, is the act of completion, such as when one completes a table by painting it. Similarly, Hashem’s finishing touch of creation is “making peace,” the vessel that holds it all together, as stated in the Mishnah, “Hashem found no vessel to contain blessing other than peace.” לֹא מָצָא הקב"ה כְּלִי מַחְזִיק בְּרָכָה אֶלָא הַשָּׁלום— Siddur HaGra</i> of peace, and Creator<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Yeshaya (45:7) on which this blessing is based concludes with the words, “and creates evil.” In His original creation Hashem created the potential for evil, which He constantly limits and controls as the Former and Maker.—Siddur HaGra</i> of all things.

Recitation of Shema

<small>The recitation of Shema was part of the daily worship in the Holy Temple, and our Sages ordained that it be recited in the synagogue service, providing it a central place in the morning and evening prayers of each Jew. Its importance may be judged from the fact that the very first Mishnah in the Oral Torah opens with the question, “From what time may the evening Shema be read?”</small>
<small>In reading Shema, bear in mind that you are performing a Scriptural commandment. All three paragraphs should be read with kavanah, concentrated intention, on what you are saying. The entire Shema should be recited in awe and reverence as it proclaims the existence and unity of God; the Jews’ complete dedication to God and His commandments; the belief in Divine justice; the remembrance of the Exodus and the selection of the Jews as God’s Chosen People. These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָל֯־לְ֯בָבְךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, and the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.</small>
<small><i>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</i><br></small>
(Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Yisrael:</b> Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שְׁמַע and last letter of אֶחָד are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עֵד “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to Hashem’s unity.—Avudraham<br>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on Hashem’s unity. The last word, אֶחָד “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that Hashem, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Yisrael, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i> 
<small><i>The following three lines are to be said silently:</i><br></small>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Yisrael” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Yaakov said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moshe did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Yaakov ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a.<br>When Moshe went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise Hashem by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם aloud.—Midrash Rabba to Devarim</i> 
And you shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages (Sifrei to Devarim 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to Hashem’s Law and make them instruments for His service.</i> and with all your soul<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved Hashem with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.</i> and with all your possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to Hashem and to Torah might entail.</i> And these words which I command you today,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The teachings of the Torah should be ever fresh in your minds, as though you received it today.—Ibid.</i> shall be upon your heart.

And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 6:5-9. This paragraph contains 10 commandments: 1) accepting the “yoke” of heaven; 2) proclaiming the Unity of Hashem; 3) loving Hashem; 4) studying Torah (and you shall speak of them); 5) teaching your children; 6-7) reciting Shema in the evening and in the morning; 8-9) putting on the tefillin of the hand and head; 10) putting up mezuzos on the door posts.</i>

<small>You must be careful to connect the last words of Shema, ה' אֱלֹקֵיכֶם (Adonoy, your God), with the word אֱמֶת (is true) without pause or interruption so that these three words form one sentence, meaning “Adonoy your God is true” (Berachos 13a).</small>

Adonoy, your God, is true.
<small>The following prayer, which culminates with גָאַל יִשְׂרָאֵל, Who redeemed Yisrael, constitutes the “Blessing after Shema” mentioned in the Talmud (Maseches Berachos 11a). It is also mentioned in Maseches Tamid (32b) as part of the morning service in the Temple.</small>

<b>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</b> 
You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. 
<b>And so,</b><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The word וּבְכֵן, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i> grant<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The word תֵּן implies מַתָּנָה, a gift. We ask Hashem to grant us the feeling of reverence for Him, as a gift, knowing how difficult it is to attain such a high level of reverence completely on our own (Siach Yitzchak).</i> that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The word מַעֲשֶׂיךָ, lit., Your works, indicates that which has attained or is near perfection.

This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashana-Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).</i> and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth.

May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart—before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart—before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein. 
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years.

The Talmud (Taanis 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered. Rabbi Akiva stepped down after him and exclaimed, “Our Father, our King, we have no king except You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake have mercy on us,” and rain fell. This prayer is not recited on the Sabbath. 
<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i><br></small>
Our Father, our King!<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as Hashem’s slaves (Vayikra 25:42), and as His children (Devarim 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King. Contrary to the view that Hashem the Father is so full of love for His children that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that Hashem the King must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to Hashem—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!</i> we have sinned before You.

Our earlier pleas were for forgiveness of those sins we committed ourselves. But there are sins for which we are held accountable even though we do not commit them ourselves. One possibility is that of watching while others sin when we may have been able to prevent it. (Chazal say כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל עֲרֵבִין זֶה לָזֶה. A guarantor is one who countersigns a debt note, undertaking to pay if the borrower defaults. Thus we ask Hashem to erase all our notes of obligation whether as borrower or guarantor.

<small><i>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish:</i><br></small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Yisrael before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein. May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Yisrael, and say, Amein. 

Second Day of Rosh Hashana

The King

<small><i>On the second day of Rosh Hashana, begin morning prayers on page 76.</i><br></small>
<b>The King</b> Who sits on a throne [that is] exalted and uplifted.
<b>He Who dwells</b> in eternity, exalted and holy is His Name. And it is written: “Joyfully exult in God, [you] righteous ones, for the upright, praise is fitting. Through the mouth of the upright, You are exalted, and with the words of the righteous You are blessed; and by the tongue of the pious, You are sanctified; and in the midst of the holy, You are extolled. 
<b>And in the assemblies</b> of myriads of Your people, the House of Yisrael; with joyful song glorified will be Your Name, our King, in every generation. For it is the duty of all beings, before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to thank, to extol, and to praise; to glorify, to exalt, and to honor; to bless, to elevate, and to acclaim [You,] even beyond all the words of song and praise of Dovid, son of Yishai, Your servant, Your anointed. 

Yishtabach

<small>Rabbeinu Alfasi (Maseches Berachos 32) refers to Baruch She’amar as the opening blessing of the Pesukei Dezimrah, and Yishtabach as the concluding blessing.</small>
<b>Praised be</b> Your Name forever, our King, Almighty the great and holy King in heaven and on earth. For to You it is fitting [to offer] Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, song and praise, glorification and hymns, [to proclaim your] strength and dominion, victory, grandeur, and might, praise and glory, holiness and sovereignty, blessings and thanksgivings, from now, forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Almighty, King [Who is] great in [our] praise Almighty, of [to Whom we offer our] thanksgiving, Master of [Whom we praise for His] wonders, the Selector of song-hymns, King, Almighty, Life of [all] the worlds. 
<small><i>The following Psalm (130) is said responsively:</i><br></small>
<b>A Song of Ascents.</b> Out of the depths I have called to You, Adonoy. My Master, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If You God should take account of iniquities, my Master, who could survive? For with You is forgiveness, in order that You be feared. I hope for Adonoy, my soul hopes; and for His word, I wait. My soul [waits] for my Master more than the watchman [waits] for the morning, [more than] the watchman [waits] for the morning. Wait, Yisrael, upon Adonoy, for with Adonoy there is loving-kindness, and with Him there is much redemption. And He will redeem Yisrael from all its iniquities. 
<small><i>The Half-Kaddish is recited by the Chazzan</i><br></small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. 
<small>It has become a universally-accepted custom to recite Barechu before proceeding to the blessings of Shema. Barechu, like Kaddish and Kedushah, cannot be recited unless a quorum—a minyan of ten adult males—is present. Barechu is also said by one who is called upon to read from the Torah.</small>
<small>The practice of saying Barechu is mentioned numerous times in the Talmud. It is even cited in the Mishnah (Maseches Berachos 49b) in the names of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael.</small>
<small><i>The Chazzan says:</i><br></small>
<b>Bless</b> Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small><i>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</i><br></small>
<b>Blessed</b> is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever. 
<small>The two blessings יוֹצֵר אוֹר “Former of light” and אַהֲבָה רַבָּה “With unbound love,” are referred to as the blessings preceding Shema (Maseches Berachos 11a). According to Rambam they were formulated by Ezra and his Court (Laws of Shema 1:7).</small>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Former<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Forming, יוצֵר, is the act of refining or modifying an original substance, whereas, creating, בּורֵא, refers to creating the original substance from nothing. For example, when one shapes a wooden table, to make it round, he “forms” the wood, the original substance which was “created.” Similarly, Hashem “forms the light” which is His act of modifying or limiting the darkness He created.—Siddur HaGra</i> of light, Creator of darkness, Maker<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Making, עושֶׂה, is the act of completion, such as when one completes a table by painting it. Similarly, Hashem’s finishing touch of creation is “making peace,” the vessel that holds it all together, as stated in the Mishnah, “Hashem found no vessel to contain blessing other than peace.” לֹא מָצָא הקב"ה כְּלִי מַחְזִיק בְּרָכָה אֶלָא הַשָּׁלום— Siddur HaGra</i> of peace, and Creator<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Yeshaya (45:7) on which this blessing is based concludes with the words, “and creates evil.” In His original creation Hashem created the potential for evil, which He constantly limits and controls as the Former and Maker.—Siddur HaGra</i> of all things. 








<b>He illuminates</b> the earth [and provides light] for those who dwell on it with compassion;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem causes light to appear in stages, gradually.

The blessed Almighty, great in knowledge, prepared and made the rays of the sun. [The] Good [One] created [everything] for the glory of His Name:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Yeshaya 43:7: “All that is called by My Name, I have created for My glory.”—Avudraham</i> the luminaries He set around His strength (His throne).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Heavenly throne is thus conceived of as surrounded by angels and all the adoring heavenly bodies.—See Yeshaya 6:12 </i> The chiefs of His hosts are holy beings,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">“Holy beings” are angels.

Be blessed, our Former,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Some render צוּרֵנוּ “our Rock.” The Gaon of Vilna, however, maintains that it refers to Hashem as our Creator, thus describing Him in the tri-epochal aspect of His Unity: past, present, and future.

And they all open their mouths in holiness and purity, with song and music, and they bless, and praise, and glorify, and revere, and sanctify, and proclaim the sovereignty of—

“<b>Holy,</b> holy, holy is Adonoy of Hosts, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshaya 6:3. Targum Yonoson paraphrases this verse: “Holy [is Hashem] in the highest heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His almighty power; holy [is He] forever and for all eternity.” The Talmud, (Maseches Chulin 91b) refers to this verse as the “Sanctification of the Angels.” According to Avudraham and Yaavetz, this Kedushah has been inserted here to refute those who maintain that Hashem relinquished His control over the heavenly bodies, and they are now able to function independently. We are therefore told that all the heavenly hosts proclaim Hashem’s sanctification and dominion over all the universe.</i> 
  
 And the Ofanim and the holy Chayos, with a mighty sound rise toward the Serafim. Facing them, they offer praise and say, 
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from His place.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkel 3:12. According to the Kuzari, Hashem’s glory is a euphemism for Hashem Himself. Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: Hashem is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view set forth in the Kuzari is that “Hashem’s glory” includes the angels, His throne, His chariot, the firmament, and the spheres. These are called Hashem’s glory similar to a king’s retinue which is his royal splendor.</i> 
To the Blessed Almighty, they<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The angels.</i> offer pleasant melodies; to the King, the Almighty, [Who is] living and enduring, they utter hymns and make praises heard. For He alone is the Performer of mighty deeds, Maker of new things; Master of battles, Sower of acts of righteousness,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair was given two measures of barley for safekeeping. The owner forgot about it for a number of years. Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair planted the barley seed, and each year replanted the previous year’s harvest until it grew to be a substantial crop. After seven years, the owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchas told him, “Come I will show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” Hashem does the same with the good and righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive his reward, Hashem returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated dividends. Midrash Rabba, Devarim 3:6</i> Causer of deliverance to sprout forth; Creator of cures. Awesome in praise, Master of wonders, He renews in His goodness, each day, continuously,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since the blessing began with the praise of Hashem as the Former of light Who continually renews the creation, it concludes on the same note.</i> the work of creation, as it is said: “[Give thanks to Him] Who makes the great luminaries,” for His kindness is everlasting.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 136:7.</i> Shine a new light upon Tziyon,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">We pray that we will be worthy of enjoying the original light of creation, which Hashem put aside for the righteous in the future world.—Yaavetz</i> and may we all soon be privileged to [enjoy] its brightness. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Former of the luminaries.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—Kuzari</i> 
<small>In the second of the blessings that precede Shema we praise God for His goodness in giving us His Torah, and pray for His help in the study of Torah. None of our petitions for the material goods of life approaches the fervor of this prayer for knowledge of the Torah and steadfastness in obeying it.</small>
<b>[With]</b> unbounded love You have loved us<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Kuzari writes, “When reciting the blessing ‘Unbounded Love’ אַהֲבָה רַבָּה, one should bear in mind that Hashem’s Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of Hashem’s will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called love.”</i> Adonoy, our God; [With] great and abundant pity<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem bestowed His great and abundant pity on us after we sinned in making the golden calf. He not only pardoned us, but gave us the Second Tablets and ordained the construction of the Tabernacle (Mishkan) for His Divine Presence to dwell among us.—Siach Yitzchak</i> have You pitied us. Our Father, our King! for the sake of our forefathers who trusted in You, and whom You taught statutes of life, so too, be gracious to us and teach us.

Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who chooses His people Yisrael with love. 

Recitation of Shema

<small>The recitation of Shema was part of the daily worship in the Holy Temple, and our Sages ordained that it be recited in the synagogue service, providing it a central place in the morning and evening prayers of each Jew. Its importance may be judged from the fact that the very first Mishnah in the Oral Torah opens with the question, “From what time may the evening Shema be read?”</small>
<small>In reading Shema, bear in mind that you are performing a Scriptural commandment. All three paragraphs should be read with kavanah, concentrated intention, on what you are saying. The entire Shema should be recited in awe and reverence as it proclaims the existence and unity of God; the Jews’ complete dedication to God and His commandments; the belief in Divine justice; the remembrance of the Exodus and the selection of the Jews as God’s Chosen People. These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָל֯־לְ֯בָבְךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.</small>
<small><i>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</i><br></small>
(Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Yisrael:</b> Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שְׁמַע and last letter of אֶחָד are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עֵד“witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to Hashem’s unity.—Avudraham<br>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on Hashem’s unity. The last word, אֶחָד “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that Hashem, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Yisrael, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i> 
<small><i>The following three lines are to be said silently:</i><br></small>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Yisrael” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Yaakov said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moshe did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Yaakov ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a.<br>When Moshe went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise Hashem by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם aloud.—Midrash Rabba to Devarim</i> 
And you shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages (Sifrei to Devarim 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to Hashem’s Law and make them instruments for His service.</i> and with all your soul<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved Hashem with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.</i> and with all your possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to Hashem and to Torah might entail.</i> And these words which I command you today,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The teachings of the Torah should be ever fresh in your minds, as though you received it today.—Ibid.</i> shall be upon your heart.

<b>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</b> 
You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. 
<b>And so,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The word וּבְכֵן, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i></b> grant<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">The word תֵּן implies מַתָּנָה, a gift. We ask Hashem to grant us the feeling of reverence for Him, as a gift, knowing how difficult it is to attain such a high level of reverence completely on our own (Siach Yitzchak).</i> that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The word מַעֲשֶׂיךָ, lit., Your works, indicates that which has attained or is near perfection.

<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice,<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The entire universe was created for the sake of Yisrael in order that Hashem’s Divine Influence be attached to it. This essence (Yisrael) was created for the sake of an even more treasured essence, namely the prophets and the pious among them. This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashana-Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).</i> and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One.

Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name.

Avinu Malkenu

<small>This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (Taanis 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered.

Contrary to the view that Hashem the Father is so full of love for His children that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that Hashem the King must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations.

<small>The following prayer is taken from the Zohar (Parshas Vayakhail), the basic text of Kabbalah which was written by the Mishnahic sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The Zohar states, “When the Torah is taken out to be read before the congregation, the heavenly gates of mercy are opened, and the Divine love is aroused; therefore one should say the following prayer.</small>
<b>Blessed</b> is the Name of the Master of the Universe. Blessed is Your crown and Your place. May Your good will [be] with Your people Yisrael forever.

May it be Your will to prolong our lives in well-being. Let me be counted among the righteous, so that You will have compassion on me and protect me and all that is mine, and all that belongs to Your people, Yisrael. You are He Who nourishes all and maintains all; You are He Who rules over all; You are He Who rules over kings, and the kingdom is Yours. I am a servant of the Holy One, blessed is He, I bow before Him and before the honor of His Torah at all times. Not in man do I put my trust, nor do I rely on any angel; but only in the God of heaven Who is the true God, Whose Torah is truth, Whose prophets are true, and Who performs many deeds of goodness and truth. In Him I put my trust and to His holy, honored Name I utter praises. May it be Your will to open my heart to Torah, and to fulfill the desires of my heart and of the heart of Your people Yisrael for goodness, for life, and for peace.

Reading of the Torah for the First Day

<small><b>Bereishis 21:1-34</b></small>
<small><i>For the Torah reading for the second day of Rosh Hashana, turn to page 275.</i><br></small>
<small><i>The account of the birth of Yitzchak is read on the first day of Rosh Hashana because it was then decreed in heaven that Sarah should give birth to a son.</i></small>
And Adonoy considered Sarah as He had said; and Adonoy did for Sarah as He had spoken. Sarah conceived and gave birth to Avraham’s son in his old age, at the designated time that God had declared. And Avraham named the son that was born to him, to which Sarah had given birth, Yitzchak. And Avraham circumcised his son Yitzchak when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Avraham was one hundrerd years old when his son Yitzchak was born to him. And Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, all who hear will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would have said to Avraham, that Sarah would nurse children? For I have given birth to a son in his old age.” And the child grew and was weaned, and Avraham made a great feast on the day that Yitzchak was weaned. And Sarah saw that the son which Hagar, the Mitzrayimian, had born unto Avraham, was mocking.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">According to some, Sarah saw Yishmael commit three of the worst possible sins, adultery, idolatry, and murder. A very different opinion is expressed by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who said, “Heaven forbid that such sins would have been committed in Avraham’s house.” (Yishmael was fourteen years old at the time.) He maintains that Yishmael’s mockery consisted of his claiming the premier right of inheritance over Yitzchak.</i> She said to Avraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son; for the son of this slave woman will not share the inheritance with my son Yitzchak. But the matter appeared extremely bad in the eyes of Avraham on account of his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It was very difficult for him to drive Yishmael away from his house. Avraham was kind-hearted to all; even more so to his own flesh and blood. Having to drive away his son was the worst thing that every happened to Avraham (Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer).</i> And God said to Avraham, “Do not consider this bad for the boy and for your slave woman; regarding all that Sarah tells you, listen to her, for only through Yitzchak will offspring be called unto you.
And also the son of the slave woman will I make into a nation, for he is your offspring.”And Avraham got up early in the morning, took bread and a skin (pouch) of water, gave it to Hagar, placing it on her shoulder with the lad, and sent her away; she went and lost her way in the desert of Beer Sheba. The water in the skin was used up,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Although Avraham had given them sufficient food and water to reach their destination, Yishmael contracted an illness, and suffering from fever, he consumed all the water (Rashi).</i> and she threw the lad under one of the bushes. She went and sat facing him, about the distance of a bowshot away, for she said, “Let me not see the death of the lad”; and she sat facing him and wept in a loud voice. And God heard the voice of the lad,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">According to Targum Yonassan, Hashem had compassion on Yishmael, and heard his voice because of Avraham’s merit. Others say that Yishmael also had merit, since he allowed his father to circumcise him when he was a grown lad of thirteen years.</i> and an angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad in the place where he is.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As Hashem was about to spare Yishmael, certain angels argued that he did not deserve miraculous intervention because of the following event that was to occur in the future: When Nebuchadnezzar drove the Jews from Yerushalayim to Babylonia, eighty thousand young kohanim, (priests) fled to the Yishmaelites. They said, “We are brothers, all we ask is some water to quench our thirst. The Yishmaelites first gave them generous helpings of salt fish, saying that it was not good to drink on an empty stomach. Since they were nearly starving, they ate the fish, which made them all the more thirsty. When they asked for water, the Yishmaelites gave them skins filled with air. When they took them to their lips, the pressure exploded their stomachs, killing many of them.<br>The angels said, “The descendants of Yishmael are destined to do such a wicked thing to Your children, killing them with thirst. How can You now save Yishmael, since he himself is also wicked? “I know,” replied the Almighty, “but I judge a person only according to what he is now, and at this point in time, Yishmael doesn’t deserve to die of thirst. See Rashi, Targum Yonassan.</i> “Arise, lift up the lad, and strengthen your hand over him, for I will make him a great nation.” And God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad to drink. And God was with the lad and he grew up; and he settled in the desert and he became an expert archer. He settled in the desert of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Mitzrayim.
It was at this time that Avimelech and Pichol, his general, spoke to Avraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do.” “And now, swear to me here, by God, that you will not deal falsely with me, with my son or my grandson; according to the kindness that I have done with you, do unto me and to the land in which you have lived a while.” And Avraham said, “I will swear.” And then Avraham reprimanded Avimelech regarding the well of water that Avimelech’s servants had taken by force. And Avimelech said, “I don’t know who did this thing, neither did you tell me, and I also heard nothing of it until today.” And Avraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Avimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.
And Avraham set seven ewes of the flock apart, by themselves. And Avimelech said to Avraham, “What is the reason for these seven ewes that you have set apart?” And Avraham said, “these seven ewes, you will accept from me, so that it will be proof for me that I dug this well.” Therefore he called that place Beer Sheba, because there, the two of them took an oath. They made a covenant in Beer Sheba; then Avimelech and Pichol, his general, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines. And Avraham planted an eshel<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to some commentaries, the word אֵשֶׁל is an abbreviation of אַכִילָה (food), שְׁתִיָה (drink) and לְוִיָה (escort), which were part of the generous hospitality provided by Avraham.</i> tree in Beer Sheba, and there he proclaimed the Name of God, Almighty of the universe. And Avraham lived in the land of the Philistines for many days.

Reading of the Torah for the Second Day

<small><b>Bereishis 22:1-24</b></small>
After these events, God tested Avraham and said to him, “Avraham!” and he [Avraham] said, “Here I am.” He said, “Please, take your son, your only one, whom you love — Yitzchak — and go to the land of Moriah, and bring him up as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will designate to you. Avraham awoke early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took his two attendants with him. and also his son Yitzchak. He split the wood of the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went to the place that God had designated to him.
On the third day, Avraham lifted his eyes and saw the place from afar. Avraham said to his attendants. “You stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go to that place. We will prostrate ourselves [in worship] and return to you.” And Avraham took the wood of the burnt-offering and placed it on his son Yitzchak. In his hand he took the fire and the knife, and they both went together. Yitzchak spoke to Avraham his father and said, “Father,” and he said, “Here I am my son.” He said, “Here are the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?” Avraham said, “God Himself will show the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went together.
They came to the place that God had designated to him, and Avraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his son Yitzchak and placed him on the altar on top of the wood. Avraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. An angel of Adonoy called to him from heaven and said, “Avraham! Avraham!” and he said, “Here I am.” He [God] said, “Do not harm the boy, nor do anything to him; for now I know that you are one who fears God and have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me.” Avraham raised his eyes and beheld a ram after it had been caught in the thicket by its horns; and Avraham went and took the ram, and brought it up as a burnt-offering instead of his son. Avraham called the name of that place, “Adonoy will see”; as it is said [to] this day “On Adonoy’s mountain, He will be seen.”
An angel of Adonoy called to Avraham a second time from heaven, and said, “‘I have sworn by Myself,’ declares Adonoy, ‘that because you performed this deed, and did not withhold your only son, I will greatly bless you and make your descendants numerous as the stars of the sky and like the sand on the seashore, and your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies. Through your children, will be blessed all the nations of the world because you heeded My voice.’” Avraham returned to his attendants, and they rose and went together to Beer Sheva, and Avraham dwelt in Beer Sheva.
And it was after these events that it was told to Avraham, “Behold, Milkah also has had children from Nachor, your brother. Utz his first born; and Booz, his brother; and Kmuel, the father of Aram. And Kessed, Chazo, Pildash, Yidlof, and Bethuel. And Bethuel fathered Rebbeca; these eight children, Milkah bore to Nachor, Avraham’s brother. His (Nachor’s) concubine was named Reumah, and she too gave birth, to Tevach, Gacham, Tachash and Ma’achah.
<small><i>When the reading of the Torah is concluded, the Half Kaddish is recited by the Reader. The Torah is raised so that the congregation can see the script, and the congregation exclaims:</i><br></small>
<b>This</b> is the Torah which Moshe placed before the children of Yisrael. at Adonoy’s command by the hand of Moshe. It is a tree of life to those who grasp to it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Long life is at its right, at its left, riches and honor. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it. 

Maftir Reading from the Second Sefer Torah

On the seventh month, the first day of the month shall be for you a day of holy assembly, and all work of labor you shall not do; a day of sounding the shofar it shall be for you. And you shall prepare a burnt-offering for a pleasing savor to Adonoy; one young bullock, one ram, seven male yearling lambs without blemish. And their meal-offering of fine flour mixed with oil; three tenths [of an epha] for the bullock, two tenths for the ram. And one tenth for each lamb, for the seven lambs. And one he-goat for a sin-offering; to make atonement for you. These are in addition to the burnt-offering of Rosh Chodesh and its meal- offering, and their [wine] libations as prescribed; [all these will be for] a pleasing savor, a burnt-offering to Adonoy.

Berachos for the Haftarah

<small>The Haftarah, a selected reading from the Prophets, usually contains some reference to the text or theme of the Sidrah, the Torah Reading, which precedes it. According to Avudraham, the recitation of the Haftarah, was instituted during the period of persecution preceding the revolt of the Maccabees, when the actual Torah reading was prohibited. Readings from the Prophets were then substituted in order to review some of the teachings contained in the Torah itself. The word הַפְטָרָה is derived from the root פטר, which means to discharge or conclude. By reading the Haftarah, we conclude the reading of the Torah.</small>
<small><i>Berachah recited before the reading of the Haftarah:</i><br></small>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who chose good prophets,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The true prophet must be genuinely tov “good” and a friend to all men both in his attitude and in his conduct.

Hashem chooses as His prophets only such men whose words are נֶאֱמָרִים בֶּאֱמֶת, spoken in truth.—S. R. Hirsch</i> which were spoken in truth. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who chooses the Torah and Moshe, His servant, and Yisrael, His people, and the prophets of truth and righteousness. 

Haftarah for the First Day of Rosh Hashana

<small><b>I Shmuel 1-2:10</b></small>
And there was a certain man from Ramathaim-Zophim, the hills of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Yerocham, the son of Eliyhu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuf, a distinguished man. And he had two wives; one named Hannah and the other, Peninah. And Peninah had children but Hannah had no children. And this man went up from his city, from year to year, to prostrate himself and offer sacrifices to the Adonoy of Hosts, in Shiloh. And there, the two sons of Eli, Chophni and Pinchas, were priests to Adonoy. And on the day when Elkanah offered sacrifices, he gave portions to Peninah, his wife and to all her sons and daughters. And to Hannah, he gave a double portion because he loved Hannah, though Adonoy had closed up her womb. And her rival taunted her bitterly to provoke her, because Adonoy had closed up her womb. And as he did so from year to year; whenever she came up to the House of Adonoy she provoked Hannah who wept and would not eat. And Elkanah, her husband, said to her: “Why do you weep? And why won’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” And Hannah arose after they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, and Eli, the Priest, sat on the chair near the door-post of the Temple of Adonoy. And she was bitterly grieved and prayed to Adonoy and wept. And she vowed a vow and said: “Adonoy of Hosts if You will see the anguish of Your handmaid and remember me and will not forget Your handmaid and will give Your handmaid a son—then I will give him to Adonoy all the days of his life and no razor shall touch his head.” And she prayed so long before Adonoy, that Eli observed her mouth. But Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved but her voice was not heard. And Eli thought her to be a drunkard. And Eli said to her: “How long will you remain drunk? Free yourself from your need of wine!” And Hannah answered and said: “No, my master, I am a woman of grieved spirit; I have not drunk any wine or other intoxicating drinks. But I have poured out my soul in the presence of God. Do not take your handmaid for a wicked woman; it is only because of my sorrow and grief that I have spoken until now.”And Eli answered and said: “Go in peace! And may the God of Yisrael grant you that which you asked of Him.” And she said: “May your servant find grace in your eyes.” And the woman went on her way and she ate and she was no longer grieved. And they arose early in the morning and prostrated themselves before Adonoy and returned to their home in Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah, his wife, and Adonoy remembered. And in the course of days, Hannah conceived and bore a son and she called him Shmuel, because from Adonoy I asked for him. And the man Elkanah and his entire household went up to offer the yearly sacrifice and to fulfill his vows to Adonoy. But Hannah did not go up, for she told her husband: “When the boy is weaned, I will bring him to appear before Adonoy and he will remain there forever.” And Elkanah, her husband, said to her: “Do what is best in your eyes; stay here until you wean him and may Adonoy fulfill the word that was said of him.” And the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. And she took him up with her, after she weaned him, along with three bullocks and an ephah of flour and a bottle of wine. And she brought him to the House of Adonoy at Shiloh, when he was still a young boy. And they slaughtered the bullock and brought the child to Eli. And she said: “Please, my master. I am the woman who stood here with you to pray to Adonoy. I prayed for this boy and Adonoy gave me what I asked of Him. And I have therefore loaned him to Adonoy; for as long as he lives, he is loaned to Adonoy.” And he prostrated himself there to Adonoy. And Hannah prayed and said: My heart exults in God; my horn is raised through Adonoy. My mouth is opened wide against my enemies, because I rejoice in Your deliverance. There is none as holy as Adonoy, for nothing else exists besides You; nor is there any rock like our God. Do not talk so much, so haughtily; nor let arrogance come out of your mouths; For Adonoy is a God of knowledge, and He weighs all of man’s actions. The bows of the powerful are broken, while the feeble are girded with strength. Those that were sated must hire themselves out to labor for bread, while those who were hungry no longer toil. While the barren woman has born seven children, she with many children languishes. Adonoy causes death and gives life; He brings down to the grave but also brings up therefrom. Adonoy impoverishes and makes rich; He lowers and He raises up. He raises up the poor from the dust, lifts up the needy from the dunghill, to seat them with nobles, and they inherit the throne of honour; for the foundations of the earth are Adonoy’s and He has set the world of man upon them. He will guard the footsteps of His pious ones, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness; for not by might shall man prevail. Those that strive against Adonoy shall be broken to pieces; Adonoy will thunder against them in the heavens. He will judge the ends of the earth and give strength to His king and raise up the horn of His anointed. 

Haftarah for the Second Day of Rosh Hashana

<small><b>Yirmiyahu 31:2-20</b></small>
Thus spoke Adonoy: The people that survived the sword<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the armies of Egypt and Amalek.—Rashi</i> found favour in My eyes; in the desert, on their way to seek rest in the land of Yisrael. From afar, Adonoy appeared to me, saying: I have loved you with everlasting love; therefore I have drawn you to Me with affection. I shall build you again and then shall you be rebuilt, maiden of Yisrael; once again you shall adorn your drums and go forth in the dances of the merry. Once again, you shall plant vineyards in the hills of Samaria; the planters shall plant them and redeem them.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the fruits of the fourth year after planting which must be eaten in Yerushalayim or redeemed with money.

For thus spoke Adonoy: Sing joyously for Yaakov and shout joyously from the hilltops of the nations; make it known; praise and proclaim: Adonoy, deliver Your people, the remnant of Yisrael. I shall bring them from the north country<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Babylonia.</i> and I shall gather them from the ends of the earth; the blind and the lame among them, pregnant women and nursing mothers, together; a large gathering shall return, here.

Hear the words of Adonoy, you nations, and speak of it in far-off islands and say: He who scattered Yisrael will gather them and He guards them as a shepherd guards his flock. For Adonoy has redeemed Yaakov and freed him from a hand mightier than his (own). And they shall come and sing joyously from the heights of Tziyon and they shall stream towards the goodness of Adonoy; to the corn, the wine, the oil, the sheep and the cattle. And their soul shall be like a well-watered garden and they shall no longer have to worry. Then the maiden shall rejoice in dancing and the young men and the old, together and I will change their mourning into joy and I shall comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow. And I shall satiate the souls of the priests with fatness<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">During the Exile, the Kohanim were deprived of their share of the sacrifices and tithes. Upon the deliverance of the people, they will again receive their due.</i> and My nation shall be satisfied with My goodness, says Adonoy. For thus spoke Adonoy: A voice is heard on high, crying and lamenting bitterly; it is Rachel weeping over her children, refusing to be comforted, for they are gone. For thus spoke Adonoy: Refrain (your voice) from crying and your eyes from shedding tears; for there is a reward for your deeds, said Adonoy; and they shall return from the land of the enemy. And there is hope for your future, said Adonoy; and the sons shall return to their borders. I have heard Ephraim reproaching himself, saying: You have punished me, and I have been chastised, like an untrained calf; bring me back to You and I shall return, for You, Adonoy, are my God. After I repented, I regretted,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The sinner regrets the sins of the past.</i> and after I examined myself, I struck my thigh; I am ashamed and disgraced because of the sins of my youth. Ephraim is a precious son to Me; a child in whom I delight. For when I speak of him, I remember him more; therefore I long for him and shall surely have compassion on him, said Adonoy.

Sounding of the Shofar

<small>According to Rav Saadiah Gaon the Almighty commanded us to sound the shofar on Rosh Hashana for these ten reasons:</small>
<small>1) Rosh Hashana corresponds to the first day of creation and the shofar proclaims the sovereignty of the Creator. We are obliged to coronate God as King on this day in the manner written by Dovid, “בַּחֲצֹצְרוֹת וְקוֹל שׁוֹפָר הָרִיעוּ לִפְנֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ ה', With trumpets and the sound of shofar, call out in the presence of the King, Almighty” (Psalms 48:6).</small>
<small>2) Rosh Hashana is the beginning of the Ten Days of Repentance and the shofar calls the people to amend their lives before the final judgment of Yom Kippur. It was customary for rulers to issue a final warning to their subjects before punishing them for violating their decrees. Similarly, the shofar represents God’s last warning to His people to repent.</small>
<small>3) The sounding of the shofar recalls the revelation of the Torah on Mount Sinai. The Torah was given to us amid blasts of the shofar, as it is written, “וְקוֹל שׁוֹפָר חָזָק מְאֹד,” the sound of shofar was most powerful” (Shemos 19:16), and the people accepted it saying “We will do and we will listen.”</small>
<small>4) The shofar brings to mind the warnings and exhortations of the prophets which are likened to the blasts of the shofar, as it is said, וְשָׁמַע הַשֹׁמֵעַ אֶת קוֹל הַשׁוֹפָר וְלֹא נִזְהָר וַתָּבוֹא חֶרֶב וַתִּקָּחֵהוּ דָמוֹ בְּרֹאשׁוֹ יִהְיֶה ... וְהוּא נִזְהָר נַפְשׁוֹ מִלֵט. He who hears the sound of the shofar and does not take warning, the sword come ands takes him away, his blood will be upon his own head ... but he who heeds warning will save his soul. (Yechezkel 33:4,5).</small>
<small>5) The shofar reminds us of the destruction of the Holy Temple which was destroyed amid the sounding of enemy trumpets, as it is said: כִּי קוֹל שׁוֹפָר שָׁמַעַתְּ נַפְשִׁי תְּרוּעַת מִלְחָמָה—“For you have heard the sound of the shofar, O my soul, the shouts of battle (Yirmiyahu 4:19); and when we hear the shofar on Rosh Hashana, we pray to God to restore the Temple to its former glory.</small>
<small>6) The shofar recalls the willingness of Yitzchak to be sacrificed on the altar in obedience to God’s command to Avraham. We pray that with the sounding of the shofar his great deed will be recalled by the Almighty as a source of merit to his descendents.</small>
<small>7) It is the nature of the shofar’s sound to arouse the heart to awe and reverence. Thus when we hear the shofar, we tremble and humble ourselves before the presence of God.</small>
<small>8) The shofar reminds us of the ultimate Day of Judgment, as it is said, “קָרוֹב יוֹם ה' הַגָדוֹל, קָרוֹב וּמַהֵר מְאֹד—יוֹם שׁוֹפָר וּתְרוּעָה” “The great day of Almighty is near, it is near and rapidly approaching—a day of the shofar and shouting” (Tzefanyah 1:14, 16).</small>
<small>9) The shofar inspires us with hope for the ultimate ingathering of our people and their deliverance from exile, as it is said, “וְהָיָה בַּיוֹם הַהוּא יִתָּקַע בְּשׁוֹפָר גָדוֹל וּבָאוּ הָאֹבְדִים בְּאֶרֶץ אַשׁוּר וגו' And it will be on that day that a great shofar will be sounded; and those who were lost in the land of Ashur ... will come and prostrate themselves before Adonoy on the holy mountain in Yerushalayim.” (Yeshaya 27:13)</small>
<small>10) The shofar reminds us of the future resurrection of the dead and it reaffirms our faith that God will revive the dead which will be heralded with the sounding of the shofar.</small>
<small>This Psalm (47) is recited seven times prior to the sounding of the Shofar. The Name, אלהים, which refers to God’s manifestation, as One Who rules with strict justice, appears in this psalm seven times. Thus we mention the Name אלהים forty-nine times as a prelude to the sounding of the Shofar. Our sages have said that there are forty-nine levels of spiritual impurity before one reaches the lowest depth, from which no salvation is possible. On the other hand, there are forty-nine ascending levels of intellectual sanctity which man can attain. In reciting this psalm we pray for the blast of the Shofar to arouse God’s mercy to overcome His manifestation of strict justice. We also pray for the sound of the shofar to inspire us to climb from the forty-ninth level of spiritual impurity, to rise to the forty-ninth level of sanctity.</small>

When the Jew hears the broken notes of the teruah, he realizes that he deserves shattering punishment for his transgressions and is inspired to teshuvah, true repentance. His sins are forgiven and this forgiveness is symbolized in the ascendance of Hashem from His Throne of Strict Justice (Elokim) to sit on His Throne of Mercy.

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. 
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by Dovid! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works, and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak, and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your Kingship, they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His Kingship. Your Kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him, He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare and all flesh will bless His Holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now forever. Praise God.

Almighty of glory thunders, Adonoy is upon [the] many waters. The voice of Adonoy is in power, the voice of Adonoy is in beauty. The voice of Adonoy breaks cedars, Adonoy shatters the cedars of Lebanon. He makes them leap like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like unicorns. The voice of Adonoy hews out flames of fire. The voice of Adonoy makes the desert tremble, Adonoy makes the desert of Kadesh tremble. The voice of Adonoy causes hinds to calve, and strips the forests bare; and in His Sanctuary all proclaim [His] glory. Adonoy sat enthroned (even) at the flood, Adonoy is enthroned as King forever. Adonoy will give strength to His people; Adonoy will bless His people with peace.

And when it rested, he would say: Return, Adonoy, to the myriads and thousands of Yisrael. Arise, Adonoy unto Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your strength. Let Your priests clothe themselves in righteousness, and let Your devoted ones sing in joy. For the sake of Dovid, Your servant, do not reject Your anointed. For I have given you good instruction, do not forsake My Torah. It is a tree of life to those who grasp it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return; renew our days as of old.

<b>Behold,</b> I stand here, impoverished in good deeds, perturbed and frightened in fear [of Him,] Who is enthroned upon the praises of Yisrael.

<small><b>Introduction to מַלְכֻיּוֹת, זִכְרוֹנוֹת, וְשׁוֹפָרוֹת</b> </small>
<small>The major portion of the Musaf service, is based on the three concepts: מַלְכֻיּוֹת, namely, that God reigns over the world and we accept His rule; זִכְרוֹנוֹת, that He remembers as He reviews our past; and שׁוֹפָרוֹת, that we are called upon to follow Him into a new future of Torah obedience and fulfillment. These thoughts are impressed upon us in the Musaf service by means of detailed references from the Bible. For each of these three concepts we are given ten Biblical quotations, three from the Torah, three from Sacred Writings, (כְּתוּבִים), and three from the Prophets, (נְבִיאִים). The final quotation is again taken from the Torah; for the Torah is the exclusive, basic source of all Jewish truth, and neither the Writings or the Prophets contain any thought that is not contained in some form in the Torah. Thus these series of quotations both begin and end with quotations from the Torah itself. In keeping with the Talmudic principle, מַעֲלִין בַּקוֹדֶשׁ וְלֹא מוֹרִידִין “that one must always proceed upward and forward, and never backward and downward with respect to things holy,” the quotations from the Writings precede those from the Prophets; for while the Writings are only the product of sacred inspiration, רוּחַ הַקוֹדֶשׁ, the words of the Prophets are the actual, direct, Divine revelation. Thus in this sequence, that which is written in the Writings is confirmed by the Prophets and sealed by the Torah.</small>
<small>The prayer of עָלֵינוּ sets the tone of מַלְכֻיּוֹת for it declares our acceptance of God as our Master and Creator. It concludes with the proclamation that all men will eventually accept upon themselves the yoke of His Kingdom.</small>
<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of [the world in] the beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in the heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftier heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth; and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize, and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You every knee must bend, every tongue must swear allegiance to You. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will accept upon themselves the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” 
<b>And it is said:</b> “He beheld no iniquity in Yaakov, nor did He see wrongdoing in Yisrael; Adonoy, His God is with him, and the love of the king is among them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 23:21. These words were uttered by Bilaam when he was asked to curse the nation of Yisrael. He realized that Yisrael was a unique nation in the eyes of Hashem, their King, and thus were invulnerable to his curses.</i> And it is said: “And He was King in Yeshurun, with the gathering of the heads of the people, the tribes of Yisrael were united.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 33:5. Rashi says that Hashem was King of Yisrael only when the tribes of Yisrael were united. When there is unity and harmony among Jews, the kingdom of Hashem is revealed and enhanced.</i> 
And in Your holy words it is written: “For the kingship is Adonoy’s, and He rules over nations.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 22:29. The word king signifies one whose leadership is accepted willingly by his people. In referring to the nation of Yisrael which willingly accepted the kingship of Hashem, the Psalmist says, “For the kingship is Adonoy’s.” A ruler, however, might be one who imposes his rule without consent of the people. Therefore, regarding the other nations who do not willingly submit to His Kingship, a Psalmist says, “And He rules over nations.”—Gaon of Vilna</i> And it is said: “Adonoy has begun His reign, He has clothed Himself in majesty; Adonoy has clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength. He has also firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 93:1.</i> And it is said: “Lift up your heads,—gates, and be uplifted entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is this King of Glory? Adonoy, strong and mighty; Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle. Lift up your heads,—gates, and lift up entranceways to eternity,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The words וּשְׂאוּ פִּתְחֵי עו‍ֹלָם, “and lift up entranceways to eternity,” imply that the gates of the Temple will lift up voluntarily, whereas the earlier words וְהִנָשְׂאוּ פִתְחֵי עו‍ֹלָם, “and be uplifted entranceways to eternity” suggests that the gates must be uplifted against their will. The Siach Yitzchak quoting Malbim explains that initially Hashem was referred to as the King of Glory because He appeared as strong and mighty in battle, forcing the wicked to bend to His will. Therefore, the gates do not open willingly to permit the glory of Hashem to enter, and must be opened by force. Ultimately, however, the world will be so spiritually saturated that it will recognize Hashem’s greatness as the Creator of all. The gates will open by themselves to welcome Hashem, not as One mighty in vengeance but as the masterful Creator of the world.</i> so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is He, this King of Glory? Adonoy Tzevaos, He is the King of Glory, Selah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 24:7-10.</i> 
<b>And</b> by the hand of Your servants, the Prophets it is written: “Thus said Adonoy, King of Yisrael and its Redeemer, Adonoy Tzevaos: ‘I am the first and I am the last;<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshaya 44:6. According to the Kuzari, “first” is used to preclude the notion that anything existed before Him, but not to assert that He has a beginning. Similarly, “last” is used only to repudiate the idea that there is an end to His existence, not to fix a term for Him.</i> and beside Me, there is no God’.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshaya 44:6.</i> And it is said: “And deliverers will go up to Mount Tziyon to judge the mount of Esav, and the kingdom will be Adonoy’s.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Ovadyah 1:21.</i> And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Zecharyah 14:9. In messianic times, Hashem will be recognized as the One and only God by all nations, and they will accept Him willingly, proclaiming His unity.</i> 
<b>And</b> in Your Torah it is written: “Hear, Yisrael: Adonoy is our God Adonoy is One!”<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 6:4.</i> 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, reign over the entire world with Your glory, and be uplifted over all the earth with Your honor, and appear in the splendor of Your majestic might over all who dwell in the inhabited world of Your earth; so everything that has been made will know that You have made it, and it will be understood by everything that was formed that You have formed it. And they will say everyone who has breath in his nostrils, “Adonoy, God of Yisrael is King and His Kingship rules over all.

For those who seek You will never stumble, and never will they be disgraced— all who trust in You. For the remembrance of all their deeds come before You, and You examine the deeds of all of them. 
And No’ach too, You remembered with love, and [therefore] decreed for him a promise of deliverance and compassion, when You brought the flood-waters to destroy all flesh because of the wickedness of their deeds. Therefore, his remembrance came before You, Adonoy, our God, to multiply his seed like the dust of the earth, and his descendants as the sand of the sea; as it is written in Your Torah; “And God remembered No’ach<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash, since there is no forgetfulness before Hashem, the words וַיִזְכֹּר אֱלֹקִים אֶת נֹחַ, imply that Hashem took cognizance of No’ach’s virtuous deeds.

And it is said: “And God heard their groaning cry, and God remembered His covenant with Avraham, with Yitzchak, and with Yaakov.”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 2:24. The Biblical verse deals with Hashem’s promise to redeem the children of Yisrael when they were yet enslaved in Egypt.</i> And it is said: “I will remember My covenant with Yaakov, and also My covenant with Yitzchak, and also My covenant with Avraham, will I remember; and the land [of Yisrael] I will remember.”<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 26:42. This verse deals with the ultimate repentance of all Yisrael and Hashem’s promise to return them to their homeland.</i> 
And in Your holy words it is written: “He made a memorial for His wonders, gracious and merciful is Adonoy.”<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 111:4.</i> And it is said: “He gave food to those who fear Him; He is ever mindful of His covenant.”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 111:5.</i> And it is said: “And He remembered His covenant for them, and He relented in accordance with His abundant kindness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 106:45.</i>

I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, saying: “You have chastised me and I was chastised ... I was ashamed, I was also disgraced, because I bear the humiliation of the sins of my youth.” Thus, explains Rabbenu Shlomo of Germaza, when Hashem hears Ephraim’s words of repentance, He is moved to proclaim His Divine love for him and to recall His delight in him. Ephraim is the name by which the ten tribes of Yisrael was referred.</i> Therefore, My innermost being is aroused for him, I will surely have compassion on him,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The Almighty pledges His Divine mercy and promises to deliver them from exile.—Radak</i> says Adonoy.”<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 31:19.

And fulfill for us Adonoy, our God the promise You made in Your Torah, through Your servant, Moshe, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said: “I will remember for them the covenant with their forefathers whom I took out of the land of Mitzrayim, before the eyes of the nations, to be their God; I am Adonoy.”<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 31:19.</i> For He Who remembers all forgotten things from eternity, are You, and there is no forgetfulness before the Throne of Your Glory; and the binding of Yitzchak— in behalf of his descendants— may You remember it today with compassion.

My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein. 
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Yehudah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years.

And thus unto You may [our saying of] the Kedushah ascend, for You our God are King. 
There is a famous legend behind this stirring prayer as recorded in the thirteenth century work, Ohr Zerua, by Rabbi Yitzchak of Vienna. In the section dealing with laws of Rosh Hashana (Section 276), he writes, “I found a letter from Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn, in which he wrote that Rabbi Amnon of Mayence authored the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף as a result of a tragic incident in his life.” This is the story as recorded in the letter:
<small>Rabbi Amnon of Mayence, a great scholar, a person of wealth, a handsome man of noble ancestry was under great pressure from the lords and Archbishop of the city to change his faith and adopt their religion. He repeatedly ignored them but on one occasion, in order to put them off, he asked for three days to consider their request. Afterwards he was heartbroken because he had given the impression that he might actually consider renouncing his belief in the One Living God. He refused food or drink; weeping bitterly over his lapse, he refused to accept the sympathy and consolation of friends and relatives.</small>
<small>At the end of the three days he was summoned by the Archbishop, but he ignored the summons. A distinguished delegation was sent to ask him to appear at the court but he refused them. Finally, he was brought before the court by force, and the Archbishop demanded, “Why did you not come and answer me as you promised?” Rabbi Amnon answered, “As a punishment, you should have my tongue cut out, because my tongue deceived you.” Rabbi Amnon thought to sanctify God’s Name in this manner, since his tongue had uttered such a promise. The Archbishop replied, “No, I will not cut out your tongue for it spoke well, instead, I will cut off your feet for they did not bring you to me.” The tyrant ordered that his hands and feet be cut off in piecemeal fashion; asking him at each interval if he was willing to renounce his faith. He was finally released and sent home with his severed and mutilated limbs aside him in bed.</small>
<small>The holiday of Rosh Hashana was at hand, and the Rabbi, dying from the effects of his wounds, was at his own request carried into the synagogue, bringing his severed limbs with him. When the Chazzan was about to recite the Kedushah, Rabbi Amnon asked him to stop, saying, “Pause that I may sanctify His Most Holy Name,” and he said in a loud voice: וּבְכֵן וּלְךָ תַעֲלֶה קְדֻשָּׁה, and thus may this sanctification ascend to You, inferring that with his terrible suffering, he had sanctified God’s Name. He then began reciting the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף, and with the words אֱמֶת כִּי אַתָּה הוּא דַיָּן וּמוֹכִֽיח, true that You are Judge and Admonisher, he indicated his acceptance of God’s Divine judgment, and with the words וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם, and You recorded the decree of their judgments, he manifested his belief that his fate had been decreed on Rosh Hashana. No sooner had he finished the prayer when he expired. Three days later, he appeared to Rabbi Kolonymus ben Meshullam in a dream and taught him this prayer, asking him to introduce it to all congregations as a testimonial and as a memorial for him. This prayer has formed a portion of our Service ever since.</small>
<b>Let us describe</b> the great holiness of this day, for it is awesome and frightening.

Bartenura</i> As a shepherd inspects his flock, making his sheep pass under his rod, so do You cause to pass, count, number, and review the soul of every living being, determining the life-span of every creature; and You record the decree of their judgment. 
<b>On Rosh Hashana</b> their decree is inscribed, and on Yom Kippur it is sealed,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This formula of judgment is only for those who are considered בֵּינו‍ֹנִים, neither righteous nor wicked. The truly righteous are inscribed and sealed for life on Rosh Hashana, and the wicked also receive their full verdict on Rosh Hashana. Thus it is only the בֵּינו‍ֹנִי, one in between, who is given time until Yom Kippur to mend his ways and be judged for life. Talmud Yerushalmi, Maseches Rosh Hashana 1:3.</i> how many will pass away and how many will be created, who will live and who will die; who will come to his timely end, and who to an untimely end; who will perish by fire and who by water; who by the sword and who by beast; who by hunger and who by thirst; who by earthquake and who by the plague; who by strangling and who by stoning; who will be at rest and who will wander about; who will have serenity and who will be confused; who will be tranquil and who will be tormented; who will become poor and who will become wealthy; who will be brought to a low state and who will be uplifted.

Man, his beginning is from dust and ends in dust; risking his life, he gets his bread, he is like a potsherd that is breakable, like grass that withers, like the flower that fades, like the shadow that passes, like the cloud that vanishes, like the wind that blows, like the dust that flies, and like a fleeting dream.

Who is perfect and completely just with those who are perfect [with Him:] And all believe that He is perfect in all His work.

And the mountains will burst out in joyous song, and the isles will exult in Your Kingship, and they will accept the yoke of Your kingdom upon themselves, and they will exalt You in the assembly of peoples.

<b>SANCTIFICATION OF THE DAY</b>

<b>But because</b> of our sins, we were exiled from our land, and driven far away from our soil; and we are unable, and to perform our obligatory offerings in Your chosen House, in the great and holy House upon which Your Name is proclaimed, because of the hand [of violence] that was sent against Your Sanctuary. May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, merciful King, to once again have compassion on us and on Your Sanctuary in Your abundant mercy; and rebuild it soon and greatly enhance its glory. Our Father, our King! reveal the glory of Your Kingship upon us soon, appear and be uplifted over us before the eyes of all living things. Bring near our scattered [people] from among the nations, and gather our dispersed from the ends of the earth. Bring us to Tziyon, Your city, with joyous song,— to Yerushalayim, House of Your Sanctuary, with everlasting joy. And there we will offer before You our obligatory sacrifices— the daily [burnt] offerings in their order, and the Musaf offerings according to their rule. And the Musaf offerings of <br><i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br> (this Shabbos day and) this Day of Remembrance we will prepare and bring before You with love according to the command of Your will; as You wrote for us in Your Torah, through the hands of Moshe, Your servant, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said: 
<i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br> (“And on the Sabbath day [the offering is]: two male yearling lambs without blemish; two tenths [of an epha] of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with the [olive] oil, and its libation.” [This is] the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the daily burnt offering and its libation; [wine offering].) 
<b>And</b> in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, a day of holy assembly it shall be for you, all work of labor, you shall not do; a day of blowing [the shofar] it shall be for you. And you will prepare a burnt-offering for a pleasing savor to Adonoy; one young bullock, one ram, seven yearling lambs, without blemish. And their meal-offerings and libations as stated: three tenths [of an epha of fine flour] for the bullock, two tenths for the ram, and one tenth for each lamb, and wine according to each libation; and two he goats for atonement, and the two daily burnt-offerings according to their law. [These are] besides the burnt-offering of Rosh Chodesh and its meal-offering, and the daily burnt-offering and its meal-offering; and their drink offering according to their law. for a pleasing savor, an offering consumed by fire to Adonoy. 
<i>On Shabbos, add:</i><br> (They will rejoice in Your Kingship— those who preserve the Sabbath— and call it a delight. The people who sanctify the seventh [day] will all be satisfied and delighted with Your goodness. And the seventh [day]— You took pleasure in it, and You hallowed it. “Most desirable of days,” You called it— a commemoration of the work of creation.)

<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of [the world in] the beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in the heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftier heights. He is our God, there is nothing else.

Zikhronot

<b>You</b> remember the dealings of [men in] today’s world, and You [also] consider the behavior of all those who lived in earlier times. In Your Presence are revealed all hidden things and the multitude of secrets from the beginning of creation; for there is no forgetfulness before the throne of Your Glory, and there is nothing hidden from Your eyes. You remember all that has been done, and even all that which is formed is not concealed from You. All is revealed and known before You Adonoy, our God Who observes and looks until the end of all generations. For You set an appointed time of remembrance, to consider every soul and being; to cause numerous deeds to be remembered and the multitude of creatures without end. From the beginning of creation, You have made this known, and from before time You have revealed it. This day [Rosh Hashana] is the beginning of Your work a memorial of the first day. For it is a statute for Yisrael a [day of] judgment of the God of Yaakov. And over countries [judgment] is pronounced, which of them is destined for the sword [war] and which for peace, which for famine and which for abundance. And on it, creatures are brought to mind, to be remembered for life or for death. Who is not considered on this day? For the remembrance of all that is formed comes before You: the dealings of man, and the decree of his fate, and the misdeeds of man’s actions, the thoughts of man and his schemes, and the motives for the deeds of man. Fortunate is the man who does not forget You, the son of man who gains strength in You. For those who seek You will never stumble, and never will they be disgraced— all who trust in You. For the remembrance of all their deeds come before You, and You examine the deeds of all of them. And No’ach too, You remembered with love, and [therefore] decreed for him a promise of deliverance and compassion, when You brought the flood-waters to destroy all flesh because of the wickedness of their deeds. Therefore, his remembrance came before You, Adonoy, our God, to multiply his seed like the dust of the earth, and his descendants as the sand of the sea; as it is written in Your Torah; “And God remembered No’ach and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the Ark, and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were calmed.” And it is said: “And God heard their groaning cry, and God remembered His covenant with Avraham, with Yitzchak, and with Yaakov.” And it is said: “I will remember My covenant with Yaakov, and also My covenant with Yitzchak, and also My covenant with Avraham, will I remember; and the land [of Yisrael] I will remember.” 
<b>And</b> in Your holy words it is written: “He made a memorial for His wonders, gracious and merciful is Adonoy.” And it is said: “He gave food to those who fear Him; He is ever mindful of His covenant.” And it is said: “And He remembered His covenant for them, and He relented in accordance with His abundant kindness.” 
<b>And</b> by the hand of Your servants, the Prophets it is written: “Go and proclaim it in the ears of Yerushalayim, saying: thus said Adonoy, I remembered for you the kindness of your youth, the love of your bridal days, how you followed Me into the wilderness, in a land that was not cultivated.” And it is said: “I will remember My covenant [which I made] with you in the days of your youth, and I will fulfill it for you as an everlasting covenant.” And it is said: “Is Ephraim not My precious son, is he not a child of delight? For whenever I speak of him, I recall him even more; Therefore, My innermost being is aroused for him, I will surely have compassion on him, says Adonoy.” 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers remember us favorably before You and be mindful of us for deliverance and compassion from the eternal high heavens. Remember in our behalf, Adonoy, our God, the covenant, the kindness and the oath which You swore to our father Avraham on Mount Moriah, and let there appear before You the binding with which our father Avraham bound his son Yitzchak upon the altar, and how he suppressed his compassion to do Your will with a whole heart; so may Your compassion suppress Your anger against us, and in Your great goodness turn Your fierce anger away from Your people, and from Your city, from Your land, and from Your territorial heritage. And fulfill for us Adonoy, our God the promise You made in Your Torah, through Your servant, Moshe, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said: “I will remember for them the covenant with their forefathers whom I took out of the land of Mitzrayim, before the eyes of the nations, to be their God; I am Adonoy.” For He Who remembers all forgotten things from eternity, are You, and there is no forgetfulness before the Throne of Your Glory; and the binding of Yitzchak— on behalf of his descendants— may You remember it today with compassion. Blessed are You Adonoy, Who remembers the covenant. 

On this day, the world came into being; On this day, He makes stand in judgment— all the creatures of the worlds— whether as children, or as servants; if as children, have compassion on us as a father has compassion on his children! If as servants, our eyes are fixed on You until You favor us, and bring forth our judgment as the light, Revered and Holy One! 
<i>This paragraph is omitted on Shabbos</i><br> May the utterance of our lips be pleasing unto You, Almighty, Most High and Uplifted, Who understands, and gives ear, Who perceives and listens to the sound of our shofar blast, and accept with compassion and desire our prayers of remembrance. 

Shofarot

<b>You were revealed</b> in Your cloud of glory to Your holy people to speak to them. From the heavens, You let them hear Your voice, and revealed Yourself to them in pure clouds. So too, the entire world quivered before You, and the works of creation trembled before You, when You, our King revealed Yourself upon Mount Sinai to teach Your people Torah and mitzvos. You let them hear the majestic splendor of Your voice, and Your holy words from flames of fire; amidst thunder and lightning You revealed Yourself to them, and with the sound of a shofar, You appeared to them, as it is written in Your Torah: “And it was on the third day, as morning dawned there was thunder and lightning, and a dense cloud over the mountain, and the sound of a shofar was exceedingly loud; and all the people in the camp trembled.” And it is said: “And the sound of the shofar became increasingly louder; Moshe spoke and God answered him by voice.” And it is said: “And all the people saw the sounds and the flames, and the sound of the shofar, and the mountain in smoke; and the people saw and were shaken, and stood from afar.” 
<b>And</b> in Your holy words it is written: “God has ascended with a blast, Adonoy, with the sound of a shofar.” And it is said: “With trumpets and the sound of a shofar raise your voices before the King, Adonoy.” And it is said: “Blow a shofar on the New Moon, as the appointed time for our festive-day. For it is a statute for Yisrael, a day of judgment of the God of Yaakov.” And it is said: “Praise God. Praise the Almighty in His Sanctuary Praise God in the firmament of His might. Praise Him for His mighty deeds, Praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness. Praise Him with the blowing of a shofar, Praise Him with lyre and harp. Praise Him with drum and dance, Praise Him with stringed instruments and flute. Praise Him with resounding cymbals, Praise Him with clanging cymbals. Let every soul praise God, Praise God.” 
<b>And</b> by the hand of Your servants, the Prophets it is written: “All who inhabit the world of man and who dwell on earth— when the banner is raised on the mountains you will see it; and when a shofar will be sounded, you will hear it.” And it is said: “And it will be on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, and they will come— those who were lost in the land of Ashur, and those who were outcasts in the land of Mitzrayim, and they will prostrate themselves to Adonoy, on the holy mountain in Yerushalayim.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will appear over them, and His arrow will go forth like lightning; and my Master, Adonoy, will sound the shofar and go forth in the whirlwinds of the south. Adonoy Tzevaos will protect them.” So may You be a shield over Your people, Yisrael, with Your peace. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, sound a great shofar for our liberty and raise a banner to gather our exiles. And bring near our scattered people from among the nations, and gather our dispersed from the ends of [the] earth. Bring us to Tziyon, Your city, with joyous song,— to Yerushalayim, House of Your Sanctuary, with eternal joy. And there we will offer before You our obligatory sacrifices, as we were commanded in Your Torah, through the hands of Moshe, Your servant, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said: “And on the day of your rejoicing, and on your appointed festivals, and on your Rosh Chodesh days, you will sound the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God; I am Adonoy, your God.” For You hear the sound of shofar, and listen to the teruah; and there is none like You. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who hears the sound of the teruah of His people, Yisrael, with compassion. 

On this day, the world came into being; On this day, He makes stand in judgment— all the creatures of the worlds— whether as children, or as servants; if as children, have compassion on us as a father has compassion on his children! If as servants, our eyes are fixed on You until You favor us, and bring forth our judgment as the light, Revered and Holy One! 
<i>This paragraph is omitted on Shabbos</i><br> May the utterance of our lips be pleasing unto You, Almighty, Most High and Uplifted, Who understands, and gives ear, Who perceives and listens to the sound of our shofar blast, and accept with compassion and desire the order of our prayers concerning the shofar. 

Avodah

<b>Be pleased,</b> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Yisrael and their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Yisrael; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Yisrael. 
<i>When there are no Kohanim present to recite the Priestly Blessings, the Chazzan recites the following paragraph.</i><br> And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon. <b>Priestly Blessings</b> Even though the kohanim are commanded to bless Yisrael every day (according to some authorities) nevertheless, the custom outside the Holy Land is that kohanim bless the people only during the Musaf Service of the Festivals, and the High Holidays. One reason given is that the Priestly Blessings are pronounced only in a festive atmosphere. Thus on weekdays when people are troubled with the difficulties of earning a livelihood, and even on the Sabbath when people are disturbed by thoughts of their economic plight, the blessings are not pronounced. During the Musaf Service of the Festivals, however, which precedes the festive meal of the holiday, a joyous atmosphere does prevail and the Priestly Blessing is pronounced. After the Chazzan’s recital of ‘רְצֵה, be pleased,’ the following prayer is recited by the Congregation and kohanim, and repeated by the Chazzan: <b>May</b> our prayer be sweet unto You as a burnt-offering and as a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The burnt-offering refers to the עוֹלַת הַתָּמִיד, the daily communal burnt-offering, while sacrifice refers to the מוּסַף, the additional offerings of the Festivals.—Iyun Tefiloh<br>According to Dover Shalom these two types of offerings can be compared to two kinds of prayers. The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt- offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים, peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i> Please, Merciful One, in Your abundant mercy return Your Divine Presence to Tziyon, Your city, and the order of the [Temple] Service to Yerushalayim. And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. 
<small><i>The Chazzan concludes:</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, You alone, in reverence do we serve. 
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<b>We</b> are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<small><i>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esreh and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon,” the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</i><br></small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and Holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. Our Father, our King! remember Your mercies, and suppress Your anger, and remove pestilence, sword, famine, captivity, destruction, iniquity, assimilation, plague, misfortune, every disease, every stumbling-block, every contention, every type of disorder; every evil decree and groundless hatred, from us, and from all the children of Your covenant. Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant. And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise.

May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and the God of our fathers, that this blessing <br><i>When said by the kohanim:</i><br> which You have commanded us <br><i>When said by the Congregation:</i><br> which You have commanded to bless Your people Yisrael, be a perfect blessing; that there be in it neither stumbling nor iniquity from now, forever. 
<small><i>The Chazzan then says:</i><br></small>
kohanim
<small><i>The Congregation responds:</i><br></small>
Your holy people, as it is said.
<small><i>The Kohanim begin:</i><br></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with the holiness of Aharon and commanded us to bless His people, Yisrael, with love.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The kohanim are commanded to bless the people out of their feeling of love for the congregation of Hashem.</i> 
<small><i>The Congregation but not the Chazzan answer:</i><br></small>
Amein
<small>The Chazzan chants each word of the Birchas Kohanim and the kohanim pronounce it after Him. The Congregation should concentrate on their words, but not repeat them.</small>
May [He] bless you Adonoy and guard you. 
<small><i>While the kohanim sing an extended chant before saying וְיִשְׁמְרֶֽךָ, the congregation says the following prayer in an undertone. This prayer is not said on the Sabbath.</i><br></small>
Master of the World! I am Yours and my dreams are Yours. I have dreamed a dream and I do not know its meaning. May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God, and God of my fathers, that all my dreams regarding myself, and regarding all of Yisrael be for the good; those I have dreamed concerning myself, and those I have dreamed about others, and those that others have dreamed about me. If they are good dreams, strengthen and reinforce them and may they be fulfilled in me and in them, like the dreams of Joseph, the righteous. But if they require curing, cure them like Hezekiah, king of Judah, [who was healed] from his sickness; like Miriam, the prophetess from her tsoraas;<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The word צָרַעַת should not be translated as leprosy. The illness of tsoraas described in the Torah has no relationship to the disease of leprosy. It is an illness which Hashem inflicts to show His displeasure with people.

[May You] guard me, [may You] be gracious to me, and [may You] accept me favorably, Amein. 
<small><i>After the kohanim pronounce the word וְיִשְׁמְרֶֽךָ, the Congregation and the Chazzan say: אָמֵן</i><br></small>
May [He] shine Adonoy His countenance upon you and be gracious to you. 
<small><i>While the kohanim sing an extended chant before saying וִיחֻנֶּֽךָּ, the congregation says the following prayer in an undertone:</i><br></small>

<small><i>After the kohanim pronounce the word וִיחֻנֶּֽךָּ, the Congregation and the Chazzan say: אָמֵן</i><br></small>
May [He] turn— Adonoy— His countenance toward you and grant you peace.

<small><i>After the kohanim pronounce the word שָׁלוֹם, the Congregation and the Chazzan say: אָמֵן</i><br></small>
<small><i>After the kohanim conclude the blessing, the Congregation says:</i><br></small>
Mighty One on high, abiding in power,
You are peace and Your Name is Peace.
May it be Your will, to bestow on us
and on all of Your people,
the House of Yisrael,
life and blessing for the preservation of Peace.
<small><i>After the kohanim conclude their blessing, they turn to the Ark and recite:</i><br></small>
Master of the Universe, we have done what You have decreed upon us, now may You also do for us as You have promised: “Gaze from Your Sacred Dwelling, from the heavens, and bless Your people, Yisrael, and the land which You have given us— just as You swore to our fathers— a land flowing with milk and honey.” 
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
<b>Grant peace,</b> goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your eyes to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. 
<b>In the book</b> of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. And it is said: “Through me [the Torah], shall your days be multiplied, and increased for you will be the years of your life.” For a good life, inscribe us, living God; inscribe us in the Book of Life, as it is written: “And You who cling to Adonoy, your God, are all alive today.” 
<small><i>The Ark is opened and the following is said responsively</i><br></small>
This day, may You strengthen us.
Amein.
This day, may You bless us.
Amein.
This day, may You make us prominent.

This day, listen to our supplications.
Amein.
This day, accept with compassion and favor, [all] our prayers. 
Amein.
This day, support us with Your right hand of righteousness. 
Amein.
<i>The Ark is closed:</i><br> As of this day, bring us with happiness and joy unto [Your] Sanctuary at Yerushalayim, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet: “I will bring them to My holy mountain; and make them joyful in My House of Prayer, their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on My Altar; for My House shall be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.” And it is said: “And Adonoy commanded us to carry out these statutes— to fear Adonoy, our God— for our own everlasting good, that He might keep us alive, as at this day.” And it is said: “And righteousness it will for us, if we preserve and do all this commandment in the presence of Adonoy, our God, as He commanded us.” 
And [may] righteousness, blessing, compassion, life and peace, be unto us and all Yisrael, forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>(others conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace.) 
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish:</i><br></small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Yisrael before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein. May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Yisrael, and say, Amein. 
Hope to Adonoy; be strong and He will give you courage and hope to Adonoy. There is none holy like Adonoy for there is none beside You and there is no stronghold like our God. For who is a god other than Adonoy and who is a stronghold beside our God. 
There is none like our God. There is none like our Master. There is none like our King. There is none like our Deliverer. Who is like our God? Who is like our Master? Who is like our King.? Who is like our Deliverer? Let us thank our God. Let us thank our Master. Let us thank our King. Let us thank our Deliverer. Blessed is our God. Blessed is our Master. Blessed is our King. Blessed is our Deliverer. You are our God. You are our Master. You are our King. You are our Deliverer. You are He before Whom our fathers burned the incense offering. 
The composition of the incense consisted of balm, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense— by weight, seventy maneh of each; myrrh, cassia, spikenard and saffron by weight— sixteen maneh of each; twelve maneh of costus, three maneh of aromatic bark, and nine maneh of cinnamon. [Also used in compounding the incense were:] Nine kabin of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three s’in and three kabin— If he had no Cyprus wine, he could use strong white wine— a fourth of a kab of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of maaleh ashan. Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, A minute quantity of Jordan amber [was added]. If one added honey, the incense became unfit; and if one omitted any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: “The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree.” Why was Carshina lye used? To refine the onycha in order to make it pleasant. Why was Cyprus wine used? The Onycha was soaked in it to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful. 
These are the Psalms which the Levites recited in the Holy Temple: On Sunday, they used to recite, “The earth is Adonoy’s and the fullness thereof, the inhabited world and those who dwell in it.” On Monday, they used to recite, “Adonoy is great and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary.” On Tuesday, they used to recite, “God stands in the congregation of the Almighty; in the midst of judges, He gives judgment.” On Wednesday, they used to recite, “Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy, Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself.” On Thursday, they used to recite, “Sing joyously to God, our strength, shout for joy to the God of Yaakov.” On Friday, they used to say, “Adonoy has begun His reign, He has clothed Himself with majesty; Adonoy clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength, He has firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved.” On the Sabbath, they used to recite, “A psalm, a song for the Sabbath day.” It is a psalm, a song for the future, for the day which will be entirely Sabbath and rest for everlasting life. 
It was taught in the school of Elijah; Whoever studies halachos every day, he is assured of life in the World-to-Come, for it is said, “The ways (halichos) of the world are His.” Do not read halichos, but halachos. 
Rabbi Eliezer said on behalf of Rabbi Chanina: “The disciples of the wise increase peace in the world, for it is said: ‘and all your children will be disciples of Adonoy’s [Torah]; and great will be the peace of your children.’ Do not read banayich [your children] but read bonayich [your builders].” Great is the peace of those who love Your Torah, and they will have no stumbling block [misfortune]. Let there be peace within your moats, serenity within your palaces. For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will say: ‘Peace be with you.’ For the sake of the House of Adonoy, our God, I will seek [pray for] your good. Adonoy will give strength to His people, Adonoy will bless His people with peace.” 

Kaddish d'Rabanan

<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future — and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. Upon Yisrael, and upon our Sages, and upon their disciples, and upon all the disciples of their disciples, and upon all those who engage in Torah study in this land and in every land. May there be unto them and unto you abundant peace, favor, kindness, compassion, long life, ample sustenance and redemption from their Father Who is in heaven and on earth, —and say Amein.

He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, in His mercy, make peace for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. 

Aleinu

<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.” 

Song of the Day

<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Yisrael, and say, Amein. 
On Monday: Today is the second day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: A song, a psalm by the sons of Korach. Adonoy is great and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Beautiful in its panoramic vista, the joy of all the earth is Mount Tziyon, on the northern extremities (of Yerushalayim); the city of the great King. God, in its palaces, has become known as a Stronghold. For behold, the kings assembled, they passed by together. They saw and were astounded, they panicked and fled in haste. Trembling siezed them there, like the pangs of a woman in labor. With an east wind You smashed the ships of Tarshish. As we heard, so we saw in the city of Adonoy of Hosts, in the city of our God; may God establish it for eternity, Selah. We hoped, God, for Your lovingkindness in the midst of Your Sanctuary. As Your Name, God, so is Your praise— to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness. Let Mount Tziyon rejoice, let the daughters of Judah exult, because of Your judgments. Rally around Tziyon and encircle her, count her towers. Consider well her ramparts, raise high her citadels, that you may recount it to future generations. That this is God, our God forever and ever, He will lead us like children. 
On Tuesday: Today is the third day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: A psalm of Assaf. God stands in the congregation of the Almighty, in the midst of the judges He gives judgement. How long will you judge lawlessly and show partiality to the wicked, Selah? Render justice to the lowly and the orphan, deal righteously with the poor and destitute. Rescue the lowly and the needy, save them from the hand of the wicked. They neither know nor understand, they walk along in darkness, all the foundations of the earth are shaken. I had said “You are godlike beings, all of you sons of the Most High.” Nevertheless, you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. Arise, God, judge the earth, for You will inherit all the nations. 
On Thursday: Today is the fifth day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: To Him Who grants victory— upon the Gittis, a psalm of Assaf: Sing joyously to God, our strength, shout for joy to the God of Yaakov. Take up the hymn, sound the drum, the pleasant harp and the lute. Blow the shofar on the Rosh Chodesh, at the appointed time for our festive day. For it is a statute for Yisrael, a [day of] judgement of the God of Yaakov. As a testimony for Yehosef, He ordained it when he went out over the land of Mitzrayim, [where] an unfamiliar language I heard. From the burden, I removed his shoulder, his hands were removed from the cauldron. In distress you called out, and I released you, I answered you [though you called] in secret [I answered you] thunderously; I tested you at the waters of Merivah. Selah. Hear, My people, I will testify about you, Yisrael, if you would just listen to Me. Let no strange god be within you, nor bow before a foreign god. I am Adonoy, your God, Who brought you up from the land of Mitzrayim, open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. But My people did not heed My voice, and Yisrael did not want Me. So I sent them to follow their heart’s desires, let them follow their own devices. If only My people would heed Me, if Yisrael would walk in My ways. I would immediately subdue their enemies, and turn My hand against their tormentors. Those who cause hate of Adonoy deceive [pretend obedience to] Him, but their time (of punishment) will be forever. But He would feed him (Yisrael) from the cream of the wheat, and from the rock, I would sate you with honey. 
On Shabbos: Today is the holy Shabbos on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: A psalm, a song for the Shabbos day. It is good to thank Adonoy, and sing praise to Your Name, Most High. To relate Your kindliness in the morning, and Your faithfulness in the nights. Upon a ten-stringed instrument and lute, in meditation upon the harp. For You have given me joy, Adonoy, with Your deeds, at the work of Your hands I sing joyously. How great are Your works, Adonoy; how infinitely profound are Your thoughts. An empty-headed man cannot know, nor does a fool understand this: When the wicked bloom like grass, and all the evildoers blossom— it is so that they may be destroyed forever. But You will remain on high forever Adonoy, For behold, Your enemies, Adonoy; behold, Your enemies shall perish; dispersed shall be all evildoers. You uplifted my horn like that of a unicorn; I am saturated with fresh oil. My eye has seen [the defeat of] those who spy on me; of the wicked who rise against me, my ears have heard [that they are doomed]. The righteous will blossom like a date palm, like a cedar in Lebanon, he will grow tall. Planted in the House of Adonoy, in the Courtyards of our God they will blossom. They will still be fruitful in old age; they will be full of sap and freshness. To declare that Adonoy is upright; He is my Stronghold; in Whom there is no injustice. 
<small>The following Psalm (27) voices our prayer that God will be our light on Rosh Hashana enabling us to repel the darkness of sin through true repentance, and that He will be our salvation on Yom Kippur, through His compassionate atonement of our sins.</small>
By Dovid: Adonoy is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? Adonoy is the strength<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rav S.R. Hirsch’s translates, “Adonoy is the source of my life’s strength,” thus Dovid declares that Hashem is the fount from which his life derives its power to resist all foes.</i> of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?

For He will hide me in His Tabernacle<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Vilna Gaon comments that the commandment of Succos is implied in this verse and the next.</i> on the day of distress, He will conceal me in the shelter of His Tent, upon a rock He will lift me.

Of You, my heart has said, “Seek My Presence”; Your Presence, Adonoy I will seek. Conceal not Your Presence from me, do not turn away Your servant in anger.

Altough my father and mother abandon<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Even if I were so depraved that my own mother and father would abandon me to my own devices, Hashem would still gather me up and believe in my ability to mend my ways.—S.R.

Adonoy, teach me Your way, and lead me in the path of uprightness, because of my watchful foes.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">His enemies. Dovid asks for Divine help that he be saved even from the mere semblance of wrongdoing so that his foes should not be able to rejoice over his faults.—S.R.

Had I not believed<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">“These false witnesses would have destroyed me had I not believed that I would see the goodness of Hashem in the land of the living.”—Rashi, Radak</i> that I would see the goodness of Adonoy in the land of living.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">There are various interpretations of the “Land of the living.” Some hold that it refers to the present world in which we live—Metsudas Tziyon; Ramban holds that it refers to the World-to- Come; and Malbim says that it refers to Eretz Yisroel.</i> Hope to Adonoy, be strong and He will give you courage; and hope to Adonoy. 

Hymn of Glory

<small>This closing hymn is called “Hymn of Glory” because it sings the praises and great glory of God. According to some scholars, the hymn was composed by Rabbi Samuel ben Kolonimus, the father of Rabbu Judah of Regensburg, known as Rabbi Yehudah ha-Chassid, a saint and mystic. Others say that Rabbi Yehudah himself wrote it.</small>

Second Day of Rosh Hashana

Amidah

When I proclaim Adonoy’s Name attribute greatness to our God. My Master, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise. 
<b>THE VIRTUE OF OUR FOREFATHERS</b>
<b>Blessed</b> are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Avraham, God of Yitzchak, and God of Yaakov, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children’s children, for the sake of His Name, with love. 
Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When saying the words, “לְמַעַנְךָ אֶלֹקִים חַיִים,” “for Your sake living God,” you might offer this silent prayer: Master of the Universe, because we believe in the absolute unity of Your Name, that You alone are the living God, and there is nothing besides You, it is fitting and proper that You inscribe us in the Book of Life.—Yesod V’shoresh HaAvodah</i> Living God. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing, you should recite it. If you have already said “Blessed are You, Adonoy,” you must continue the prayers without saying “Remember.”</i><br></small>
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Avraham. 
<b>DIVINE MIGHT</b> 
You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the Powerful One to deliver us. Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? 
King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Divine deliverance of our people will not come about in a sudden, dramatic fashion, but rather as a gradual development, as a plant that sprouts forth in stages.</i> 
Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Chasam Sofer says that זו‍ֹכֵר יְצוּרָיו לְחַיִים בְּרַחֲמִים does not mean that we ask Hashem to remember us for life in His mercy, but rather that He grant us חַיִים שֶׁל רַחֲמִים, a life of mercy, a life in which we will exemplify the quality and virtue of compassion.</i> 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning “Remember us for life.”</i><br></small>
And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.

<b>SANCTIFICATION OF THE DAY</b>
<b>And so,</b> grant that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When saying these sentences, bear in mind these words: “How long has Your great, sacred Name been desecrated among the nations as they taunt us, asking, “Where is Your God? Why doesn’t He come to your aid?” Therefore, let Your awe be upon all Your works, Your dread upon all You have created, so they may all know there is no God but You, and thus will Your Name be exalted and sanctified even among the nations.—Yesod V’Shoresh HaAvodah</i> and Your dread upon all You have created; and [then] all [Your] works will fear You, and prostrate before You will be all [Your] created beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The ultimate sanctification of Hashem’s great and Holy Name over the nation of Yisrael will have a tremendous impact on all peoples and will result in their spiritual uplifting for they will be inspired to fear Hashem, and subject themselves to His rule.—R’ Moshe Chaim Luzzato, (Yalkut Yedeos HaEmes)</i> And may they all form a single band<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Divine inspiration of Hashem, Who is One, the Unity par excellence, can only be experienced by an entity, united, in a single cause. The nation of Yisrael, though composed of individuals, is nevertheless a unit, bound by its singular belief in Hashem and Torah. Thus we are referred to as גוֹי אֶחָד בָּאָרֶץ one nation in the land, and as such, we are capable of receiving and retaining the Divine influence. The nations of the world however are many, and the diversity within each nation is great. In their present status they are incapable of experiencing the Divine inspiration.

<small><b>Introduction to מַלְכֻיּוֹת, זִכְרוֹנוֹת, וְשׁוֹפָרוֹת</b> </small>
<small>The major portion of the Musaf service, is based on the three concepts: מַלְכֻיּוֹת, namely, that God reigns over the world and we accept His rule; זִכְרוֹנוֹת, that He remembers as He reviews our past; and שׁוֹפָרוֹת, that we are called upon to follow Him into a new future of Torah obedience and fulfillment. These thoughts are impressed upon us in the Musaf service by means of detailed references from the Bible. For each of these three concepts we are given ten Biblical quotations, three from the Torah, three from Sacred Writings, (כְּתוּבִים), and three from the Prophets, (נְבִיאִים). The final quotation is again taken from the Torah; for the Torah is the exclusive, basic source of all Jewish truth, and neither the Writings or the Prophets contain any thought that is not contained in some form in the Torah. Thus these series of quotations both begin and end with quotations from the Torah itself. In keeping with the Talmudic principle, מַעֲלִין בַּקוֹדֶשׁ וְלֹא מוֹרִידִין “that one must always proceed upward and forward, and never backward and downward with respect to things holy,” the quotations from the Writings precede those from the Prophets; for while the Writings are only the product of sacred inspiration, רוּחַ הַקוֹדֶשׁ, the words of the Prophets are the actual, direct, Divine revelation. Thus in this sequence, that which is written in the Writings is confirmed by the Prophets and sealed by the Torah.</small>
<small>The prayer of עָלֵינוּ sets the tone of מַלְכֻיּוֹת for it declares our acceptance of God as our Master and Creator. It concludes with the proclamation that all men will eventually accept upon themselves the yoke of His Kingdom.</small>
<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of [the world in] the beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in the heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftier heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth; and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize, and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You every knee must bend, every tongue must swear allegiance to You. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will accept upon themselves the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” 
<b>And it is said:</b> “He beheld no iniquity in Yaakov, nor did He see wrongdoing in Yisrael; Adonoy, His God is with him, and the love of the king is among them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 23:21. These words were uttered by Bilaam when he was asked to curse the nation of Yisrael. He realized that Yisrael was a unique nation in the eyes of Hashem, their King, and thus were invulnerable to his curses.</i> And it is said: “And He was King in Yeshurun, with the gathering of the heads of the people, the tribes of Yisrael were united.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 33:5. Rashi says that Hashem was King of Yisrael only when the tribes of Yisrael were united. When there is unity and harmony among Jews, the kingdom of Hashem is revealed and enhanced.</i> 
And in Your holy words it is written: “For the kingship is Adonoy’s, and He rules over nations.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 22:29. The word king signifies one whose leadership is accepted willingly by his people. In referring to the nation of Yisrael which willingly accepted the kingship of Hashem, the Psalmist says, “For the kingship is Adonoy’s.” A ruler, however, might be one who imposes his rule without consent of the people. Therefore, regarding the other nations who do not willingly submit to His Kingship, a Psalmist says, “And He rules over nations.”—Gaon of Vilna</i> And it is said: “Adonoy has begun His reign, He has clothed Himself in majesty; Adonoy has clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength. He has also firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 93:1.</i> And it is said: “Lift up your heads,—gates, and be uplifted entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is this King of Glory? Adonoy, strong and mighty; Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle. Lift up your heads,—gates, and lift up entranceways to eternity,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The words וּשְׂאוּ פִּתְחֵי עו‍ֹלָם, “and lift up entranceways to eternity,” imply that the gates of the Temple will lift up voluntarily, whereas the earlier words וְהִנָשְׂאוּ פִתְחֵי עו‍ֹלָם, “and be uplifted entranceways to eternity” suggests that the gates must be uplifted against their will. The Siach Yitzchak quoting Malbim explains that initially Hashem was referred to as the King of Glory because He appeared as strong and mighty in battle, forcing the wicked to bend to His will. Therefore, the gates do not open willingly to permit the glory of Hashem to enter, and must be opened by force. Ultimately, however, the world will be so spiritually saturated that it will recognize Hashem’s greatness as the Creator of all. The gates will open by themselves to welcome Hashem, not as One mighty in vengeance but as the masterful Creator of the world.</i> so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is He, this King of Glory? Adonoy Tzevaos, He is the King of Glory, Selah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 24:7-10.</i> 
<b>And</b> by the hand of Your servants, the Prophets it is written: “Thus said Adonoy, King of Yisrael and its Redeemer, Adonoy Tzevaos: ‘I am the first and I am the last;<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshaya 44:6. According to the Kuzari, “first” is used to preclude the notion that anything existed before Him, but not to assert that He has a beginning. Similarly, “last” is used only to repudiate the idea that there is an end to His existence, not to fix a term for Him.</i> and beside Me, there is no God’.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshaya 44:6.</i> And it is said: “And deliverers will go up to Mount Tziyon to judge the mount of Esau, and the kingdom will be Adonoy’s.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Ovadyah 1:21.</i> And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Zecharyah 14:9. In messianic times, Hashem will be recognized as the One and only God by all nations, and they will accept Him willingly, proclaiming His unity.</i> 
<b>And</b> in Your Torah it is written: “Hear, Yisrael: Adonoy is our God Adonoy is One!”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 6:4.</i> 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, reign over the entire world with Your glory, and be uplifted over all the earth with Your honor, and appear in the splendor of Your majestic might over all who dwell in the inhabited world of Your earth; so everything that has been made will know that You have made it, and it will be understood by everything that was formed that You have formed it. And they will say everyone who has breath in his nostrils, “Adonoy, God of Yisrael is King and His Kingship rules over all. Sanctify us with Your commandments and give our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, and purify our hearts to serve You in truth, for You are the true God, and Your word is true and enduring forever. Blessed are You Adonoy, King over all the earth, Sanctifier of Yisrael and the Day of Remembrance.

My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart—before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein.

And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years.

And thus all acknowledge You their Sovereign, <b>to the Almighty</b> Who apportions judgment; Who examines hearts on the day of judgment; Who reveals depths [of the heart] in judgment; Who speaks uprightly on the day of judgment; Who utters knowledge in judgment; to Him Who is steadfast, and yet deals kindly on the day of judgment; Who recalls His covenant in judgment; Who has pity on His works on the day of judgment; Who purifies those who trust in Him, in judgment; Who knows the thoughts of man on the day of judgment; Who suppresses His anger in judgment; Who is clothed in righteousness on the day of judgment; Who forgives iniquities in judgment; Who is awesome in praise on the day of judgment; Who pardons those borne by Him, in judgment; Who answers those who call upon Him on the day of judgment; Who exercises His compassion in judgment; Who scrutinizes secrets on the day of judgment; Who acquires His servants, in judgment; Who has compassion on His people on the day of judgment; Who preserves those who love Him, in judgment; Who supports His perfect ones on the day of judgment. 
And thus unto You may [our] sanctification ascend, for You our God are King! 
<small>There is a famous legend behind this stirring prayer as recorded in the thirteenth century work, Ohr Zerua, by Rabbi Yitzchak of Vienna. In the section dealing with laws of Rosh Hashana (Section 276), he writes, “I found a letter from Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn, in which he wrote that Rabbi Amnon of Mayence authored the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף as a result of a tragic incident in his life.” This is the story as recorded in the letter:</small>
<small>Rabbi Amnon of Mayence, a great scholar, a person of wealth, a handsome man of noble ancestry was under great pressure from the lords and Archbishop of the city to change his faith and adopt their religion. He repeatedly ignored them but on one occasion, in order to put them off, he asked for three days to consider their request. Afterwards he was heartbroken because he had given the impression that he might actually consider renouncing his belief in the One Living God. He refused food or drink; weeping bitterly over his lapse, he refused to accept the sympathy and consolation of friends and relatives.</small>
<small>At the end of the three days he was summoned by the Archbishop, but he ignored the summons. A distinguished delegation was sent to ask him to appear at the court but he refused them. Finally, he was brought before the court by force, and the Archbishop demanded, “Why did you not come and answer me as you promised?” Rabbi Amnon answered, “As a punishment, you should have my tongue cut out, because my tougue deceived you.” Rabbi Amnon thought to sanctify God’s Name in this manner, since his tongue had uttered such a promise. The Archbishop replied, “No, I will not cut out your tongue for it spoke well, instead, I will cut off your feet for they did not bring you to me.” The tyrant ordered that his hands and feet be cut off in piecemeal fashion; asking him at each interval if he was willing to renounce his faith. He was finally released and sent home with his severed and mutilated limbs aside him in bed.</small>
<small>The holiday of Rosh Hashana was at hand, and the Rabbi, dying from the effects of his wounds, was at his own request carried into the synagogue, bringing his severed limbs with him. When the Chazzan was about to recite the Kedushah, Rabbi Amnon asked him to stop, saying, “Pause that I may sanctify His Most Holy Name,” and he said in a loud voice: וּבְכֵן וּלְךָ תַעֲלֶה קְדֻשָּׁה, and thus may this sanctification ascend to You, inferring that with his terrible suffering, he had sanctified God’s Name. He then began reciting the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף, and with the words אֱמֶת כִּי אַתָּה הוּא דַיָּן וּמוֹכִֽיח, true that You are Judge and Admonisher, he indicated his acceptance of God’s Divine judgment, and with the words וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם, and You recorded the decree of their judgments, he manifested his belief that his fate had been decreed on Rosh Hashana. No sooner had he finished the prayer when he expired. Three days later, he appeared to Rabbi Kolonymus ben Meshullam in a dream and taught him this prayer, asking him to introduce it to all congregations as a testimonial and as a memorial for him. This prayer has formed a portion of our Service ever since.</small>
<b>Let us describe</b> the great holiness of this day, for it is awesome and frightening.

Bartenura</i> As a shepherd inspects his flock, making his sheep pass under his rod, so do You cause to pass, count, number, and review the soul of every living being, determining the life-span of every creature; 
and You record the decree of their judgment.
On Rosh Hashana their decree is inscribed, and on Yom Kippur it is sealed,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This formula of judgment is only for those who are considered בֵּינו‍ֹנִים, neither righteous nor wicked. The truly righteous are inscribed and sealed for life on Rosh Hashana, and the wicked also receive their full verdict on Rosh Hashana. Thus it is only the בֵּינו‍ֹנִי, one in between, who is given time until Yom Kippur to mend his ways and be judged for life. Talmud Yerushalmi, Maseches Rosh Hashana 1:3.</i> how many will pass away and how many will be created, who will live and who will die; who will come to his timely end, and who to an untimely end; who will perish by fire and who by water; who by the sword and who by beast; who by hunger and who by thirst; who by earthquake and who by the plague; who by strangling and who by stoning; who will be at rest and who will wander about; who will have serenity and who will be confused; who will be tranquil and who will be tormented; who will become poor and who will become wealthy; who will be brought to a low state and who will be uplifted.

True, You are their Creator, and You know their impulse that they are [but] flesh and blood. Man, his beginning is from dust and ends in dust; risking his life, he gets his bread, he is like a potsherd that is breakable, like grass that withers, like the flower that fades, like the shadow that passes, like the cloud that vanishes, like the wind that blows, like the dust that flies, and like a fleeting dream.

For we know Adonoy, our God that rulership is Yours, strength is in Your hand, might is in Your right hand and Your Name is awesome over all You have created. 
<b>And so,</b> grant honor, Adonoy, to Your people, praise to those who fear You, good hope to those who seek You confident speech to those who yearn for You, joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days. 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice, and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And</b> all shall come to serve You and bless Your glorious Name, and throughout the isles they shall declare Your righteousness. And peoples will seek You, who knew You not before; and they will praise You, those who live in every part of the earth, and they will say, always, “Magnified be Adonoy.” And they will offer to You their sacrifices, and they will abandon their idols, and they will be humiliated with their graven images, and they will turn with unanimous accord to worship You. And they will fear You— as long as sun is upon them— those who seek Your Presence, and they will realize the power of Your Kingship, and they will teach— those who have gone astray— understanding [of God]. And they will speak of Your might, and they will uplift You causing You to be uplifted above all, and they will fervently beseech Your Presence and crown You with a crown of glory. And the mountains will burst out in joyous song, and the isles will exult in Your Kingship, and they will accept the yoke of Your kingdom upon them, and they will exalt You in the assembly of peoples. Those from far-off lands will hear of this and they will come, and they will tender unto You the crown of sovereignty. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 
<b>SANCTIFICATION OF THE DAY</b>
<b>You</b> chose us from [among] all the peoples; You loved us and took pleasure in us; You exalted us above all tongues, and You sanctified us with Your commandments; You drew us near, our King, to Your servitude and Your great and Holy Name, You have pronounced upon us. 
<b>And</b> You gave us Adonoy, our God, in love, this day of Remembrance a day for sounding the shofar a day of holy assembly commemorating the exodus from Mitzrayim. 
<b>But because</b> of our sins, we were exiled from our land, and driven far away from our soil; and we are unable, and to perform our obligatory offerings in Your chosen House, in the great and holy House upon which Your Name is proclaimed, because of the hand [of violence] that was sent against Your Sanctuary. May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, merciful King, to once again have compassion on us and on Your Sanctuary in Your abundant mercy; and rebuild it soon and greatly enhance its glory. Our Father, our King! reveal the glory of Your Kingship upon us soon, appear and be uplifted over us before the eyes of all living things. Bring near our scattered [people] from among the nations, and gather our dispersed from the ends of the earth. Bring us to Tziyon, Your city, with joyous song,— to Yerushalayim, House of Your Sanctuary, with everlasting joy. And there we will offer before You our obligatory sacrifices— the daily [burnt] offerings in their order, and the Musaf offerings according to their rule. And the Musaf offerings of this Day of Remembrance we will prepare and bring before You with love according to the command of Your will; as You wrote for us in Your Torah, through the hands of Moshe, Your servant, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said: 
<b>And</b> in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, a day of holy assembly it shall be for you, all work of labor, you shall not do; a day of blowing [the shofar] it shall be for you. And you will prepare a burnt-offering for a pleasing savor to Adonoy; one young bullock, one ram, seven yearling lambs, without blemish. And their meal-offerings and libations as stated: three tenths [of an epha of fine flour] for the bullock, two tenths for the ram, and one tenth for each lamb, and wine according to each libation; and two he goats for atonement, and the two daily burnt-offerings according to their law. [These are] besides the burnt-offering of Rosh Chodesh and its meal-offering, and the daily burnt-offering and its meal-offering; and their drink offering according to their law. for a pleasing savor, an offering consumed by fire to Adonoy. 

Malkhuyot

<small><i>The Ark is opened:</i><br></small>
<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of [the world in] the beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in the heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftier heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
<small><i>The Ark is closed, and the Chazzan continues</i><br></small>
Our God and God of our fathers, be with the mouths of those who have been sent by Your people the House of Yisrael, who stand to offer fervent prayer and supplication before You, on behalf of Your people, the House of Yisrael. Instruct them what to say, teach them what they shall speak, disclose to them what they shall ask, make known to them mahow they may glorify You. In the light of Your countenance may they walk, [their] knee, unto You may they bend, Your people, with their mouths, may they bless, and from the blessings of Your mouth, may they all be blessed. Your people, they lead into Your Presence, and from their midst, they approach You; the eyes of Your people are fixed on them, and their eyes look longingly to You. They approach the Holy Ark in awe, to appease anger and wrath; and Your people surround them like a wall, and You, from the heavens look upon them with compassion. They lift their eyes to You in heaven, their hearts are poured out before You as water, and You, [please] hear [their prayer] from the heavens. May they not stammer with their tongue, nor become entangled in their speech, may they not be ashamed of those who rely on them, and may they not bring disgrace to their multitude [their congregation]; and may their mouths never say a word that is not according to Your will. For those to whom You are favorably disposed, Adonoy, our God, they have truly found favor, and those upon whom You have compassion, they have truly found compassion. For we know, Adonoy, our God, that You will show favor to whom You will show favor, and that You will be compassionate to whom You will be compassionate. As it is written in Your Torah: And He said: “I will cause to pass over all My goodness before you, and I will proclaim the Name, Adonoy in your presence; “I will show favor to whom I show favor, and I will be compassionate to whom I will be compassionate.” And it is said: “Let them not be ashamed through me those who wait for You, my Master, God of Hosts; let them not be disgraced through me, those who seek You, God of Yisrael.” 
<small><i>The Ark is opened and the Chazzan continues:</i><br></small>
<b>I hope</b> in Almighty, I implore His Presence, I ask of Him to grant me eloquent speech, so that in the congregation of the people, I might sing of His might and utter joyful songs praising His deeds. To man belong the arrangements of thoughts, but [only] from God, comes eloquent speech. My Master, open my lips and my mouth will declare Your praise. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart — before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
<small><i>The Ark is closed:</i><br></small>
<b>We therefore</b> put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth; and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize, and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You every knee must bend, every tongue must swear allegiance to You. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will accept upon themselves the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” 
<b>And it is said:</b> “He beheld no iniquity in Yaakov, nor did He see wrongdoing in Yisrael; Adonoy, His God is with him, and the love of the king is among them.” And it is said: “And He was King in Yeshurun, with the gathering of the heads of the people, the tribes of Yisrael were united.” 
<b>And</b> in Your holy words it is written: “For the kingship is Adonoy’s, and He rules over nations.” And it is said: “Adonoy has begun His reign, He has clothed Himself in majesty; Adonoy has clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength. He has also firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved.” And it is said: “Lift up your heads,—gates, and be uplifted entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is this King of Glory? Adonoy, strong and mighty; Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle. Lift up your heads,—gates, and lift up entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is He, this King of Glory? Adonoy Tzevaos, He is the King of Glory, forever.” 
<b>And</b> by the hand of Your servants, the Prophets it is written: “thus said Adonoy, King of Yisrael and its Redeemer, Adonoy Tzevaos: “I am the first and I am the last; and beside Me, there is no God.” And it is said: “And deliverers will go up to Mount Tziyon to judge the mount of Esau, and the kingdom will be Adonoy’s.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.” 
<b>And</b> in Your Torah it is written: “Hear, Yisrael: Adonoy is our God Adonoy is One!” 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, reign over the entire world with Your glory, and be uplifted over all the earth with Your honor, and appear in the splendor of Your majestic might over all who dwell in the inhabited world of Your earth; so everything that has been made will know that You have made it, and it will be understood by everything that was formed that You have formed it. And they will say everyone who has breath in his nostrils, “Adonoy, God of Yisrael is King and His Kingship rules over all. Sanctify us with Your commandments and give our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, and purify our hearts to serve You in truth, for You are the true God, and Your word is true and enduring forever. Blessed are You Adonoy, King over all the earth, Sanctifier of Yisrael and the Day of Remembrance. 

On this day, the world came into being;<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion in the Talmud, Maseches Rosh Hashana 10b regarding the day in which the world was created. This prayer follows the opinion of Rabbi Elazar who maintains that Hashem created the world in Tishrei.</i> On this day, He makes stand in judgment— all the creatures of the worlds— whether as children, or as servants; if as children, have compassion on us as a father has compassion on his children! If as servants, our eyes are fixed on You until You favor us, and bring forth our judgment as the light, Revered and Holy One! 
May the utterance of our lips be pleasing unto You, Almighty, Most High and Uplifted, Who understands, and gives ear, Who perceives and listens to the sound of our shofar blast, and accept with compassion and desire our acknowledgments of Your sovereignty. 

Zikhronot

<b>You</b> remember the dealings of [men in] today’s world, and You [also] consider the behavior of all those who lived in earlier times. In Your Presence are revealed all hidden things and the multitude of secrets from the beginning of creation; for there is no forgetfulness before the throne of Your Glory, and there is nothing hidden from Your eyes. You remember all that has been done, and even all that which is formed is not concealed from You. All is revealed and known before You Adonoy, our God Who observes and looks until the end of all generations. For You set an appointed time of remembrance, to consider every soul and being; to cause numerous deeds to be remembered and the multitude of creatures without end. From the beginning of creation, You have made this known, and from before time You have revealed it. This day [Rosh Hashana] is the beginning of Your work a memorial of the first day. For it is a statute for Yisrael a [day of] judgment of the God of Yaakov. And over countries [judgment] is pronounced, which of them is destined for the sword [war] and which for peace, which for famine and which for abundance. And on it, creatures are brought to mind, to be remembered for life or for death. Who is not considered on this day? For the remembrance of all that is formed comes before You: the dealings of man, and the decree of his fate, and the misdeeds of man’s actions, the thoughts of man and his schemes, and the motives for the deeds of man. Fortunate is the man who does not forget You, the son of man who gains strength in You. For those who seek You will never stumble, and never will they be disgraced— all who trust in You. For the remembrance of all their deeds come before You, and You examine the deeds of all of them. And No’ach too, You remembered with love, and [therefore] decreed for him a promise of deliverance and compassion, when You brought the flood-waters to destroy all flesh because of the wickedness of their deeds. Therefore, his remembrance came before You, Adonoy, our God, to multiply his seed like the dust of the earth, and his descendants as the sand of the sea; as it is written in Your Torah; “And God remembered No’ach and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the Ark, and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were calmed.” And it is said: “And God heard their groaning cry, and God remembered His covenant with Avraham, with Yitzchak, and with Yaakov.” And it is said: “I will remember My covenant with Yaakov, and also My covenant with Yitzchak, and also My covenant with Avraham, will I remember; and the land [of Yisrael] I will remember.” 
<b>And</b> in Your holy words it is written: “He made a memorial for His wonders, gracious and merciful is Adonoy.” And it is said: “He gave food to those who fear Him; He is ever mindful of His covenant.” And it is said: “And He remembered His covenant for them, and He relented in accordance with His abundant kindness.” 
<b>And</b> by the hand of Your servants, the Prophets it is written: “Go and proclaim it in the ears of Yerushalayim, saying: thus said Adonoy, I remembered for you the kindness of your youth, the love of your bridal days, how you followed Me into the wilderness, in a land that was not cultivated.” And it is said: “I will remember My covenant [which I made] with you in the days of your youth, and I will fulfill it for you as an everlasting covenant.” And it is said: “Is Ephraim not My precious son, is he not a child of delight? For whenever I speak of him, I recall him even more; Therefore, My innermost being is aroused for him, I will surely have compassion on him, says Adonoy.” 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers remember us favorably before You and be mindful of us for deliverance and compassion from the eternal high heavens. Remember in our behalf, Adonoy, our God, the covenant, the kindness and the oath which You swore to our father Avraham on Mount Moriah, and let there appear before You the binding with which our father Avraham bound his son Yitzchak upon the altar, and how he suppressed his compassion to do Your will with a whole heart; so may Your compassion suppress Your anger against us, and in Your great goodness turn Your fierce anger away from Your people, and from Your city, from Your land, and from Your territorial heritage. And fulfill for us Adonoy, our God the promise You made in Your Torah, through Your servant, Moshe, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said: “I will remember for them the covenant with their forefathers whom I took out of the land of Mitzrayim, before the eyes of the nations, to be their God; I am Adonoy.” For He Who remembers all forgotten things from eternity, are You, and there is no forgetfulness before the Throne of Your Glory; and the binding of Yitzchak— on behalf of his descendants— may You remember it today with compassion. Blessed are You Adonoy, Who remembers the covenant. 

On this day, the world came into being; On this day, He makes stand in judgment— all the creatures of the worlds— whether as children, or as servants; if as children, have compassion on us as a father has compassion on his children! If as servants, our eyes are fixed on You until You favor us, and bring forth our judgment as the light, Revered and Holy One! 
May the utterance of our lips be pleasing unto You, Almighty, Most High and Uplifted, Who understands, and gives ear, Who perceives and listens to the sound of our shofar blast, and accept with compassion and desire our prayers of remembrance. 

Shofarot

<b>You were revealed</b> in Your cloud of glory to Your holy people to speak to them. From the heavens, You let them hear Your voice, and revealed Yourself to them in pure clouds. So too, the entire world quivered before You, and the works of creation trembled before You, when You, our King revealed Yourself upon Mount Sinai to teach Your people Torah and mitzvos. You let them hear the majestic splendor of Your voice, and Your holy words from flames of fire; amidst thunder and lightning You revealed Yourself to them, and with the sound of a shofar, You appeared to them, as it is written in Your Torah: “And it was on the third day, as morning dawned there was thunder and lightning, and a dense cloud over the mountain, and the sound of a shofar was exceedingly loud; and all the people in the camp trembled.” And it is said: “And the sound of the shofar became increasingly louder; Moshe spoke and God answered him by voice.” And it is said: “And all the people saw the sounds and the flames, and the sound of the shofar, and the mountain in smoke; and the people saw and were shaken, and stood from afar.” 
<b>And</b> in Your holy words it is written: “God has ascended with a blast, Adonoy, with the sound of a shofar.” And it is said: “With trumpets and the sound of a shofar raise your voices before the King, Adonoy.” And it is said: “Blow a shofar on the New Moon, as the appointed time for our festive-day. For it is a statute for Yisrael, a day of judgment of the God of Yaakov.” And it is said: “Praise God. Praise the Almighty in His Sanctuary Praise God in the firmament of His might. Praise Him for His mighty deeds, Praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness. Praise Him with the blowing of a shofar, Praise Him with lyre and harp. Praise Him with drum and dance, Praise Him with stringed instruments and flute. Praise Him with resounding cymbals, Praise Him with clanging cymbals. Let every soul praise God, Praise God.” 
<b>And</b> by the hand of Your servants, the Prophets it is written: “All who inhabit the world of man and who dwell on earth— when the banner is raised on the mountains you will see it; and when a shofar will be sounded, you will hear it.” And it is said: “And it will be on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, and they will come— those who were lost in the land of Ashur, and those who were outcasts in the land of Mitzrayim, and they will prostrate themselves to Adonoy, on the holy mountain in Yerushalayim.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will appear over them, and His arrow will go forth like lightning; and my Master, Adonoy, will sound the shofar and go forth in the whirlwinds of the south. Adonoy Tzevaos will protect them.” So may You be a shield over Your people, Yisrael, with Your peace. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, sound a great shofar for our liberty and raise a banner to gather our exiles. And bring near our scattered people from among the nations, and gather our dispersed from the ends of [the] earth. Bring us to Tziyon, Your city, with joyous song,— to Yerushalayim, House of Your Sanctuary, with eternal joy. And there we will offer before You our obligatory sacrifices, as we were commanded in Your Torah, through the hands of Moshe, Your servant, from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said: “And on the day of your rejoicing, and on your appointed festivals, and on your Rosh Chodesh days, you will sound the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God; I am Adonoy, your God.” For You hear the sound of shofar, and listen to the teruah; and there is none like You. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who hears the sound of the teruah of His people, Yisrael, with compassion. 

On this day, the world came into being; On this day, He makes stand in judgment— all the creatures of the worlds— whether as children, or as servants; if as children, have compassion on us as a father has compassion on his children! If as servants, our eyes are fixed on You until You favor us, and bring forth our judgment as the light, Revered and Holy One! 
May the utterance of our lips be pleasing unto You, Almighty, Most High and Uplifted, Who understands, and gives ear, Who perceives and listens to the sound of our shofar blast, and accept with compassion and desire the order of our prayers concerning the shofar. 

Avodah

<b>Be pleased,</b> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Yisrael and their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Yisrael; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Yisrael. 
<i>When there are no Kohanim present to recite the Priestly Blessings, the Chazzan recites the following paragraph.</i><br> And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon. 
<small><b>Priestly Blessings</b></small>
<small>Even though the kohanim are commanded to bless Yisrael every day (according to some authorities) nevertheless, the custom outside the Holy Land is that kohanim bless the people only during the Musaf Service of the Festivals, and the High Holidays. One reason given is that the Priestly Blessings are pronounced only in a festive atmosphere. Thus on weekdays when people are troubled with the difficulties of earning a livelihood, and even on the Sabbath when people are disturbed by thoughts of their economic plight, the blessings are not pronounced.</small>
<small>During the Musaf Service of the Festivals, however, which precedes the festive meal of the holiday, a joyous atmosphere does prevail and the Priestly Blessing is pronounced.</small>
<small>After the Chazzan’s recital of ‘רְצֵה, be pleased,’ the following prayer is recited by the Congregation and kohanim, and repeated by the Chazzan:</small>
<b>May</b> our prayer be sweet unto You as a burnt-offering and as a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The burnt-offering refers to the עוֹלַת הַתָּמִיד, the daily communal burnt-offering, while sacrifice refers to the מוּסַף, the additional offerings of the Festivals.—Iyun Tefiloh<br>According to Dover Shalom these two types of offerings can be compared to two kinds of prayers. The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt- offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים, peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i> Please, Merciful One, in Your abundant mercy return Your Divine Presence to Tziyon, Your city, and the order of the [Temple] Service to Yerushalayim. And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. <br><i>The Chazzan concludes:</i><br> Blessed are You, Adonoy, You alone, in reverence do we serve. 
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<b>We</b> are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<small><i>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esreh and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon,” the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</i><br></small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and Holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted be your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. Our Father, our King! remember Your mercies, and suppress Your anger, and remove pestilence, sword, famine, captivity, destruction, iniquity, assimilation, plague, misfortune, every disease, every stumbling-block, every contention, every type of disorder; every evil decree and groundless hatred, from us, and from all the children of Your covenant. Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant. And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise.

<b>Grant peace,</b> goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. 
<b>In the book</b> of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. And it is said: “Through me [the Torah], shall your days be multiplied, and increased for you will be the years of your life.” For a good life, inscribe us, living God; inscribe us in the Book of Life, as it is written: “And You who cling to Adonoy, your God, are all alive today.” 
<small><i>The Ark is opened and the following is said responsively</i><br></small>
This day, may You strengthen us.Amein.

<small><i>The Ark is closed.</i><br></small>
As of this day, bring us with happiness and joy unto [Your] Sanctuary at Yerushalayim, as it is written by the hand of Your prophet: “I will bring them to My holy mountain; and make them joyful in My House of Prayer, their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on My Altar; for My House shall be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.” And it is said: “And Adonoy commanded us to carry out these statutes— to fear Adonoy, our God— for our own everlasting good, that He might keep us alive, as at this day.” And it is said: “And righteousness it will for us, if we preserve and do all this commandment in the presence of Adonoy, our God, as He commanded us.” And [may] righteousness, blessing, compassion, life and peace, be unto us and all Yisrael, forever. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>(others conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace.) 
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish:</i><br></small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world—and say Amein. May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Yisrael before their Father in heaven. And say, Amein. May there be abundant peace from heaven and life for us and for all Yisrael, —and say Amein. He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He, make peace for us and or all Yisrael, and say, Amein. 
Hope to Adonoy; be strong and He will give you courage and hope to Adonoy. There is none holy like Adonoy for there is none beside You and there is no stronghold like our God. For who is a god other than Adonoy and who is a stronghold beside our God. 
There is none like our God. There is none like our Master. There is none like our King. There is none like our Deliverer. Who is like our God? Who is like our Master? Who is like our King.? Who is like our Deliverer? Let us thank our God. Let us thank our Master. Let us thank our King. Let us thank our Deliverer. Blessed is our God. Blessed is our Master. Blessed is our King. Blessed is our Deliverer. You are our God. You are our Master. You are our King. You are our Deliverer. You are He before Whom our fathers burned the incense offering. 
The composition of the incense consisted of balm, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense— by weight, seventy maneh of each; myrrh, cassia, spikenard and saffron by weight— sixteen maneh of each; twelve maneh of costus, three maneh of aromatic bark, and nine maneh of cinnamon. [Also used in compounding the incense were:] Nine kabin of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three s’in and three kabin— If he had no Cyprus wine, he could use strong white wine— a fourth of a kab of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of maaleh ashan. Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, A minute quantity of Jordan amber [was added]. If one added honey, the incense became unfit; and if one omitted any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: “The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree.” Why was Carshina lye used? To refine the onycha in order to make it pleasant. Why was Cyprus wine used? The Onycha was soaked in it to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful. 
These are the Psalms which the Levites recited in the Holy Temple: On Sunday, they used to recite, “The earth is Adonoy’s and the fullness thereof, the inhabited world and those who dwell in it.” On Monday, they used to recite, “Adonoy is great and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary.” On Tuesday, they used to recite, “God stands in the congregation of the Almighty; in the midst of judges, He gives judgment.” On Wednesday, they used to recite, “Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy, Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself.” On Thursday, they used to recite, “Sing joyously to God, our strength, shout for joy to the God of Yaakov.” On Friday, they used to say, “Adonoy has begun His reign, He has clothed Himself with majesty; Adonoy clothed Himself, He has girded Himself with strength, He has firmly established the world so that it cannot be moved.” On the Sabbath, they used to recite, “A psalm, a song for the Sabbath day.” It is a psalm, a song for the future, for the day which will be entirely Sabbath and rest for everlasting life. 
It was taught in the school of Elijah; Whoever studies halachos every day, he is assured of life in the World-to-Come, for it is said, “The ways (halichos) of the world are His.” Do not read halichos, but halachos. 
Rabbi Eliezer said on behalf of Rabbi Chanina: “The disciples of the wise increase peace in the world, for it is said: ‘and all your children will be disciples of Adonoy’s [Torah]; and great will be the peace of your children.’ Do not read banayich [your children] but read bonayich [your builders].” Great is the peace of those who love Your Torah, and they will have no stumbling block [misfortune]. Let there be peace within your moats, serenity within your palaces. For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will say: ‘Peace be with you.’ For the sake of the House of Adonoy, our God, I will seek [pray for] your good. Adonoy will give strength to His people, Adonoy will bless His people with peace.”

<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”

On Tuesday: Today is the third day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: A psalm of Assaf God stands in the congregation of the Almighty,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Assaf was one of the ten composers who contributed to the Book of Tehillim; he wrote eleven psalms (73-83). The leading Levite musician of his times, he was also endowed with the spirit of prophecy.<br>The Talmud designates psalm 82 for the third day of the week because on the third day of creation, Hashem in His wisdom revealed the earth and established the world for His chosen “congregation.” This is an allusion to Bereishis 1:9 where we read, “Hashem said, ‘Let the waters beneath the heavens be gathered (congregate) into one place, so that the dry land may appear.”—Maseches Rosh Hashana 31a</i> in the midst of the judges He gives judgement. How long will you judge lawlessly and show partiality to the wicked, Selah? Render justice to the lowly and the orphan, deal righteously with the poor and destitute. Rescue the lowly and the needy, save them from the hand of the wicked. They neither know nor understand,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">“They” refers to the judges.</i> they walk along in darkness, all the foundations of the earth are shaken.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Justice is one of the three pillars upon which the earth rests ( Maseches Avos 1:18).

They express, they speak with arrogance; all the evildoers are boastful. Adonoy, they crush Your people and Your heritage they oppress. The widow and stranger they kill, and orphans they murder. And they say, “God does not see, the God of Yaakov is not concerned.” Consider, [you] stupid [ones] among the people,— and you fools when will you become wise? He Who implanted the ear, does He not hear? He Who formed the eye, does He not see? He Who chastises nations, does He not reprove— He that teaches man knowledge? Adonoy knows the thoughts of men, that they are vanity. Fortunate is the man whom You chastise, God, and whom You instruct from Your Torah. To grant him tranquility from days of evil, until the pit is dug for the wicked. for Adonoy will not abandon His people and His inheritance, He will not forsake. For justice shall return unto righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it. Who will rise up for me against the wicked, who will stand up for me against the evildoers? Had Adonoy not been my help, in an instant my soul would have dwelt in the silent grave If [Whenever] I said, my foot has slipped, Your kindliness, Adonoy upheld me. When (worrisome) thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations soothe my soul. Can a tribunal of evil have accord with You— [a tribunal] that makes iniquity into law? They gang up against the life of the righteous, and blood of the innocent they condemn. Adonoy has been my stronghold, my God the Rock of my refuge.

On Friday: Today is the sixth day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple: Adonoy has begun His reign<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">On the sixth day, the Levites sang psalm 93, “Adonoy is King, He has clothed Himself in majesty,” because He completed the work of creating and reigned over all His creatures.—Maseches Rosh Hashana 31a</i> with majesty He has clothed Himself; Adonoy clothed Himself, with strength He has girded Himself; He has firmly established the world, so that it cannot be moved.

Hymn of Glory

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. <br><i>Psalms 144:15</i><br> Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by Dovid! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works, and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak, and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your Kingship, they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His Kingship. Your Kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him, He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare and all flesh will bless His Holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now forever. Praise God.

<small><i>When Rosh Hashana occurs on Shabbos, say:</i><br></small>
But as for me, may my prayer to You, Adonoy, be at a favorable time; God, in the abundance of Your kindness, answer me with the truth of Your deliverance. 
<small><i>When the Holy Ark is opened, the following is said:</i><br></small>
And whenever the Ark traveled Moshe would say: “Rise, Adonoy and let Your enemies be scattered, and those who hate You, flee before You.” For from Tziyon will go forth the Torah, and the word of Adonoy from Yerushalayim. Blessed is He Who gave the Torah to His people Yisrael in His holiness. 

Berich Shemei

<small>The following prayer is taken from the Zohar (Parshas Vayakhail), the basic text of Kabbalah which was written by the Mishnahic sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The Zohar states, “When the Torah is taken out to be read before the congregation, the heavenly gates of mercy are opened, and the Divine love is aroused; therefore one should say the following prayer.</small>
<b>Blessed</b> is the Name of the Master of the Universe. Blessed is Your crown and Your place. May Your good will [be] with Your people Yisrael forever. The redemption of Your right hand, show Your people in Your Holy Temple. Bestow on us Your excellent light, and accept our prayer with compassion. May it be Your will to prolong our lives in well-being. Let me be counted among the righteous, so that You will have compassion on me and protect me and all that is mine, and all that belongs to Your people, Yisrael. You are He Who nourishes all and maintains all; You are He Who rules over all; You are He Who rules over kings, and the kingdom is Yours. I am a servant of the Holy One, blessed is He, I bow before Him and before the honor of His Torah at all times. Not in man do I put my trust, nor do I rely on any angel; but only in the God of heaven Who is the true God, Whose Torah is truth, Whose prophets are true, and Who performs many deeds of goodness and truth. In Him I put my trust and to His holy, honored Name I utter praises. May it be Your will to open my heart to Torah, and to fulfill the desires of my heart and of the heart of Your people Yisrael for goodness, for life, and for peace. 
<i>The Chazzan says:</i><br> Declare the greatness of Adonoy with me, and let us exalt His Name together. 
<i>The Congregation responds:</i><br> Yours, Adonoy, is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory, and the beauty, for everything in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours, Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He. Exalt Adonoy, Our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain for Adonoy, our God, is holy. 
May the Father of mercy have compassion on the people borne by Him, and may He remember the covenant with the patriarchs; may He rescue our souls from evil times; and may He rebuke the Evil Impulse from those who have been carried by Him; and may He graciously grant us eternal survival; and fulfill our requests in beneficent measure, [for] deliverance and compassion. 
<i>When the Torah is unrolled, the Reader says:</i><br> May His sovereignty be revealed and visible to us, soon; and may He be gracious to our remnant and the remnant of His people, the House of Yisrael; [granting them] favor, kindness, compassion and goodwill, and let us say Amein. Let us all ascribe greatness to our God and give honor to the Torah. Let the Kohein come forward. Arise, son of , the Kohein, Blessed is He Who gave the Torah to His people, Yisrael, in His holiness. 
<i>The Congregation responds:</i><br> And you who cling to Adonoy, Your God, are all alive today. 
<small><i>(The following blessings are recited by every person called to the Torah.)</i><br></small>
<i>The Kohein walks up to the Torah, and says:</i><br> Blessed Adonoy, Who is blessed. 
<i>The Congregation responds and the Kohein repeats:</i><br> Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed, forever and ever. 
<i>The Kohein says:</i><br> Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who chose us from among all the peoples and gave us His Torah. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Giver of the Torah. 
<i>After the Torah is read, the Kohein says:</i><br> Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe Who gave us the Torah of truth, and implanted eternal life within us. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Giver of the Torah. 
<small><i>The above blessings are recited by every person called to the Torah.</i><br></small>

<small><i>When the reading of the Torah is concluded, the Torah is raised so that the congregation can see the script, and the congregation exclaims:</i><br></small>
<b>This</b> is the Torah which Moshe placed before the children of Yisrael. at Adonoy’s command by the hand of Moshe. It is a tree of life to those who grasp to it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Long life is at its right, at its left, riches and honor. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it. 
<i>The Chazzan takes the Torah and says:</i><br> <b>They</b> will praise the Name of Adonoy for His Name alone is exalted. 
<i>The congregation then says:</i><br> His majesty is over the earth and the skies. He will raise the might of His people, [which is] praise for all His pious ones, for the Children of Yisrael, the people near to Him. Praise God. 
A Psalm of Dovid: the earth is Adonoy’s and the fullness thereof, the inhabited world and those who dwell in it. For He founded it upon the seas, and established it upon rivers. Who may ascend the mountain of Adonoy, and who may stand in the place of His holiness? The clean of hands and the pure of heart, who has not borne My soul in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully. He will bear Adonoy’s blessing and righteousness from the God of his deliverance. This is the generation of those who seek Him, the seekers of Your Presence, [God of] Yaakov, selah. Lift up your heads, gates, and be uplifted [you] entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is this King of Glory? Adonoy, strong and mighty; Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle. Lift up your heads, gates, and lift up, entranceways to eternity, so that the King of Glory may enter. Who is He, this King of Glory? Adonoy Tzevaos, He is the King of Glory, selah. 
<i>As the Torah is returned to the Ark the following is said:</i><br> And when it rested, he would say: Return, Adonoy, to the myriads and thousands of Yisrael. Arise, Adonoy unto Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your strength. Let Your priests clothe themselves in righteousness, and let Your devoted ones sing in joy. For the sake of Dovid, Your servant, do not reject Your anointed. For I have given you good instruction, do not forsake My Torah. It is a tree of life to those who grasp it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace. Cause us to return to You, Adonoy, and we shall return; renew our days as of old. 
<small><i>The Chazzan recites the Half-Kaddish:</i><br></small>
<b>Exalted</b> and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His Kingdom in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Yisrael, speedily and in the near future— and say Amein. May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He; far above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world— and say Amein. 

Amidah

When I proclaim Adonoy’s Name attribute greatness to our God. 
My Master, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Avraham, God of Yitzchak, and God of Yaakov, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children’s children, for the sake of His Name, with love. 
Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing, you should recite it. If you have already said “Blessed are You, Adonoy,” you must continue the prayers without saying “Remember.”</i><br></small>
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Avraham. 
<b>DIVINE MIGHT</b> 
You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the Powerful One to deliver us. Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth. 
Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy. 
<small><i>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning “Remember us for life.”</i><br></small>
And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead. 
<small><i>When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esreh, the Kedushah is said here</i><br></small>

Kedushah

<i>The Congregation says and the Chazzan repeats:</i><br> We will sanctify Your Name in the world, just as they sanctify it in the highest heavens; as is written by the hand of Your prophet, “And they called one to another, and said: 
<i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</i><br> ‘Holy, holy, holy, is Adonoy of Hosts, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.’” 
<i>The Chazzan says:</i><br> Those facing them say “Boruch...” 
<i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</i><br> “Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from its place.” 
<i>The Chazzan says:</i><br> And in Your holy words it is written: 
<i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</i><br> “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations! Praise God.” 
<small><i>The Chazzan concludes:</i><br></small>
From generation to generation we will declare Your greatness, and to all eternity, we will sanctify Your holiness, and Your praise, our God, will not depart from our mouth forever and ever; because You are the Almighty Who is King; Great, and Holy. 
<small><i>During the silent Shemoneh Esreh, continue here:</i><br></small>
You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. 
<b>And so,</b> grant that Your awe, Adonoy, our God, be upon all Your works, and Your dread upon all You have created; and [then] all [Your] works will fear You, and prostrate before You will be all [Your] created beings. And may they all form a single band to do Your will with a perfect heart. For we know Adonoy, our God that rulership is Yours, strength is in Your hand, might is in Your right hand and Your Name is awesome over all You have created. 
<b>And so,</b> grant honor, Adonoy, to Your people, praise to those who fear You, good hope to those who seek You confident speech to those who yearn for You, joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, flourishing of pride to Dovid, Your servant and an array of light to the son of Yishai, Your anointed, speedily in our days. 
<b>And then</b> the righteous will see [this] and rejoice, and the upright will be jubilant, and the pious will exult with joyous song; injustice will close its mouth, and all the wickedness will vanish like smoke, when You remove the rule of evil from the earth. 
<b>And You</b> Adonoy will reign alone over all Your works on Mount Tziyon, dwelling place of Your glory, and in Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary, as it is written in Your holy words, “Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Tziyon, throughout all generations. Praise God.” 
<b>Holy</b> are You, and awesome is Your Name, and there is no God beside You, as it is written, “And Adonoy Tzevaos is exalted through justice and the Almighty, the Holy One, is sanctified through righteousness.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One. 
<b>You</b> chose us from [among] all the peoples; You loved us and took pleasure in us; You exalted us above all tongues, and You sanctified us with Your commandments; You drew us near, our King, to Your servitude and Your great and Holy Name, You have pronounced upon us. 
<b>And</b> You gave us Adonoy, our God, in love, <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (this Shabbos Day and) this day of Remembrance a day for <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (the remembrance of) sounding the shofar <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (with love) a day of holy assembly commemorating the exodus from Mitzrayim. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of Dovid, Your servant; the remembrance of Yerushalayim, city of Your Sanctuary and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Yisrael, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for life and peace on this day of Remembrance. Remember us Adonoy, our God on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty, Who is King, Gracious and Merciful. 
<b>Our God</b> and God of our fathers, reign over the entire world with Your glory, and be uplifted over all the earth with Your honor, and appear in the splendor of Your majestic might over all who dwell in the inhabited world of Your earth; so everything that has been made will know that You have made it, and it will be understood by everything that was formed that You formed it, And they will say, everyone who has breath in his nostrils, “Adonoy, God of Yisrael is King and His Kingship rules over all.” 
<i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (Our God and God of our fathers, be pleased with our rest) Sanctify us with Your commandments and give us our share in Your Torah; satisfy us from Your goodness and gladden us with Your deliverance, <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (And give us as our inheritance Adonoy our God with love and with pleasure Your holy Sabbath; and may Yisrael rest thereon— [they who are] sanctifiers of Your Name) and purify our hearts to serve You in truth, for You are the true God, and Your word is true and enduring forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, King over all the earth, Sanctifier <br><i>On Shabbos add:</i><br> (of the Sabbath and) of Yisrael and the Day of Remembrance. 
<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
<b>Be pleased,</b> Adonoy, our God, with Your people Yisrael and their prayer; and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings of Yisrael; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Yisrael. And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Tziyon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon. 
<small><i>At the words, We are thankful, bend forward; at Adonoy return to an upright position.</i><br></small>
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<b>We</b> are thankful to You that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon. (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You. 
<small><i>When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esreh and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Tziyon,” the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.</i><br></small>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and Holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due. 
<b>And</b> for all the foregoing blessed and exalted your Name, our King constantly, forever and ever. Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant. <br><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</i><br> And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, “The Beneficent” is Your Name and You it is fitting to praise. 
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
<b>Grant peace,</b> goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Yisrael, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life, and peace. And may it be good in Your eyes and to bless Your people Yisrael, at all times and at every moment with Your peace. In the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance, may we be remembered and inscribed before You; we and all Your people, the House of Yisrael for a good life and peace. <br><i>If you forgot to say this, you need not go back and repeat the Amidah.</i><br> Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who makes the peace. <br><i>(others conclude—</i><br> Who blesses His people Yisrael with peace.) 
May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart—before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceitfully. To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments. And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand. Act for the sake of Your holiness. Act for the sake of Your Torah. In order that Your loved ones be released, deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me. May the words of my mouth be acceptable and the thoughts of my heart—before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer. 
He Who makes the peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Yisrael and say Amein. 
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Yerushalayim as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Aleinu

<b>It is</b> our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: “And You shall know this day and take into your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.” 
We therefore put our hope in You, Adonoy our God, to soon behold the glory of Your might in banishing idolatry from the earth, and the false gods will be utterly exterminated to perfect the world as the kingdom of Shadai. And all mankind will invoke Your Name, to turn back to You, all the wicked of the earth. They will realize and know, all the inhabitants of the world, that to You, every knee must bend, every tongue must swear [allegiance to You]. Before You, Adonoy, our God, they will bow and prostrate themselves, and to the glory of Your Name give honor. And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and to all eternity You will reign in glory, as it is written in Your Torah: “Adonoy will reign forever and ever.” And it is said: “And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.”

Tashlich

<small>On the first day of Rosh Hashana [or on the second day if the first day is Shabbos], after the Mincha Services, before sunset, it is customary to go to a body of water [the ocean, river, lake, etc.] but preferably one which contains fish, and recite the following prayers. The opening verses are taken from Micah 7:18-20 and they correspond to the thirteen Divine Attributes mentioned in Shemos 34:6,7. The closing verses are from Psalms 118:5-9 which correspond to the nine attributes mentioned in Bamidbar 14:18.</small>
<small>According to Maharam Yaffe the custom of the Tashlich ritual is based on the Midrash. “As Avraham was about to sacrifice Yitzchak, the Satan disguised himself as a raging river. Upon approaching the river, Avraham went in wading up to his waist. Thinking he would be able to ford the river, he summoned Yitzchak and they had taken but a few steps when the water surged up to their necks. Avraham cried out, “Deliver us Adonoy, for the water is drowning us,” and they were saved. Others say that water is the symbol of kindness, and fish symbolize an ever-open eye. Thus we ask God to bestow His benevolent kindness on us and protect us with His watchful eye.</small>
Who is an Almighty like You Forbearer of iniquity, and forgiver of transgression for the remnant of His heritage? He does not maintain His wrath forever, for He desires to do kindness. He will again show us compassion, He will suppress our iniquities; and You will cast into the depths of the sea all their sins. You will grant truth to Yaakov, kindness to Avraham, as You swore to our fathers from the days of old. From the narrowness [of distress] I called [to] God; He answered me with the breadth of Divine relief. Adonoy is with me, I will not fear, what can man do to me? Adonoy is with me, to help me, and I will see my enemies’ [defeat]. It is better to take refuge in Adonoy than to trust in man. It is better to take refuge in Adonoy than to trust in nobles. 
Joyfully exult in Adonoy, [you] righteous ones, for the upright, praise is fitting. Thank Adonoy with the harp, with the ten-stringed lyre sing to Him. Sing Him a new song, play skillfully with jubilation. For upright is the word of Adonoy, and all His deeds [are done] with faithfulness. He loves righteousness and justice, the kindliness of Adonoy fills the earth. By the word of God, the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth, all their hosts. He gathers like a mound the waters of the sea, He places in vaults the deep waters. Fear Adonoy, all the earth, of Him, be frightened all dwellers of the inhabited world. For He spoke and it became; He commanded and it stood. Adonoy annuls the counsel of nations, He disrupts the intention of peoples. The counsel of Adonoy will stand forever, the thoughts of His heart throughout all generations. Fortunate is the nation for whom Adonoy is their God, the people He chose as His heritage. From the heavens, Adonoy looks [down], He sees all mankind. From His dwelling place, He watches intently all the inhabitants of the earth. He forms their hearts all together; He perceives all their doings. A king is not saved by a great army; a mighty man is not rescued with [his] great strength. A horse is deceptive [assurance] for deliverance, and with its great strength it provides no escape. Behold, the eye of Adonoy is on those who fear Him, on those who wait for His kindliness. To rescue their soul from death, and to keep them alive during famine. Our soul yearned for Adonoy, our help and our shield is He. For in Him our heart will rejoice, for in His Holy Name we trust. May your kindliness, Adonoy, be upon us, as we have waited for You. 
May it be Your will Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, most High Almighty Who is crowned with thirteen attributes of mercy, that this be a time of favor before You, and may it ascend before You our recitation of the Thirteen Attributes of mercy, [which are contained in the verses: “Who is an Almighty like You” which correspond to the Thirteen Attributes, “Almighty, Merciful, Gracious etc.,” that we have recited before You. Consider it as if we had comprehended all the esoteric meanings and the combinations of the Holy Names that are formed from them. And the joining of their attributes, which, one by one, shall approach [You] to sweeten the severe judgments. And so, cast into the depths of the sea all our sins. And You, with Your goodness, arouse Your mercy, that we may be cleansed from all forms of impurity. And may there ascend [before You] all the sparks of holiness which have been scattered. And may we be refined and purified through Your goodness. You Almighty, are our deliverance, the Keeper of kindness for thousands [of generations.] And with Your abundant compassion grant us long life, a life of peace, a life of goodness, a life of blessing, a life of good sustenance, a life of bodily vigor, a life in which there is fear of Heaven and fear of sin, a life in which there is no shame or disgrace, a life of prosperity and honor, in order that we may serve You, a life in which there will be within us love of Torah and fear of Heaven, a life [in which] You will fulfill the wishes of our hearts for goodness. And remember us for life O King, Who desires life, and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God. And tear up the evil [parts] of our sentence, and may our merits be stated before You.
