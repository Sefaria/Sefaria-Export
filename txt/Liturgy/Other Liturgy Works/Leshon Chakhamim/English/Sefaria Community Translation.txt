Lord, please save us on this day; for the trees is it the new year. 
Lord, please grant us success on this day; for the trees is it the new year.
Lord, please grant us relief on this day; for the trees is it the new year.
Lord, please grant us goodness on this day; for the trees is it the new year.
Lord, please bless us on this day; for the trees is it the new year.
Please, God spare this year from briers and thistles, and bless the oil tree and the olive. 
Please, God quench the dry wastelands with rain, and bless the cotton, the fig and the pomegranate.
Please, God exalt the counsel of the new born babes, and bless the nut, the date and the apples.
Please, God do not stop Your charity from Your people, and bless the carob, the wild pear and the peach.
Please, God release the congregation that pines for You, and bless the mulberry, the nut and the etrog (citron).
And may it be Your will in front of You, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that You will bless all of the etrog trees to produce their fruits at their time, and produce fine, beautiful and superior etrogs that are free from any blemish. And let not growths emerge from them; let them be whole and not have any lackings, even a mark from a thorn. May they be plentiful for us and for all of our brethren, Israel, wherever they may be, to fulfill the commandment of taking them together with the lulav (palm branch) on the festival of Sukkot - may it come to us for good life and peace - as You have commanded us in Your Torah, through Moshe, Your servant (Leviticus 23:40), "You are to take yourselves, on the first day, the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palms, and boughs of thick trees and willows of the brook."
And may it be Your will in front of You, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that You will help us and assist us to perform this commandment of taking the lulav, the myrtle, the willow and the etrog according to its law and its time on the festival of Sukkot - may it come to us for good life, peace, joy and good heartedness - and make available to us a fine and superior etrog that is complete and fit according to the law.
And may it be Your will in front of You, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that You will bless all types of trees and have them produce their fruit in large quantities, full and goodly. And may You bless the grapevines that they should produce many grapes, full and goodly, in order that there be wine easily available for all of Your people Israel, in order to fulfill the commandment of Kiddush with it, and the commandment of Havdalah on Shabbats and on holidays. And may the verse be fulfilled with us and with all of Israel, our brothers, that is written (Ecclesiastes 9:7), "Go, eat your bread in gladness, and drink your wine in joy; for your action was already approved by God." (And it is said,) "I have come to my garden, my own, my bride; I have plucked my myrrh and spice, eaten my honey and honeycomb, drunk my wine and my milk; eat, friends; drink deep, loved ones" (Song of Songs 5:1). May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before You, Lord, may Rock and my Redeemer.
A Song for Tu BiShevat - the mnemonic is I will bless the Lord, (<i>Avarekh Ya-h</i>):
<b>A</b> Then will the tree of the forests rejoice before God, the Strong One of the strong ones; it will raise hymns and songs. I will sing a new song - the living God shall be exalted; our Rock, His name shall be sanctified.
<b>B</b> Blessed is God who dwells in the skies, the Creator of many souls, and the Creator of goodly trees. I will sing a new song - the living God shall be exalted; our Rock, His name shall be sanctified.
<b>R</b> God is elevated in the Heavenly abodes; blessed is the One who blesses the years, who makes grow the grapes of the vine. I will sing a new song - the living God shall be exalted; our Rock, His name shall be sanctified.
<b>Kh</b> His glory is powerful in the lights; He grows the branches and the twigs and creates olives and dates. I will sing a new song - the living God shall be exalted; our Rock, His name shall be sanctified.
<b>Ya</b> Blessed be the One who dwells in His abode; He makes grow the fruit of the fig tree. We shall acknowledge Him with song and rejoicing. I will sing a new song - the living God shall be exalted; our Rock, His name shall be sanctified.
<b>H</b> Praise the living God with hymns, the One who, upon the waters of the rivers, grows pomegranates and all types of fruit. I will sing a new song - the living God shall be exalted; our Rock, His name shall be sanctified.
<b>Chazak</b> Strengthen the wandering hearts, rejoice sons together with the fathers; this is how we will merit many years. I will sing, let us sing, a new song - the living God shall be exalted; our Rock, His name shall be sanctified.

<b>A Supplicatory Prayer for Immersion on Shavuot Night</b>
A person should be very alacritous, about the immersion of Shavout night in the early morning a little before the dawn, to immerse in a mikveh or a spring of flowing water if he has one. This is to receive the addition of holiness from the supernal Crown that is drawn on this night through [Torah] study; and that is called the fiftieth gate. And it is stated about it (Ezekiel 36:25), "And I have sprinkled pure water upon you, etc." And it is like the Ari, may his memory be for life in the world to come, said in the Shaar HaKavannot [regarding] the secret of this thing at greater length, see there. But before the immersion, he should say this supplicatory prayer: 
For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Divine Presence - with fear and love and love and fear - and to unify the letters, <i>yod</i> and <i>hey</i>, and the letters, <i>vav</i> and <i>hey</i>, in the name of all of Israel: Behold I prepare myself to be from the attendants of the holy queen mother, Rachel, the anchor of the house. And behold I now come in the early morning of the day of the Shavuot festival at the time that is called the morning star (<i>ayelet hashachar</i>) to immerse in the mikveh (in the spring of flowing water), to repair the root of this immersion in the supernal place, to draw forth purity and immersion from the supernal Crown which is drawn forth on this night. And it is called the fiftieth gate; and it is stated about it (Ezekiel 36:25), "And I have sprinkled pure water upon you, and you shall be purified." And behold I am prepared to immerse four times, corresponding to the four letters of [God's] name, may He be blessed, with the vocalization of <i>kamatz</i> (he should intend to think of the name with a <i>kamatz</i> under every letter). And behold I am also prepared to immerse a fifth time, corresponding to the light of the supernal Kindness, which is the supreme will that is revealed in the eighth constellation that is called, Forms Kindness. 'May the favor of the Lord, our God, be upon us; let the work of our hands prosper, prosper the work of our hands!'

<i>At the end of the seventh day of the seven clean days, the woman should say:</i>
Master of the Universe, It is revealed and known before you that I have fulfilled Your commandments by keeping the days of menstruation and I have counted seven clean days. And behold, I am prepared and ready to fulfill the commandment of immersion in proper water at its time, as per the commandments that You have commanded me. Behold, I am fulfilling this commandment for the sake of the unification of the Holy One, blessed be He, with His divine presence, in complete unification on behalf of all of Israel, in order to rectify the root of this commandment in the supernal place. And may it ascend before You as if I had intended all of the intentions that are fitting to intend. 
And just like I am purifying my body from impurity in the water, so too, in Your great mercy and Your great kindness, purify my spirit from all impurity and dirt. And fulfill through us the verse, <i>And I will throw pure water upon you, and you shall become pure</i> (Ezekiel 36:25). And it is stated, <i>The Lord is the mikveh [purification pool] of Israel</i> (Jeremiah 17:13).  
And may it be Your will before You, Lord, my God and  God of my fathers, that the commandment of keeping the days of menstruation and the commandment of counting the seven clean days and the commandment of purification and immersing in proper water be significant and acceptable and desired before You, to repair all of our lackings and the lacking of Adam and Eve and that all of the dross be separated from the holy and that there be a brightness like the light [alluding to Habakkuk 3:4] towards the holy place.
And may it be Your will before You, Lord, my God and  God of my fathers, that You grant me and my husband strength, ability, help, and assistance for our marriage, and that we merit to have righteous wise children who understand the Torah. Please, Lord, save us now, please; please, Lord, make us successful now, please. Please, Lord, save us now, please; please, Lord, make us successful now, please.
