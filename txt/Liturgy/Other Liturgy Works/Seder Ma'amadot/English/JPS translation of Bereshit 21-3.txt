(1) The heaven and earth were finished and all their array. (2) On the seventh day G-D finished the work that He had been doing, and He ceased on the seventh day from all the work that He had done. (3) And G-D blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, because on it G-D ceased from all the work of creation that he had done.
