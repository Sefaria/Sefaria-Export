Yedid Nefesh

My soul's beloved, merciful father,
Draw your surrendered to your will rendered.
Your surrendered will run like a gazelle,
He will bow before your splendor.
For to him, your love is sweeter,
Than the dripping honeycomb, and any taste at all.
Resplendent, beautiful, radiance of the world,
My soul is sick for your amore,
Please, O God, heal her now,
By the beauty of your radiance, by showing her.
Then she will be strong, she will be healed,
And she will be your handmaiden forever more.
Ancient one, rouse, please, your mercy.
Please have pity on the son of your beloved,
For so much has this yearning been,
To see your strength, in its beauty,
Please, my god, the love of my heart,
Hurry, please, and do not hide yourself.
Please, be revealed and spread the covering, beloved,
Upon me, the shelter of your tranquility
Illuminate the earth with your nobility
We will rejoice in you, we will be in festivity
Hurry, beloved, for the time has come,
And be good to me, like days long ago.
