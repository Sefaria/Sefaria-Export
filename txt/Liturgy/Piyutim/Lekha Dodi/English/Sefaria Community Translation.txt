Lekha Dodi



Verse 1

Come, my lover, to welcome the bride
The face of Shabbat we will receive

Verse 2

"Keep" and "remember" in one saying
We were caused to listen by the Unified God
Adonai is One, and His Name is One
To His name, and to glory and to praise!

Verse 3

To greet the Sabbath, come and we'll go
For she is a source of blessing
From the first, from of old, she was chosen
Made at the end, and planned from the start

Verse 4

O Holy Place of the King, city of sovereignty
Arise, escape from the midst of the chaos
Long have you sat in the valley of tears
And He will grant mercy, mercy upon you

Verse 5

Shake it off, from the ashes get up!
Put on the clothes of your glory, my people!
By the hand of the son of Jesse the Bethlehemite
Nearer to my soul is its redemption!

Verse 6

Awaken yourselves! Awaken yourselves!
For your light has come! Get up, my light!
Wake up! Wake up! A song, speak out!
The glory of Adonai upon you is revealed!

Verse 7

Don't be ashamed! Don't be abashed!
Why be depressed? Why be upset?
In you my poor people will be sheltered
And she shall be rebuilt - the city on her hill!

Verse 8

And attacked shall be those who attack you
And far distant will be those who devoured you.
For you your God will rejoice
As a groom rejoices for his bride

Verse 9

Right and left you will break out
And Adonai you will venerate
By the hand of the man of the line of Peretz
We will rejoice and we will sing

Verse 10

Come in peace, crown of her husband
As well in joy and in jubilation
The midst of the faithful precious nation
Enter, bride! Enter, bride!
