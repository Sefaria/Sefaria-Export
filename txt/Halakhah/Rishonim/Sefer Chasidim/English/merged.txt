Sefer Chasidim



Siman 1

This is called “Book of the Pious.” Its contents are sweet and most desirable. It is written for those who fear God and revere His name. There is a Hasid whose heart desires the love of His Creator, to do His will completely. But he does not know which matters to assume, which matters to avoid, or how to immerse himself thoroughly to do his Creator’s will. The reason is that hearts have become deficient. There is a Hasid who undertakes a great deal and there is one who does little, but if he knew and understood matters of piety he would do a great deal more than those who do much. It is for this reason that the “Book of the Pious” was written, so that all who fear God and those returning to their Creator with a sincere heart may see, know and understand all that they must do and all that they must avoid. This book was not written for the wicked, for if they read it much of its contents would strike them as nonsense. And if communicated to them, they would ridicule it. Concerning them Solomon in his wisdom said, “Speak not in the ear of a fool; for he will despise the wisdom of thy words” (Prov. 23:8). Similarly when Solomon wrote Proverbs, it was not intended for the wicked for even if he were to confront them with all his wisdom, it would not have availed either to better their hearts or to encourage their return (to God). He spoke only to the righteous who long for God’s word; he spoke to them that they might see, understand and become wise, as it is written, “For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just do walk in them; but transgressors do stumble therein” (Hos. 14:10). This demonstrates that the path of piety, humility and fear of the Lord is a snare unto the wicked but an ascent for the righteous.

Siman 2

The author of this book who dealt with piety, humility and fear of the Lord in separate treatises, said, “I perceived for myself, and from my teachers I received understanding and instruction. It is proper for all those that fear the Lord to teach their children, students and all Israel how they can succeed in doing the will of our Creator, may His name be blessed and His fame be exalted.” His style is that of the allegory, comparing the Lord to the ways of mortals in order to reach the hearts of humans, to speak to them in their accustomed manner of hearing, to open the eyes of the blind and to enlighten uncircumcized hearts. And this is recorded in the Bible, “And His voice was like the sound of many waters” (Ezek. 43:2); “The Lord shall roar like a lion” (Hos. 11:10). He also likens His image to that of His creatures: “His eyes are like doves” (Cant. 5:12); and there are many other such examples: “His legs are as pillars of marble” (Cant. 5:15). All this is done in order to address them in their accustomed manner of hearing.

Siman 3

“The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing” (Prov. 10:7), i.e., the memory of the Righteous One of the world will be for a blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 37a. All Talmudic references are to the Babylonian Talmud unless otherwise indicated.</i> Each time we invoke the revered and awesome name of God we are enjoined to bless Him in the sacred tongue, may His name be blessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 35b.</i> Even those of lesser knowledge will understand that this is comparable to a man whose son or loved one has gone on some distant journey; when he refers to him he does so saying, “My son, may he be remembered in peace this day, may all go well with him.” And whereas we say of the deceased, “His repose be peace,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 31b.</i> all the more so are we enjoined (to say) concerning the Holy One, blessed be He, who is living and enduring, “may the revered name of our Creator be blessed.” Concerning this it was said, “He who hears his neighbor invoke God’s name (in vain) should excommunicate him, and if he fails to do so he is himself excommunicated.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim 7b.</i>

Siman 4

It is reported of a certain pious man that while seated in a wedding hall he heard one of the singers at the dance employing God’s name in his song. The pious man excommunicated him for each single offense. Even demons do not invoke God’s name in vain, as it is stated in the tractate Megillah, “Perhaps it was a demon? but we do know by way of tradition, they do not invoke the name of God in vain.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Megillah 3a.</i>

Siman 5

“Thou shalt surely rebuke they neighbor” (Lev. 19:17). We are commanded to rebuke any Israelite who is resigned and careless of even one of the 248 positive commandments, or if he has violated one of the negative commands. And the sages tell us that he who has an opportunity to rebuke any Israelite concerning a positive or negative command and fails to do so is punished for all (the transgressions).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Arakhin 16b.</i> As we have studied (Talmud), “He who has the opportunity to rebuke and protest the actions of his household members and fails to do so is punished because of them. If it involves people of his city he is held responsible because of them, if it involves the entire world he is held responsible for the entire world.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 54b.</i> Whence do we know that we must return a second time to reprove someone if he has failed to respond at first? It is stated, “Whence do we deduce (the command) that if one has rebuked a first time he must rebuke his neighbor once again.” It is stated, “Thou shalt surely rebuke.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 31a.</i> He must do so in a manner commensurate with the qualities of the one who is being rebuked; if he be kindly let him reprove him benignly, if he be difficult let him rebuke him accordingly. Let him speak to him in parables and give proofs to enable him to restore his mind to his will. And he shall not favor an elder or superior if he wishes to avoid punishment because of (either of) them. He should warn them of their wicked deeds with impartiality, even when involving a teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> For thus said the wise man, “Where there is a profanation of God’s name, one does not grant respect even to a teacher.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 19b.</i> And they (the rabbis) said further, “Rebuke”; this implies a teacher towards his student. How do we know that a student may do similarly to his teacher? Read the text: “Thou shalt surely rebuke, in all cases.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 31b.</i> We are obliged to rebuke transgressors and to shame them with their sins to the extent that they strike, insult and curse us. He who rebukes is obliged to reprove (purge) himself for that transgression and to rectify his (own) way before rebuking his neighbor. For if he fails to do so his neighbor will not accept his reproofs. Thus did they say, “Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together,” first adorn (correct) thyself and then adorn (correct) others.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 18a.</i> And let no man rest without exploring all means to cause his neighbor to walk the straight path, furthering him from (assisting him against) transgression in worldly and spiritual matters. He who restrains himself from rebuking is guilty of his neighbor’s punishment; for it is written, “Thou shalt not bear sin because of him”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 54b.</i> (Lev. 19:17). And if he has rebuked him and his neighbor has not responded the rebuker is exempt from punishment for the sin. The rebuker nevertheless receives merit because he has admonished him to walk the straight path and to shun wrong, as it is explained in the paragraph, “Therefore, O thou son of man, etc….” (Ezek. 23:9) “Nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he turn not from his way he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul” (Ezek. 23:9). The root of this commandment “and not bear sin because of him” (Lev. 19:17), is that a man should not reprove his fellowman with anger or embarrassment,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Arakhin 16b.</i> but first quietly and privately that he not become insolent and recalcitrant and add wrong to his transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 34a.</i> Thus did they say, “I might conclude that he may rebuke him even if his neighbor suffers embarrassment”; read the text, “Thou shalt not bear sin because of him” (Lev. 19:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra,</i> ed. Isaac H. Weiss (reprint of Vienna Edition of 1862; New York: OM Publishing Co., 1947), p. 89a.</i>

Siman 6

“Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor” (Exod. 20:13). By implication of this negative command it is forbidden to say a shameful thing about a neighbor not in his presence, i.e., that if he were to hear it, it would anger him.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Arakhin 15b.</i> As it is written, “Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother, thou slanderest thine own mother’s son” (Ps. 50:20).<br/>But if he has committed sins and has been reproved privately but he has not accepted (the reproofs) then it is permissible to reprimand him publicly for his evil doings, with or without his presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides, Hilkhoth Deoth, 6:8.</i>

Siman 7

Of what manner is the root of piety? When a man’s heart inclines toward qualities of piety and it is made difficult for him because all mock him and shame him and say things to torment him and recall his former evil deeds, let him not leave his piety because of the scorners, but let him acquire good qualities little by little, day after day: “he that gathereth little by little shall increase” (Prov. 13:11). Concerning this it is stated, “If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself” (Prov. 9:12). Concerning the scorners it is written “They make a man an offender by words” (Isa. 29:21), i.e., they (the scorners) speak badly about those who perform the commandments. It is a great sin to say to a penitent, “Remember thy former deeds”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 58b.</i> after he has evidenced through good deeds his desire to acquire the qualities of piety. He is not disturbed by the laughter of the scorners. Those that recall his former deeds are regarded as if closing the door to the penitent. And let him say to himself that his being shamed will be counted for him as a great merit and as righteousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 12b.</i> And the pure fear of God enters his heart and purifies his heart and body of all evil because he will be aided from heaven to be strengthened in the fear of God. And so they said, “He who comes to be purified is assisted from heaven.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 104a.</i> And they prepare for him to make full repentance, for the doors of repentance are not shut.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tehillim,</i> ed. Solomon Buber (Wilna: Romm Publisher, 1891), p. 313.</i> And precept leads to precept,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 4:2.</i> and now as the man enters through the doors of repentance he will pray day and night before his Creator that He rescue him from Divine Justice and there occur no stumbling through himself. And to the extent that a man treads in his piety and has no inclination to turn aside from his meritorious way—for it is upright in his sight—so the Master of Uprightness will lead him in the upright path. And thus David said, “Good and upright is the Lord; therefore doth He instruct sinners in the way. He guideth the humble in justice; and He teacheth the humble His way” (Ps. 25:8). And as he enters piety with difficulty so will it be the more difficult for him to leave his good way because of shame, because people might say, thus is it now known that this man strives for outward appearances only<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel 16:7.</i> and in order to deceive people he has feigned piety, and it is forbidden to deceive people, even a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin 94a.</i> And because piety is difficult to achieve initially it is good to start during youth, as it is written, “Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth” (Eccl. 12:1); “and even when he is old he will not depart from it” (Prov. 22:6). For the repentance of an old man, when he is aged and the desires are gone, resembles a man indulging in slander with his tongue gone and he speaks no more. But when a man returns while yet in his strength and might and his passion threatens to make itself master over him and he subdues it, this sort of repentance is the most praiseworthy. And a mighty act he performs indeed through controlling his intense and strong passion. Concerning this it is said, “and he that ruleth his spirit (rather) than he that taketh a city” (Prov. 16:32). And for each matter which is difficult for the individual but which he nevertheless accomplishes, his reward is very great.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 5:26.</i>

Siman 8

When Rabbi Simeon ben Gamaliel and Rabbi Ishmael went forth to be killed, said Rabbi Simeon b. Gamaliel to Rabbi Ishmael “I do not know why I am going forth to be killed.” He said, “Perhaps when you were expounding in public, your heart rejoiced and your heart was gratified.” He said, “You have consoled me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aboth of Rabbi Nathan,</i> ed. Solomon Schechter (reprint of Vienna Edition of 1887; New York: P. Feldheim Publisher, 1945), version A, Chapter XXXVIII, p. 114.<br>/2/ <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> (New York—Berlin: Horeb Publishers, 1926), Kings, par. 244, p. 768.</i> And so should every man do, he should repent of his evil doings without ostentation and let him go and perform his tasks and matters privately, let his heart not profit at all from his good works; also all matters relative to piety let him do in concealment. For it is already stated, “conceal thy things” (Prov. 25:2) “and walk humbly with thy God” (Mic. 6:8). And let a man not claim credit for himself that his intentions are heavenly. Let him beware lest his heart profit or rejoice. For if his heart rejoices before the world, he has indeed already received a part of the reward for that command in this world. If his heart rejoiced against his will, that is to say without his knowledge or intent, let him condition his heart to overcome his passion and let him desist from that act in which his heart rejoiced. For many of those now deceased performed this specific deed and performed meritorious acts without number; they have passed on to their eternal rest and the matter is forgotten, they have left no remembrance because their memory is forgotten in this world with none to recall them, but their memory is for the after-life. Therefore what advantage or profit is mine if they praise me in this world? So should he think at all times also at night when retiring. He must be concerned lest eternal sleep overtake him and he will awaken no more. Wherefore should he continue to rejoice that they praise him in this world? All is vanity and a striving after wind.

Siman 9

The main strength of piety from beginning to end is that although they scoff at him he does not forsake his piety, his intent is for heaven’s sake and he does not look at the countenances of women: especially so among other men where women are customarily seen, for example, if he has been in the wedding hall where the women were garbed in choicest ornaments and all were gazing but he did not stare, for that will he merit the great good that is laid up, as it is written, “which thou hast laid up for those that fear thee” (Ps. 31:20). And his eye will be satiated with the Divine Glory: “Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty” (Isa. 33:17). For this reason it is best for the individual when he meets a woman, whether single or married, whether a gentile woman or Jewish, whether she be of age or a minor, to turn his face aside from looking at her. Thus do we find in Job (31:1), “I made a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid.” And thus is it written in the book of Ben Sira, “Avert your eyes from a beautiful woman, lest you stumble and incur penalties for her.” <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ben Sira 9:5.</i> (So Isa. 33:15) “And shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil” refers to him who gazes not upon women at the time when they stand by their wash.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Bathra 57b.</i> When they wash their garments and lift their skirts so as not to soil them, they uncover their legs, and we know a woman’s leg is a sexual incitement<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 24a.<br>/4/ Solomon Ibn Gabirol, <i>Choice of Pearls,</i> ed. Zvi Phillipawski (Warsaw: J. Lebenson, 1863), p. 9; also Jerusalem Talmud Berakoth 1:5. All future references to the Jerusalem Talmud will be designated J. T.</i> and so said the sage, “nothing interposes better before desire, than closing one’s eyes.”

Siman 10

The essence of piety is to apply oneself constantly to things, where his passions are most challenging, such as evil gossip, the evil inclination, vanities, not to speak falsely, not to stare at women or speak of worldly curiosities or walk about idly; implicit in all this is evil passion. Thus he should not swear at all, nor invoke God’s name in vain, and so in all similar matters that go on constantly, where his passion overpowers him and he cannot withstand (he will be able to resist) only if he has been trained from childhood. Therefore let a man train his children in these matters while they are yet small and when they grow old they will not forsake them or set them aside; as it is written, “And even when he is old he will not depart from it” (Prov. 22:6). Take, for example, tallith and phylacteries, many men of quality wish to garb themselves with fringes and put on the phylacteries but refrain from doing so because of embarrassment; however all matters in which a man is trained (to do so) in childhood, when he grows up and attempts to forsake (them) it will be as difficult for him as death. But if a man strengthens himself in Torah and commandments and good deeds, then it becomes difficult for him to depart from them because of the embarrassment; people will say all that he has done so far has been to deceive people, as has been mentioned. He is called <i>hasid</i>, which is derived from <i>hasadim</i> (kindness).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>hasid</i> used to describe the pious and saintly, derives from the Hebrew word <i>hesed,</i> meaning act of loving kindness.</i> He is also called <i>hasid</i> because of the term <i>hasidah</i> (stork) (Deut. 14:18) which Onkelos translates <i>huraitha</i> (white bird). And it is written, “not now shall he be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale” (Isa. 29:22), which has the meaning of insult and shame that if they insult him and cause his face to become white and he like one deaf can not hear and like a mute does not open his mouth and does not insult anyone, then he is called pious.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tehillim,</i> ed. Buber, p. 123.</i> And in the hereafter his face will shine brightly and he will succeed to sit in the seven classes of righteous men who will receive the Shekhina and enjoy the Divine Glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah</i> (New York-Berlin: Horeb Publishers, 1924), Leviticus, Chapter XXX, p. 81a.</i> As it is written, “Arise, shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee etc…. But upon thee the Lord will arise and His glory shall be seen upon thee. And nations shall walk by thy light and kings by the brightness of thy rising” (Isa. 60:1-3). These seven classes enjoy Divine Glory.

Siman 11

One is not considered pious unless he is able to overlook personal grievances. If people come before him who have wronged him and have dealt with him unworthily, and now are sorry and seek his forgiveness; that which is in their power to correct of the wrong which they caused, they correct, and for that which they cannot remedy, they repent and seek his pardon, and agree to accept any judgement he sees fit to pass upon them. And when this one sees that it is in his power to do evil to them and repay them in kind, he forgives them with a whole heart and does not do evil to them. Because of this he is called pious, as it is written, “Return thou backsliding Israel, Saith the Lord; I will not frown upon you for I am merciful” (Jer. 3:12). And so the children of Jacob, when they sinned against Joseph, he forgave and did not repay in kind. And this is the root of <i>Hasiduth</i>, he must do beyond the line of strict justice in all matters, as it is written “and gracious in all his works” (Ps. 145:17).

Siman 12

The root of <i>Hasiduth</i> is fear of the Lord. If a man desires some matter of enjoyment and turns aside from his passion only because of fear of God and not because he fears retributions in the world to come, nor because of the enjoyment of this world and the world to come, but he rather fears that he will not be perfect in the love of the Creator, may His name be blessed, as it is written, “Thou shalt be wholehearted with the Lord thy God” (Deut. 18:13); this person is called a God-fearing man. The great and singular restraint is forsaking foods, for saturation with foods brings evil imaginations. How so? If there be before him a meal of fish or meat or of other dainties let him not resist from eating at all but for the fear of God let him not fill his stomach to the full reach of his appetite.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra,</i> ed. Weiss, p. 93b.</i> It is the same with respect to one to whom a meritorious deed presents itself and it is difficult for him to do it, and (nevertheless) he does not desist from acting. And so we find with Abraham, “for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man” (Gen. 22:12).

Siman 13

The foundation of the fear of God is the trial. For the essence of fear becomes apparent in the time of trial. And as fear is apparent when involving passion for women, so is it recognizable in all sorts of passion. And the Holy One, blessed be He, does not put man to a trial except when He intends to do good to him; Satan, who embodies the attribute of strict justice, comes before God and says, “Lord of the Universe, it would not be proper to do good to him until he proves himself in trial.” Therefore the just are sworn to conquer their passion.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hagigah 10a.</i> And thus when He brought good to Saul and his children He tried him, and so with Abraham and Job.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 5:3.</i> Man should always be deliberate in the fear of the Lord,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 17a.</i> answering softly, turning back anger,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> speaking peacefully with his brothers and close ones, even with a gentile in the street, in order that he be beloved above and favored below and acceptable to human beings. They said concerning Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, a man never was first in saluting him not even a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> And let a man be deliberate in fear of the Lord and understanding to think subtle thoughts for the improvement of the world and the honor of heaven. In the end the words of every man who is God-fearing are heard. As it is stated, “The end of the matter, all having been heard: fear God” (Eccl. 12:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 6b.</i> A man who possesses learning but is devoid of works is analogous to one to whom have been given the inner keys but not the outer ones by which he shall enter; and how shall he enter?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 31b.</i>

Siman 14

The root of loving God is loving God with all your heart (Deut. 6:4). Our Creator commanded us to serve him with love,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The term “love” is the preferred reading.</i> that the love of our soul be bound up with His soul in joy and in His love and with a good heart. And the joy of this love is of such intensity and so overpowers the heart of those who love God, that even after many days of not being with his wife and having a great desire for her, in the hour that a man ejaculates he does not find it as satisfying as the intensity and power of loving<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> God and finding joy in his Creator. And all the pleasures of playing with his children are as naught compared to the pleasures of the heart of the man who loves God with all his heart and soul and with all his might, i.e., with all his thoughts, about how to love God and how to make the public acquire merit and sanctify God’s name, and how to devote himself with love to the Creator,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 61b.</i> as did Phineas the priest who dedicated himself with love for his Creator to be zealous in His name. Let him not covet money in a situation where there is a Sanctification of God’s name if he resists taking money, as we find with Abraham, “that I will not take a thread or a shoe latchet” (Gen. 14:23). And so (it was) with Elisha who did not want to take money from Naaman. Let him not neglect the study of the Law because of pleasures, playing with his children or attachment to his wives. Also let him give up leisurely walks, meeting with women, sweet songs, in order that his heart may be whole in the joy of God, toiling and laboring in that which is the will of the Creator. He should take a lesson from one of flesh and blood. If he knew a matter to be the desire of a king, he would not yield nor rest until he fulfilled the will of the king, who is a worm like himself. He would be overjoyed that his deeds received the notice of the king and especially if it met with the will of the Creator who is eternal. Therefore must he labor all the more and seek how to fulfill the will of His commandments. He who serves out of love, occupies himself with Torah and commandments, goes in paths of proper wisdom and occupies himself with Torah and loves God with great love, not for any other reason, and not for fear of evil, nor for the purpose of inheriting the good. But he serves in truth, because the Holy One, blessed be He, is truth and in the end the good will come because of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim 62a.</i> He must love the Creator with a great and strong love until he becomes sick because of his love, as the man who is love-sick for the affections of a woman and reels constantly because of his love, when he sits, rises, goes and comes, also when he eats and drinks. He neither sleeps nor slumbers because of this love. Greater than this should love of the Creator be in the hearts of those who love Him and they should be absorbed in it constantly,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh ha-Shanah 4a.</i> as we were commanded, “with all thy heart, with all thy soul …” (Deut. 6:4); and this is what Solomon in his wisdom said by the way of simile: “For I am love-sick” (Cant. 2:5). And this is a matter as clear as day and sun, for all who know that love of the Creator is not bound up with the heart of man until he is absorbed in it continuously, so as, for example, to forsake all else in the world outside of Him, as He commanded us “with all thy heart” (Deut. 6:4). This is impossible except through the apprehension of the mind. Therefore this is the truth, and the sum of it all is, that man must understand and study in the wisdoms and disciplines that make known to him his Master<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 75a.</i> according to the intellectual ability that he possesses to understand, consider and comprehend.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides, Hilkhoth Teshuvah, 10:6.</i> And the Creator, blessed be His name and exalted be His revered and awesome fame, commanded us to love and fear His name, as it is written “and thou shalt love the Lord thy God” (Deut. 6:4); and it is said, “thou shalt fear the Lord thy God” (Deut. 6:13). And which is the way in which to love Him and fear Him? In the hour that the individual comprehends the great and wondrous works of God, the Holy One, blessed be He, which are beyond assessment and limit, he immediately loves, praises, glorifies and yearns deeply to know that great, revered and awesome name.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Moses Maimonides, <i>Book of the Divine Commandments,</i> trans. Charles Chavel (<i>2</i> Vols.; London: Soncino Press, 1940), I, 82, commandment 3.</i> And thus did David say, “My soul thirsteth for God for the living God” (Ps. 42:3). And when he reflects upon these matters he will be startled, he will fear, and will tremble that he is a very small and lowly creature standing with poor and scanty knowledge before Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides, Hilkhoth Yesode Ha-Torah, 2:2, adds the words, “Who is omniscient,” (literally, “Whose knowledge is complete”).</i> And so did David say, “When I behold Thy heavens the work of Thy fingers etc…. What is man that Thou art mindful of him” (Ps. 8:4).

Siman 15

Concerning the root of humility, one must remove oneself from a situation involving high office and honor, and let him not include himself with other individuals. How so? If he was before his teacher and he remembered a question or some query that he posed or some answer that he supplied, let him not say to his teacher or his friend, “So have I answered, so have I asked,” but “So have you asked,” in order that his heart may not be gratified.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Shabbath 30b.</i> Also let him give his teacher or friend the honor and not himself. For such do we find with Moses, when he said to Joshua, “Choose us our men” (Exod. 17:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekilta,</i> ed. Jacob Z. Lauterbach (3 Vols.; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1933-1935), Exodus II, 140.</i> From this Rabbi Gamaliel derived and wrote, “The matter pleases me and my colleagues.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 11b.</i> And it is also written that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Isaiah, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” (Isa. 6:8). From this the Torah indicated the path of humility for scholars. If you question why it is written, “Whom shall I send,” and it is not written “Shall we send,” the answer is: let it not be said that there are two powers governing the universe.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 38b.</i> And he should mention his friend’s name before his own in all matters, in French, “vous et moi,” and let him not say “moi et vous.” Thus the Schools of Hillel and Shammai were wont to do.

Moreover what profit is there to glory in the matter saying, “I know as well as you do.” The end of the matter is that in every way that one is able to diminish his own honor in order to magnify the honor of those that fear God let him do so, as it is written, “In whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he honoreth them that fear the Lord” (Ps. 15:4). And if he sees that others pride themselves through humility resulting in his own embarrassment, let him listen to them. For example, if they are greater than he is and they do not wish to walk before him, i.e., they say, “We are also humble,” and because of this he is embarrassed in that he must walk before them; he is exposed to embarrassment because they urge him to walk in front and he grieves lest they say of him, “How impudent this one is who goes before us, it is we who are greater than he, and see how he magnifies himself because of it,” and in this they pride themselves. In spite of this he should bear the embarrassment in order to respect them, and it will be regarded as a sin and transgression on their part in that they honor themselves at the expense of his embarrassment Let him not honor his friend in a way that causes him embarrassment. For example, he (his friend) is customarily called by name, but he calls him “teacher,” and he (his friend) is embarrassed by this, in that he feels mocked and ridiculed.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gittin 56a.</i> (When studying with two teachers) Let him not praise one in the presence of the other<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Pesahim 100a.</i> nor praise his teacher’s teacher in his teacher’s presence, that he should say to his teacher, “So and so your teacher,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Ketuboth 69a.</i> etc….” Here is a case where students spoke to their teacher Rabbi Eliezer concerning Rabbi Eliezer’s teacher Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zakkai, saying, “Your colleagues have already been polled concerning you and have permitted it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Betzah 5b.</i> Although a person should not profit from his humility,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah 22b.</i> as has already been stated; one should not extoll his own humility since it is written, “Let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth” (Prov. 27:2), however if he wishes to praise himself to his students and friends in order that they learn from his ways, he may praise himself, as David stated, “And I was single-hearted with Him” (Ps. 18:22), “For I have kept the ways of the Lord.” And so do we find a scholar who related to his students his good deeds for which he achieved longevity.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Megillah 28a.</i> Let a man not stand in a place where he is being praised,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aboth of Rabbi Nathan,</i> ed.

This world compares to the world to come as sleeping to wakefulness. In a dream one is not ashamed. For if one were ashamed, imaginings such as, for example, that he is sleeping with a woman and playing with her would not occur to him. He would not do things (in his dream) that he would be ashamed of if they were done while awake. The reason is that dreams come as a result of imaginings.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 55b.</i> If a man entertains impure thoughts he is not ashamed of them (his impure fancies), because (he realizes) that a man does not know or have an understanding of what his neighbor imagines in his heart, (for this reason) therefore he is not embarrassed during his dream. He who is God-fearing with all his heart and because of fear of his Creator does not imagine evil things when awake, will also never be visited with evil imaginings in his dreams.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ketuboth 46a.</i> And so did Ezekiel (4:14) say, “My soul hath not been polluted.” I did not imagine by day and therefore did not come to pollution at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin 44b.</i> And so did our rabbis explain, “Thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing” (Deut. 23:10).

A man should not look at a woman even though she be unattractive,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah 20a.</i> neither at the colored garments of a woman, neither at animals during mating,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> even though he be “full of eyes” as the Angel of Death. The rabbis have taught, “Thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing” (Deut. 23:10). From this Rabbi Phineas ben Jair makes the following<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> deduction: “Torah leads to zeal, and zeal leads to care, and care leads to cleanliness, and cleanliness leads to self-control, and self-control leads to purity, and purity leads to fear of sin, and fear of sin leads to saintliness, and saintliness leads to the resurrection of the dead; and saintliness is greater than all, as it is written, “Then Thou spokest in vision to Thy godly ones” (Ps. 89:20). Others say humility is greater than them all, as it is written, “Because the Lord hath annointed me to bring good tidings unto the humble” (Isa. 61:1). To bring good tidings to the saintly is not written, but to the humble. But the wicked who have evil imaginings and do not guard themselves against evil, come to uncleanliness at night, and to dreams, and to impure fancies leading to pollution. And as there is no shame for the dream, so is there no embarrassment for the wicked with their deeds in this world, as it is written, “Yet they are not at all ashamed, neither know they how to blush” (Jer. 6:15). And all those wicked who imagine evil things and do not dispel them with study of the Torah or with other means, in the world to come The Holy One, blessed be He, will give recompense; for in the same measure that a man commits evil so will he be repaid.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah 8b.</i> Even though humility brings a person to the world to come, humility does not exist in the world to come, and no person will be able to honor his neighbor by saying, “Sit beside me.” For each one will rest on his couch and each one will come in peace to the place that is prepared for him. And each one who humbles himself in this world and is able to rule over himself and take a position of leadership and administration in the community, and has no desire to exalt himself, as did the Sons of Bathyra (Elders of Bathyra) who resigned their leadership in deference to Hillel who was greater than they,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">J.

Concerning the root of study, the individual must steep himself in study and know the performance of each commandment, as it is written, “A good understanding have all they that do thereafter” (Ps. 111:10). It is not written, “All they that study,” but “They that do.” A man should not read and study and be contumacious with his father or teacher or one who is greater than he. He rather studies on the condition that he teach, observe and do, and this is study for its own sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim 62a.</i> And whoever studies the Law not for its own sake, better for him that he were not created.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra,</i> ed.

The root of prayer is joyousness of heart in the Holy One, blessed be He,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 31a.</i> as it is written, “Glory ye in His holy name; let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord” (I Chron. 16:10). And that is why David, King of Israel, used to play on his lute all of his prayers and songs in order to fill his heart with joy in his love for God.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 30b.</i> And when an individual prays he must direct his heart to Him before Whom he stands.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 28b.</i> Five things prevent prayer even though its time has arrived. These are they: ritual purity of the hands, covering one’s nakedness, purity of the place of prayer, matters that distract, and the intent of the heart. “Ritual purity of the hands,” how so? He washes his hands with water unto the joint of the wrist, in French <i>jointure</i>, and then let him pray. If he has been walking and the time of prayer has arrived and he has no water, let him walk until (he reaches) a place of water, wash his hands and then pray. If there is between him and the water more than four miles<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin 122b.</i> let him cleanse his hands with pebbles, or with sand, or on a post and pray, as it has been said,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 15a.</i> “In what case was this said ‛before him,’ but ‛behind him’ we do not oblige him to return, but only up to a mile.” But if he has gone more than a mile he then cleanses his hands with pebbles, sand or on a post. “Covering one’s nakedness,” how so? <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 25a.</i> Even though he has covered his nakedness in the manner that he covers himself for the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, let him not pray until he covers his bosom. And if he has not covered his bosom because of circumstance and has nothing with which to cover himself, since he has covered his shame and prayed he has done his duty. But at the outset he should not do so. “Cleanliness of the place of prayer,” how so?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> Let him not stand in a filthy place and pray, nor in a bathhouse, nor in a privy, nor in a dung heap, nor in a place which has not a presumptive status of ritual cleanliness until investigated. The sum of the matter is that one does not pray in a place where he cannot recite the <i>Shema</i>. And in the same manner that one removes himself from excrement, similarly does one remove himself from urine and from bad odors and from indecent sights for prayer, as he would remove himself for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. If during the prayer one finds excrement in his place, since he has sinned by not investigating prior to praying let him repeat his prayers in a clean place. If one has been in the midst of prayer and seen excrement in front of him, if he is able to go forward putting a distance of four cubits between, let him go forth. If he is unable to do so, let him remove it to the side and if he is unable to do this, let him cease praying. “Matters that distract,” how so? If one has had need to evacuate and has prayed, his prayer is an abomination. He repeats his prayers after taking care of his needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23a.</i> If he is able to contain himself for the time needed to traverse a parasang, his prayer is acceptable. But even so, let him not pray until he has examined himself thoroughly, let him remove phlegm, mucous, all spittle and filth of the nose, and then let him pray. One who belches, yawns or sneezes deliberately during his prayers, in French, <i>tousser, bâiller, éternuer</i>, is disgraceful. But if he has examined himself before praying and was overcome, it is of no consequence. If during his prayer he has chanced upon spittle, let him remove it with his prayer shawl or clothing, but if he be exceedingly sensitive and troubled thereby, let him cast it behind him, in order that he not be troubled during prayer. If he breaks wind during prayer unwittingly, let him be silent until the odor subsides and then return to his prayer. If he has had need to break wind and suffered greatly being unable to contain himself, let him remove himself a distance of four cubits, wait until the odor subsides, say, “Lord of all the universes, You have created me orifices and orifices, hollows and hollows. Before the throne of Thy glory is revealed and apparent our revilement all the days of our lives and that we are worms in our death.” And he prays once again in his place. If he has been in the midst of prayer and urine has dripped on his knees, he waits until it ceases and returns to the place in his prayers where he has stopped. And if he has paused for an interval of such duration as would have enabled him to conclude the prayer, let him return to the beginning. Similarly if he has urinated, he pauses for the duration of an interval necessary to walk four cubits and then prays.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Megillah 27b.</i> “Directing one’s heart,” how so? A prayer which is devoid of inwardness let him repeat and pray with inwardness. If his mind has been confused and his heart troubled, he is forbidden to pray until his mind becomes settled. In what way is inwardness achieved? He should free his mind of all thoughts as if he were standing before the Lord. Therefore he must rest a bit before prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The Zohar,</i> trans. H. Sperling, M. Simon and P. Levertoff (4 Vols.; London: Soncino Press, 1931-1934), II, 28.</i> in order to direct the prayer inwardly, and then let him pray with prayers and supplications. And let him not regard his prayer as if he were carrying some heavy burden which he casts aside and then moves on. Therefore, he should sit down after prayer and then leave. The scholars of former years tarried one hour before prayer and one hour after prayer and prolonged their prayers one hour.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 32b.</i> A person who is drunk should not pray,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Erubin 64a.</i> and if he prays his prayer is an abomination, because there is no inwardness. But when he becomes sober let him recite again his prayers with inwardness. While under the influence of drink let him not pray. But if he has prayed, his prayer is acceptable. Who is regarded as being drunk? One who cannot speak before a king. But one under the influence of drink is able to speak before a king and does not blunder, but even if this be the case, if he has drunk a quarter of wine, let him not pray until the wine wears off. And so one does not rise to pray out of laughter,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 31a.</i> in French <i>rieur</i>, or out of lightheadedness or scoffing, or out of conversation, or out of strife, or out of anger, only out of the study of the Law, and such law that he does not have to investigate, namely, defined laws.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i> See also, “Decided laws which admit of no discussion,” in Berakoth 31a, <i>Babylonian Talmud in English,</i> ed. Isidore Epstein (36 Vols.; London: Soncino Press, 1935-1953), I, 188.</i> If he has been travelling by ship, or has been in a place of danger, in a place where there are hordes of wild beasts and robbers, and the hour of prayer has arrived,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29b.</i> he recites one prayer and this is it: “The needs of Thy people Israel are great and they are impatient; may it be Thy will God, our God and God of our fathers, that You assign to each and everyone enough for his maintenance and to each individual enough for his requirements, and that which is best in Thy sight do. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hears prayer.” And he recites it as he goes, and if he is able to remain stationary he stands, and when he reaches a settlement and his mind is set at ease he repeats the prayer according to the institution of the Eighteen Benedictions. Of eight things must the person who prays be circumspect<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillah, 1:1.</i>—and do them. And if he has been pressed or overcome or if he has transgressed and has not performed them they do not hinder the matter, and these are they: standing, facing the Holy Temple, preparation of the body, modulating the voice, arranging the attire, preparation of the place, kneeling and prostration. “Standing,” how so?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 30a.</i> One does not pray except while standing. If he has been seated in a ship or wagon, if he is able to stand let him stand, if not, let him sit in his place and pray. One who is sick prays even though sitting, and this applies only when he is able to direct his mind. Similarly the thirsty and the hungry are classified as being ill. If it is possible for them to direct their mind, let them pray; if not, they should not pray until they eat and drink. If he has been riding on an animal, even though there is someone to hold his animal until he complete his prayer, let him not descend but rather sit in his place and pray in order that his mind be at ease. “Facing the Holy Temple,” how so?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> If he has been standing outside the Holy Land, he turns his countenance towards the land of Israel and prays. If he has been standing in the Holy Land he directs his countenance towards the Holy of Holies. A blind person or one who cannot tell directions or one travelling on a ship, let him direct his heart towards the Divine Presence and pray. “Preparation of the body,” how so? If he has been in the midst of prayer he must align his feet one beside the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 10b.</i> He casts his eyes downward and directs his heart as if looking earthward, and let his heart be turned upward as if he were standing in heaven. And let him place his hands as though bound upon his heart, the right upon the left, and stand as a slave before his master in fear and trembling. Let him not place his hands upon his loins. “Adjusting one’s attire,” how so?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 10a.</i> He adjusts his clothing at the outset, straightens himself and adorns himself, as it is written, “Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness” (Ps. 29:2). Let him not stand in prayer with his purse, nor with a bare head, nor with exposed feet, if the custom of people of that place is not to stand before a superior except with shoes. While praying it is prohibited to take hold of a Scroll of the Law or phylacteries, because his mind is engaged. Let him not hold money or an object in his hand. But during the Festival he prays with his palm branch in his hand because that is the commandment of the day. The custom of the sages and their students was not to pray except when fully dressed.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> “Preparation of the place,” how so?<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 10b.</i> Let him stand in a low place and pray. Let him turn his face to the walls. He should open the windows or the doors towards Jerusalem to pray towards them, for thus do we find in the case of Daniel, “His windows were open in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem” (Dan. 6:11). He establishes a place for prayer. One does not pray in a ruin, neither behind the synagogue, only if he directs his countenance towards the synagogue. It is prohibited to sit beside one who stands in prayer or to pass before him unless he is removed from him four cubits. He should not stand in a place higher than three handbreadths or more and pray, neither on a bed, a bench or on a chair. If he has been standing in an elevated edifice and it is four cubits in length by four cubits in width, which are the dimensions of a house, it is considered a garret and it is permissible to pray. Thus if it is surrounded with a partition on all sides, even though it lacks four cubits, it is permissible to pray there. “Modulating the voice,” how so?<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31a.</i>He should not raise his voice in prayer, and should not pray only in his heart but articulate the words with his lips, sounding it to his ear. He should not cause his voice to be heard except if he has been sick or unable to direct his mind until it causes his voice to be heard; then it is permissible, except that he not be in public, so as not to disturb the thought of others hearing his voice. “Bending the knee,” how so?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34a.</i> He who prays should bend the knee five times; with the first blessing at its beginning and end; and at <i>Modim</i> beginning and end; and when he finishes the prayer he bows and prostrates himself taking three steps backwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed.

The original read: “He sits on the right and falls on his face” (see Perush).</i> he sits down and falls on his face to the right and prays with all the supplication that he desires.

It is permissible for a person to pray in one place and fall on his face in another. One who prays with the congregation let him not extend his prayer more than necessary, but he may do so privately. And if he desires to recite after his prayers even the Order of the Confessional for the Day of Atonement, let him do so. Also if he has wished to add to each prayer of the “middle benedictions,” supplications of similar content, let him add them.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah 8a.</i> If he has been ill or in need of sustenance, let him make additions according to his verbal ability,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 34a.</i> but he should not supplicate in the first three benedictions or in the last three benedictions.

Twenty-four things interfere with repentance.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides, Hilkhoth Teshuvah, 4:1.</i> These are they: (1) gossiping evil, (2) slandering, (3) anger, (4) thinking evil, (5) fraternizing with the wicked, (6) eating at a table a meal that does not even suffice for the host, (7) staring at lewdness, (8) dividing spoils with a thief, (9) saying, “I will sin and the Day of Atonement will atone,” (10) disregarding one’s teachers, (11) cursing the community, (12) withholding the community from performing a meritorious deed is also included in this sin, (13) deflecting one’s friend from a meritorious deed to an act of transgression, (14) making use of the poor man’s pledge, (15) accepting bribes to pervert the law, (16) finding a lost object and not announcing it publicly so that it can be returned to its rightful owners, (17) seeing one’s son going out to a bad environment and not reprimanding him, (18) eating the plunder of the poor and widows, (19) separating oneself from the community, (20) transgressing the words of the sages, (21) honoring oneself at the expense of a friend’s disgrace, (22) suspecting the innocent, (23) despising reproof, (24) scorning the commandments. All these twenty-four things withhold repentance. Repentance is not withheld if he has repented of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Repented of the twenty-four items listed here.</i> for he is then a penitent and has a share in the world to come.<br/>And these things are differentiated in their various aspects. They are not all equal in punishment or with regard to repentance. There are aspects of them that close the path of repentance before their doers: “One who separates himself from the path of the community,” that at the time that they do penance he will not be with them, and he will not share with them in the good deeds that they perform; “One who contests the words of the sages,” because argument causes him to separate from them and he does not know repentance; “one who disregards his teachers,” because this causes him to be banished from the world, and in the time that he is being driven from the world he will not find a teacher to show him the path of truth;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph Albo, <i>Sefer ha-Ikkarim</i> (Book of Principles), ed.

And so we find with Moses when he would admonish Israel he would remind them of all their transgressions, “Ye have been rebellious” (Deut. 9:7), in order to cause them to repent, and (in this manner) all of the prophets reproved Israel. Therefore it is necessary to set up in each and all of Israel’s communities a person, an elder, wise and God-fearing from his youth onward and beloved to the people of his city, to reprove them and return them (to God) in repentance. And this one despises reproof and does not listen to his words therefore he will remain in his sins, which in his eyes are good. There are things which are great transgressions and him who does one of them the Holy One, blessed be He, does not let repent because of the gravity of his sin. These are they: one who leads the community astray and included in this perversity is one who restrains the community from performing a meritorious act; one who leads his neighbor from a good to an evil path, such as an instigator and seducer. One who sees his son conducting an evil life and does not reprimand him and his son is still in his care. For if he were to reprimand him, he would mend his ways; this is therefore tantamount to causing him to sin. Included in this perversion is each one who has the power to rebuke others, both the community and individuals, and has not done so;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 54b.</i> it is as though he placed the snare with his own hands; also he who says, “I will sin and repent,” “I will sin and the Day of Atonement will atone.” There are some things for which he who does them is unable to do complete penance, because they are between him and his fellowman; for example, when he does not know the person against whom he has sinned in order to ask for his forgiveness or, if he has stolen, to whom to make restitution. These<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In the text, “he does not know” is lacking.</i> are they :one who curses the community and has not cursed a specific individual, to be able to approach him, appease him and ask of him forgiveness; one who shares with a thief, because he does not know from whom the theft was taken because he<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“The thief.”</i> steals from all people and brings it to him and he accepts it therefore he doesn’t know to whom to make restitution, moreover, he strengthens the hands of the thief and causes him to sin; one who finds a lost object and does not proclaim it in order to return it to the owners, after a while when he does make penance he does not know to whom to return it; one who eats the loot taken from poor people, orphans and widows, these unfortunate people are not known and wander from city to city and there is no one that knows them to know to whom to return it; he who accepts a bribe to pervert justice, he does not know the extent of the perversion and what loss is involved in order to make a proper restitution moreover, he strengthens the hand of the pervert and causes him to sin.<br/>These are very bad things and he who does them in all probability will not return (to God) because they are simple in the eyes of most people and it appears to them that it is no perversion but it is a decisive sin and perversion. These are they: one who eats at the table a meal that does not even suffice for the host, which is a great sin but he who eats thinks in his heart, “What is my sin, I ate only with his permission”; he who uses the pledge of the poor man, for instance he loans to the poor man on his ax and the creditor chops wood without the poor man’s permission and says, “What is my sin if I have chopped with it, he loses nothing thereby.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 82b.</i> One who stares at lewdness, thinks in his heart, “What is my transgression, wherein is my sin, if I did look at my kinsman have I then fornicated with her?” He does not know or understand that he causes sin to the person involved, as it is written, “That ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye used to go astray” (Num. 15:39). And in the book of Ben Sira he says, “Avert your eyes from a beautiful woman.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 63b; Ben Sira 9:5.</i><br/>The rabbis commented on the verse, “He shutteth his eyes from looking on evil” (Isa. 33:15), that he closes his eyes from looking at women.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Bathra 57b.</i> A woman’s leg is a sexual incitement.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 24a.</i> The voice of a woman is indecency.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> As our sages have said, “He who stares at the small finger of a woman is as if staring at the pudenda.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> They also have said, “Even at the colored clothing of a woman stretched out on the wall, if he recognizes the owner he is prohibited from looking.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah 20b.</i><br/>He who honors himself through the shame of his neighbor says in his heart he is not sinning in that he does not embarrass him and did not bring him to his shame.

Every commandment of the Law, both positive and negative, if a man transgresses one of them through error or deliberately, if he repents and returns from his sins he is enjoined to confess before God, may His name be exalted, as it is written, “When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass … then they shall confess their sin” (Num. 5:6). This is a verbal confession and it involves a positive commandment. In what manner does one confess? He says, “I pray, O Lord, I have sinned, I have done perversely, I have transgressed before Thee, such and such have I done, and behold I am sorry, I am ashamed of my actions and I will never return to this thing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides, Hilkhoth Teshuvah, 1:1.</i> This is the essence of the confession. And he who adds to his confession and elaborates in the matter is all the more praiseworthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 84b.</i> And so sinners and the guilty at the time that they bring sacrifices for their sins and for their errors are not forgiven until they do penance and make a verbal confession, as it is written, “And he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned” (Lev. 5:5). And so all those under sentence of death by the court and those subject to lashes, their death and flagellation does not obtain forgiveness for them unless they do penance and confess.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 43b.</i> And so he who wounds his neighbor or does damage to his neighbor even though he has paid him that which was due him is not atoned for until he confesses and returns from ever doing this again, as it is written, “Any sin that men commit” (Num. 5:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> ed. Horeb, Numbers, par. 701, p. 444.</i> The goat that is to be sent away<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lit “The goat to be sent away.” The scapegoat used for the Yom Kippur ritual sent into the wilderness carrying the sins of the people. (See Leviticus 16:8.)</i> atones for all transgressions in the Torah, light ones and more serious ones, both if the person transgressed in error and if he transgressed deliberately, both if it was made known to him or not made known to him, all is expiated for by the goat that is sent away and this all applies only when he does penance. But if he has not done penance the goat does not atone except for the light ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">J. T. Shebuoth 1:6.</i> And which are the light ones and which are the more serious ones? The more serious ones are those for which one is guilty of the death penalty or of excision (from Israel). A needless oath and a false oath, even though excision is not applicable, are considered among the more serious ones. And all other positive commandments and negative commandments which do not involve excision are regarded as light ones. And in our day when the Holy Temple no longer exists and we have no atonement through the altar there is nothing left but penance. Penance atones for all transgressions. Even if a man has been wicked all his days and has done penance at the end, his wickedness is not counted, as it is written, “And as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not stumble thereby in the day thereby he turneth from his wickedness” (Ezek. 33:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 40b.</i> And the gravity of the Day of Atonement atones for penitents, as it is written, “For on this day shall atonement be made for you” (Lev. 16:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 85b.</i> Even though repentance atones and the gravity of the Day of Atonement atones, there are transgressions which obtain forgiveness only after a time.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 86a.</i> How so? A man has transgressed a positive commandment not involving excision and has done penance he does not go away from there until he is forgiven. Concerning these (such transgressors) it is said, “Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings” (Jer. 3:22). If a man has transgressed a negative commandment which does not involve excision and capital punishment and has repented, the repentance suspends judgement and the Day of Atonement atones. Concerning this it is said, “For on this day shall atonement be made” (Lev. 16:30). If he has transgressed in a matter involving excision and capital punishment and has done penance, penance and the Day of Atonement suspend judgement and the tribulations that visit him conclude the expiation, and he never does obtain full forgiveness until tribulation comes upon him. Concerning them (such transgressors) Scripture says, “Then will I visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with strokes” (Ps. 89:33). When does this apply? Only when he did not profane the Name when he transgressed, for example, he committed the transgression in secret (is expiation possible), but profaning the Name publicly, even though he has done penance and the Day of Atonement has arrived and he stands yet within his penance and tribulation has visited him, not even all of these are able to cleanse his wrong so as to obtain (for him) full forgiveness, except that he die. Repentance, the Day of Atonement and tribulations, these three only suspend judgement but death cleanses and atones, as it is said, “And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in mine ears” (Isa. 22:14).<br/>What is complete penance? (It is illustrated by) one to whom a transgression has presented itself which he has already transgressed and he has the opportunity to do it again but has withdrawn and has not done it because of the penance and not because of fear or weakness. How so? Behold one who has cohabited illicitly with a woman and later has been left alone again with her and has had the opportunity to do it again, and he has been still steadfast in his love for her and has been able to do it, but has subdued his passion and has not transgressed, he is a complete penitent. Concerning this one Solomon said, “Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth” (Eccl. 12:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah 19a.</i> And if he has not returned except in his old age and at the time when it is no longer possible because of his failing strength, to do that which he was able to do in his youth, even though this is not the best penance it avails, and he is regarded as a penitent. And even though he has transgressed all his life and at the end, at the time of his death, he has repented and he has died penitent, all of his transgressions are forgiven him,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 40b.</i> as it is said, “Before the sun and the light … are darkened” (Eccl. 12:2), which is the day of death, from which we can deduce that if he remembers his Creator before death he is forgiven. And what is this repentance? That the sinner forsake his sin and remove evil thoughts from his heart, and resolve in his heart to do it (the evil) no more, as it is said, “Let the wicked forsake his way” (Isa. 55:7). Let him repent and regret his previous sins, as it is written, “Surely after that I was turned I repented” (Jer. 31:18); and let him say, “I give testimony concerning myself before Him Who knows all hidden things, that I will not return to this sin ever; as it is written, “Neither will we call anymore the work of our hands our gods” (Hos. 14:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The Zohar,</i> ed. Soncino, V, 334, 335.</i> And in keeping with the paths of repentance it would have been proper for him to cry continuously before God with weeping and supplications, do charity according to his ability, further himself greatly from the things wherein he sinned, change his name, that is to imply, that “I am another and not that man who did those evil things,” and he changes his actions for the good to rear himself in the upright path. He imposes exile upon himself because exile atones for transgression, it subdues him and causes him to become humble and meek. And it is most praiseworthy for the penitent to confess publicly and let his sin be known and reveal his sin that is between him and his neighbor to others, saying to them, “I have sinned against so and so and such and such have I done to him and this day I return and do penance.” And the proud who do not make known but conceal their sins, their repentance is not complete, as it is written, “He that covereth his transgression shall not prosper; but who so confesseth and forsaketh shall obtain mercy” (Prov. 28:13). In what case (who so confesseth … shall obtain mercy)? Only (in cases) concerning transgressions between man and man, but involving those between man and his Master, he does not need to publicize them. It is insolence on his part if he has revealed it to another; instead he returns to his Creator, blessed be He, and enumerates his sins before Him but confesses them before the congregation inexplicitly, (saying) “I have sinned.” It is best that he not reveal his transgressions, “Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned” (Ps. 32:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Yoma 21a.</i>

The pious men of olden days were wont to write their transgressions on a tablet when they sinned in order to confess their sins,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The previous chapter instructs him to enumerate his sins. This can be done if he records them. Hence the custom of the pious (Perush).</i> also in order to remember, regret and do penance. Because if he remembers his transgressions and that in the future he must give an accounting of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Another reason for recording them is to fulfill the demands of the verse.</i> he will do penance, therefore it is good to record them, to fulfill that which is written, “And my sin is ever before me” (Ps. 51:5). And he remembers the day of death, Gehenna, and the day of judgement and lastly the love of heaven which is the best.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 86b.</i> Let him write them cryptically in order that nobody sees them. The statement of the rabbis that one who declares his sins is called “impudent,” refers to one who enumerates his sins, who tells everyone wherein he sinned. But one is permitted to tell a humble and righteous individual one of his transgressions, that he may be able to teach him how to do penance. Or he should inquire of him inexplicitly, “ If a person has committed such a transgression and comes to repent, how does he do penance?” Even though penance and weeping are good for the person at all times, the days between the New Year and the Day of Atonement are better,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh ha-Shanah 18a.</i> and they (penance and weeping) are immediately accepted, as it is written, “Seek ye the Lord while He may be found” (Isa. 55:6). This is said only concerning the individual, but with the community, as long as they are doing penance and crying with whole hearts, they are answered, as in a similar matter where it is written, “For what great nation is there, that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is whensoever we call upon Him?” (Deut. 4:7) The Day of Atonement is the day of penance for each individual and the community, it is the time of remission and pardon for all Israel. Therefore, all are enjoined to do penance and to confess on the Day of Atonement. And the commandment concerning confession on the Day of Atonement is that it start while yet day before the individual eats or drinks lest he choke. Let him recite the confessional that is customary “But we have sinned,” and this is the quintessence of the Confessional. Transgressions, even though he has confessed them on the Day of Atonement and he is yet within a state of penance, them he confesses on another Day of Atonement, as it is written, “For I know my transgression: and my sin is ever before me” (Ps. 51:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 86b.</i>

For through his confession the sinner will not be shamed, as it happened with Rabbi Meir, “It happened with a certain woman who came to the academy of Rabbi Meir that she said to them, “One of you betrothed me with intercourse.” Rabbi Meir stood up and wrote a divorce document and gave it to her and so did all.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 11a.</i> And he who confesses for others is able to say, “We have sinned,” and to include himself with them because all Israelites are guarantors for each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 39a.</i> And if he saw people sinning and did not reprove them he should confess even though he did not sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 54b.</i> And when he confesses let him recall all of his sins as they are.

This is the path of the upright with their steadfast hearts, but the gentiles with their uncircumsized hearts are not so,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 79a.</i> and their wrath is kept forever.

If someone has sinned against his neighbor and the neighbor dies before extending forgiveness, he (then) brings ten people, places them on his grave and says before them, “I have sinned before God, the God of Israel and against this individual to whom I have done such and such,” and if he owes him money he returns it to his heirs, if he does not know who the heirs are, let him leave it with the court and confess.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Kamma 103a.</i>

Siman 27

Do not say that one need not search his ways and repent but from transgressions which entail action, such as robbing, unchastity, stealing and the like. But as the individual must withdraw and repent of these, so must he search out evil thoughts and repent of them, such as anger, enmity, jealousy, mockery and pursuing gluttony and the like. Of all these he must repent. And these are more difficult than transgressions which possess action. For when a man is habituated in these, it is difficult to withdraw from them after he has become sunken and accustomed to acting. Concerning this it is said “Let the wicked forsake his ways” (Isa. 55:7).

Siman 28

This is the instruction to one who repents with all his heart with all his soul and with all his might in order to cleave to his Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rokeah,</i> ed.

And as soon as one comes to purify himself he is helped from Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 104a.</i> If a man experiences unchaste thoughts about a certain woman during his prayer or other impure fancies, let him dig his thumbs into the earth and let him “hang his body upon them”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 18a.</i> and not lean against a wall and this will dispel the impure fancies. If he is sitting and is unable to rise because of people let him dig his thumbs vigorously into the earth. If a man is in the bathhouse or in a polluted place and thoughts of love possess his heart, or a woman passes before him, let him meditate on matters of Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh,</i> “Orah Hayim,” 85:1.</i> because Torah is good to purify the heart of its evil inclination.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 30b.</i> Even though it is permissible to meditate on Torah everywhere except in the bathhouse and privy, nevertheless to withdraw a man from transgression it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 40b.</i> And let a man avoid coming to nocturnal pollution by not drinking more wine then is suited, because it afflicts his heart and turns him aside from God, as it is written, “Harlotry, wine and new wine take away the heart” (Hos. 4:11). And if a transgression presents itself to him, let him pray with all his heart to his Creator that He rescue him. And if the individual were to be visited with tribulations he would presently fast, cry and pray to his Creator, all the more so should a man pray to his Creator that He rescue him from transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 71b.</i> And let a man not acquire for himself a prosecutor on the Day of Judgement.

Siman 29

If an individual stood steadfast in a meritorious deed let him not boast of it saying, “How pious I am.” But rather let him offer praise and thanks to the Lord, praised and exalted be His fame, Who has rescued him from sinning before Him, who has it in His power to incline the heart to all that He desires, as it is written, “ The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the watercourses” (Prov. 21:1). And he says, “and I also withheld thee from sinning against Me” (Gen. 20:6). Each one who wishes to return in repentance and achieve a status of piety and fathom the depths of God’s law, the depths of His glory, let him not enter (attempt to do so) except if he be discerning and a soul of goodwill without anger. Let him forsake converse with people and playing with children,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 3:14.</i> also converse with his wife except during coitus.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hagigah 5b.</i> And let him be as careful in the observance of a light command as a more serious command,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 2:1.</i> and on guard to rise before an elder even a hundred times.

Beware, watch your soul lest you be captured in the domain of the evil inclination, lest it thrust you aside from the land of the living.

And if thou doest not well sin coucheth at the door.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 4:7.</i> And you, son of man, return to your Maker with all your heart, and set your heart aright with Him who tries your mind.

Siman 31

At all times you should love your Creator with all your heart and all your soul and take counsel with your heart and a lesson from man who is but worms; if a person gives you ten gold pieces or more, how deeply engraved would his love be in your heart. And if he provides your support and the support of your children and of your household you would certainly think, “This man which I have never seen and who has extended to me such kindness I would not be able to repay for all the goodness he has shown me should I live a thousand years. I would love him with all my heart and with all my soul; he could not command me to do anything that I would not do for him, because both my wealth and my being are his.” As with the love of man so with the love of the Holy One, blessed be He, raised and exalted be His fame. It is He who gives sustenance to all, how much better that we should cleave to the love of the Creator, fear Him, nor transgress His commands whether great or small. For we do not know the reward of each commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 2:1.</i> and the punishment for transgressions though they appear light in our eyes, as it is written, “When the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about” (Ps. 49:6). The transgressions to which a man becomes habituated in this world will encompass him on the Day of Judgement.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah 18a.</i> If he is deserving his good deeds will bear witness for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2a.</i> True and firm it is that we are not to transgress the commandments of our Creator even one of the small ones for a house full of gold and silver. If an individual says, “I will transgress a commandment and with the gold and silver they give me I will fulfill the difficult commandments. With this I will support the poor, invite wayfarers, I will do very many favors.” These are all futile thoughts, for perhaps soon after the transgression he will die and not succeed to the gift. Moreover, if he should not die the money would soon be dissipated so that he dies in his sin. Come and see how much you should love your Creator who does wonderful kindnesses with you, He creates you from a decayed drop, He gives you a soul, draws you forth from the belly, then gives you a mouth with which to speak, a heart to understand, ears to hear the pure words of His mouth, which are refined as silver and pure gold. It is He who leads you on the face of earth, who gives sustenance to all, who causes death and gives life to all. In His hand are the souls of all the living. It is He who distributes your share of bread. What is there to say? for the mouth is unable to speak, the ear unable to hear, for to Him all praise is as silence, there is no end to the length of His days, His years will have no end, He is the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be His name and His fame. It is He who has created the heavens and earth, sea, and all that is therein. He is the provider of all, for His eyes are open upon all men’s paths recompensing each according to his ways and the fruit of his deeds, whether good or bad. Behold it is He who sets forth before men two paths, the path of life and the path of death and says to you, “Choose life” (Deut. 30:19). In spite of all this, we who are filled with worms do not think and do not set our hearts but to fill our appetites freely. We do not think that man’s days are numbered,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Job 7:1.</i> today he is here, tomorrow in the grave,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 28b.</i> that suddenly he dies. For no man rules over his spirit<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the breath of life, actual breathing.</i> retaining it (forever). Therefore it is good for man to remove himself from all appetites and direct his heart to love and fear the Lord with all his heart at all times and to revile the life of vanity. For we will not be able to humble ourselves and subdue our passion which thrusts us from the land of the living, except through subduing our heart and returning to our Maker in complete repentance, to serve Him and to do His will with a whole heart. Our sages have said, “Bread and salt shalt thou eat and water in measurement shall you drink <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 6:4.</i> and beware of gazing at women which drives a person from the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:28.</i> Love humans<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:12.</i> and judge all people in the scale of merit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:6.</i> And this is what the Torah has said, “ But in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor” (Lev. 19:15). Be humble before all, busy yourself with Torah, which is whole, pure and upright and do not praise yourself for it, because for this were you created.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2:9.</i>

Siman 32

Each man who loves virtue, loves reproofs, loves reprimands, loves acts of charity, invites the wayfarer and recites his prayers with devotion, such a man, even if his dwelling be outside the Holy Land, will not be visited with the afflictions of the grave.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">According to Jewish folklore after the body is placed in the grave it is subjected to violent and painful afflictions.</i> And even the judgement of Gehenna he does not see.

And we who serve the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, how much more should we rejoice and be zealous in the service of the Holy One, blessed be He.

And since this sinner injures himself when he turns from the good path, eschewing the good and choosing evil, he therefore needs to cry and wail for that which he has done to his soul. His reward is evil, and this is as it has been written after it, “Wherefore doth living man complain, a strong man because of his sins” (Lam. 3:39). Come and see how numerous are the afflictions, the fasts and the supplications entreated when his son or one of his loved ones is sick, for then his heart is bitter. So much the more must he afflict himself and mourn when he commits a transgression. Repentance returns his soul to two worlds.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This world and the next.</i>

“May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaketh proud things!” (Ps. 12:4).

Gossip, which knows no limit, see how powerful it is, and let us take a lesson from the “spies.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">They were sent by Moses to search out the Holy Land. (See Numbers 13 and Deuteronomy 1:22.)</i> Even when one slanders wood and stones, which do not hear and see, there is concern for their shame, so much more when one slanders his neighbor who is created in the (divine) image and likeness, “What shall be given thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue” (Ps. 1:23). The Holy One, blessed be He has said to the tongue, “What shall I do to you? All of man’s limbs are from without, you are within. Moreover, I have made for you two walls, one of bone and one of flesh; of bone, the teeth; and of flesh, the lips.” “In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression” (Prov. 10:19). A man should always increase (his) silence <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides, Hilkhoth Deoth, 2:4.</i> and not speak at all, except (to indulge) in the words of the wise or in matters necessary for the needs of his body. It has been said of Rav, the student of Rabenu (Judah) the Pious, that in all his days he never indulged in idle talk.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 19b.</i> All who indulge in ordinary talk transgress a positive commandment as it has been said, “And shalt talk of them (Deut. 6:7) and not in other matters.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> And (we know) that a prohibition which has been derived by implication from a positive command is a positive command.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 56b.</i> Others say, he violates both a prohibition and a positive command, as it is said, “all things toil to weariness; man cannot utter it …” (Eccl. 1:8).

Also let him teach his student with composure and quietness, without shouting or lengthiness, for “the words of the wise (are) spoken in quiet” (Eccl. 9:17).

Siman 35

He who speaks and is concerned only with his own words and does not consider God<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lit “Searcher of kidneys.”</i> Who knows his thoughts, his very coming and going Who counts his steps and before Whose glory and power his words are laid, as it is written, “Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? Saith the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth? Saith the Lord” (Jer. 23:23); this man is not on a good path. For the nature of man should be to think of his Creator continually and to place Him before himself, as it is written, “ I have set the Lord always before me” (Ps. 16:8). When a man sits in solitude, wherever he may be, let him empty his mind of all vain matters and think only of his Creator, of His holiness and wonders and of His favors which He does for us each day. But when a despised man concentrates on idle things or hears vain matters, even though he does not intend to speak, immediately he turns his thoughts to idleness<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 149a.</i> with loss to himself for each and every good thought which (rightfully) should be thought of his Creator’s holiness and of His fear so pure. He should be in that good, pure and exalted station to worship God for love and desire of His commands. And this is the grand worship that the ministering angels and the hosts of heaven, who declaim His holiness, employ as it is said, “Holy, holy, holy” (Isa. 6:3). Therefore one needs to be careful and not multiply idle talk lest he forget the Lord who is always before him, as the seeing before the blind (so is He) with His presence and strength in all places. And this blind man is one who does not see except through his vain thoughts and does not remember the Lord and removes himself from the standard of truth and fear of Him. For it (fear of God) is not found in his heart because of the hardness of his heart, which is calloused and distant from God, in his mind are found only vain thoughts. Therefore he is not present in the Divine Mind, only through difficulty and force. As the blind person cannot perceive or apprehend the person who is before him if he does not touch him or hear his voice, so too an individual cannot learn and bind God in his heart permanently unless he forsake transgression. For transgressions divide and darken fear of the Lord and change one’s countenance<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed. Horeb. Genesis, Chapter LXXIII, p. 158a.</i> and so he says, “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God” (Isa. 59:2).

In the fullness of silence there is reverence.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh,</i> “Orah Hayim,” 1:1, note Isserles.</i> He who fears God, obeys Him, sees Him, knows Him and searches for Him and is silent because of his fear, is the one who adds to (His) reverence. But if he heightens and raises his voice he diminishes reverence, for he forgets that he stands before God as a blind man who stands before a king. He multiplies words without fearing him, because he does not see whom to fear. He who increases silence because of reverence will not soon come to sin.

Siman 37

“The fear of the Lord is clean” (Ps. 19:10). There is no equivocation. A person who finds an occasion to sin (in a situation) where there is no cause to fear others or risk of being shamed and does not permit himself to sin because of fear of God, reflects the essence of reverence. And if he has done so many times, but once succumbed to his evil inclination and did sin, he does not forfeit his other merits. Let neither his hands nor heart weaken from continuing to do good.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 31b.</i> But if he regrets and is sorry for his previous deeds he receives no reward for his troubles in subduing his evil inclination initially. Concerning this it is said, “But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity” (Ezek. 18:24) none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered.

Siman 38

“Keep thy tongue from evil” (Ps. 34:14) when you reprove your neighbor guard your money.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The translation is dubious.</i> He whose words exceed his wisdom, his words will be upon him. He whose wisdom exceeds his words, let his words be with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gabirol, <i>Choice of Pearls,</i> ed. Phillipawski, p. 17.</i> This means, he whose words and reproofs of others exceed his understanding, that is to say, he is neither wise nor understanding enough to do as he says and his understanding does not prevail upon him to act in accord with his good words, his words will disgrace him. For listeners will say to everyone, “These virtues for which he reproves us, he himself lacks; he preaches well but does not act as well.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 107b.</i> But one whose wisdom exceeds his words, who does not reprove excessively, but only according to the dictates of reason, wisdom, conduct and the loftiest virtues which are within him, his words will be with him, that is to say, the virtues for which he reproves others will be for him an honor and adornment. Listeners will say, “All this wisdom and discipline of which he speaks can all be found in him.” This is to teach you that silence is better than excessive talk. For the increase of silence redowns to one’s honor and grace, but excessive talk is a disgrace and shame. Of necessity, he who studies the book of Hasiduth and wisdom will try to act to the extent that he is able to understand, and will not aspire to understand merely to know a book. Merely to relate wisdom serves no purpose for the one who does so, it does not endure except with the one who absorbs it and only then is it of use to the one who relates it. Another explanation of “his words exceed his understanding,” is that he says more than is appropriate for him in light of his (own limited) wisdom and understanding. Solomon has said, “Overbearing speech becometh not a churl” (Prov. 17:7), then his words will rule over him and he will be caught in their hands. “He whose understanding exceeds his words,” i.e., that his wisdom is greater and in excess of his words, is virtuous. From his abundant wisdom he governs his spirit and does not bring words forth except in keeping with his judgement and understanding. His words will be heard, that is to say, they are his and in his possesssion, as “My beloved is mine and I am his” (Cant. 2:16).

Siman 39

“A time to keep silence and a time to speak” (Eccl. 3:7) (refers to) when they revile, curse him and say ignoble things (about him), there is (then) to be no reply. “And a time to speak,” also refers to when they speak in matters of Law, then is not a time to keep silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin 89a.</i> (Another interpretation) also “A time to keep silence,” is not to reprimand those whom you know will not accept reproof in the slightest matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the preferred reading.

Siman 40

“May, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day” (Ps. 44:23). These are people who suffer insult and shame because of the commandments. For when one tells a person it is foolish to fulfill the commandments of fringes and phylacteries and the like, his blood spills as water because of the shame. Scripture regards this as if he had been murdered because of it. One who shames another is regarded as a murderer<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 58b.</i> and it (sin) withholds him from performing a meritorious deed. This is what Scripture has said, “That make a man an offender by words” (Isa. 29:21) and it has been said, “Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach” (Ps. 69:8). “Still greater is the effect of shame,” our sages have said, “in the case of one who commits a sin and is put to shame by it, he is pardoned for all his transgressions.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 12b.</i> For it is said, “That thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth anymore because of thy shame when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord, God” (Ezek. 16:63).

Siman 41

If not for “shame,” which God created, no one would be free of transgression. Proof of this is that it is more common to murder a person openly than to sleep openly with a woman, even (one’s) own wife. For anger is found in each person, the great, small and elderly alike; but the evil inclination is found only in youths, but not in the small, elderly or the weak. And those youths whose evil inclination overwhelms them are not let off therefrom except because of shame.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 80b.</i> Therefore an individual cannot boast if he has done good and has not sinned since in his youth he was restrained by his parents or by his shame; therefore even if in later life he avoids sin, let him not boast, since he had initially recoiled from sin because of shame.

Secondly, that he forsake them. Thirdly, that he confess them in his heart.

Also he needs to single out the sin, as it is written, “O, this people have sinned a great sin and have made them a god of gold” (Exod. 32:31). And so should he confess, “I pray Thee, O God, I have sinned, I have done perversely, I have transgressed before Thee, I have done such and such, I am sorry I am ashamed of my deeds. And I give witness concerning myself, He who knows all hidden secrets, that I am resolved in my heart not to return to do this again.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta d’Rav Kahana</i>, ed.

Four groups do not receive the Divine Presence:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah 42a.</i> a group of liars; a group of hypocrites; a group of gossipers; a group of scoffers; and all are referred to in Scripture. “A group of liars” (is denied the Divine Presence because it is stated) “He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before Mine eyes” (Ps. 101:7). And also in the wars of Ahab, when he came and asked the prophets if he should go out and do battle, the spirit of Naboth came before God, and he said: “I will go forth and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said: etc…. ‘Go forth’” (I Kings 22:22). And our scholars explain this to mean, “Go forth from my precincts.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 102b.</i> “Hypocrites” (are denied His presence as it is written), “A hypocrite cannot come before Him” (Job 13:16). “Those who relate evil gossip” (are denied His presence), for it is said, “For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; Evil shall not sojourn with Thee” (Ps. 5:5). Evil (doers) shall not sojourn with you nor enter your precincts. “Scoffers” (are denied His presence) “The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight” (Ps. 5:6). People who are scoffers confound the world. “Evil gossip,” (includes also that which is) intended to dishonor his neighbor, even though it be true.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides, Commentary on Aboth, Chapter I, p. 16.</i> Even if it becomes a (popular) by-word, it is ignoble to indulge in its use. If one has spread an evil report about his neighbor or has disgraced him with reviling matters of which he had never been suspected and which no one had anticipated (but which were apparently true), the sin of the person who has revealed it is not atoned for, because he cannot set aright that which he has perverted, nor undo the disgrace caused his neighbor, and this is what Solomon said in his wisdom, “Lest he that heareth it revile thee” (Prov. 25:10). And so is it taught in the Jerusalem Talmud,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">J. T. Baba Kamma 8:7.</i> “He who sins against his neighbor, and then repeatedly goes and asks for his pardon, but his neighbor does not respond, let him form lines of people and pacify him before them. This is what is said, “He cometh before men and saith, ‘I have sinned’ against so and so and behold I repent.” And if he does so, he redeems his soul from death, for it is written after that, “So He redeemeth his soul from going into the pit” (Job 33:28). Rabbi Jose said, “This is said concerning one who does not spread evil reports about his neighbor, but if he does there is absolutely no forgiveness.” If he inflicts pain on an individual it is as though he inflicts pain on the entire world, for everything that is in the world is in man.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> (Berlin: Horeb Publishers, 1924), Pekuday, p. 344.</i> If he spits before him but the spittle does not reach him, he is free from judgement in human law, but guilty under divine law.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Kamma 90a and 91a.</i> Even if he inflicts a small measure of pain he will be punished at the hands of the Lord for each and every hurt which he inflicts upon his neighbor, for it is said, “That for all these things God will bring thee into judgement (Eccl. 11:9) concerning every hidden thing” (Eccl. 12:14). And our rabbis elucidate,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Hagigah 5a.</i> “What is meant with ‘concerning every hidden thing’?” This refers to one who kills vermin before his neighbor and disgusts him thereby, others say it refers to one who spits. Therefore all the God-fearing and righteous through whom the Holy One, blessed be He, does not cause any stumbling, let them be cautious to forgive immediately those who kill vermin or spit or do anything repulsive so that there be no stumbling through them (the righteous ).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Megillah 28a.</i> It is reported of a certain pious man that he covered all the spittle that he found in a place where he knew the offender to be a Jew and would forgive him (the offender). He covered it so that another would not come, see and be disgusted by it, and not pardon the offender, with the result that the offender stumbles thereby. And it is good to follow this procedure.<br/>“Whether it be good or whether it be evil” (Eccl. 12:14), this ending passage they interpret to mean one who gives charity to the poor publicly.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hagigah 5a.</i> For this deed he stands in judgement because he embarasses the recipient. Also, one who gives charity to a woman privately, brings upon himself suspicion, for it is said, “Then ye shall be clear before the Lord and before Israel” (Num. 32:22). Moreover, he causes those who suspect him to stumble and be punished because of him, because those who suspect the innocent are flogged.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 19b. The Soncino translation reads: “Whosoever suspects good folks will suffer (for it) on his own body.”</i> How do we know this? From Moses our teacher, who said, “But behold they will not believe me” (Exod. 4:1) immediately he became leprous.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 97a.</i> Moreover others will not accept his reprimands, but will say to him, “You do such and such, and you are reproving us!” Therefore the supervisors of charity should not burden the poor man to work without pay, except for a meritorious deed, because the poor man fears them, moreover, he derives profit from them; also that the congregation should not suspect him (the supervisor) saying, “He (the supervisor) gives a greater portion to this one (poor man) than to the others so that he (poor man) should perform services for him,” and the Torah says, “then ye shall be clear” (Num. 32:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 38a.</i> “From every evil thing” (interpreting verse “whether it be evil” in Eccl. 12:14) refers to causative matters which a man causes deliberately, and inflicts pain on his neighbor, for this he is punished. Those who steal, take or conceal a thing which causes grief to the owner who must seek it, transgress a prohibitory law.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh,</i> “Hoshen Mishpat,” 348.</i> And so our scholars interpret,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 61b.</i> “Ye shall not steal” (Lev. 19:11) in order to vex or to cause (another) pain.

Our scholars also expounded, “In that day Saith the Lord, I will smite every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness” (Zech. 12:4).

All your actions should be for the sake of heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 2:17.</i> Let a man not eat nor sleep with the intention of being healthy and fattened in order to engage in matters of this world and to pursue wealth. He should rather say, “I will sleep and I will eat in order that I may be able to stand in fear of my Creator and engage in His Law and commandments.” <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">J.

Let him not act as one who does something because of habit and recites (blessings) without the heart’s meditation. For this reason God’s anger is kindled in His people and He sent us His servant Isaiah and said, “For as much as this people draw near, and with their mouth and with their eyes do honor Me, but have removed their heart far from Me and their fear of Me is a commandment of men learned by rote” (Isa. 29:13). The Holy one, blessed be He, said to Isaiah, “Isaiah, see the works of My children, and know that it is all for appearances sake only. They hold fast to Me as a person who holds fast and follows the usage handed down to him from his father. They come into My house and pray in accord with the fixed prayers like the customs of their fathers but without a whole heart. They cleanse their hands and recite the blessing for the washing of the hands, they break bread and recite the blessing over the bread, they drink and bless (only) because the matter is fluent in their mouths, but at the time that they bless, their thoughts are not to bless Me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh ha-Shanah 28b.</i> It is for this reason that His wrath is kindled in Him and He swears by His great name to destroy the wisdom of His wise men who know Him and bless Him (only) out of custom but without devotion, as it is written thereafter, “Therefore, behold, I will again do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the prudence of their prudent men shall be hid” (Isa. 29:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed.

The rule of the matter is let a man pursue the golden mean of each and every idea<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides, Hilkhoth Deoth, 3:1.</i> until his thoughts are directed toward that mean. This is what Solomon said, “And let all thy ways be established” (Prov. 4:26). A man should not say, “because jealousy, lust and ambition are evil and cause man to be removed from the world I will try assiduously to remove myself from them (jealousy, lust and ambition) to the opposite extreme.” And (if) he does so, so much so, that he does not eat meat, drink wine, reside in a suitable dwelling, or wear appropriate clothing, except sack cloth, hard wool and the like, as do Christian priests; (let him know) this too is an evil course and one is forbidden to pursue it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanna debe Eliyahu,</i> ed.

Also he should not forbid himself through oaths and vows matters that are permissable.

How so? A man sins because of monetary matters, or because of his honor, or physical pleasures, woe to the sinner, for they (heavenly powers) will punish him for the sin that he commits. Similarly, if he merits and remains unconcerned with the pleasures of his body, wealth, or honor, they (heavenly powers) reward him with the very matter which he foregoes. For the king Solomon did not ask for his own perfection either in matters of wealth or ambition, but only in wisdom and understanding, to do his Creator’s will,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 3:11.</i> and the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him both, even that for which he did not ask.

What sort of murder is it that is not observed by the eye yet the punishment for it is very great, the transgression is light but regarded as very serious in heaven. It is “shame” and (this) refers to one who puts his neighbor to shame publicly <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 58b.</i> or causes him to suffer in the presence of another before whom he is pained with embarrassment. It is as though he murdered him, because the other would surely suffer death rather than be so humiliated. One who shames his neighbor but later grieves and repents and is willing to receive punishment and comes before one who is God-fearing to find a way to repent, let them say to him, “Know that your evil is great, that you shed the blood of your neighbor.” For so we find with Abijam, the son of Rehoboam, who reproved Jeroboam and shamed him publicly and was stricken dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">J.

And the meek do not retaliate insult for insult, nor do they reply. They are joyful in the afflictions of their meekness. And if fools shame you saying, “Remember your former deeds,” say to them, “I know that I sinned greatly and I did many things unbecoming, but the Lord will forgive me.” Endure those that shame you measure for measure, (if you insult them and then they insult you) for in this way will you expiate for your sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 12b.</i> If his sin, involving unchastity, was made known to the public, because of this shame<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh,</i> “Orah Hayim,” 138, see Baer Hetev, note 3.</i> let him not refrain from studying those laws that deal with unchastity.

“Happy is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in His commandments” (Ps. 112:1).

These things a man should ponder, let a man not serve his Creator in order to inherit the Garden of Eden,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre,</i> Deuteronomy, 11:13.</i> but rather out of love for God and His commands, (knowing) that He created him and loves him.

“Thou shalt not utter a false report” (Exod. 23:1).

They will relate to the other man the evil talk that this one spread about him, and he too will come to quarrel with him. The result is that the quarrel comes about through you because you did not listen to him. But if he tells others because he intends to spread an evil report about him, neither oblige nor listen to him. Rebuke him and dismiss him with anger. Go to them, to whom he had spoken and say, “Do not believe him, he speaks falsely about his neighbor.” And when you speak about a man or woman don’t relate the bad, tell about their good deeds. Do not praise a man in the presence of his enemy,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Tosafoth, Abodah Zarah, Chapter I.</i> because he cannot bear to hear a good thing about him.

And so if you hear a man invoke God’s name, for example, he wishes to relate what the Holy One, blessed be He, did for him for the good, namely such and such, do not jump and interrupt him. He may become silent in order to listen to your words and will speak no further about his matters.

“Therefore remove vexation from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh” (Eccl. 11:10). And this is the best and most exalted of all the virtues. When you hear a man or woman say about you or against you something unfitting, put your fingers in your ears, for thus the scholars said, “Why are the fingers of a person shaped as pegs? So that if a person hears something which is not fitting let him place his finger or the lobe into his ear and not listen at all.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ketuboth 5b.</i> All the more, if you hear a man speak about his neighbor or a woman speak about her neighbor, where one cannot refute at all, since it is not your concern, shut your ears and do not listen as they revile each other. It is best for you to rule your own spirit and restrain yourself. Put a seal on your mouth without ever shaming your neighbor. Even if he relates about your father or your mother matters that are unbecoming do not answer unworthily, rather set his teeth on edge and say to him, “You do not tell the truth,” <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 14b.</i> and do not say another thing either great or small.

“But thou shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord” (Lev. 19:14). This is the great principle of the Law.

Do not become involved in another’s quarrel, for what concern is it to you. And so did the sage say, “Do not express an opinion in a matter which is not your concern.” For in favoring one you will be condemning the other, and in a person’s absence, 3 you cannot act in his behalf to his disadvantage and so did Solomon say, “He who meddles in a quarrel not his own is like one who takes a passing dog by the ears” (Prov. 26:17).

Do not shame your brother when he speaks conceitedly of matters that the mind cannot grasp and it is easy for you to topple him from his arrogance and seize him in his words.

Do not punish an Israelite, nor curse him<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 10a.</i> but pray for him that the Holy One, blessed be He, make his heart whole and return him to right conduct. Do not invoke judgement on him saying, “The Lord should avenge me from his hand and visit evil upon him according to his wickedness.” For he who invokes divine judgement upon his neighbor, the attribute of justice comes before the Holy One, blessed be He, and says, “Lord of all the Universe, shall we then acquiesce to his request? he is deserving to be punished for such and such.” The conclusion of the matter is do not curse anyone for very often all curses return and fall on one’s own head and children, as in the case of David, we find that all the curses with which he maledicted Joab were fulfilled in his own children.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 48b.</i> Do not hate your neighbor because of the love of your friend who hates him.

Do not bring yourself to a light transgression for it will bring you to a more serious one.

Love to say “perhaps,” and hate to say “so what.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Derekh Eretz Zuta, Chapter I.</i> This means, love to say “perhaps, if I say this thing,” or “(perhaps) if I do,” or “(perhaps) if I go to do or see this thing,” or “(perhaps) if I hear this thing, or sweet songs,” or “If I go for a stroll, perhaps it will cause me to sin.” Let it be loathsome to you to say, “of what harm is it to tell of news and listen to vain matters as I please, I will not come to sin.”

“Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife” (Exod. 20:14). It is written without a <i>vav</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Scriptio defectiva.</i> do not cause yourself to be coveted. It is a warning not to beautify himself in order to find favor in the eyes of his neighbor’s wife and instill his love and attractiveness in her heart. You should not appear desirable to your neighbor’s wife. Another rendition, “Thou shalt not covet,” one should not praise a pretty woman in the presence of his friend lest he pursue her and it will be his (the one who praised) sin. This is to say, you should not make the wife of your friend desirable to others.

There are two thoughts that are man’s day and night, thoughts about women, and thoughts about money,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Bathra 164a.</i> and because of them he gives his life. There are other thoughts, envy, enmity, haughtiness, the appetites, the enjoyment of his children, the yearning for sons and women, the entertainment of friends, strolls and the most current banal matters.

If a man asks your advice and you can advise, lead him in the upright way that appears in your eyes to be the will of God, but not according to his way which is against God’s will.

Don’t take advice from one whom you suspect. He might advise you in a way he truly thinks best for you.

“For this let everyone that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found” (Ps. 32:6). Our scholars expounded,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 8a.</i> “In a time when Thou mayest be found” refers to a woman. He prays that the Holy One, blessed be He, should ordain for him a good wife, “But a prudent wife is from the Lord” (Prov. 19:14). The custom of the world is that a man follows after a woman, as it is said about Ahab, “Whom Jezebel, his wife, stirred up” (I Kings 21:25). It happened with a certain pious man who married a completely righteous woman but in time he gave her a divorce. He then went and married a wicked woman, a daughter of iniquity, and his former wife married a completely evil man. As a result, the pious man left his virtues and became transformed through the advice of his evil wife; the wicked man, through his wife, repented of his wickedness and became a completely pious man. Therefore every God-fearing man will not take advice from his wife involving the performance of commandments <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 59a.</i>because her eye is grudging, even if she is God-fearing. Pray tell, who is greater in fear of God than Sarah, our mother, yet in spite of it all when Abraham said to her, “Make quickly three measures of fine meal” (Gen. 18:6) she prepared to use coarse meal, until he told her fine meal. And from this the scholars explained we learn that a woman’s eye is grudging when involving guests, more so than a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 87a.</i> But in matters of the world, if your wife is small, bend down and whisper in her ear.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 59a.</i>

“But the name of the wicked shall rot” (Prov. 10:7). This refers to scribes who add words, delete or lose words, also those who seek to allude to their names by means of acrostics.

“In all thy ways acknowledge Him” (Prov. 3:6). Let every God-fearing man, when angered because of transgressors, weigh his anger, so that his mind is (remains) settled.

He who lost commentaries, a book of the Pentateuch or of the Writings or Prophets and started to write another, but when half completed the first one was found, it is then prohibited to write on the remaining half any other matters, even if it be rabbinic laws, for this will then be regarded as the main text and the bible portion as secondary.

One does not decree two bans in one day, as it is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 45b.</i> “I will not again curse anymore … neither will I again smite anymore” (Gen. 8:21). It is written in the Twelve Minor Prophets, in the book of Malachi (3:6) “For I, the Lord, change not” and near to it is written, “Ye are cursed with the curse” (Mal. 3:9) which has the numerical value of “ban.” And it is written “Trouble shall not rise up the second time” (Nah. 1:9). We do not decree a ban except during the day, for it is written “And cursed his day” (Job 3:1) “Cursed be the day” (Jer. 20:14).

“Bring ye the whole tithe into the storehouse etc.… And try Me now herewith” (Mal. 3:10).

“For anger resteth in the bosom of fools” (Eccl. 7:9). Anger is very bad and of necessity one must remove himself from it to the opposite extreme.

Because of her fear for him, he will engage in coitus with his wife during menstruation or she will cook for him on the Sabbath. If he is accustomed to have a light kindled in his night-chamber before the Sabbath and she forgets to put it there, out of fear she will kindle it on the Sabbath.

God created three things in man: ears, eyes and tongue. Ears to hear with, eyes to see with and a tongue with which to speak. These are the means through which a man’s activities are performed. If he did not have ears he would not hear vain matters. There are numerous transgressions which he commits which come about as a result of hearing. He hears that somewhere there is a woman, or money that he can steal. If he did not have eyes he would not gaze at indecency and lust for it and for numerous other things. If he did not have a tongue he would not speak evil or commit other sins of vanity which result from the tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">J. T. Shabbath 1:2.</i> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He prepared for each and every one of these faculties, a fence and wall for their separation to remove the individual from transgression. For the ears He prepared fingers which are shaped as pegs, also the broad earlaps to plug them and serve as a fence for the hearer lest he hear something sinful.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ketuboth 5b.</i> He prepared eye-lids to cover his eyes from seeing evil. And for the tongue, He prepared two walls; a wall of bone and a wall of flesh, to keep him from speaking evil or any other transgression. And puny man, when he turns his ears to hear and his eyes to see for purposes of transgression and his tongue frames deceit, what does he do? He breaks the fence of the King of the World. (And so) many sinners were thus punished. Take a lesson from a man who breaks the fence (law) of a king of flesh and blood, his sentence is death. How much more is he doomed when he breaks the fence (law) of the King of the World who appoints him as watchman. Concerning this it is said, “And whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him” (Eccl. 10:8).

“Thou art near in their mouth and far from their reins” (Jer. 12:2).

Nor is the rod of God and His awe upon them so that they might be able to restrain themselves and not utter evil.

There is a pious individual whose heart eagerly pursues the will of his Creator. He does not increase his good deeds as does the wise pious man who is instructed by his teacher and is therefore (also) wise. The reason why the good deeds of the other are not many is because he is not instructed by a teacher. However, if he did know (receive instruction) he would fulfill (his share of good deeds), because they have said, “A man should always be deliberate (schooled) in the fear of the Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 17a.</i> Behold, one who has not learned, his heart is not like a sponge to absorb learning, and even if he has a teacher, behold, his heart is closed and at time disarrayed, he is unable to understand and know. And we find in the Torah that any one who is able to understand (what is proper to do) even though he was not commanded, is punished if he did not take the matter to heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Moses Maimonides, <i>Guide for the Perplexed,</i> trans. M. Friedlander (reprint of 1st ed., 1881-1885; New York: Hebrew Publishing Co.), Part 3, Chapter XVII, p. 73.</i> For it is written, “And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousand, and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. And Moses said unto them: ‘Have ye saved all the women alive?’” (Num. 31:14). Why did they not answer him, “Why then did you not command us? You did not tell us to put the women to death.” But Moses knew that there were wise men and experts able to argue a conclusion a <i>minori ad majus</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Reuveni</i> (Warsaw: Levin and Epstein Publishers), Numbers, Chapter II, pp. 118-119.</i> If with the Caananites where it is written “Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth,” “That they teach you not to do etc.…” (Deut. 20:16-18), and it is written, “For he will turn away thy son from following Me” (Deut. 7:4), lest he cause you to sin in the future, (they are to be put to death) these who have already sinned and caused others to sin is it not a matter of course that you should have argued a conclusion <i>a minori ad majus</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 68a.</i> (that they be put to death). Similarly, when the angels said to Balaam, “Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass” (Num. 22:32), why did he not reply “What transgression is it that I hit my ass.” Even the prohibition not to cause pain to a live thing does not apply. She did not buckle because of the load (but because of an angel that blocked the road). Also when she squeezed his leg why should he not hit her? Because he should have reflected, “Perhaps it is without the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, that I curse them. He permitted (me) only to reveal to them the future, for it is said, ‘If the men are come to call thee’ (Num. 22:20), you should tell them of the future.” The Holy One, blessed be He, saw that he (Balaam) would rejoice if he were allowed to curse Israel, and this is what is said, “I have sinned for I know not that thou (angel) stoodest in the way against me” (Num. 22:34). (And yet) on the contrary the reverse stands to reason, because he did not know that he (the angel) stood opposite him he did not sin. However, he said thus, “I sinned because I did not take the pains to know, I did not examine and search into the roots of the (my) transgression.” From this we learn that a man should be deliberate in the fear of the Lord since he is punished because of his ignorance. He must know and investigate, for in the presence of the Ruler you will not be able to plead inadvertence, as Shimei was unable to say to Solomon, “ I forgot that I went out to the river Kidron.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 2:40.</i> It is for this reason that I said I will write a book for those that fear God lest they think that they are being punished without cause. Heaven forfend, attributing evil to God “For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness” (Ps. 5:5), and it is written “Warn them from Me. When I say unto the wicked: O’ wicked man thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn … the righteous he shall surely live… but thou hast delivered thy soul” (Ezek. 33:7-9). The seven warnings correspond to the (seven) abominations of the heart: “There are six things that the Lord hateth, Yea seven which are an abomination unto Him” (Prov. 6:16); and to, “Seven times more for your sins” (Lev. 26:18). “But thou hast delivered thy soul” (Ezek. 33:9), mark that he does not say “thou hast ‘merited’” or “vindicated” but rather, “thy soul hast thou ‘delivered.’” From this we learn that anyone who has a friend that is being punished and he does not warn him and say to his friend “do not do so,” all the punishment visited upon his friend is attributed to him as if he personally killed his friend, because he should have warned him but he did not.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 55a.</i> Moreover, we exact from him the blood of his friend, concerning him it is said, “His blood will I require at thy hand” (Ezek. 33:8). For this reason have I prepared this Book of Reverence so that those who fear the word of God be circumspect. And furthermore my son be admonished,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 12:12.</i> (beforewarned) if I have been mistaken let the wise man set it aright and understand in order to fear God all of the days in truth.

The beginning of wisdom is fear of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">(Perush.) This is the preferred sequence.

So did the rabbis say, “That which also honors him in the sight of mankind.” <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 2:1.</i>As you advise others so do for yourself. The beginning of wisdom is to acquire wisdom. When your son reaches the age of learning, acquire for him a teacher who is a scholar, and God-fearing, for it is written “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (Prov. 1:7). This is to introduce him to the fear of the Lord. In addition, from all firstlings give Him, “The first of all the first fruits of everything, and every heave offering of everything” (Ezek. 44:30). So too, give Him the beginning of the day and night (in which) to bless Him for that which man enjoys day and night.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">J. T.

And concerning the hands which were initially in a state of uncleanliness with the spirit of uncleanliness prevailing over them,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 77b.</i> in order that you not be harmed, wash your hands. Similarly do not put your hands to your eyes until you wash them. Our scholars instituted blessings for every activity. It happened with a certain pious man who recited a blessing for each and every limb and Scripture supported him “My heart and my flesh sing for joy unto the living God” (Ps. 84:3). And it is written, “All my bones shall say, Lord who is like unto Thee” (Ps. 35:10), and he prayed for all of the limbs that were created part of him that they serve Him who created them for His glory and that they not sin against Him. For the Holy One, blessed be He, puts into the heart of the good that they (do) not sin against Him, nor that sin be brought about through them, for it is said, “There shall no mischief befall the righteous” (Prov. 12:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 120a.</i> Good and evil inclinations can serve beneficent ends with the righteous.

That person who has the ability to do everything that his heart desires, and it is possible for him to do it without risk of shame, he need not be so cunning in the matter. But where the power is not within him to do that which the heart desires, because of so and so and because of someone in such a matter, then he must be cunning so as to make the desires of his heart such that this other matter does not harm him. Since all of these matters involve depth of wisdom and great exertions which are found in those who lust, and are jealous and pursue honor, (therefore) he who fears the word of God sees how they search and lurk to fulfill their lusts which are momentary and questionable of achieving, and they hurl their souls from the distance, so much the more (let him apply this tenacity to himself) myself.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">“I need to be cunning.”</i> “But I will be hallowed among the children of Israel” (Lev. 22:32) refers to those who are slain in Sanctification of the Name,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra,</i> ed.

The <i>kof</i> in the verse from Isaiah begins the quotation and is the initial letter for the word “all.” The <i>kof</i> in medial form appears in the last word which concludes the quotation from Deuteronomy. Here again the word is “all.”</i> (Isa. 9:4) for the entire world is judged measure for measure for it is said, “because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Lord shall send against thee in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things” (Deut. 28:47). And all who have mercy on the cruel show no mercy to the merciful. A man who is obliged to have mercy upon others, such as his sons, his daughters, his brother and his near ones, and they are in need and he is able to feed them but does not, behold everything that he possesses will come into the hands of others and he will receive for this neither merit nor credit.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., into the hands of his sons, daughters, and relatives.</i> Even if he supports others, but knows that his father, mother and brothers are poor and does not support them, in the end these others that he supports will deal cruelly and mercilessly with him; they will become his enemies and not consider it as a favor the kindness that he did with them. For there is a matter for which a person receives no merit if he does it, but if he does not do it, it is regarded as evil. For instance a man and his wife who love their children and they possess the means for their support and have mercy upon them, behold this is no merit or righteousness<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Ketuboth 50a.</i> because out of love they do this for them, as in the case of dogs, bears and all animals who put their lives in danger to bring prey to their offspring.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 49a.</i> If parents do not support their children or if they strike them unnecessarily or show no mercy to them or never admonish them and their offspring have nothing, the parent’s transgression is grave. Therefore a father who does favors for some of his children and reviles others and does no good for them, him that he loathes will be his heir.

If you see three generations or more, one after the other, all scholars, but then their children are illiterate, do not say that the words of the scholars are voided because they said, “‘Thy words shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed’ (Isa. 59:21), thereafter Torah will no longer cease from among them.” <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metziah 85a.</i> Behold they have become wedded to a family whose destiny is not to have scholars in its midst,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed.

And if you see that in the fourth generation the God-fearing and pious cease, it is then apparent that they intermarried with those to whom they were not suited, for instance he is not God-fearing or pious, therefore the generation is such.

Behold “fear” is prior to “all they that do thereafter” i.e., “The fear” of God and “love …” “to walk in all His ways” (Deut. 10:12). “A good understanding have all they that do thereafter” (Ps. 111:10), “That ye may make all that ye do to prosper” (Deut. 29:8).

<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The first three of the eighteen verses dealing with God-fearing are missing.

(3) Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord (Prov. 2:5).</i> “The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, pride, arrogancy and the evil way, and the forward mouth, do I hate” (Prov. 8:13). “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the All-holy is understanding” (Prov. 9:10). “The fear of the Lord prolongeth days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened” (Prov. 10:27). “He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord, but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth Him” (Prov. 14:2). “In the fear of the Lord a man hath strong confidence and his children shall have a place of refuge” (Prov. 14:26). “The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death” (Prov. 14:27). “Better is a little with fear of the Lord, than great treasure and turmoil therewith” (Prov. 5:16). “The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor goeth humility” (Prov. 5:33). “By mercy and truth iniquity is expiated and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil” (Prov. 16:6). “The fear of the Lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied, He shall not be visited with evil” (Prov. 19:23). “The reward of humility is the fear of the Lord, even riches, and honour, and life” (Prov. 22:4). “Let not thy heart envy sinners, but be in the fear of the Lord all the day” (Prov. 23:17). “Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the Lord, and depart from evil” (Prov. 3:7). “My son, fear thou the Lord and the king, and meddle not with them that are given to change” (Prov. 24:21). “Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised” (Prov. 31:30). Behold there are eighteen forms of “fear” corresponding to the eighteen forms of <i>Trefa</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin 42a. <i>Terefah,</i> Lit., torn.

And because life is dependent upon eighteen points in the body man is called “living”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Numerical value of the Hebrew word “living” is eighteen.</i> for as long as there is no injury to them (eighteen points) he is able to live. Moreover, “eighteen fears” correspond to the eighteen points<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin 42a.</i> upon which life is dependent, for if you fear the Holy One, blessed be He, He will guard your life and this is as it is said, “The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death” (Prov. 14:27). When Abraham wished to take the life of his son Isaac, he was then called God-fearing, for it is said, “for now I know that Thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son” (Gen. 22:12). The “eighteen fears” correspond to the Eighteen Benedictions of the Silent Prayer. And if you say, what of the verse, “A wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool behaveth overbearingly and is confident” (Prov. 14:16) where the blessing of the Lord does not occur, there is, however, the blessing against the heretics.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">“Fear” in Proverbs stands in apposition to the blessing against the heretics in the “Eighteen Benedictions.” This makes for Nineteen Benedictions! See Daily Prayer Book, ed. Hertz, p. 143.</i> (And if you ask what of the verse) “Who so despiseth the word shall suffer thereby; But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded” (Prov. 13:13), (it is) in apposition to the first blessing of the Eighteen Benedictions which commences with “Blessed be He.” Why are these “eighteen fears” made to correspond with the Eighteen Benedictions, for when a man prays, he must stand in fear,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 30b.<br>/8/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 29b.</i> for it is said “Serve the Lord with fear, And rejoice with trembling” (Ps. 2:11), and it is written “They shall fear Thee while the sun endureth” (Ps. 72:5), which our Rabbis explained (to mean) “pray at the setting of the sun.” Moreover, why as against (in apposition to) “Fear of the Lord” does it state “Blessed is the Lord,” (it is to say) that he should not run in prayer as if (to show) he is happy that he is finished. But with every word and everything that he says let him concentrate to put devotedness into his heart. One should consider, if there is a matter to entreat and ask for of a king of flesh and blood, would he favor you or countenance you if you hurry your words before him? Let alone would he not do your bidding, but he will say that you can mean only to mock, and he would drive you away. Do not regard the Crowner of kings less than the kings who are beneath Him. If you come to praise and adore Him, consider this for a moment, if you were to hear a sweet voice and song of praise rushed and hurried without intonation, how acceptable would it be? Therefore it (prayer) is not to be done hurriedly, but with deliberation and a sweet and loud voice, for it is said “And many shouted aloud for joy” (Ezra 3:12). It is said<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">J. T. Berakoth 1:1.</i> that when they walked in the temple court they walked heel to toe so that the worship of the Lord not appear as a burden. Concerning this it is said “And their course is evil and their force is not right” (Jer. 23:10). Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, created the cock’s crowing that we learn a lesson from him, for it is said, “And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven” (Job 35:11). You would not be proper if you spoke before a king of flesh and blood, and your words were hurried, and if you sang for your pleasure you would prolong your voice, how then can you hurry before the supreme King of kings. You should therefore bless Him with your voice, and not make it as a chore that issues from your mouth. It is only right that when you utter words of supplication you say them in an entreating manner, for it is said “The poor useth entreaties” (Prov. 18:23). When a man entreats a ruler he does not hurry his words but on each matter he concentrates so as not to be mistaken with his words. Before he entreats a ruler or king he sets forth his petition orderly<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh ha-Shanah 35a.</i> that he not falter nor forget nor skip a letter. So should you do, for it is written, “Will thy riches avail, that are without stint” (Job 36:19), and he says further, “Take with you words” (Hos. 14:3). When you recite blessings and praises, make it as though you stand before a king and he says to you, “Let me hear your voice.” Do not hurry your words and do not be anxious to speak. If you need sustenance, do not put your heart only to that blessing such as the blessing of “years.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Daily Prayer Book,</i> ed. Hertz, p. 141.</i> If you have an illness do not set your heart only to the blessing for “illness,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, p. 140.</i> because they (will) say about you on high, “This individual imagines that he has need only of this.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Erubin 65a.</i> Therefore let him (a person) be devoted in all the blessings. For behold the “eighteen fears of God” should be before him and he should be reverent of all the blessings. Do not direct your thoughts only to the supplications, for the essence of devotion is for the blessings and praises. They therefore said,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 34b.</i> let him direct his heart toward all of them. If it is impossible let him direct himself to the blessing of <i>Ovos</i> or toward the blessing of “thanksgiving.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Daily Prayer Book,</i> ed. Hertz, p. 148.</i> For if you direct yourself only to the (personal) entreaties there will be a hindrance from above,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 44b.</i> it will be said that it is not proper to accept his prayer, for with the honor of the Lord he is not concerned to seek Him with devotedness and with supplication. How can we do his will if he is concerned only with his own welfare and not in adoration. Therefore it is good to pray and to direct oneself with joy and honor to the Holy One, blessed be He, to pray with devotion and not to speak to anyone before completing the service but recite those things that initially subdue the heart with mercy. And when you pray add in each and every blessing your request in keeping with the nature of the prayer <sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 29b.</i> for they do best to prepare the heart. If you cannot add because the congregation already finished (the prayer), add in only one or two in order that you do not hurry in another blessing. You may add as we have outlined in the Order of Supplication.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>S. H. Bologna,</i> Section 171.</i> If you cannot add, search out for yourself other melodies and when you pray recite them (the prayers) in that melody which is pleasing and sweet in your eyes, in that melody recite your prayers and recite your prayers with devotion and let your heart be drawn after that which comes out of your mouth. For a matter of request and entreaty select a melody which prepares the heart. For praise, a melody which rejoices the heart, in order that your mouth brims with love and joy for Him who sees your heart. And you are to praise Him with broad love and rejoicing. All of those things prepare the heart.<br/><i>Lamed,</i> why is this letter called <i>lamed?</i> Because of the verse “That thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word “to learn” shares a common root with the letter <i>Lamed.</i></i> (Deut. 14:23). For this reason David indicated with the letter <i>lamed</i> the teaching of fear “Come, ye children, harken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord” (Ps. 34:12). Why does he say “children”? Because one who studies in childhood is not like one who learns in his old age. A son whose father led him in good deeds from his early years onward is like one who is accustomed to travel in a wilderness and is trained to find his way to the city. Similarly, he is like one who is accustomed to go by ship on the sea and knows how to direct the ship to the desired harbor. But he who does not know how to go, will go hither and yon, for it is said, “For he knoweth not how to go to the city” (Ecc. 10:15). And again, one who learns in his early years is likened to the sun, moon, stars, and zodiac, for they go in an upright path as it is said, “But they that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might” (Judg. 5:31). And this is as it is said, “But unto you that fear My name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings” (Mal. 3:20). Therefore it is said, “Come, ye children, etc.… I will teach you the fear of the Lord” (Ps. 34:12). This is the teaching of the secret of fear. The letter <i>lamed</i> is larger than all the letters,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Height-wise, <i>lamed</i> is taller than all other letters.</i> for the discipline of fear is greater than all, for it is said, “O, that they had such a part as this always, to fear Me etc.…” (Deut. 5:26). Behold before him is the greatest of all, therefore <i>lamed</i> is greater than all the letters and its name is greater than all and it is written, “Happy is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in His commandments” (Ps. 1:12).

“Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars” (Prov. 9:1). These seven passages in Scripture have coupled in them wisdom and reverence.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Each contains references to wisdom and God-fearing.</i> And these are them, “And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord” (Isa. 11:2). “And the stability of thy times shall be a hoard of salvation—wisdom and knowledge, and the fear of the Lord which is His treasure” (Isa. 33:6). “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a good understanding have all they that do thereafter” (Ps. 111:10). “And unto man He said: ‘Behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding’” (Job 28:28). “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but the foolish despise wisdom and discipline” (Prov. 1:7). “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the All-holy is understanding” (Prov. 9:10). “The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor goeth humility” (Prov. 15:33). Behold there are seven passages relating to wisdom and reverence for the Lord corresponding to the seven matters that are evil for the soul and draw her to sins, for it is said, “There are six things which the Lord hateth, Yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him” (Prov. 6:16). Moreover, the seven correspond to seeing, hearing, speaking, working with one’s hands, going on one’s feet, cohabiting, plotting evil in one’s heart. They also correspond to seven movements in man: standing on one foot; moving hands and feet; standing on knees; sitting and lying in four positions: i.e., on two sides (left and right), leaning on the head or on the face. Another interpretation of “seven organs,” (is that it applies to) eyes, ears, a mouth to bring forth words, a throat to bring in food and drink, hands, feet, genitals, these are “She hath hewn out her seven pillars.” “Hath builded her house” (Prov. 9:1), for all of them (organs) depend upon the chamber of the heart <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">J. T. Terumoth 8:4.</i> which leads wisdom to contain and restrain his spirit in the fear of God. Concerning the seven transgressions wherein I wrote that the heart is their master, there are corresponding to them seven groups which receive the Divine Presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed.

For this reason David entreated Him, for it is said, “Make one my heart to fear Thy name” (Ps. 86:11), and it is written, “And renew a steadfast spirit within me” (Ps. 51:12).

If you withstood a great test still do not be confident of yourself until the day of death,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 2:5.</i> to say, “Since I did not sin in this great matter, I will no longer sin.” Because the evil inclination today is not the same as yesterday, therefore perhaps in the very same matter (test) tomorrow you will be unable to endure. Behold David did not sin with Abigail<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Megillah 14b.</i> but he sinned with Bathsheba, David did not sin with his pursuers who sought to kill him<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Berakoth 62b.</i> and did not raise his hand upon the annointed of God and did not give permission to Avishai to strike him,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He allowed no one to strike Saul.</i> but in the end he did sin with Uriah, who sought his (David’s) wellbeing.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 56a.</i> But if you say, “I can believe in myself since I was rescued from a great transgression,” then you hold yourself more righteous than those on high. Not only that, but you regard yourself and your wisdom superior to Him who created you, for it is said, “Behold, He putteth no trust in His holy ones” (Job 15:15), “And His angels He chargeth with folly” (Job 4:18). If the Holy One, blessed be He, who knows what the future will be, does not trust His angels and His holy ones, you, with your thoughts changing from good to evil all the more that you should not be confident in yourself, and thus it is said, “Happy is the man that feareth always” (Prov. 28:14) that he not sin. “Lamed,” signifies “Your heart, fill it with understanding,”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>lamed</i> is used as an acrostic. The “l,” “m” and “d” serve as the first letters for each of the three words that comprise the passage.</i> to know the fear of the Lord, and it is written, “ Teach me good discernment and knowledge … teach me Thy statutes” (Ps. 119:66-68).

There was an incident with a young woman who would not adorn herself. They said to her: "Whoever will see you will not take you for a wife  because you do not adorn yourself" She replied: "Just because the Holy one Blessed be He is engaged in matchmaking - I do not worry about it." And it came to pass that she was taken for a wife by a Torah scholar who was a tsadik.

One should not travel with a wicked person neither on the same road, nor on the same ship lest he be damaged on his account. Don't hang around with a wicked person who causes damage to many (neither on a road nor on a ship) as is written "... So that you won't perish because of their wicked deeds" (Bemidbar 16:26)

Siman 399

If a simple person unintentionally made profit in a prohibited way because he got deluded by his heart (without intent) - he shouldn't mix it with his (other) money as is stated "Will you even destroy the righteous with the wicked?" 

Siman 400

One man who gambled with his fellow with dices won and the one who lost went and stole a wooden piece used for playing like one called "tsahekes shkeki" and the like... Thereafter he went forth and won off the sum he previously lost. (Later on) he posed the question whether any guilt lies on him (for what he had done). The answer he got was: "One who steals from a thief tastes a taste of theft himself. Furthermore (the very actions of yours) proved that you got despaired  of your money. However where one saves his property from a robber it is allowed for him to take immediate legal action on the spot (and this is how you should have acted)".

Siman 401

Anyone who lends money to rulers who engage in libels - it is as if he robs Israel because if he lends it the ruller might tell him "Give me back my security and believe me (even without it) And if not I'll go capture a jew!". And it can end up with the ruller making an oath (in the name of idolatry).

Siman 402

A person should always weigh money or count it prior to giving or taking it even though (his partners) are trustworthy because it may come to pass that money will be partially lost without one's knowledge or another person will take it in the interim. It comes out that if one doesn't weigh or count money in the first place - they might come to suspect each other in stealing (in case something is missing).

There was one man in a village who needed a willow branch and he didn't find so beautiful a willow branch as in a yard of idolatry by water. A wise person said to him: you'd better take the one which is not so beautiful rather than that beautiful one from the yard because you will not find grace (if you take the latter).

Siman 439

There was not much water in one town in order to suffice for immersion however that place was broad and attractive for jews to settle there. A wise person said to them: "For the reason that thieves use that water - it is not proper for women to immerse there. And if one happens to immerse in that water knives or metal or glass utensils - it's not good to recite a blessing to G-d's name".

There was an incident involving a gentile who was sitting with a sad countenance. His fellow said to him: "Why are you so bitter?" He returned: "I saw in a dream a rider on a red horse that was standing by an elevated platform". The fellow replied that this means that he will speedily pass away on a bed. The dream reader asked him that if he gives him to drink he will buy off his dream from him. He said: "I shall give you to drink on condition that my dream will be sold off to you." And his fellow accepted it whereupon the man give him to drink." On the next day the dream reader died. One man was deathly ill where another one was making fun, so he said "Sell me your disease and give me such and such" He said: "I will give it to you". Immediately this one rose up and this one took ill and died.

There is a night when the souls come out of their graves, like on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, when they come out and pray. And two people already went and hid themselves in the graveyard and heard that one was calling to her friend: Let us go and pray together! All of the souls came out and prayed and asked for mercy so that death would not be decreed upon the living, and those who will die that they return from their evil ways, and that they die through minor illness, and about every matter of the living and the dead; and about themselves, to quickly remove judgement from upon them and from upon others - and they told their congregation. The next year on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, two others went and only one virgin didn't come out of the grave, who had died last week. They said: Come out! She said: I cannot, because my father was rich and lost his possessions and buried me without clothing. And they heard that some of the souls said we will not gather together because two have already revealed us to many. Rather, each one of us will pray in the grave, so that the living will not hear and tell the nation. And they became angry at the father and took clothing and clothed that virgin. And when a shroud decays it does not hold back the soul for behold despite body's decay the soul rests in the bones although it departs from dead body as is known that (sorcerers) who raise a spirit bring it by means of dust that absorbed from the dead. It happened that one man didn't see his head's shadow on Hoshana Rabbah's night, so he and his loving ones fasted numerous fasts and gave a lot to tzedakah and lived many years after that as is said "Tzedakah saves from death".

When a man is young and desires to marry a woman, he will then think about the improper thoughts and the grief from which he suffers; so he will think that when his sons will reach that age, he will have them marry. For it will give them grief to go without a wife. And sometimes he does not have the ability to do this; he should pray to God that He find him matches at the  right time for all of their needs and betterments. Behold our teacher Moshe married a convert, when he saw that he could not go back to Egypt. And why were Peretz and Zerach born to Yehudah by way of a sin, even though Tamar was fit for him? It was because he caused Yosef to be sold, so that he did not marry a woman until he was thirty years old, it being because he was placed in jail. And since Yehudah caused it that he not find a wife until he was thirty, that is why David did not reign until he was thirty. Another explanation: "From tearing my son (Yosef) you arose" (Genesis 49:9) - you did not kill Yosef (you prevented his death), and caused him to become great when he was thirty. That is why David reigned when he was thirty.

Great in power we did not find Him, meaning He did not overburden Israel with mitzvot. And if you will object "How about regulations about theft and forbidden sexual relations?" (The answer is) even if these laws were not written down one would have to keep them, otherwise the world would not be able to stand, for behold, rams and roosters wedge battles for females, so would people kill each other for this matter. And so a father should not command his son to perform an exacting or tiresome task, likewise a teacher should not act in the like manner towards his student lest they fail to accomplish the task and it will come out that (father or teacher) caused him to sin. And so a father should not leave to many possessions as inheritance to his son unless he does so for Heaven's sake.

And even if for Shimon it is fine whereas for his family it is an embarrassment - Ruben should not let Shimon honor him.

That's why it is better that one prays in the language he understands.

It once happened that a certain hasid asked the question in a dream “who will be my neighbor in the World-To-Come? And it was shown to him a certain man in place two days journey away. So he got himself ready and went to search out and find the man. When he got close to the place of the man he asked about him, and the whole world wondered why the Hasid would want to see such a villainous man. This made the Hasid sad, but still, he went to the house of the man. When the hasid arrived, the man came out of his house incredibly angry and struck the hasid on his face, and pulled down the hasid’s pants. The man said to the hasid, “Enter if you like.” And the man and his friends mocked the hasid. The hasid payed no attention and entered the room adjacent to the bordello. That night all the prostitutes of the town entered the room next to where the hasid was and drank wine until they became intoxicated, and the man danced before them all night until they passed out. The hasid saw all of this and cried. The next day the hasid prepared to return home, but before he left he asked the man, “On your life, tell me if you have ever done good in your days, because I saw in a dream that you are sitting next to me in the Garden of Eden, yet you do all of this licentiousness. How can it be that you will sit with me? The man said to the hasid, “All that you I have done that you have seen is for the good. I only make it appear that I am licentious, I offer prostitutes a higher price to come with me, and they think I will spend the night with them when they are drunk, what’s more, I tell my mother to come in at night and pull me out by the hair, so if the prostitutes ask, ‘Why did you not sleep with us?’ I can reply, ‘You know that my mother beats me.’ And this is how I prevent licentiousness among Hebrew women.

There was an incident: one jew traveled to a distant place and saw in a night dream another jew whom they weighed on heavenly scales: he was put on one side of the scales whereas his sins were put on the other side. As a result his sins outweighed and they said to him that seeing that his sins outweighed he has no portion in the World to Come. After that came in another ones and said: "You didn't weigh correctly!" And they put on that man fox skins and other skins so the man outweighed and they declared that he does have a portion in the World to Come. The man who saw this in his dream thought that the man was alive whereas in fact the man whom they weighed was already dead by that moment. They said: those skins that were put on him were the ones he gave as a tax as is written: "... (I will make) your rullers righteousnes (Yeshayahu 60). When a congregation sees fit to impose a tax and one gives it in good faith - it is thought to be a tzedakah for them. An as for the body that they weighed it is written: "You were weighed on the scales and found wanting" (Daniel 5). Alternative explanation: ... in the merit of the fact that he strived with his body to perform good deeds.

But if he is <i>goses</i> and says that he is unable to die until they put him in another place – they must not move him from there. Even though they (the Rabbis) said: “A <i>goses</i> person – they must not move him from his place”,  if there is a fire, they must not leave him in the house, and they must take him out.

A town in which two people passed away - they first take out the first one lest they be unable to take care of both of the two simultaneously. If all this happens on Friday (which is Shabbos eve) they don't prolong eulogizing the first person lest they be unable to engage in burying the second one during the day. And if there is a concern that the second one will swell and burst - they should burry the second one first.

The Holy one blessed be He judges a man only together with upper host and if you will object that our sages of blessed memory said: "No one judges alone, but He'' - one can answer that this refers to judging a nation or a king. And if The Holy one blessed be He pronounces verdict there's no one to retort as is written: "He is one and who will answer him" (Yov 23:13)

Siman 1166

The Serpent was walking on two and he had semblance slightly similar to that of a man. You should know that those who are able to turn a man into a wolf, a cat or a donkey - his eyeball does not change and so the serpent who underwent a change - his eyes did not change. Therefore one who miscarried and the fetus had a form of a snake - the mother is ritually impure as one who gave birth because his eyeballs are similar to those of a man.

A sinning soul will perish and repentance helps but does not fully annul decree but rather pushes off tribulation so that it will not hasten to come and so repentance is effective for soul to bring her to the World to Come
