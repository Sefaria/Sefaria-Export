Sefer Chasidim



Siman 1



Siman 2

And so said the author of this book, the one who compiled the words of piety, humility and fear, each of them present in the book that I have contemplated and comprehended due to my mentors and teachers, because it is proper for all G-d fearing people to instruct their offsprings and students and all People of Israel as to how to fulfill the Will of our Creator, blessed be His Name and extolled be the mention of Him. And so are the teachings of His words: to describe Him using attributes relevant to those of a human of flesh and blood in order to penetrate human hearts of flesh to make it understood to the human ear, open their unseeing eyes and make their uncircumcised hearts comprehend. And so it is stated in the Torah: "His voice is like that of multiple waters... Hashem like a lion shall roar". And so He would appear to His creations: "His eyes like doves..." and the like... "His legs like pillars of marble..." - and all this only in order to make it understood to the human ear.

It is forbidden to tear clothes or break vessels in anger because he who breaks a vessel in his anger it is as if he worships idolatry for such is the way of the evil inclination: at first it tells you to do thus, and the next day it tells you to go and worship idols and one goes and does so.

If suddenly a mitzvah comes your way - rejoice, praise and give thanks to the Holy One, Blessed be He for the fact that He directed it your way for you to perform it.

Siman 101

A person shouldn't inscribe notes on a holy book because it has holiness to it whereas they have not and all the more so one shouldn't brush his hair even over a part of it.

Siman 102



Siman 103

Never should a person rely on miracles fot it is possible that they won't perform a miracle for him and even if they will - could be that they'll diminish his merits on account of this. Greater is merit of the one who is handsome and overpowers his evil inclination than that of the one who is not (handsome) for (the latter) is not (well) accepted amongst women.

"Do not be overly righteous" (Ecclesiastes 7:16). If there is a woman drowning in a river and you have the means to save her, do not say, "I will let her drown because how can I go and see her nakedness?" Do not ruin yourself, be considered sinful, and be punished for it. Go and learn from Saul, who spared Agag and made a foolish argument a fortiori, and because of this he was condemned. Likewise, "one of the students of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of God, 'Strike me, please,' and the man refused to strike him" (I Kings 20:35). Because of this, he was punished, and a lion struck him and killed him.

If you are arguing with a wise man don't be distressed if he took the upper hand because he possesses scholarship and thus you add to your knowledge. If you take the upper hand what will you gain? However if he won the argument you only gained because now you know what you didn't know before this.

And so that your heart should not trouble you when you see or examine what we are about to write here, and you might say, “These are not words of piety, but merely superstitions,” do not let this thought arise in your heart, and do not be misled into thinking this way. For this book is called Sefer Chasidim (The Book of the Pious), and its name reflects its true nature.
I will begin by saying that in a person’s limbs, the Holy One, Blessed be He, has engraved all of a person’s actions and experiences. Through the subtle sensations of one’s limbs, one’s Creator informs them daily of what is destined to happen. From one matter, you can learn many things, as it is written:
	•	“He counts all my steps” (Job 31:4).
	•	“Then those who fear the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and think upon His Name” (Malachi 3:16).
From here, we learn that every step a person takes is counted, and it is decreed upon them how many steps they will take.
Know that this is true: even though divination is forbidden, signs do exist. However, one must not speak of these signs to others, lest they fall into practicing divination.
For example, if a person feels an itch on their foot—as if a louse has bitten them—but they scratch it willingly and without any wound appearing, and then the itching stops, they should know that they are destined to travel to a place they did not expect. This applies particularly to someone who does not usually travel.
	•	If a person’s ears itch, they will soon hear something new.
	•	If the skin over their eye itches, they are destined to see or read something new that they have never seen before.
	•	If their tongue itches, they will soon speak of something new.
	•	If their eyebrows itch, they will soon see men or women they have not seen in a long time.
	•	If their forehead itches, people will be watching them and will desire to see them.
	•	If their palms itch, they will soon receive new money—silver or gold.
	•	If their nose itches, they will soon become angry.
	•	If an area beneath their eyes and near their nose itches, their eyes will shed tears.
Thus, every sensation in the body signals a forthcoming event. And who causes all of this? It is the Holy One, Blessed be He, who reveals to a person, through their limbs, everything that is about to happen to them.
A person must understand that everything is decreed by God—how many steps they will take, how many people they will see, how many sights they will witness, how many deeds they will perform, and what they are meant to do. Similarly, it is decreed how many words a person will speak. Every action of each limb, whether for good or for bad, is recorded.
Regarding the heart, it is decreed how many thoughts will arise in it involuntarily and how many thoughts will be intentional—whether for good or for bad, as it is written:
“I, the Lord, search the heart and examine the kidneys” (Jeremiah 17:10).

Siman 163

If you defeat your friend, do not rejoice. It is better to be defeated than to be the one who defeats, for one who defeats their friend in this world will be handed over to the defeated one in the World to Come.

Siman 164

A person who was traveling by ship or in the desert, and the rest of the people were saved while he was not, or they were saved and he was lost, he is being punished while they are not, and it is fitting that his sins be reduced. If the suffering a person endures is equivalent to his sins, then his sins are atoned for, and his merits remain intact, for sins are not exchanged for merits, as no transgression extinguishes a mitzvah. However, this applies only if the suffering he endures is not due to a transgression, such as seeing a woman and suffering because she is not his, as his eyes have caused him this pain. Additionally, there is shame in pursuing her, for perhaps she does not want him, or he fears she will expose his shame to others. The same applies to the suffering of a thief who is ashamed before people, or suffering caused by sins that he refrains from due to fear of people, yet his heart desires them; in such a case, his punishment is even greater. But if he accepts his suffering for the sake of God, such as refraining from enjoying time with his children, hearing them cry while his wife raises them, and he suffers from their crying yet does not respond because he is engaged in Torah study and does not go out to walk with his children, for this suffering he will receive reward, and the suffering of Gehinnom will be reduced for him. The same applies to suffering from a bad wife when he does not sin, poverty when he does no wrongdoing, suffering from bodily afflictions or the death of loved ones, or suffering for the pain of his enemies or others. All of these are counted in his favor as substitutes for the suffering of Gehinnom, balancing out his sins, as it is said (Isaiah 40:2) “For her iniquity has been pardoned,” and it is written (Isaiah 40:2) “For she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.” However, there are sins for which, even though one is punished in this world, he will still be punished in Gehinnom, such as Jeroboam, who caused others to sin, for whoever leads the public into sin has no share in the World to Come, as do those who prevent others from attaining merit, such as the sons of Eli in this world.
And if you ask, since it is written (Exodus 20:5), “He visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and fourth generations,” then why did the punishment of the sons of Eli extend for many generations? After all, Rabba and Abaye lived many generations later, and moreover, they did not persist in the sinful ways of their ancestors. Rather, if a person sins once, punishment is exacted from him for four generations. If he repeats the sin or commits a different sin, punishment is exacted for eight generations. If he sins three times or commits three different sins, he is punished for twelve generations. The sons of Eli sinned multiple times, increasing their guilt, and so their punishment extended through many generations. And if you ask why should the sin affect the righteous descendants who did not follow in their ancestors’ ways, an even greater question arises. For it is said, “One born on Shabbat will die on Shabbat,” but what sin did the child commit that Shabbat was desecrated for his birth? After all, they said, “You are born against your will.” Rather, they explained that idolatry brings punishment before and after, just as they expounded from the verse, “And he pursued them until Dan.” All the more so, this applies to goodness that a person does, that it has effects before and after. If the child later becomes righteous, why did his future merit not retroactively prevent him from being born on Shabbat? Similarly, why did the merit of the righteous descendants of the sons of Eli not retroactively prevent the original decree against them, and the same question applies to all people from the first man. And further, if they did not persist in the sins of their ancestors, why are they punished? Because it was said, “The righteous who suffers is a righteous person, the son of a wicked person,” but he does not follow in his ways. Rather, if there is a righteous person who benefits from his father or covers up for him, he is like one who robs for the sake of his children, and it is possible that his children will bear his sin. But if the father committed a different sin for his own bodily pleasure, and there is no way to say that he did it for the sake of his child, then why should the children receive punishment? After all, they said, “One who has relations with a non-Jewish woman, his children will not become Torah scholars.” And if he sinned, what sin did his children commit? You must therefore understand that every person merits for his children in five ways, as they said, “One who honors Torah scholars,” etc. Therefore, when a wicked father rejoices, his children are led to stumble. Why did Rabba and Abaye, who were descendants of Eli, die young? Because a decree had been issued, and unless they had great merits, they would not be saved, even though they were personally righteous. As it is said (Ezekiel 14:19), “Or if I send a plague upon that land and pour out My wrath upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast—Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it—by My life, says the Lord, they would save neither son nor daughter; they would save only themselves by their righteousness.” Thus, even the most righteous can only save themselves. As it is written, “My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they did not harm me, because I was found innocent before Him.” Unless a merit is found, even if one has not sinned, it will not help. And so, Jeremiah was commanded not to take a wife and not to have children in that place, because a harsh decree had been issued to kill the sons and daughters, fathers and mothers. And Jeremiah did not say, “But I am righteous, why should my children not live?” Rather, when a decree has been issued, unless there is great merit, they will not be saved. Therefore, do not be surprised about the generation of the flood and the people of Sodom, where even the small children died. What sin did they commit that they perished? But it was a decree, that unless there was overwhelming and great merit, they would not be saved, even for their own sake.

"Do not move your fellow's border, as the first ones bordered" (Deut. 19:14) — that they established the melodies, that one not use the Torah melody for the prophets or writings, or the prophetic melody for Torah and writings, or the writings melody for Torah or the prophets. Rather, every melody is as it was established, for it is all a law given to Moshe from Sinai, as is said (Ex. 19:19) "answered him in sound."

Siman 303

One does not recite a verse over a wound. One who recites over mandrakes, forbidden. One who comes and recites a verse over his son who is frightened and terrified, and wants to give him a book or tefillin so he can sleep, forbidden. But isn't it taught that they would sing the Song of Afflictions in Jerusalem? Rabbi Yudan said, in one case, before he was hurt; in the other, now that he was hurt. What is the Song of Afflictions? The "LORD, how many are my oppressors" psalm (Psalm 3), "Sitting in the shade of the Highest" to "for You, LORD, are my refuge; you set the Highest as your abode" (Psalm 91:1-9).

There was an incident with a young woman who would not adorn herself. They said to her: "Whoever will see you will not take you for a wife  because you do not adorn yourself" She replied: "Just because the Holy one Blessed be He is engaged in matchmaking - I do not worry about it." And it came to pass that she was taken for a wife by a Torah scholar who was a tsadik.

One should not travel with a wicked person neither on the same road, nor on the same ship lest he be damaged on his account. Don't hang around with a wicked person who causes damage to many (neither on a road nor on a ship) as is written "... So that you won't perish because of their wicked deeds" (Bemidbar 16:26)

Siman 399

If a simple person unintentionally made profit in a prohibited way because he got deluded by his heart (without intent) - he shouldn't mix it with his (other) money as is stated "Will you even destroy the righteous with the wicked?" 

Siman 400

One man who gambled with his fellow with dices won and the one who lost went and stole a wooden piece used for playing like one called "tsahekes shkeki" and the like... Thereafter he went forth and won off the sum he previously lost. (Later on) he posed the question whether any guilt lies on him (for what he had done). The answer he got was: "One who steals from a thief tastes a taste of theft himself. Furthermore (the very actions of yours) proved that you got despaired  of your money. However where one saves his property from a robber it is allowed for him to take immediate legal action on the spot (and this is how you should have acted)".

Siman 401

Anyone who lends money to rulers who engage in libels - it is as if he robs Israel because if he lends it the ruller might tell him "Give me back my security and believe me (even without it) And if not I'll go capture a jew!". And it can end up with the ruller making an oath (in the name of idolatry).

Siman 402

A person should always weigh money or count it prior to giving or taking it even though (his partners) are trustworthy because it may come to pass that money will be partially lost without one's knowledge or another person will take it in the interim. It comes out that if one doesn't weigh or count money in the first place - they might come to suspect each other in stealing (in case something is missing).

Siman 431

When one comes to make windows for his house, he should not make them across from the abominations. Since when he opens [them], he appears as if he is bowing. Moreover, it is since he is always turning towards the idolatry, and it is written (Leviticus 19:4), "Do not turn to the idols." And a synagogue should not have a window that is open across from the idolatry, nor should [holy] books be placed in the window across from the idolatry. 


Siman 432

'In all of your ways, know Him.' If the door is across from the idolatry and the door is low, such that he must bow his head, he should not bend but rather turn his face backwards or turn backwards or to the side, so that he not appear as if he is bowing to the idolatry. And likewise, if he encounters an officer or the king in front of an idolatry, he should not bow down to him, as it appears as if he is bowing to the idolatry. Rather he should position himself so as not to bow across from the idolatry. There is a story of a certain sage, whose name was Rabbi Yitzchak Chasid, who would never enter a house of idolatry. At the time of his death, they were taking him out to the cemetery in a cart, and there was an idolatry at the gate of the city. So the horses fled against the will of the chariot [driver], and they they took the cart through a breach in the city wall which formed [only] a little before his death. And there were excavations around the city, but they exited from the excavations and went on a straight path [to the cemetery]. And it was because he was careful during his life, as he did not want to enter into a house of idolatry, that the Holy One, blessed be He, made it that the protective wall ruptured. 

Siman 433

There is a story of a man who would sell the priests their jewelry for the house of worship. And when he died, it was the day that they bring their images, so the uncircumcised ones brought them in front of his bier. So they said that what happened to him was measure for measure (poetic justice).

If a person was in a synagogue and saw through a window a house of idolatry or an idol or a graven image - he should place something in the window in order to block their view.

Siman 438

There was one man in a village who needed a willow branch and he didn't find so beautiful a willow branch as in a yard of idolatry by water. A wise person said to him: you'd better take the one which is not so beautiful rather than that beautiful one from the yard because you will not find grace (if you take the latter).

Siman 439

In one city, there was not much water for immersion, but the settlement was a spacious and desirable place for Jews to live there. The sage said to them: "Since there is no water there except the water that thieves are tested with and the priests invoke their idolatrous names upon, it would not be proper for women to immerse in it. And if knives, metal utensils, and glassware are immersed in those waters, it is not good to recite a blessing in God's name over them, as they have invoked the name of idolatry upon those waters."

There was an incident involving a gentile who was sitting with a sad countenance. His fellow said to him: "Why are you so bitter?" He returned: "I saw in a dream a rider on a red horse that was standing by an elevated platform". The fellow replied that this means that he will speedily pass away on a bed. The dream reader asked him that if he gives him to drink he will buy off his dream from him. He said: "I shall give you to drink on condition that my dream will be sold off to you." And his fellow accepted it whereupon the man give him to drink." On the next day the dream reader died. One man was deathly ill where another one was making fun, so he said "Sell me your disease and give me such and such" He said: "I will give it to you". Immediately this one rose up and this one took ill and died.

There is a night when the souls come out of their graves, like on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, when they come out and pray. And two people already went and hid themselves in the graveyard and heard that one was calling to her friend: Let us go and pray together! All of the souls came out and prayed and asked for mercy so that death would not be decreed upon the living, and those who will die that they return from their evil ways, and that they die through minor illness, and about every matter of the living and the dead; and about themselves, to quickly remove judgement from upon them and from upon others - and they told their congregation. The next year on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, two others went and only one virgin didn't come out of the grave, who had died last week. They said: Come out! She said: I cannot, because my father was rich and lost his possessions and buried me without clothing. And they heard that some of the souls said we will not gather together because two have already revealed us to many. Rather, each one of us will pray in the grave, so that the living will not hear and tell the nation. And they became angry at the father and took clothing and clothed that virgin. And when a shroud decays it does not hold back the soul for behold despite body's decay the soul rests in the bones although it departs from dead body as is known that (sorcerers) who raise a spirit bring it by means of dust that absorbed from the dead. It happened that one man didn't see his head's shadow on Hoshana Rabbah's night, so he and his loving ones fasted numerous fasts and gave a lot to tzedakah and lived many years after that as is said "Tzedakah saves from death".

Gentiles who name their children after their fathers - it is not objectionable. However Jewish people take care not to do so. And there are places where they don't name their children after those who are alive rather they give them names of those who already passed away.

When a man is young and desires to marry a woman, he will then think about the improper thoughts and the grief from which he suffers; so he will think that when his sons will reach that age, he will have them marry. For it will give them grief to go without a wife. And sometimes he does not have the ability to do this; he should pray to God that He find him matches at the  right time for all of their needs and betterments. Behold our teacher Moshe married a convert, when he saw that he could not go back to Egypt. And why were Peretz and Zerach born to Yehudah by way of a sin, even though Tamar was fit for him? It was because he caused Yosef to be sold, so that he did not marry a woman until he was thirty years old, it being because he was placed in jail. And since Yehudah caused it that he not find a wife until he was thirty, that is why David did not reign until he was thirty. Another explanation: "From tearing my son (Yosef) you arose" (Genesis 49:9) - you did not kill Yosef (you prevented his death), and caused him to become great when he was thirty. That is why David reigned when he was thirty.

And even if the man carrying a burden was a gentile, for it is written: "And find favor and good apprehension in the eyes of G-d and man" (Mishlei 3, 4).

Great in power we did not find Him, meaning He did not overburden Israel with mitzvot. And if you will object "How about regulations about theft and forbidden sexual relations?" (The answer is) even if these laws were not written down one would have to keep them, otherwise the world would not be able to stand, for behold, rams and roosters wedge battles for females, so would people kill each other for this matter. And so a father should not command his son to perform an exacting or tiresome task, likewise a teacher should not act in the like manner towards his student lest they fail to accomplish the task and it will come out that (father or teacher) caused him to sin. And so a father should not leave to many possessions as inheritance to his son unless he does so for Heaven's sake.

One who left the city where there are his father and mother and he is going to a dangerous place.

If there were two people in a city, say, Ruben and Shimon and Shimon was accustomed to honoring Ruben, he should not let Shimon honor him by doing something that would be embarrassing for Shimon, for instance if this was not the way of Shimon  to bring water from a well. And even if for Shimon it is fine whereas for his family it is an embarrassment - Ruben should not let Shimon honor him.

That's why it is better that one prays in the language he understands.

It once happened that a certain hasid asked the question in a dream “who will be my neighbor in the World-To-Come? And it was shown to him a certain man in place two days journey away. So he got himself ready and went to search out and find the man. When he got close to the place of the man he asked about him, and the whole world wondered why the Hasid would want to see such a villainous man. This made the Hasid sad, but still, he went to the house of the man. When the hasid arrived, the man came out of his house incredibly angry and struck the hasid on his face, and pulled down the hasid’s pants. The man said to the hasid, “Enter if you like.” And the man and his friends mocked the hasid. The hasid payed no attention and entered the room adjacent to the bordello. That night all the prostitutes of the town entered the room next to where the hasid was and drank wine until they became intoxicated, and the man danced before them all night until they passed out. The hasid saw all of this and cried. The next day the hasid prepared to return home, but before he left he asked the man, “On your life, tell me if you have ever done good in your days, because I saw in a dream that you are sitting next to me in the Garden of Eden, yet you do all of this licentiousness. How can it be that you will sit with me? The man said to the hasid, “All that you I have done that you have seen is for the good. I only make it appear that I am licentious, I offer prostitutes a higher price to come with me, and they think I will spend the night with them when they are drunk, what’s more, I tell my mother to come in at night and pull me out by the hair, so if the prostitutes ask, ‘Why did you not sleep with us?’ I can reply, ‘You know that my mother beats me.’ And this is how I prevent licentiousness among Hebrew women.

There was an incident: one jew traveled to a distant place and saw in a night dream another jew whom they weighed on heavenly scales: he was put on one side of the scales whereas his sins were put on the other side. As a result his sins outweighed and they said to him that seeing that his sins outweighed he has no portion in the World to Come. After that came in another ones and said: "You didn't weigh correctly!" And they put on that man fox skins and other skins so the man outweighed and they declared that he does have a portion in the World to Come. The man who saw this in his dream thought that the man was alive whereas in fact the man whom they weighed was already dead by that moment. They said: those skins that were put on him were the ones he gave as a tax as is written: "... (I will make) your rullers righteousnes (Yeshayahu 60). When a congregation sees fit to impose a tax and one gives it in good faith - it is thought to be a tzedakah for them. An as for the body that they weighed it is written: "You were weighed on the scales and found wanting" (Daniel 5). Alternative explanation: ... in the merit of the fact that he strived with his body to perform good deeds.

But if he is <i>goses</i> and says that he is unable to die until they put him in another place – they must not move him from there. Even though they (the Rabbis) said: “A <i>goses</i> person – they must not move him from his place”,  if there is a fire, they must not leave him in the house, and they must take him out.

A town in which two people passed away - they first take out the first one lest they be unable to take care of both of the two simultaneously. If all this happens on Friday (which is Shabbos eve) they don't prolong eulogizing the first person lest they be unable to engage in burying the second one during the day. And if there is a concern that the second one will swell and burst - they should burry the second one first.

It is proper that the prayer of a prayer leader should be fluent in his mouth like in a case of R. Chanina ben Dosa of whom it is said that whenever his prayer was fluent in his mouth this indicated Heaven's benevolence.

Why did Nevuchadnezar succeed and the host of heaven did according to his will? Because Hashem changed names of angels during the Temple's destruction in order to prevent their invocation.

The Holy one blessed be He judges a man only together with upper host and if you will object that our sages of blessed memory said: "No one judges alone, but He'' - one can answer that this refers to judging a nation or a king. And if The Holy one blessed be He pronounces verdict there's no one to retort as is written: "He is one and who will answer him" (Yov 23:13)

The Serpent was walking on two and he had semblance slightly similar to that of a man. You should know that those who are able to turn a man into a wolf, a cat or a donkey - his eyeball does not change and so the serpent who underwent a change - his eyes did not change. Therefore one who miscarried and the fetus had a form of a snake - the mother is ritually impure as one who gave birth because his eyeballs are similar to those of a man.

A sinning soul will perish and repentance helps but does not fully annul decree but rather pushes off tribulation so that it will not hasten to come and so repentance is effective for soul to bring her to the World to Come
