Amidah

We read in the first chapter of <i>Berachot</i> the following: “Rav said: Anyone who greets another before praying (the <i>Amida</i>), it is as if he has built an idolatrous altar, as is stated: ”Cease ye from man, in whose nostrils is a breath; For how little (<i>ba-meh</i>) is he to be accounted!” (Is. 2:22). Do not read it as <i>ba-meh</i>, “how little,” but rather, read <i>bama</i>, an altar.” <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 14a</i> This applies specifically when one is about to enter (a house of worship) since it is forbidden for him to make the other appear as god before he comes before the true God, and then afterwards he comes to the synagogue to pray. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In Rabbinic literature (Pro. 29:4) <i>lihitpallel</i> almost always refers to reciting the <i>Amidah</i>, the central prayer of the daily liturgy.</i> Regarding this, the verse is quoted, “Cease you from man;” that is, whenever fear of heaven is upon a person he should cease greeting other people, placing their honor before the Creator. But if he meets someone on the way (to synagogue) or if he is even at the entrance and has some pressing matter to discuss with them, he is allowed to ask about their welfare, as the <i>Mishnah</i> states, “At the breaks between paragraphs (of the <i>Sh’ma</i>), one may greet out of respect that he is obligated to show him, and one may respond to another’s greeting due to respect.” <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Berachot</i> 2:1</i> Even though he is engaged showing honor to God, he is permitted to stop between the paragraphs of the <i>Shema</i> when he greets him on the way or as he is about to enter (the synagogue) out of necessity. Rabbi Hai asks, regarding the passage, “in whose nostrils there is breath,” isn’t their “breath’ in every person’s nostrils? However, the verse is speaking about the morning prayers, since that is the time that the breath returns to a person's nostrils.
We explain in the <i>Mishnah,</i> in chapter <i>Ein Omdim,</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Berachot</i> 5:1</i> “I am the woman who stood here beside you (<i>imchah</i>)…” (l Sam. 2:26) <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is part of the story of the birth of Samuel. When Hannah returns with Samuel to the temple they bring a sacrifice and she turns her son over to Eli. She said, “Please, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood beside you and prayed to <i>Adonai</i>.”</i> “Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: From here we learn the <i>halakha</i> that it is forbidden to sit within four cubits of one who is praying.” <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Berachot</i> 31b</i> There are those who explain that it is based on the word עמכה (<i>imchah</i>) “with you,” which is written with a <i>hei;</i> that is, they must be apart by a distance of five cubits. <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">One should not sit within four cubits which means you must be at least five cubits apart.</i> Or else one might explain עמכה is made up of four letters for the four <i>amot</i>/ cubits. Some of the commentators explain that these four cubits applies both before the person and to his side. A allusion to this is the expression, עמכה בזה “Who stood beside you in this (<i>ba-zeh</i>).” The gematria of the word <i>zeh</i> is 12; that is, four cubits in three directions. But the Jerusalem Talmud states that if one is engaged in prayer is permitted (to sit within four cubits).
We also read in the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i> in Chapter <i>Ain Omdiin</i>: (Berachot Ch. 5) Rabbi Yasa said… “A person should turn his face to the wall when one prays. What is the reason? “Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and he prayed to <i>Adonai</i>.” (Is. 38:2) <sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">JT Berachot 4:4</i> In other words, one should not pray in the middle of the room In our Talmud, <sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the Babylonian Talmud</i> in the first chapter of <i>Beracho</i>t, we read, “Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: From where is it derived that one who prays should have nothing between him and the wall? As it is stated: “And Hezekiah turned to face the wall and prayed” (Is. 38:2) It is explained in <i>Chidushei Rabash</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rabbash</i> is possibly <i>Rabbeinu Bechor Shor,</i> a 12 century scholar in France and a student of <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i>.</i> that this refers to anything that separates him from the wall. For example, a bed/couch, since it has an important place and its length is four (<i>amot</i>) and its height is ten (<i>amot</i>). <sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>Amah</i> is between 17-18 inches</i> But something small is not considered a “partition,” for if it were, how could we pray in a synagogue before the benches on which people sit? The <i>Rambam</i> Z”L asks what is considered a partition between the person and the wall and why did they prevent a person (from praying near it)? Is a hanging placed on the wall to beautify the space that contains forms that protrude considered to be a partition? He explains that the reason that one must come close to the wall at the time of prayer is so that there will be nothing that interrupts his concentration <i>(kavanah).</i> Clothing hanging on the wall are not forbidden but it is not proper that there be thing such as cabinets or sacks or similar objects such as household furnishings since they interrupt one’s concentration. It is not proper to pray before clothes which have figurative images on them, even though they do not protrude for the reason we have given; one might look at these images and not concentrate on one’s prayers. We generally close our eyes in prayer whenever there is clothing or an illuminated wall there, This is the conclusion of his words.
We read in the first chapter of <i>Beracho</i>t: “And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: When praying, one should align his feet it is stated: “And their feet were a straight foot.”“(Ez. 1:7) <sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 10b</i> <i>Targum</i> translates it, Their legs should be one straight leg. <sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Targum Yonatan Ezekiel 1:7</i> A sign of this matter – the word <i>yeshara,</i> straight, has the same gematria as t<i>efillah</i> (415). The <i>Hidushei Rabash</i> explains that their heels are next to one another but their toes are apart. They are similar to the hoofs of a calf which is attached in the back and separated in the front. This is the meaning of, “And their feet were a straight foot.” How so? Their feet are from one place and their foot is from another. There are those who explain that their feet are attached to one another both above and below. This is, “And their feet were a straight foot.” The tow of them together are called regel.
We read the the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i>, <i>Masechet Berachot</i>, chapter, <i>Tefilat Hashachar</i> (Ch. 4) “Rabbi Ḥiyya, said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: A person should pray at a place dedicated for prayer. What is the reason? “At every place where I shall let My name be mentioned.” (<i>Ex.</i> 20:24) It does not say “where you will mention” but “at every place where I shall let My name be mentioned.” Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanina said: A person has to select a fixed place in the synagogue where he prays. What is the reason? “David came to the top” (2 Sam. 15:32), it does not say “where he prostrated himself before God” but “where he used to prostrate himself before God.” <sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">JT<i> Berachot</i> 4:4</i>
Rabbi Hai (Gaon) wrote: When a person is reciting the <i>Amida,</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Literally the text says When a person is praying (<i>lihitpallel</i>). However in Rabbinic literature this almost always refers to reciting the <i>Amida</i> and will be translated appropriately going forward.</i> he is not permitted to speak or to respond to the <i>Kaddish</i> or the <i>Kedusha</i>. This can be compared to two people who are each sent to act as agents. This one cannot perform the act of agency of the other and this one is not permitted to perform the act of agency of the first.
We read in Berachot, Chapter <i>Mi Sh’meito</i> (Ch. 3) Furthermore, “One who belches or yawns while praying (the <i>Amida</i>) is among the rude.” <sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">BT<i> Berachot</i> 24b See Rashi’s interpretation of this expression: גיהק נוטריקון גו הקים פיהק פיו הקים Also Kesef Mishnah on the Rambam: וכתב ה''ר מנוח גיהק גו הקים כלומר שהקים ופשט גופו למעלה פיהק פה הקים שפותח פיו הרבה. ורש''י פי' פיהוק הוא הרוח היוצא דרך הפה בקול כמנהג הזוללים:</i> <i><b>Peirush</b></i>, These words are abbreviations for <b>גיהק גו הקים</b> a haughty back and <b>פיהק פיו הקים</b> a haughty mouth. This person is called rude because he shows no reverence before the Creator. “If one who sneezes during prayer is a bad omen. And some say: It is clear that he is repulsive.” <sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berchot</i> Ibid.</i> This means specifically one who “passes wind.” But if one sneezes it is a good sign. Just as he finds satisfaction below (by sneezing) so he finds satisfaction above. If one is in the midst of praying (the <i>Amida</i>) and needs to spit, let him absorb it into his garment or his head covering. <i><b>Peirush</b></i><b>:</b> An <i>Afarkisuto</i> is a turban with two pieces of material hanging down on either side. If he is squeamish he should spit behind him or to his left. The <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i> states, “Everyone acknowledges that spitting … is prohibited, <sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">However we find in BT <i>Berachot</i> 62b: Rava said: Spitting in a synagogue is permitted, just as in the case of shoes. Just as wearing shoes is prohibited on the Temple Mount but permitted in a synagogue, so, too, spitting is prohibited on the Temple Mount but permitted in a synagogue.</i> <i><b>Peirush</b></i> - this means one who walks along freely – that is to say, it didn’t happen involuntarily. <sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">BT<i> Berachot</i> 24b , 31a</i>
We read in the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi, Berachot</i>, chapter <i>Tefilat Hashachar</i> (Ch.4) “Now Hannah was praying in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard. Eli thought she was drunk.” (l Sam. 1:13) “Rabbi Yose bar Ḥanina said: From this verse you may learn four things. “Hannah was speaking to her heart,” from here that prayer needs concentration (<i>kavanah</i>). “Only her lips moved,” from here that one must articulate with one’s lips. “Her voice was not heard,” from here that nobody should raise their voice in prayer. “And Eli thought that she was drunk,” from here that a drunk is forbidden to pray.
This is found in our Talmud Masechet <i>Berachot</i>, chapter <i>Mit Sh’meito</i>, (Ch. 3) “One who sounds his voice during his <i>Amida</i> prayer is among those of little faith.” <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Berachot</i> Ibid.</i> <i><b>Peirush</b></i><b>,</b> It is as if he thinks that the Holy One can’t hear silent prayers. “Rav Huna said: This was only taught in a case where one is able to focus his heart while praying silently, but if he is unable to focus his heart while praying silently, he is permitted to sound his voice.” <sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Berachot</i> Ibid.</i> Thus we read in the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi, Berachot,</i> Chapter <i>Tefilat HaShachar</i> (Ch. 4): Rabba bar Zavda prayed aloud in his house so that the people in his house should learn prayer from him.” <sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">JT Berachot 4:1, 7b</i> <i><b>Peirush</b></i>, he prayed so loud to arouse the spirit of concentration (<i>kavanah</i>) so that the members of his household would hear the prayers and learn how to pray from him. This explanation applies to an individual but for the community that is not the case. What is the reason (one shouldn’t recite the <i>Amida</i>) out loud in public. He might come to bother the members of the community. One who raises his voice when reciting the <i>Amida</i> prayer is considered to be a false prophet, as it says regarding the prophets of Jezebel, ““Shout louder! After all, he is a god. Possibly he is sleeping and he will be awakened.” (l Kings 18:24) <sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Berachot</i> 24b</i>
It is taught in <i>Beracho</i>t, Chapter <i>Ein Omdin</i> (Ch.5) “One who prays must focus his heart.” <sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">BT<i> Berachot</i> 31a</i> If he is not able to focus his heart when reciting the <i>entire</i> Amida prayer, he should focus his heart on one of the blessings. Rabbi Safra said in the name of one from the school of Yanai, “let him focus on the first blessing of the <i>Amida (Avot</i>).” <sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See , BT<i> Berachot</i> 34b – note the differences in the original source: Rabbi Ḥiyya said that Rav Safra said in the name of one of the Sages of the school of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: An error is a bad omen in the first blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer, the blessing of Patriarchs.” Some teach that this statement was made on a <i>baraita</i> referring to another topic. It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: One who prays must focus his heart in all of the blessings. And if he is unable to focus his heart in all of them, he should focus his heart at least in one. Also see, <i>Rosh Berachot</i> 5:24</i> <i><b>Peirush -</b></i> Since it is the most important of all the blessings since it states the greatness of God and the merit of our first forefathers as well as the final redemption. Further, because if one concentrates upon it, he can learn to increase his <i>kavanah</i>, his concentration. One should know that a prayer is accepted based on the amount of concentration (<i>kavanah</i>), as is stated. “I will heed their outcry as soon as they cry out to Me.” (Ex. 22:22) We read in <i>Eruvin</i>, chapter <i>Hadar im nochri</i> (Ch. 6) “One who drinks wine must not pray, but if he prays, his prayer is a prayer. On the other hand, one who is intoxicated must not pray, and if he prays, his prayer is considered an abomination <b>….</b> What are the circumstances in which a person has imbibed wine; and what are the circumstances in which a person is considered intoxicated?”  <sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">BT Eruvin 64a</i> One who drank wine is able to speak before the king while one who is drunk is not able to speak before the king. We read in the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i>, <i>Berachot</i>, Ch.<i>Hayah Koreh (Ch. 2</i>): “The great Rabbi Hiya: I never managed to pray with deep concentration, but one time I made an effort to concentrate and I started to think and said to myself, who enters first before the king? The commandant of the fort or the <i>Resh Galuta?</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">JT Berachot 2:4 The commandant of the palace appears as a greek word in the Sefaria translation with the following footnote: *This Greek form was found in a Palmyrenian inscription. Following Fleischer, the title is a composition of Persian ارك ark “citadel”, پد pad (old Persian pat) “master, overseer”. So the title seems to designate the person who oversees the royal castle (Fleischer) or “commandant of a fort” (Liddell &amp; Scott).</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The exilarch was the leader of the Jewish community in Persian Mesopotamia during the era of the Parthians, Sasanians and Abbasid Caliphate up until the Mongol invasion of Baghdad in 1258 CE, with intermittent gaps due to ongoing political developments.

(Wikipedia)</i> <i><b>Peirush -</b></i> Who came before the king first? The <i>Arkafta</i> or the <i>Reish Galuta.</i> The <i>Arkafta</i> is a high officer called a <i>Zaim</i> in Arabic.

Abba Shaul says: An indication of this matter is stated in the verse: “The desire of the humble You have heard, <i>Adonai;</i> direct their hearts, Your ear will listen” (Ps. 10:17).” <sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 31a</i> Rabbi Yaakov, son of the Rosh <sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob ben Asher (c. 1270 – 1340), also known as Ba'al ha-Turim as well as Rabbi Yaakov ben Raash (Rabbeinu Asher), was an influential Medieval rabbinic authority. He is often referred to as the <i>Ba'al ha-Turim</i> ("Master of the Columns"), after his main work in halakha (Jewish law), the <i>Arba'ah Turim</i> ("Four Columns"). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ben_Asher</i> explains, “One should focus on the words that he articulates and imagine that it is as if the Divine Presence was before him, as Scripture states, “I am ever mindful of the presence of <i>Adonai’</i>s.” (Ps 16:8) Also one should arouse one’s concentration/focus (<i>kavanah</i>) and remove any thoughts that are troubling him so that finally his thoughts and intentions are pure and it is as if he is speaking to a mortal king who is here today and gone to the grave tomorrow. He should order his words and focus them in a lovely manner so that he doesn’t fail. How much more so should one do this before the king of kings of kings, of blessing. One needs to focus one's thoughts since one's thoughts are like speech; since God knows all our thoughts. In the Guide to the Perplexed, the Rambam, of blessed memory, writes about intention of the heart in prayer: If one prays by moving his lips and facing a wall but is thinking about business, one shouldn’t think that he is actually praying. Rather we are like the one referred to in Scripture: “You are near in their mouth, and far from their reins” (Jer. 12:2). Rabbi Avraham ben Yitzchak, head of the court explained: “You shall serve <i>Adonai,</i> your God… (Ex. 23:25) The use of the word <i>Avodah</i> implies that he has removed all troubling thoughts regarding worldly matters in order to subjugate oneself in <i>kavanah.</i> You will find that the word <i>Tefillah</i> has the same numerical value as <i>kavanat halev</i> (513) and <i>Avodat Lev (514).</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the numbers are slightly off, the sages were not so exact in using Gematria or numerical equivalents!</i> Anyone who wants his prayers to be heard should concentrate and focus his intentions in prayer and offer supplications before his creator. Regarding Moses it is stated <i>Va’etchanan</i>., “I offered supplication with God.”(Deut. 3:23) The numerical count of <i>Va’etchanan i</i>s the same as <i>Tefillah</i> to teach us that there is no prayer without supplication.
The reason we do not offer a blessing before reciting the <i>Amida</i> is because the <i>Amida</i> prayer has no limitation based on the <i>Torah.</i> Rather a person can make it either brief or long, as the Rashba <sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo ben Avraham ibn Aderet (1235 – 1310) also known as the Rashba. He was a medieval rabbi, halakhist, and Talmudist. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ibn_Aderet</i> explains in his commentary on the Passover <i>Haggadah</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Rashba explains that we do not recite a blessing for the telling of the Exodus story because there are no specific limits in how we tell the story, whether briefly or at length. Similarly, the same principle applies here.</i>
One recites the Eighteen blessings of the <i>Amidah</i> in a whisper.
“<i><b>Adonai,</b></i> <b>open my lips, and let my mouth declare Your praise.”</b> (Ps. 51:17) It is a Scriptural verse. This is the way of human beings: “A person may arrange his thoughts, but what he says depends on <i>Adonai (YHVH</i>).” (Pr. 16:1) A person asks God to arrange the words in his mouth when he recites the <i>Amida.</i> The name of God begins with <i>Aleph-Dalet-Nun-Yud Adonai.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Adonai is written in two different ways. Often it is spelled with the tetragrammaton – YHVH – but pronounced Adonai. But occasionally it is pronounced just the way it is spelled: Aleph-Dalet-Nun-Yud. The Amida begins with Aleph dalet nun yud but throughout the prayer it is written YHVH</i> Rabbi Shmuel ben Hofni <sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel ben Hofni [abbreviation: רשב"ח] or שמואל בן חפני הכהן; He died 1034. He was the Gaon of Sura from 998 to 1012. (Wikipedia)</i> writes the difference between <i>Aleph-Dalet-Nun-Yud (Adonai</i>) and <i>YHVH</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In scholarly literature the four letter name of God or the tetragrammaton is written in English as <i>YHVH</i> – short for <i>Yud-Hay-Vav-Hay</i>.</i> is as follows: when the intention of the one who prays is that God is the master of all creations and he does not speak about self interests it is written as YHVH. And when the intention of the one who recites the name of God is solely for himself then they says <i>Aleph-Dalet-Nun-Yud</i> (my master), <i>Gevirai</i> (my mighty one), <i>Ribonai</i> (my sovereign), then God’s name is is written as <i>Adonai (Aleph-Dalet -Nun-Yud</i>), as is the rule when all matters when a person speaks about self interest that the words often end with a <i>Yud</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>Yud</i> at the end of a noun often reflects the first person possessive, as in “My.”</i> This is proven by the statement of the prophet: “Wake, rouse Yourself for my cause, for my claim, O my God and my Master <i>(Adonai</i>)!” (Ps. 35:23) These last words, <i>Elohai V'Adonai, are</i> explained as, “My God and my Master.” Similarly, “I called to You, <i>YHVH</i>; to my Lord (Adonai) I made an appeal.” (Ps 30:9) The first (name of God) is <i>YHVH</i> and the second <i>Adonai,</i> is because King David wished to call God by both aspects: because You are the master of all creation and because you are my personal master. You have shown kindness to them in general and to me in particular.
It is explained in the Novella of the Rabash why the sages placed, “<i>Adonai,</i> open my lips, and let my mouth declare Your praise.” (Ps. 51:17) at the beginning of the Amida prayer. The <i>Amida</i> prayer was instituted in place of the daily offerings, <sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Berachot</i> 26b</i> as was explained above. “<i>Adonai</i>, open my lips,” appears before, “You do not want me to make sacrifices…” (Ps. 51:18) Afterwards a difficulty is raised about this explanation in the first chapter of <i>Berachot</i>: Why did the sages not decree, “May the words of my mouth…” (Ps. 19:15) <sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">May the words of my mouth and the prayer of my heart be acceptable to You, <i>Adonai,</i> my rock and my redeemer.</i> at the beginning of the Amida prayer? <sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Berachot</i> 4b and 9b</i> The answer that is given is that the other verse <i>(Adonai sefatai</i>) is better because it is followed by a reference to sacrifices. I have found written annotations to these novella that this reason is correct. The question that is raised in the <i>Gemara, Why did they not decree,</i> “May the words of my mouth?” is a good one because this verse contains a mention of redemption, “My rock and my redeemer.” In this way it would be a connection between redemption and prayer. Why did they decree that it should be placed at the end of the <i>Amida</i>? It is surprising – why shouldn’t it be at the end of the <i>Amida</i>, since it is written at the end of the Psalm… Therefore, what was mentioned first stands at the beginning here.
<b>Praised are You <i>Adonai,</i> our God:</b> We have already explained in the introduction that there is an expression of God’s sovereignty in this blessing. <b>God of our fathers</b> and then, <b>God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.</b> Is based on what the Holy One said to Moses: “The God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, etc.” (Ex. 3:15) <b>The God Great, Powerful, and Awesome,</b> is based on a verse in Scripture. (Deut. 10:17) It alludes to the three worlds: the uppermost world, the world of the angels; the middle world, the world of the celestial spheres and stars; and the lower world, the world of action. <b>The Great</b> is a reference to the world of angels since the name implies that it is the greatest of all of them. <b>The Powerful</b> is the world of the celestial spheres and stars since God causes the celestial spheres to revolve<b>. The Awesome</b> is the lowly world which is the world of action since through God’s awesome power God causes those who dwell in material homes to see that He is Awesome. And after one mentions that the Holy One is to be praised in the three worlds, one says, <b>The most high Almighty,</b> based on the expression, “And blessed be God Most High,” (Gen 14:20)
<b>Who bestows beneficent kindness,</b> is based on, <sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">“Is based on” is a very loose translation of Al Shem. Abudraham identifies the Scriptural verse that is the basis for the statement in the prayer book.</i> “He bestowed upon them according to His mercy and His great kindness,” (Is. 63:7) better than the kindness that human beings bestow (on one another) for “God is good to all,” (Ps. 145:9) <b>Who creates <i>(koneh</i>) everything,</b> This is based on, “He is creator of (<i>koneh</i>) the heavens and the earth. (Gen. 14:19) And so, “I <i>Adonai</i> do all these things.” (Is 45:7) This verse is rendered in Aramaic: “He performed all these mighty acts and He possesses all of this property. <b>God remembers the kindness (<i>hasdei</i>) of the Patriarchs,</b> as is stated: “Then will I remember My covenant with Jacob,” (Lev. 26:42) and also, “I remembered the kindness (<i>hesed</i>) of your youth.” (Jer. 2:2) <b>Who brings a redeemer</b> is based on, “He shall come as redeemer to Zion.” (Is. 59:20) It mentions the kindness of the Patriarchs in conjunction with the redemption; in other words, God will remember the acts of lovingkindness for their offspring by redeeming them. Even if the merit of the forefathers might have expired, <b>He brings a redeemer to the children of their children for the sake of His name:</b> This is based on the verse, “From of old, Your name is Our Redeemer” (Is. 63:16).
<b>In love:</b> This is based on, “Eternal love I conceived for you then.” (Jer. 31:3) The language is entirely in the present tense in this passage, reflecting past, present and future. In other words, everyday God bestows acts of lovingkindness, creates everything, remembers the kindness of the forefathers and brings redemption to the children of their children. God is also our redeemer every day and in the future will redeem us. God is <b>King</b> based on the verse, “God is our king.” (Is. 33:22) God is <b>Helper</b><i>,</i> based on the verse, “Its deliverer in time of trouble,” (Jer. 14:8) <b>And Shield:</b> Based on the verse “You are a protecting Shield.” (Deut. 33:19) <b>Praised are You <i>Adona</i>i</b>, <b>Shield of Abraham.</b> As is stated, ““Fear not, Abram, I am a shield to you.” (Gen.15:1) It is also based on what Moses said at the end of his blessing: “A people delivered by <i>Adonai,</i> your protecting Shield.” (Deut. 33:29) We mention all three of these terms in the conclusion to the blessing: God helps through loving-kindness, Saves with might and God is the shield through the merit of Abraham.
We read in <i>Berachot,</i> chapter <i>Ain Omdin (Ch. 5</i>): “The Sages taught: These are the blessings in the <i>Amidah</i> prayer in which a person bows: at the beginning and end of the forefather’s blessing (<i>Avot</i>) – and at the beginning and end of the thanksgiving blessing <i>(Hoda’ah</i>)” <sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 34a</i> The <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i> explains the reason (we bow) in the <i>Avot</i> blessing (is based on the verse): “Then I bowed low in homage to <i>Adonai</i> and blessed <i>Adonai</i>, God of my master Abraham” (Gen. 24:48) and the <i>Hodaah</i> blessing (is based on the same verse), “I bow to <i>the King</i>,” which is translated (in Aramaic) “I gave thanks to the King.” <sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I was unable to find a verse ואשתחוה למלך or the Aramaic translation that follows it. See Psalms 138:2 which seems to suggest the connection between bowing and thanksgiving; Also, Tosefta Kifshuta 2:17:2</i> If someone bows at the end and beginning of each blessing (of the <i>Amidah</i>) one should teach him not to do so. “Rabbi Tanḥum said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: (In those blessings where one is required to bow,) one who prays must bow until all the vertebrae in the spine protrude <i>(yitpakaku</i>).” <sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See BT<i> Berachot</i> 28b See Rashi, Baba Batra 80b, “In the case of reeds or of vines, he may cut only from the knot (pakak) and above,” Jastrow explains this word, “<i>the place where a shoot is joined to the trunk or to a branch of the grape vine, knot</i>.”</i> This expression is taken from the expression, <i>pakak hagefen,</i> which is the knot in the branch which protrudes from the wood. “Ulla said: Until he can see a small coin [<i>issar</i>], on the ground before him opposite his heart.” <sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Berachot Ibid.</i> Rabbeinu Hai Gaon explains that he lowers his head like a bull rush until he can see a coin on the ground that is opposite his heart. He should not bow his body or head lower. Rashi explains that when one bows two folds of flesh are formed opposite the heart: one above and one below. One must stoop so far so that the flesh in between is the size of an issar coin. <sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As explained Rashi on Berachot 28b – See Shottenstein<i> Berachot</i> Note 37 on Page 28b.</i> “Rabbi Ḥanina said: Once he moves his head forward, he need not bow any further. Rava said: But that applies only if he is exerting himself and he appears like one who is bowing.” <sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Berachot,</i> Ibid.</i> But one who is not healthy does not need to be in this fashion. These prostrations are meant to remind a person, before whom he is standing and that in the end he will return to the dust.
Another explanation: It is meant to allude to the fact that a blessing is drawn down from above to below. But when one mentions the name of God one stands erect. For God is exalted and the humble will understand this; also it is said, “God raises up those who are bowed down;” that is, when we mention God’s name he raises up those who are bowed. “When Rav Sheshet bowed he bowed all at once, like a cane, without delay. When he stood upright he stood upright like a snake.” <sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Berachot</i> 6b</i> Rashi explains, “<i>Ke'Hizra</i> – [like] a staff in the hand of a person who strikes the staff downward in one motion, Straightens (from the bow) <i>Ke'Hivya</i> – pleasantly, first his head, and the rest of his body afterwards, so his bow does not appear to be a burden upon him<i>. Ke'Hivya</i> – like a snake that, when he straightens himself, lifts his head first, and then straightens himself gradually. Rabbeinu Hai Gaon explains that Hizra is a type of thornbush that is found in Babylonia which is named after <i>el hazir;</i> its head is bowed and so that it does not bow from the middle of its body but from its head. It is like a reed when it bows. This is how he explains, “Until he can see a small coin [<i>issar</i>], on the ground before him opposite his heart.”
<b>You are mighty forever:</b> is based on, “<i>Adonai</i> goes forth like a mighty warrior (<i>gibor</i>),” (Is. 42:13) One uses expressions of might at the beginning of this blessing because all the acts that are mentioned are acts of might and power as we shall explain.
We mention “Who resurrects the dead” מחיה המתים <sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Although there are other references to resurrection in the <i>gevurah</i> blessing, the expression <i>mihayei hametim</i> is only used these three times.</i> three times in this blessing: first, מחיה מתים אתה <b>You give life to the dead</b>; second, מחיה מתים ברחמים רבים <b>Gives life to dead with great mercy,</b> and third, בא"י מחיה המתים <b>Praise are You <i>Adonai</i> who resurrects the dead.</b> We call God “one who resurrects the dead '' three times for the following: the first refers to when a person sleeps in his bed and is considered like the dead. He is considered as one who says, “Into your hand I entrust my spirit” (Ps. 31:6) The Holy One of Blessing raises up clouds and brings down dew and rain in order to sustain them (in sleep) and then returns the soul to the person. Therefore, we connect sleep to מחיה מתים,One who gives life to the dead רב להושיע משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם <b>the Mighty One to deliver us. You Cause the wind to blow and the rain to fall.</b> For this teaches us that the resurrection of the dead is similar to the person who rises from bed (each day).
The second mention relates the resurrection of the dead to rainfall, as we learn in the first chapter of <i>Ta’anit:</i> “Rabbi Abbahu said: The day of rain is greater than the resurrection of the dead. While the resurrection of the dead benefits the righteous and not the wicked, as is said, “Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, others to reproaches, to everlasting abhorrence.” (Da. 12:2), while rain benefits both the righteous and the wicked.” <sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">BT Taanit 25b</i>
The third relates the resurrection of the dead to future times. We conclude the blessing, <b>Praised are you who resurrects the dead.</b> <sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Note that it is only in the third use of the expression <i>Mihayei HaMetim</i> that there is a definite article – so that only this one refers to resurrection. ‘God gives life to the dead’ as opposed to ‘God resurrects the dead.’</i> It is here that one finds a central reference to resurrection of the dead: This is what we learn in B<i>aba Metzia</i>, the chapter <i>Hasocher</i> (Ch.7) “Rabbi decreed a fast, and the Sages brought Rabbi Ḥiyya and his sons down to the pulpit to pray on behalf of the congregation. Rabbi Ḥiyya recited the phrase in the <i>Amidah</i> prayer: Who makes the wind blow, and the wind blew. Rabbi Ḥiyya recited: Who makes the rain fall, and rain fell. When he was about to say: Who revived the dead, the world trembled.” <sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Bava Metzia</i> 85b</i>
The Rif writes, even though this blessing states <b>Who causes wind to blow and rain to fall,</b> it also includes “You are the one who resurrects the dead.” This is not difficult. It says specifically, “Who causes wind to blow” for wind, and “the rain to fall” for rain so that this blessing includes references to the rain and the wind. But the reference to resurrection of the dead comes at the conclusion of the blessing because this is the essential mention of resurrection of the dead.
<b>You are the one who resurrects the dead,</b> is based on, “Oh, let Your dead revive!” (Is. 26:19) <b>The Powerful One who delivers us,</b> is based on, “I that speak in victory, mighty to deliver.” (Is. 61:1) It is also based on the story (of Sodom and Gomorrah): God rained down brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah and God saved Lot and his two daughters before all of them and even against their will.
<b>He causes wind to blow and rain to fall</b> is based on “He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.” (Ps.147:18) This is a mighty act because every drop of rain comes from above, and the wind does not blow without purpose; rather God causes the rain to fall wherever God wishes. This is an act of might; there is no act like it. Bringing life to death is dependent upon it as we have said. It is also written, “Who performs great deeds which cannot be fathomed…” (Job 5:9) Juxtaposed to this verse is, “Who gives rain to the earth…” (Job 5:10) During the season when we do not mention the might of the rain, we say, “He causes the dew to follow.” Dew is also a form of resurrection based on the fact that it gives life to the dead, as Scripture states, “Let corpses arise! Awake and shout for joy, you who dwell in the dust! For Your dew is like the dew on fresh growth…” (Is. 26:19) Also, there is great power when the dew falls, since it comes each day and it never ceases.
<b>Sustainer living with kindness…</b> is based on a verse in Scripture: “Who gives food to all flesh, His steadfast love is eternal.” (Ps. 136:25) God provides them with food and all their other needs two times every day or three times, as is said in <i>Pesachim</i>, the chapter A<i>rvei Pesachim,</i> (Ch. 10): “R. Elazar ben Azarya said: Providing a person’s food is as difficult as the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is written: “Who split apart the Sea of Reeds, His steadfast love is eternal;” (Ps. 136:13) Close to this verse it states, “He gives food to all flesh, for His mercy endures forever” (Ps. 136:25) If one makes a garment for a person, the person enjoys it for a year or two but a meal only provides benefit from one meal to the next!
<b>With Kindness:</b> That is, God does it out of His kindness and not because of the righteousness of his creations. We learn in the first chapter of <i>Ta’anit: “</i>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There are three keys in the hand of the Holy One of blessing, which were not transmitted to an intermediary. And they are: The key of rain, the key of birthing, and the key of the resurrection of the dead. The key of rain, as it is stated: “<i>Adonai</i> will open for you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its due time” (Deut. 28:12). From where is it derived the key of birthing? As it is written: “And God remembered Rachel and listened and opened her womb. (Gen. 30:22) From where is it derived that the key of the resurrection of the dead is maintained by God Himself? As it is written: “And you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves” (Ez. 37:13). <b>I</b>n the West (the land of Israel), they say: The key of livelihood is also in God’s hand, as it is written: “You open Your hand and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Ps.145:16)” <sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Ta’anit</i> 2b</i> The Talmud then asks, “And what is the reason that Rabbi Yoḥanan did not consider this key of livelihood in his list? Rabbi Yoḥanan could have said to you: Rain is the same as livelihood.” <sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Ta’anit</i> Ibid</i> An allusion to the four keys is the word <i>mafteah,</i> key. <i><b>Peirush</b></i> – <i>Mem</i> for <i>matar</i> (rain), <i>pei</i> for <i>parnassah</i> (livelihood) <i>tuf</i> for tehiyat hametim (resurrection) and <i>chet</i> for <i>hayah</i> (childbirth).
<b>Resurrect of the dead with great mercy</b> as we have explained. Furthermore, the blessing goes on to explain how God gives life to the dead. <b>God supports those who have fallen</b>, based on, “Adonai supports all who stumble.” (Ps 145:14) Sometimes people stumble and the doctors consider him like one who is already dead but God supports him and gives him life. <b>God heals the sick</b> based on, “I will not bring upon you any of the diseases…for I <i>Adonai</i> am your healer.” (Ex. 15:26) Sometimes, people reach the very gates of death and God heals them. <b>He releases those who are imprisoned,</b> based on, “God frees those who are imprisoned.” (Ps. 146:7) They too are considered to be dead who have been given life. <b>He keeps His faith with those who sleep in the dust</b> is based on “Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth will awake.” (Dan. 12:2) In other words just as God keeps His promise with the living, healing them, so too in the future he will keep his promise with the dead. There are those who say that, “<b>He keeps His faith with those who sleep in the dust</b>,'' refers to the promise God made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob who are referred to here as “those who sleep in the dust.” But Abraham is the most essential one. <b>Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You,</b> is based on the verse, “To whom, then, can you liken God, with what form can you make comparison?” <b>A King Who causes death and restores life,</b> is based on, “<i>Adonai</i>, deals death and gives life.” (I Sam 2:6) God gives life and death in many ways, as we have explained above. <b>He causes deliverance to sprout forth,</b> based on “ <i>Adonai</i> will make victory and renown shoot upon the presence of all the nations.” (Is. 61:11) <b>And You are faithful to restore the dead to life,</b> in other words even now we believe that God restores life to the dead (even though it hasn’t happened yet).
<b>Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.</b> It says in <i>Midrash Emunim: “</i>God guards the Loyal,” (Ps. 31:24) this refers to those who say <i>Amen</i> with faith. When the prayer leader says the blessing of “Resurrector of the dead,” the Jew responds, “Amen” even though he has not seen God restore the dead to life; when the prayer leader says the blessing “Redeemer of Israel,” he responds “Amen”, even though he has not yet been delivered; and when the prayer says the blessing “Builder of Jerusalem,” he responds “Amen” even though Jerusalem is still destroyed. “So <i>Adonai</i> guards the loyal.” (Ps. 31:24)  <sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tur, Orach Chaim</i> 124:1 I was unable to find a Midrashic work by this name. Note that the author plays on the words <i>Emunim,</i> loyal and <i>Amen</i>. They have the same Hebrew root – aleph mem nun.</i>
<b>You are holy,</b> is based on the verse, “And God the Holy One is sanctified through righteousness.” (Is. 5:16) <b>And Your Name is holy,</b> is based on, “Whose name is holy.” (Is. 57:15) And these correspond to, <b>And holy beings praise You every day, forever, sela.</b> These are the people of Israel, as is written, “You shall be Holy.” (Lev. 19:2) <b>For You are a great King</b>. is based on “For I am a great King.” (Malachi 1:14) and “For You are great.” (Ps. 86:10, 10:6) <b>And holy,</b> as we have already explained. Most people do not say, <b>For a King great and holy are You.</b> This appears in the prayer books of the <i>Geonim</i> and it is the correct version for the reasons explained above. <b>Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Holy One</b> as it is stated: “For I, Adonai am holy.” (Lev. 19:2)
You will find that, that it was decreed to only mention <i>Melech</i>, King, in the concluding formula (<i>Hatimot</i>) <sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>Hatimah/Hatimot</i> (P) refers to the last portion of the blessings – it begins with <i>Baruch attah Adonai</i> and then a concluding expression.</i> of four of the eighteen blessings of the <i>Amida</i>. They are the first three blessings and <b>Restore our judges</b>. The reason for the first three blessings is because they allude to the forefathers. The <i>hatimah</i> of the first blessing is <b>Shield of Abraham</b> (corresponding to Abraham); the <i>hatimah</i> of the second blessing <b>Who gives life to the dead</b> corresponds to Isaac. His father took the knife in hand through the command of the Creator so that he was considered like a person who was dead. God did not allow Abraham to slaughter him so that it was as if he gave him back his life. The third <i>hatimah</i> is <b>The Holy God,</b> corresponding to Jacob, whose bed was whole and holy since no unfit offspring came from him. And the <i>Hatimah</i> <b>King who loves righteousness and justice</b>, alludes to King David who sat in judgment. Therefore, it was decreed at the end of each of these blessings that one mention <i>Melekh</i> because of their importance and because they allude to the Patriarchs and David. It is based on the verse, “I will give you great renown like that of the greatest men on earth.” (II Sam. 7:8) This is what I think. Afterwards I found the commentary of the Rib”ah, the first three blessings correspond to the three forefathers. They include reference to divinity (<i>elohut</i>) <sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Exodus 3:15 The <i>Amida</i> begins with <i>Elohei Avraham, Elohei Yitzchak, ve Elohei Yaakov,</i> God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.</i> which corresponds to God's sovereignty. A king who loves righteousness and justice corresponds to what is written in Scripture, “<i>Adonai</i>, the God of your father,” (II Kings 20:5) and also, “I will extol You, my God and king, and bless Your name forever and ever.” (Ps. 145:1) until, “The LORD shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations…” (Ps. 146:10) <sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">There are four verses that contain references to <i>King</i> in Psalms 145-146</i>
<b>You favor man with perception:</b> is based on the verse, “He who instructs men in knowledge,” and also, “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.” (Ex 33:19) <b>And teach mankind understanding</b> is based on, “God endowed Solomon with wisdom and discernment in great measure.” (I Kings 5:9) <b>Grant us from Your wisdom, understanding and knowledge</b> is based on the verse, “who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.” (Jer. 3:15)
<b>Cause us to return, our Father, to Your <i>Torah,</i></b> is based on, “And our fathers did not follow Your Teaching,” (Neh 9:34) The sages said, ‘One says “our Father” so that we will be beloved before You like a son.’ Further, <b>Cause us to return our father to your <i>Torah</i></b><i>.</i> is based on statements in <i>Sifre</i> and in <i>Shemot Rabbah.</i> “When Moses charged us with teaching the heritage of the congregation of Jacob.” (Deut. 33:4) This may be compared to the son of a king who was taken captive in a distant land when he was young. If he tried to return even after several years, he would not be embarrassed to do so, because he said, “I am returning to my inheritance.” So too, a <i>Torah</i> scholar when he becomes separated from words of <i>Torah</i> and performs other unimportant matters, he is not embarrassed to return even after several years because he can say, “I am returning to my inheritance.” Therefore, one says, <i>Aveenu,</i> Our God. <sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Shemot Rabbah 33:7</i> He is like the son who returns to the inheritance that he received from his father.”
<b>Bring us near, our King, to Your service,</b> the performance of the commandments which a person is obligated to do as (God’s) servants. That is why one says “Our King,” and we find that the commandments are referred to as “service,” as is written, “Because you would not serve <i>Adonai</i> your God…” (Deut. 28:47) That is, they have not observed the commandments. <i><b>Peirush</b></i>: After saying, “Bring us near, our King, to Your service,” that is, to pray before you, as the sages said, “To serve Him with all your heart.” What is service of the heart? It is prayer. And ‘nearness in prayer’ is based on the verse, “Happy is the person…who is near to dwell in Your courts.” (Is. 65:5)
<b>And bring us back in complete repentance before You:</b> is based on the verse, “Bring us back, <i>Adonai</i>, to You, and let us come back; renew our days as of old.” (Lam. 5:21) In other words, if we begin to repent, You will help us to perform complete repentance before You. This is similar to the approach of the sages: “If one comes to purify, they assist him<b>.”</b> <sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">BT Yoma 38b</i>
<b>Praised are You, Adonai, Who desires penitence:</b> as is said, “it is not My desire that the wicked shall die, but that the wicked turn from his [evil] ways and live.” (Ez. 33:11) And it is written, “Is it my desire that a wicked person shall die, says Adonai, God. It is rather that he shall turn back from his ways and live.” (Ez. 18:23)
<b>Pardon us, our Father, for we have sinned,</b> is based on the verse, “Pardon Your people who have sinned against You…” (I Kings 8:50)
<b>Forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed:</b> is based on the verse, “For all the transgressions that they have transgressed against You.” (I Kings 8:50) ‘forgiveness’ (<i>selichah</i>) and ‘Sin’ (<i>hayt</i>) are associated with a ‘father’ while ‘pardon,’ (<i>mehilah</i>) and ‘transgression’ (<i>pesha</i>) are associated with ‘King.’ This is because the wilful sins (<i>zadonot</i>) of the son are considered by one’s father as inadvertent sins (<i>hayt</i>) and are judged leniently for forgiveness just as a sin (<i>hayt</i>) is more judged more leniently than transgressions (<i>pesha</i>). Before a king, inadvertent sins are considered like wilful sins (<i>pesha</i>), as is said, “By justice a king sustains the land…(Pr. 29:4) Therefore, we must say to the king that we “transgressed” (<i>pasha</i>) since transgressions are more serious than sins (<i>hayt</i>). The neighbor or the slave must seek pardon (<i>mehilah</i>) for his insult while the child asks to be forgiven for the insult and asks for <i>selichah</i>…. <sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>*</i>חטא, (sin or error) is the result of carelessness, ignorance, or weakness; sin, פשע, (transgression) is a deliberate disregard of moral or religious duty. See Sefaria. Fathers consider the more serious transgression more lenient while the king considered even the smallest sin or error more strictly. That is why the terms, King and Father, are associated with different names.</i> There are those who interpret this passage: “Forgive us, our father, even though we sinned; and pardon us, our king, even though we transgressed.” <b>For you are a good and forgiving Almighty,</b> is based on the verse, “<i>Adonai</i> is gracious and compassionate…” (Ps. 145:8) <b>Who pardons abundantly</b> as is stated, “To our God, for He freely forgives.” (Is. 55:7)
<b>Look, please, upon our affliction:</b> is based on the verse, “Have mercy on me, <i>Adonai</i>; see my affliction.” (Ps. 9:14, 25:18, 119:153)
<b>Defend our cause</b>: is based on, “For <i>Adonai</i> will take up their cause,” (Pr. 22:23) and “For I will contend with your adversaries.” (Is. 49:25)
<b>And redeem us speedily for the sake of Your name:</b> is based on, “Our Redeemer <i>Adonai Zevaot</i> is His name. <b>Because You are a Mighty Redeemer:</b> is based on the verse, “Behold, <i>Adonai</i> comes in might.” (Is. 40:10)
<b>Heal us, <i>Adonai</i>, and we will be healed, deliver us and we will be delivered; for You are our praise.</b> This verse is from the book of Jeremiah – where it appears in the singular. <sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear to me who this is referring to; the <i>HaRamah</i> appears in the digital text here.

It was the custom to read Scripture from the Sefer in Hebrew and for the <i>Metargem</i> to translate it into Aramaic – or even more likely to read the official Aramaic translation such as <i>Unkules</i>.</i> One who translates Scriptural verses (for others) or one who reads a verse from writing when it is his intention to read it (in the original Hebrew), it is not permitted to change it from plural to singular or from singular to plural. But if the verse is included in a prayer and it is not the intention of the community to read it in its original form but to recite it as part of a supplication or a prayer, then it is considered like all prayers and it is permitted to change it according to the needs of the hour and according to matters of supplication and entreaty. Rabbeinu Yona explains that (not changing the text) applies specifically when one is reciting psalms or any passage that follows a specific order (in Scripture). Then one should not change it.

<b>Grant a cure and healing to all our sickness</b> is based on, “He heals all your diseases.” (Ps. 103:2) <b>To all our pain and to affliction</b> is based on, “He injures, but He binds up,” (Job 5:18) <b>Because You are God, a faithful and merciful Healer.</b> Is based on, “for I, <i>Adonai,</i> am your healer.” (Ex. 15:26) “<b>Merciful”</b> is written about serious illness (He is a merciful healer) and “<b>Faithful”</b> is written regarding God the faithful healer. Therefore it states “malignant and chronic diseases.” (Duet 28:59) <b>Blessed are You, Adonai, Healer of the sick of His people Israel.</b> Is based on, “I deal death and give life.” (Deut. 32:39)
<b>Bless this year for us, <i>Adonai</i> our God,</b> is based on, “I will ordain My blessing for you,” (Lev 25:21) and on, “I shall bless the years for you.” <sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Uncertain which verse is being quoted here.

Ibid), and, “But each with his own gift, according to the blessing that <i>Adonai</i> your God…” (Deut. 16:17) <b>Guard and rescue this year:</b> is based on, “You crown the year with Your bounty.” (Ps 65:12) and, “It is a land which <i>Adonai</i> your God looks after,..” (Deut. 11:15) <b>From the beginning of the year to the end of the year from all adversity:</b> is based on the verse, “and not let the Destroyer enter and smite your home.” (Ex. 12:23) <b>And from all kinds of destruction and from all sorts of retribution:</b> is rabbinic language, based on the verse, “When Israel was inundated with breaches.” (Jud. 5:2) <sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Based on Rashi’s interpretation of the verse: “<b>When Israel was inundated with breaches.</b> When breaches befell Yisroel; when their enemies invaded them because they deserted Adonoy, and yet the people volunteered to repent—at this point, bless Adonoy for bringing deliverance.”</i> <b>Make it optimistic::</b> is based on the verse, “Hope of Israel, its deliverer in time of trouble.” (Jer. 14:8) <b>With a peaceful ending:</b> is based on, “For there is a future for the man of integrity.” (Ps. 37:37) <b>Be compassionate and merciful on all of its produce:</b> is based on the verse, “So that it shall yield a crop sufficient for three years.” (Lev. 25:21) Most people read “Be compassionate and merciful to us and all its produce.” But this is not the correct (reading) because this blessing was decreed to ask for compassion for the fertility of the year and its fruits. What purpose is there for including ourselves in it? The other blessings are all requests for ourselves. <b>And its fruit:</b> is based on the verse, “The trees have borne their fruit.” (Joel 2:22) <b>And bless it with rains of favor:</b> is based on, “I will send down the rain in its season, rains that bring blessing.” (Ez. 34:26) and, “You released a bountiful rain, O God.” (Ps. 68:10) <b>And plenty</b>: is based on, “You shall eat your fill of bread.” (Lev. 26:5)<b>And peace:</b> is based on, “I will grant peace in the land.” (Lev. 26:6) <b>Just as in the good years</b>: is based on, “I will send down the rain in its season, rains that bring blessing.” (Ez. 34:26) <b>Praised are You <i>Adonai</i> who blesses the year:</b> it is based on, “I will ordain My blessing for you.” (Lev 25:21)
It is the custom of Sefarad to say this version of the blessing during the rainy season.

This refers to the time of the coming of the redeemer, may he redeem us speedily in our day by taking us out from the prison of the nations. <b>And raise a banner to gather our exiles and gather us together speedily from the four corners of the earth into our land:</b> is based on the verse, “Lift up a signal to the nations and assemble the banished of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.” (Is. 11:12) <b>Praise are You, Adonai, gatherer of the dispersed of His people Israel:</b> is based on, “When I have gathered the House of Israel” (Ez. 28:25) &amp; “And assemble the banished of Israel.” (Is. 11:12)

Rabbi Yehiel, son of the Rosh writes: “I was surprised by the closing formula of this blessing. Why is it different from the other closing formulas in the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> regarding the mention of God’s sovereignty (<i>melekh</i>). We have already taught that when two blessings are juxtaposed it is not necessary to mention God’s sovereignty. Further, I do not know what the difference between <i>Melekh ohaiv tzedakah u’mishpat,</i> King who loves righteousness and justice,  <sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">These are the concluding words of the blessing throughout the year.</i> and King of Justice, <i>Melekh hamishpa</i>t, King of justice.  <sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">These are the concluding words of this blessing during the Ten Days of Repentance.</i> Why is it necessary to go back and repeat it from the beginning if one forgot to recite the appropriate formula (during the ten days of repentance). <sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Berachot 12b, Maimonides, Mishnah Torah, the Laws of Prayers and the priestly blessing, 10:13 – If during the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur…. If he erred and concluded the eleventh blessing, <i>Melech ohev tzedakah umishpat</i>, he should return to the beginning of the blessing and conclude <i>Hamelech hamishpat</i>, and continue reciting his prayers in order. If he did not remember until he concluded his prayers, he must recite [his prayers again] from the beginning.</i> But it is not permissible for me to change what is normative among the majority. However I have heard that in Provence they do not say ‘Melekh’ and this seems correct to me. Further I found the following in Machzor Vitri: We have read in the first chapter of <i>Berachot:</i> Throughout the year a person prays and concludes The holy God, and: King who loves righteousness and justice, with the exception of the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, the Ten Days of Atonement. when he prays he concludes these blessings with: The holy King and The King of justice, <sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 12b Ibid.</i> because at that time ( the days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) God sits on the throne of justice, passing judgment on the entire world. There are those who state that we say,‘King who loves righteousness and justice,’ the rest of the year since it is fitting to express God’s sovereignty regarding justice more so than in any of the other blessings, just as we said, “By justice a king sustains the land, but a fraudulent man tears it down.” (Prov. 29:4) I discussed this matter with my father, the <i>Rosh</i>, and he accepted my explanation.” We have already explained the correct reason for the concluding formula of this blessing and why it includes “the King.”
<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Translator’s note: The following passage is missing in many manuscripts and printed versions of Abudraham. In recent additions of the work it has now been reinserted See Abudraham Keren Re’em by Rabbi Eliyahu Greentzieg, 2015 Volume 1, Page 293</i>לַמְּשׁוּמָּדִים אַל־תְּהִי תִקְוָה <b>“For apostates, let there be no hope,”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Note the version of this blessing in the Amida that is recited today is different from the one in “Abudraham’s version of the Amida.

See note in Sefaria, JT Berachot 4:3: ”The benediction has been changed in Christian surroundings beyond recognition. The text of Jabneh must have been close to today’s Yemenite version: למשומדים אל תהי תקוה, כל המינים והמוסרים כרגע יאבדו ומלכות זדון תעקור ותשבור מהרה בימינו. ברוך אתה יי֨ שובר אויבים ומכניע זדים.” Apparently the version Abudraham was also similar to this version.</i> is based on, “Hope of Israel, Adonai!” (Jer. 14:8) and on, “So there is hope for the wretched,”  (Job 5:16) It is also written in Scripture, “And there is hope for your future…” (Jer. 31:17) This refers to Israel but for the apostates, there is no hope, for they shall have no hope in this world or in the world to come since they will be condemned to Gehenom forever, as is stated, “For You, O God, will bring them down to the nethermost Pit…” (Ps. 55:24) <br>The word, <b>משומד</b>, apostate, is explained by the Ramban; this is what he writes: “No foreigner shall eat of it,” (Ex 12:43) “Onkelos translate: “<i>There shall no ‘ben neichar’ eat thereof</i>, i.e, any Israelite who has become an apostate,” meaning he has estranged himself from his brethren and from his Heavenly Father through his evil deeds. This is the word <i>neichar</i>, mentioned by the Sages in all places, which means estranged, and the purport thereof is <i>m’shumad</i>, one who is an opponent of Torah. The usage of the word is similar to the Aramaic expression, <i>‘ve’isht’moda’</i> (And) Joseph (knew) his brethren, but they ‘isht’modei’ (knew) him not. (Gen. 42:8) In the case of the word <i>m’shumad</i>, it is missing the letter <i>ayin</i>, just as it is absorbed in many [Aramaic] words: <i>midam</i> (anything) in place of <i>mida’am; dor kati</i> in place of <i>dor katia</i> (a chopped generation)(BT Ketubot 10b), <i>baki</i> in place of <i>b’kia</i> (expert) (BT Sanhedrin 5b).”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For the full Ramban see Ramban on Exodus 12:43</i><br>וכל המינים כְּרֶֽגַע יֹאבֵֽדוּ <b>“And for the heretics, let there be no hope,”</b> is based on “Some die suddenly in the middle of the night.” (Job 34:20) There is the same judgment for the heretics and the apostates, specifically when they do not repent. If they sincerely repent, we receive them in their repentance, for nothing stands in the way of repentance. <br>וְכָל־אֽוֹיְבֶֽיךָ וְכָל־שֽׂוֹנְאֶֽיךָ <b>“All Your enemies and all Your haters,”</b> is based on, “God will inflict all those curses upon the enemies and foes who persecuted you.” (Deut. 30:7) <br>מְהֵרָה יִכָּרֵֽתוּ,  <b>“May they quickly be terminated,”</b> this is the language<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently the word M’haira is rabbinic.

In the first chapter of Shavuot, they are called a wicked kingdom. Therefore the sages decreed to curse them evening and morning (and afternoon) since it says in a verse regarding Amalek, “(Moses’ hands grew heavy; so they took a stone and put it under him)... thus his hands remained steady until the sun set.” (Ex. 17:12) Other kingdoms only wage war until the sixth hour of the day but a “wicked kingdom” wages war morning and night. Also Amalek is from the offspring of Esau. <br>מְהֵרָה תְעַקֵּר <b>“May they be quickly uprooted,”</b> is based on the verse, “In Your fury put an end to them; put an end to them that they be no more,” (Ps. 59:14) <br>וּתְשַׁבֵּר <b>“And smash,”</b> is based on the verse, “O break the power of the wicked and evil one.” (Ps. 10:15) <br>וְתַּכְנִ֑יעַ <b>“And subdue,”</b> is based on the verse, “I will subdue all your enemies.” (2 Chr. 17:10) Many people do not say וּתְשַׁבֵּר וְתַכְנִיעֵם but rather only תַּכְנִ֑יעַ. It is proper to say this because one should have the language of the concluding blessing juxtaposed to the final blessing. <br>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה', שׁוֹבֵר אוֹיְבִים וּמַכְנִֽיעַ זֵדִ֑ים   “Praised are you who smashes enemies and subsidies the arrogant,” is based on the verse, “You break the teeth of the wicked,” (Ps. 3:8) and “You subdued the heat ...” (Is. 25:5) <br>And if you wonder, how can we mention cursing the heretics and apostates in our prayers?

One day, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi took a rooster and placed it between the legs of the bed upon which he sat and looked at it. He thought: When the moment of God’s anger arrives, I will curse him and be rid of him. When the moment of God’s anger arrived, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi slept. When he woke up, he said to himself: Conclude from the fact that I nodded off that it is not proper conduct to do so, to curse people, even if they are wicked. “His mercy is over all His creations.’ (Psalms 145:9) is stated even with regard to sinners.</i>  (Pr. 17:25) Even if he is a sectarian? What is the reason? Scripture states, “God’s mercy is upon all of his creations,” (Ps. 145:9) One might answer that this only refers to curses that result in complete destruction, (or that are against a whole community). Or else, it may be because causing trouble is not grounds (for cursing one’s enemies) as the Talmud says there. Here, however, in our prayers, we do so for the honor of God because he denies God.

<b>And upon us, may Your mercy be aroused, <i>Adonai</i> our God:</b> is based on the verse,” Your yearning and Your love are being withheld from us.” (Is. 63:15).

<b>Cause the sprout of David, Your servant, to speedily flourish:</b> is based on the verse, “There I will make the horn for David to sprout;” (Ps. 132:17) <b>Raise his horn:</b> is based on, “His horn is exalted in honor.” (Ps. 112:9) The passage states <b>Your salvation</b> because the rebuilding of Jerusalem is the salvation brought about by the Omnipresent, as is stated, “And the very ends of earth shall see the salvation of our God.” Is. 52:10) <b>For Your deliverance we hope all day:</b> is based on, “I wait for Your deliverance…” (Gen 49:18) <b>All day</b> (should be understood as every day), based on the verse, “for You are God, my deliverer; it is You I look to every day.” (Ps. 25:5) One concludes with: <b>Praised are You, <i>Adonai,</i> Who causes to sprout the power</b> <i>(keren</i>) <b>of salvation.</b> As is stated, “On that day I will endow the House of Israel with strength (<i>keren</i>).” (Ez. 29:21)

There is no need to emphasize ourselves so much as if we were righteous, and to say God hears OUR prayers at all times. <b>And from Your Presence, our King, do not turn us away empty-handed:</b> based on, “Let not the downtrodden turn away disappointed” (Ps 74:21). It is as if to say, If we do not merit even a little do not turn us away empty handed with nothing but fulfill just a small part of our requests. <b>For You hear our prayers of every mouth</b> (<i>peh</i>): is based on the verse, “You hear prayer, and unto You all humankind shall come.: (Ps 65:3) There are those who explain that the numerical value of the word, <i>peh</i>, mouth, (85) is the same as <i>milah,</i> circumcision (85).

See <i>BT Sota</i> 21a – The Gemara asks: Does the merit of a mitzvah protect one so much as to delay her punishment? But isn’t it taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei interpreted this verse homiletically: “For the mitzvah is a lamp and the Torah is light” (Pro. 6:23). The verse associates the mitzvah with a lamp and the Torah with the light of the sun. The mitzvah is associated with a lamp in order to say to you: Just as a lamp does not protect one by its light extensively but only temporarily, while the lamp is in one’s hand, so too, a mitzvah protects one only temporarily, i.e., while one is performing the mitzvah. Also see Rashi on Pro.6:23</i> <b>Of life</b>: refers to <i>Torah</i>, as is stated, “For thereby you shall have long life.” (Deut. 30:20) <b>Love</b>: is based on, “With eternal love I have loved you.” (Jer. 31:3) <b>Kindliness, Righteousness:</b> is based on, “Bestow Your loving kindness on those devoted to You, and Your beneficence on upright people.” (Ps. 36:11) <b>And compassion, blessing and peace</b>: as we have explained above. <b>And good in Your sight to bless us:</b> in other words ‘may it be good in your sight.” <b>To bless your people Israel with much strength and peace,</b> :is based on, “May <i>Adonai</i> grant strength to His people; may <i>Adonai</i> bestow on His people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11) <b>Blessed are You, Adonai, who blesses His people Israel with peace</b>:as it is stated, “I will grant peace in the land.” (Lev. 26:6)
The reason the sages decreed that we bless Israel at the end of each <i>Amidah</i> prayer is that the <i>Amidah</i> is offered in place of the daily offering. We do so, just as the <i>Kohanim</i> blessed Israel after the daily offering, as it states, “Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them…” (Lev. 9:22) and is written,“Thus shall you bless the people of Israel.” (Nu. 6:23)
One then says, <b>May the words of my mouth be acceptable</b>… and afterwards, <b>May the One who makes peace in His high heavens</b>. One takes three steps back and bows because the Divine Presence is present with him and grants peace during these three steps, first to the left, the right hand of God, as it is written, “I am ever mindful of <i>Adonai</i>’s presence; He is at my right hand.” (Ps. 16:8) When one completes the three steps, one should stand still and not return immediately to his original position, for we read in <i>Yoma</i>, in the chapter, <i>Hotzeeu lo et hakaf</i> (Ch. 5): in the name of Rav Mordekhai. They said to him: Since he has taken three steps backward, he should stand there and not return to his place immediately. This is analogous to a student who takes leave from his teacher. If he returns immediately to the place where was first standing, he is like a dog who returns to its vomit. His final actions prove that he did not walk back to take leave of the master since he went back immediately. The Rif writes that he needs to remain in his place until the prayer leader begins and then he can return to his (original) place. There are those who say (he should remain in his place until the prayer leader recites the <i>Kedushah</i> – this is our practice. The Ra’avid writes that when a person prays alone he should wait for this amount of time. There is an allusion to the three steps in the verse, “the legs of each were a single rigid leg…” (Ez. 1:7) ורגליהם v’<i>ragleihem,</i> the legs, is two steps and ורגל v’<i>regel,</i> leg, is one step equaling three (steps). What is written afterwards, “the feet of each were like a single calf’s hoof…” (Ez. 1:7) is also equal to three; they are for his three steps returning to his place. One should take three steps forward as one did at the beginning.
There are some who have the custom before taking three steps or reciting, <b>My God, guard my tongue from evil</b>, based on the verse, “Guard your tongue from evil, your lips from deceitful speech.” (Ps. 34:14) Though good and evil are in the hands of the human being, one asks God to help us do good. <b>To those who curse me, may my soul be unresponsive</b>; This is the continuation of “Guard my tongue from evil;” that is, it is not enough that I ask that I have the merit of not speaking evil myself. Rather, I also ask You that may I have the merit of suffering the curses of others. This is the meaning of “Those who hear their insult and do not respond,” <sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">BT SHabbat 88b תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: עֲלוּבִין וְאֵינָן עוֹלְבִין, שׁוֹמְעִין חֶרְפָּתָן וְאֵינָן מְשִׁיבִין, עוֹשִׂין מֵאַהֲבָה וּשְׂמֵחִין בְּיִסּוּרִין — עֲלֵיהֶן הַכָּתוּב אוֹמֵר: ״וְאֹהֲבָיו כְּצֵאת הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ בִּגְבֻרָתוֹ״.</i> <b>And let my soul be like dust to all</b>: This is a continuation of the earlier expression, <b>And my lips from speaking deceitfully</b>. It is not enough that I ask You to prevent me from speaking falsely; I also ask that I be like dust before all who malign me. The reason for this allusion is that just as dust is tread beneath one’s feet and ascends to their heads, so too, those who humble themselves in this world will ascend to the world to come.
One goes on to say, <b>Open my heart to Your Torah:</b> as we learn in <i>Masechet Avodah Zarah,</i> “Depart from evil and do good” (Ps 34:15). Lest one say: I have kept my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile, I will go and indulge in sleep. To counter this possibility, the verse states: “Depart from evil, and do good,” And the word good means nothing other than <i>Torah</i>, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion; My Torah, do not abandon it” (Pro 4:2). <sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">BT Avodah Zarah 19b</i> But one who studies <i>Torah</i> but does not fulfill commandments has done nothing. Therefore we say, <b>And let my soul pursue Your commandments.</b> Since I pursue Your commandments, save me from those <b>who plan evil against me and pursue me</b>, as is stated, “And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Though they almost wiped me off the earth, I did not abandon Your precepts.” (Ps 119:86-7) For pursuing the commandments is helpful in abrogating the pursuit of those who hate us. Therefore we say immediately afterwards, <b>And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention</b>. one then says, <b>May they the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be acceptable, before You Adonai, my Rock and Redeemer.</b> We have already written about the reason for this verse at the beginning of the section on the <i>Shemonah Esray.</i> This petition is taught in <i>Berachot</i> at the beginning of the chapter <i>Hayah Korei.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 17a, the prayer is attributed to Mar Bar Ravinah</i>
There are some people who count the words in each blessing of the <i>Shemonah Esrai,</i> and then find verses from the Bible for each blessing with the same theme and the same number of words as the blessing. I originally did a count in this way, Afterwards, it occurred to me that there is no basis or root for this practice. There is no place in the world in which the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> is recited word for word, Rather some add words and others subtract, so that the number of words is not useful except for the one who recites it for himself. Why then should we trouble ourselves by counting them?
We read in <i>Masechet Megillah</i>, in the chapter <i>Hakorei et Ha-megillah</i> (Ch. 2): “The Sages taught in a <i>baraita</i>: From where is it derived that one says the <b>blessing of the Patriarchs</b>? It is stated: “Ascribe to the Lord, mighty ones'' (Ps. 29:1) From where is it derived that one then says the <b>blessing of mighty deeds</b>? It is stated in the continuation of that verse: “Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength” (Psalms 29:1). And from where is it derived that one then says the <b>blessing of holiness</b>? As it is stated: “Give to the Lord the glory due to His name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. And why did they see fit to place the <b>blessing of understanding</b> after holiness? As it is stated: “They shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall revere the God of Israel,” (Is. 29:23), and adjacent to that verse it is written: “They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding” (Is 29:24). And why did they see fit to say the <b>blessing of repentance</b> after the blessing of understanding? As it is written: “And they will understand with their heart, repent, and be healed” (Is. 6:10-11) If so, the blessing of healing should be said after the blessing of repentance. This should not enter your mind, as it is written: “And let him return to the Lord, and He will have compassion upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon” (Is, 55:7) But what did you see to rely on this verse? Rely on the other verse, which juxtaposes repentance to healing. There is another verse, which states: “Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, Who redeems your life from the pit” (Ps. 103:3–4) Is that verse coming to say that the blessings of redemption and healing should be placed following the <b>blessing of forgiveness</b>? But isn’t it written: “Repent, and be healed” (Is. 6:10), which suggests that repentance should be followed by healing? That verse is referring not to the literal healing, but rather to the figurative healing (brought about by) forgiveness.

Rely rather on the other verse, which indicates that it is the Priestly Benediction that should be juxtaposed with the sacrificial service. It stands to reason to have the blessing of thanksgiving immediately following the blessing of the sacrificial service, since the sacrificial service and thanksgiving, are one matter.
And why did they see fit to place the blessing of Peace after the Priestly Benediction? It is written after the Priestly Benediction: “And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them” (Nu. 6:27). The blessing of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is peace, as it is stated: “The Lord blesses His people with peace” (Ps. 29:11)....beyond this it is prohibited to declare the praises of the Holy Onemby adding additional blessings. As Rabbi Elazar said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who can declare all His praise?” (Ps. 106:2)? It means: For whom is it fitting to utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Only for one who can declare all His praise…. What is the meaning of that which is written: “For You silence is praise” (Ps. 65:2)? The best remedy of all is silence. <sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">BT Megillah 17b-18a</i> But if one recites even the order of Vidui of Yom Kippur after the Amida, one should recite it with a formal blessing.

12. And not the sectarians that emit a noxious odor.
13. “They who sit in his shade shall be revived,” (Hos. 14:8) is for <b>Upon the righteous, upon the pious</b>, as it is stated, “O you who dwell in the shelter of the Most High and abide in the protection of Shaddai.” (Ps 91:1)
14. “They shall bring to life new grain,” (Hos. 14:8) is for, <b>Builder of Jerusalem</b>, as it states, “Your belly is like a heap of wheat…” (Song 7:3) and “He endows your realm with peace,and satisfies you with choice wheat.” (Ps. 147:14)
15. “They shall blossom like the vine,” (Hos. 14:8) is for <b>The sprout of David</b>, as it is said, “He tethers his ass to a vine, His ass’s foal to a choice vine,” (Gen 49:11) and, “You plucked up a vine from Egypt;” (Ps. 80:9) It compares David and Jerusalem to bread and wine, as it says, “And King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine;” (Gen. 14:18)

The first six are for the individual. They open with <b>Who Bestows knowledge (1)</b> which is a person’s essential (need), as it is stated, “The fear of <i>Adonai</i> is the beginning of knowledge.” (Pro. 1:7) The Sages say, “If you acquire knowledge, what do you lack? If you lack knowledge, what have you acquired?” <sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Leviitcus Rabbah 1:6</i> “Rebbe <sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi is often simply referred to in the Talmud as Rebbe.</i> said: I wonder why they eliminated the blessing of knowledge on Shabbat; if there is no knowledge, where does prayer come from?” <sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">JT Berachot 4:4</i> “Anyone without knowledge, it is forbidden to have compassion upon him, as it is stated: “For they are a people of no wisdom, so their Creator will have no compassion upon them.” (Is. 27:11). <sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 33a</i> One says (that God is) the Bestower of knowledge because when God gives knowledge it is the way of graciousness and supplication to give good before Him.
When one has understanding one will return in repentance, <b>(2)</b> and afterwards will ask forgiveness <b>(3)</b> for one’s sins and rebellion. Then one will ask to be saved from suffering and from his enemies <b>(4)</b> for when God is pleased that a person has followed his ways, his enemies will make peace with him. A person's sins cause him to be hated in the eyes of people. And one’s sins are more harsh than sicknesses of the body, one asks for relief for suffering before healing of the body and limbs <b>(5)</b> since they too become ill because of his sins. This is also written in Scripture, “I said, “Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.” (Ps. 41:5) It is also written, ““If you will heed <i>Adonai</i> your God diligently…I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon Egypt, for I am Adonai your healer.” (Ex. 15:26) After the redemption of his soul and the healing of the body, one asks for livelihood, so that body and soul will be blessed with plenty.
<b>(6)</b> After asking for the needs of the individual, one asks for the needs of the many. Sound the Shofar to raise the banner for our freedom <b>(7)</b> is the first for the people of Israel and is parallel to Who Bestows Knowledge, <b>(1)</b> for the sages said, “Anyone with knowledge, it is as if the Holy Temple was built in his days; knowledge was placed between two letters and the Temple was placed between two letters, signifying that they stand together as Scripture states, “For God of knowledge is the Lord.” (I Sam. 2:3) <sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 33a</i> Afterwards, one says, Return our judges <b>(8)</b> is parallel to Let us return <b>(2)</b>; it is a sign that after the ingathering of the exiles judges are appointed, as is written in Scripture, “The people of Judah and the people of Israel shall assemble together and appoint one head over them.” (Hos. 2:2) Afterwards comes the blessing on the heretics <b>(9)</b> parallel to the blessing of forgiveness for sin <b>(3)</b> since they cause others to sin and are judged by the proper judges. Then, And so May the righteous <b>(10)</b> is parallel to the Redeemer of Israel <b>(4)</b> because the righteous see the affliction that is among them and they are zealous to redeem the people from their troubles. Builder of Jerusalem <b>(11)</b> is parallel to Heal us <b>(5)</b> as is written, “<i>Adonai</i> rebuilds Jerusalem…He heals their broken hearts,” (Ps. 1472-3) The sprout of David (12) comes after the building of Jerusalem is parallel to the blessing of prosperity <b>(6)</b> which is the sprout of the field. When there is a new king in the land, it is blessed as is stated in Scripture, “The tillage of the poor yields much food,” (Pro. 13:23) and, “who secures justice for those who are wronged, gives food to the hungry.” (Ps. 146:7) Afterwards one says, Who hears the prayers. <b>(13)</b> parallel to all the blessings of the <i>Amidah..</i>
Know that a previous blessing is better than the one that comes after it and its value is greater than the blessing which follows it. And so, the first blessing (among the intermediate blessings) is Bestower of Knowledge (4) (is better than the one that follows – repentance) , since there can be no repentance (5) if there is no knowledge because and, one cannot know the difference between good and evil. Similarly, if there is no repentance, what use is forgiveness for sin (6) since the person can transgress and commit sins every day. And if there is no forgiveness for sins, then one’s enemies and troubles will not be eliminated (7) as is said, “Hoi! Assyria is the rod of My anger...” (Is. 10:5) And what use is one’s health (8) if one is pursued by his enemies. Similarly, what use is one’s wealth (9) if one is sick and afflicted. Thus one learns that forgiveness is greater than livelihood by three levels and the acquisition of knowledge is greater than livelihood by five levels. <sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Forgiveness – is the third of the intermediate blessings is better than livelihood by three levels – knowledge, repentance and forgiveness. Similarly, knowledge, the fourth blessing is superior to repentance, forgiveness,troubles, healing and livelihood.</i> Therefore one should pursue these blessings according to their relative standing. If one travels a mile for his livelihood he is obligated to travel six miles to learn <i>Torah</i>. One who suffers travails and humiliation in order not to lose money is obligated twice as much in order not to sin and if he wishes to be a repentant twice that. Similarly, the beginning of redemption is the ingathering of the exiles. When they are gathered together, they will appoint judges to destroy the wicked. Then “the righteous seeing it will rejoice,” (Job 22:19) and the Divine Presence will dwell in Israel and then the offspring of David (the Messiah) will come. You are taught that the ingathering of the exiles precedes the offspring of David by many steps. So ends his words.

Amidah Repetition



Laws of Prayer



Post Amidah

The entire congregation performs <i>Nefilat Apayim</i>, (lit., falling on the face) on one’s left side, lifting one’s right side.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Shulchan Aruch, Orech Chaim 131:1 – One should not speak between [the Amidah] Prayer and Nefilat Apayim. When one "falls on his face", the custom is to lean [on] one's left [arm]. <b>Rem’a:</b> And some say to lean [on] one's right [arm]. But the correct way is that during Shacharit when he is wearing tefillin on his left arm, he should lean on his right arm because of honor for the tefillin. But [towards] the evening (ie. when doing Nefilat Apayim during Mincha), or when he is not wearing tefillin on his left, he should lean on his left [arm].</i> One recites Psalm 25, “Of David, I set my hope on You, <i>Adonai</i>...” One adds, prior to the Psalm, “Merciful and Gracious One, we sinned before you – have mercy on us and save us.” Psalm 25 was written by David as an alphabet acrostic; there are three letters missing at the beginning of verses. The spell <b>בוק</b>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Nachum 2:11 See BDB – <b>n.f. emptiness</b>, Na 2:11 וּמְבֻלָּקָה בּוּקה וּמְבוּקָה <i>emptiness and void and waste</i>.</i> This word means ‘empty,’ referring to one who lacks repentance and good deeds, and is an apostate as is stated, “Let the faithless be disappointed, empty handed.: (Ps. 25:3) He wishes to say that he was empty handed without repentance or good deeds. This Psalm was composed by King David who returned in repentance and prayed but did not wish to be reminded that he had been an apostate. Even so, King David repented and was healed by the holy spirit. This is hinted at in the Psalm; there are three letters that appear at the beginning of verses twice: ‘א’ר’פ – these letters of spell <i>refuah,</i> רפואה healing. We find the word <i>refuah</i>, in connection with repentance, as in, “I will heal their affliction, generously will I take them back in love.” (Hos. 14:5) Some also recite other Psalms, each according to his choice and opinion.
Afterwards, the prayer leader recites <i>Aveenu Malkaynu</i>, “Our Father, Our King – You are our Father. Our Father, Our King, we have no king, besides You….” the reason we say this after the <i>Amida</i> is because of a passage in <i>Taanit</i>. “There was an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer, who descended before the ark to serve as prayer leader on a fast day. And he recited twenty-four blessings, but he was not answered. Rabbi Akiva descended before the ark after him and said: “Our Father, our King, we have no king other than You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake, have mercy on us.” And rain immediately fell.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">BT Taanit 25b</i>
We then say, “We do not know what to do…” (ii Chron. 20:12),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Full verse: “O our God, surely You will punish them, for we are powerless before this great multitude that has come against us, and do not know what to do, but our eyes are on You.”</i> a verse in Second Chronicles. We recite selected verses from Psalms. The reason for reciting “We do not know what to do…” (2 Chron. 20:12) is that we have already acted as Moses did when he went up on Mount Sinai to receive the <i>Torah</i>. First it states, “and I stayed on the mountain” (Deut. 9:18) This is the language of yeshiva, sitting or remaining; then it states, “I threw myself down before Adonai,” (Deut. 9:18) So we begin with <i>Pesukei D’Zimra</i>, while sitting. Afterwards, we recite the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>, while standing; and then we performed <i>Nefilat Apaim</i>, by falling on our face. This is the meaning of "We do not know what to do…” (2 Chron. 20:12) We do not know what other prayers to offer, so we say We do not know what to do. 
Afterwards the prayer leader rises and recites the <i>Kaddish</i> through <i>L’eilah</i>.
Afterwards, one recites <i>Ashrei,</i> “Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house…”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 84:5. This verse, along with Psalms 144:15, introduce Psalm 145 in the daily liturgy.</i> It is customary to recite Psalm 145 three times each day.

We learn in the first chapter of <i>Berachot,</i> “Rabbi Elazar said that Rabbi Chaninah said: Anyone who recites: “A Psalm of David” (Ps. 145) every day is assured a place in the World to Come. What is the reason? Some say it is because this psalm is arranged alphabetically… <b><i>Perush</i></b>, <b><i>meaning,</i></b><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Peirush,</i> meaning, signifies that the author is adding some explanation into the Talmudic passage being quoted here.

Rather, (if you say we recite this chapter) because it contains “You open Your hand…” (Ps. 145:16) <b><i>Perush,</i></b><i> teaching us that God has the purpose and the ability and the compassion to find every creature from the wild oxen to the tiniest lice.</i>  “Then let him recite the Great <i>Hallel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Great Hallel refers to Psalm 136 in which each verse concludes with the refrain, <i>Ki l”olam hasdo,</i> “For His lovingkindness is forever.”</i> (Ps. 136), in which it is written, “Who provides food to all flesh, Whose kindness endures forever” (Ps. 136:25).”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See BT <i>Berachot</i> 4b.Abudraham attributes this statement to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Chaninah while the Talmud attributes it to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Avinah.

The <i>Geonim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><b><i>Geonim</i></b> were the presidents of the two great Babylonian Talmudic Academies of Sura and Pumbedita in the Abbasid Caliphate, and were the generally accepted spiritual leaders of the Jewish community worldwide in the early medieval era, in contrast to the <i>Resh Galuta</i> (exilarch) who wielded secular authority over the Jews in Islamic lands. (Wikipedia)</i> explain that if one did not have proper concentration (<i>kavanah</i>) at least when saying, “You open Your hands…” (Ps. 145:16) one must go back and repeat it again. The sages said, “He is assured of a place in the World to come,” not because this is the only commandment through which a person merits a place in the World to Come. Rather if the commandments are equally balanced this additional commandment would tip the balance favorably. It teaches us that this is like the other commandments. This is because it is entirely about praise and thanksgiving to the Omnipresent who is the provider of the world. God in His mercy provides all beings with their needs. One who says this with proper intention certainly has a lowly spirit.
We learn in <i>Perek Eyn Omdim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5 of Berachot, See <i>BT Brachot</i> 30b</i> from the verses added at the before the Psalm, “Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house,” that a person must wait one hour before he recites the Amida so that his mind can be calmed and concentrate his heart. We also add, “And we will bless God from now forever. Hallelujah,” to make known that (the one who recites this psalm) is a recipient of the World that is Coming. This is (the meaning) of, “From now and forever.” Also, (we do so) in order to conclude with Hallelujah and to juxtapose Hallelujah with Hallelujah in all of the following Psalms through “Let every soul praise God. Hallelujah.” (Psalm 150) These psalms begin and end with Hallelujah.
We find in the first chapter of <i>Brachot</i>, “Why is there no verse in the <i>ashrei beginning</i> with the letter nun? Because it alludes to the downfall of the enemies of Israel, (this is an euphemism for the people of Israel). As it is written: “Fallen, not to rise again, is he virgin of Israel” (Amos 5:2)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the verse begins with the letter nun, the missing letter in the Ashrai.   נָֽפְלָה֙ לֹא־תוֹסִ֣יף ק֔וּם בְּתוּלַ֖ת יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל נִטְּשָׁ֥ה עַל־אַדְמָתָ֖הּ אֵ֥ין מְקִימָֽהּ׃</i> <b><i>Perush -</i></b><i> David did not want to add this praise since he saw with the divine spirit that a time would come when a prophet would prophecy the downfall of Israel.</i> “In the West, (in Eretz Yisrael) they interpreted the verse, “She has fallen but she shall fall no more; rise, virgin of Israel.” Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak adds: Even so, David went and provided support, through divine inspiration<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">BT Brachot 4b The verse from Amos is</i> as we see in the following verse, “The Lord upholds the fallen and raises up those who are bowed down” (Ps. 145:14).

The <i>Midrash</i> asks, why do all the verses of the <i>Ashrei</i> have a <i>vav</i> in the middle except two: <b>חַ</b>נּ֣וּן וְרַח֣וּם יְהֹוָ֑ה <b>אֶ֥</b>רֶךְ אַ֝פַּ֗יִם וּגְדׇל־חָֽסֶד “<i>Adonai</i> is gracious and compassionate…” (Ps. 145:8) and, <b>קָ</b>ר֣וֹב יְ֭הֹוָה לְכׇל־קֹרְאָ֑יו <b>לְ</b>כֹ֤ל אֲשֶׁ֖ר יִקְרָאֻ֣הוּ בֶֽאֱמֶֽת “Adonai is near to all who call Him…” (Ps. 145:18)?

Afterwards, we recite, <i>laminatzeach mizmor lidavid</i> (Ps. 20). The reason the sages decreed the recitation of this Psalm at the end of the prayer service appears in <i>Midrash Tehillim</i>: Rabbi Shimon bar Aba said: You find that there are eighteen psalms from the beginning of Psalms through this passage, if, “Happy is the man,” (Ps. 1) and “Why do nations assemble,” (Ps. 2) are counted as single psalm.

Just as a person says to a fellow, “May God answer your prayers.” So, too, after David recited eighteen songs and praises, he said, <b>“May Adonai answer you in time of trouble,”</b> (Ps. 20:2) This is also found in the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">JT Berachot 4:3</i> This Psalm addresses the end of time, as it states, “May <i>Adonai</i> answer you in time of trouble,” (Ps. 20:2) and it states in Daniel, “It will be a time of trouble….” (Dan. 12:1) <b>“May He send you help from the sanctuary,”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Passages quoted from the liturgy generally appear in bold printing.</i></b> (Ps. 20:3)- this refers to the Messiah <i>ben</i> David, <b>“Now I know that <i>Adonai</i> will give victory to His anointed,”</b> (Ps. 20:7) <b>“This trust in chariots…”</b> (Ps. 20:8) referring to Gog and Magog,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 38 and 39</i> <b>“They collapse and fall, but we rise up and gather strength.”</b> (Ps. 20:9) That is why it is customary to recite it in conjunction with the passage containing the <i>Kedusha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This passage is often referred to as <i>Kedusha D’sidra.</i> It is an additional recitation of the Kedusha in the passage <i>U’va Letzion</i>.

Midrash Tehillim states “There are nine verses in Psalm 20 corresponding to the nine months of pregnancy.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">It is nine verses not counting the opening introductory verse LaMnatzeach…</i> "It is like a pregnant woman who has difficulty giving birth. They said to her, "We do not know what to say to you, but whoever answered your mother in her difficult time will answer you in your difficult time."<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tehilim</i> 20:2</i> So, too David said, regarding Jacob, it is written, “The one who answered Jacob, your father, in his time of trouble, the God of Jacob will keep you safe in the time of trouble.” Further, this Psalm begins with aniyah (answer) and it ends with aniyah (answer). It begins with aniyah: “<b>May Adonai answer you (ya’ankha) in times of trouble…</b>” (Ps. 20:2) and it ends, “<b>The Sovereign will answer us (ya’aneinu) on the day that we call out.”</b> (Ps. 20:10)
On the Shabbat and holidays we do not recite it because the Psalm is a supplication and it begins “May Adonai answer you at the time of trouble.” Shabbat and festivals are not ‘days of trouble,’ but rather joyous days
One recites <i>Seder Kedushah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Ashrai, Laminatzeach and Uva Letziyon</i> are referred to as Seder Kedushah. It is often referred to as <i>Kedusha D’Sidra</i> today</i> beginning with: <b>“He shall come as redeemer to Zion…”</b> and <b>“And this shall be My covenant with them…”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues in Isaiah and in the prayerbook: “…My spirit which is upon you, and the words which I have placed in your mouth, shall not be absent from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your children, nor from the mouth of your children’s children—said Adonai —from now on, for all time.</i> (Is. 59:20-21) These two verses appear together in the book of Isaiah. The reason, “And this shall be My covenant with them,” appears with, “He shall come as redeemer to Zion,” is because they speak of the spirit of prophecy which shall never leave Israel; this will be true with the coming of the Redeemer as is stated, “After that, I will pour out My spirit on all flesh; Your sons and daughters shall prophesy.” (Joel 3:1)
<b>And You, Holy One, await (<i>yoshev</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is usually translated as “enthroned upon the praises of Israel,” but Abudraham offers a different interpretation of the verse based on Deuteronomy 1:46.</i> the praises of Israel.</b> (Ps. 22:4) The word <i>Yoshev</i> is similar to the language in the verse, “Thus, after you had remained (vateishvu) at <i>Kadesh</i> all that long time…” (Deut. 1:46) It means God waits for Israel’s praises before accepting the praises of the angels, as is stated in <i>Hulin</i> (Perek Gid HaNasheh) “And the ministering angels do not recite their song above until the Jewish people complete their praises below, as is stated<b>:</b> “When the morning stars sang together” (Job 38:7); these are the Jewish people, (who are compared to stars); and then the verse states: “And all the sons of God shouted for joy,” these are the angels.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>CHullin</i> 91b</i> The Sages also explain, “And You, Holy One, are enthroned on (await) the praises of Israel. (Ps. 22:4) This means that the Holy One waits until the very last congregation of Israel has finished praying So God can receive all their prayers at once.
<b>“And [the angels] call one to another and say…”</b> is the verse. (Is. 6:3) U’mikablin dain me’dain v’amrin, “And they receive one from another, and say,” <b></b>is the Aramaic translation.
<b>Holy in the heights of heaven, the abode of God’s Divine Presence.</b> Rabbi Moshe Kohen explains that God is separate and apart from the world of heavenly spheres (<i>galgalim</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Olam HaGalalim</i> is one of three worlds: <i>Olam HaShafel</i> – the lower world in which we live, <i>Olam HaGalgalim</i> – the world of heavenly spheres that surround this world, and <i>Olam HaMalachim</i>, the World of the angels. <i>Olam HaGalgalim</i> mediates between this world and the world of the angels – it should not be confused with the notion of <i>Sephirot</i>.</i> The abode of the Divine Presence is present in the world of heavenly spheres and not human beings. Only the prophets can instruct people regarding the heavenly spheres and their movements which are different from one another. They know that there is a Mover who is responsible for the actions of these spheres and this is the Palace of the Divine Presence (<i>Shechintei</i>). It is similar to what is stated, “The One who is enthroned in Heaven.” (Ps. 123:1) God forbid that we should say that the dwelling place for the Divine Presence is present in it; it is separated from the world of spheres.
<b>Holy on earth, the work of His mighty power.</b> It states, <b></b>how much more so is God apart and separate from the world of elements. But, “the work of His mighty power,” is present as well. The wise person recognizes the activities of the heavenly Spheres (galgalim) in this world and all the components of the world fit together without any change… Even more so. He sees the wonder of God in the plants among all things. In a small place on the earth they go forth and many types of plants grow that are not the same as one another but are similar to those found in other places. The earth brings them forth some on land and some in the waters.
<b>Holy in the world of eternity.</b> That is, God’s holiness extends to the world of the angels which is completely separate from the other worlds. If one were to say since the realm of the angels is so completely separated from this world, how could one perceive their influence on the action of human beings, therefore the passage goes on to say, The God of hosts says, <b>“The whole earth is filled with the radiance of His glory,”</b> so that one can never avoid God’s rulership and providence, as Scripture states, “whose eyes observe all the ways of men,” (Jer. 32:19) Most people read this passage as, <i>Kadish l’olam u’l’almei almayah</i>, “Holy forever and to all eternity.” This is incorrect. One should say <i>Bolam almayah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">קַדִּישׁ לְעָלַם וּלְעָלְ֒מֵי עָלְ֒מַיָּא Note that the text is our Siddurim are different from Abudraham’s Siddur: קדיש בעלם עלמיא</i> This is the version in the Siddur of Rav Amram and Rabbeinu Saadia Gaon.
It is the custom to recite <i>Seder Kedushah</i> silently because of the verse, “Adonai will reign forever and ever,” (Ex. 15:18) which Moses said. It would have been appropriate to recite it first and yet it was placed last in the order of the <i>Kedushot</i> in which sovereignty is placed at the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The recitation of the word <i>Kadosh</i> is a reference to sovereignty. See the interpretation above of the word Kadosh in the Aramaic translation of the Kedushah. “Holy on earth, the work of His mighty power.”</i> Therefore the first verses are recited by the prayer leader out loud along with their Aramaic translation but the verse, “<i>Adonai</i> will reign forever and ever,” is recited silently.
One might ask, why is it that we recite the verse “<i>Adonai</i> will reign forever and ever,” in the <i>Seder Kedushah</i> which Moses said in Aramaic while we say “<i>Adonai</i> will reign forever,” standing (and not in Aramaic) in the Kedusha, which David recited?<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Adonai will reign forever; Your God, Zion, throughout all generations! Praise God. (Psalm 146:10)</i> The answer is, we translate Moses’ verse into Aramaic because there is an Aramaic translation but there is no Targum for the book of the Writings.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">While there are other Aramaic translations of Ketuvim, we do not have <i>Targum Onkelos</i>.</i>
I have learned, in the name of the R’ash<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Asher ben Jehiel, also called the Rosh (born c. 1250, Germany i Oct. 24, 1327, Toledo, Spain), major codifier of the Talmud, the rabbinical compendium of law, lore, and commentary. His work was a source for the great codes of his son Jacob ben Asher (1269–1340) and of Joseph Karo (1488–1575).</i>, who said that he had a tradition regarding the Aramaic translation “Adonai shall reign forever….” (Ps 146:10) that a Divine voice went forth and said to Jonathan ben Ovadia (author of an Aramaic translation). “Who is this who reveals my secrets to human beings before me that there is a Messiah in the end of time?”
The reason that we recite <i>Seder Kedushah</i> toward the end of prayer is for the common people who show up late. In this way they don’t lose out hearing the <i>Kedushah.</i> For we read, at the end of <i>Sotah</i>, “Why does the world continue to exist? Because of the <i>Seder Kedushah</i> and because of the response: <i>Yehai shmai rabbah</i>, “Let His great name be blessed, etc.” which is recited after the study of <i>Aggadah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Sota 49a</i> That is why we translate <i>Seder Kedushah</i> into Aramaic – for the common people who did not know Hebrew but spoke Aramaic at that time, as we explained regarding the <i>Kaddish.</i>
The sages decreed this as abridged form of the <i>Amida</i> beginning with the <i>Ashrai,</i> and afterwards the <i>Kedushah, Zichron tziyon</i>, and Torah study, just as they decreed on Sabbath eve that we recite an abridged form of the seven blessings of the Amidah for those who showed up in synagogue late. I have also counted God’s name eighteen times corresponding to the eighteen blessings of the <i>Amidah.</i> The reason we do not say it on the Sabbath and holidays as part of the morning service is because everyone shows up in time for the first <i>Amidah</i>. It is therefore customary to recite it on Sabbath and holidays at Mincha. This was because there would be a homily on these days before <i>Mincha</i> and they would regularly conclude the discourse with verses expressing redemption and holiness. The common people would all come to hear the discourse.
The reason that it is customary to recite <i>U’va letzion</i> at the conclusion of <i>Shabbat</i> is because it is the time when the wicked re-enter <i>Gehenom</i>, as we shall explain in its proper place. We prolong the Sabbath with the recitation of <i>Seder Kedushah</i> in order to give the wicked more respite (from the fires of hells). We do not begin with the opening verses of <i>U’va letzion</i> on Saturday evening. Instead one begins with <i>V’attah Kadosh</i> since evenings are not a time of redemption. The nations should not say that the Jewish people fled at night like thieves instead of in the daytime before the eyes of all the nations, as is said regarding the redemption from Egypt, “On that very day…” (Ex 12:41) The Exodus happened in the daytime.
It is customary to recite <i>U’va Letzion</i> on the eve of Purim and Tisha B’av. One recites <i>U’va letzion</i> on Purim because we were redeemed from our enemies and those who sought to harm us; therefore we mention redemption on the night as the holiday begins. Also it is customary to mention consolation and the redemption of Zion on the eve of <i>Tisha B’Av</i>. Further, (we do so) since we begin with dirges and end with consolation, and we end with <i>U'va Letzion</i>. In this way we juxtapose <i>U'va Letzion goel</i> with <i>U’va letzion goel.</i>
We say, <b>Adonai, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever as the intention of the hearts of Your people…</b> Is from 1 Chronicles 29:18. It expresses the hope that our recitation of <i>Seder Kedushah</i> will direct our thoughts and hearts to (to God). One recites a selection of verses. 
One says, <b>Blessed is our God, Who created us for His glory…</b> based on, “I have created them, and made them for My glory” (Is. 43:7) This means, God made them to praise Him and this is God’s glory.
<b>He set us apart from those who go astray…</b>This is based on the following verse “I have set you apart from other peoples to be Mine.” (Lev. 20:26) and “And the confused shall acquire insight.” (Is. 29:24) <sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This understanding of Lev. 20:26 is based on Unkoles’ interpretation of the verse. “When the nations strayed after the works of their hands, Elohim brought me close to His worship from my father’s house,” The translation of the Aramaic is from Sefaria.</i>
<b>He gave us the Torah of truth,</b> is based on, “Your teaching is True,” (Ps. 119:142) <b>And eternal life He implanted within</b> Is based on, “She is a tree of life to those who grasp her…” (Pro. 3:18) This is hinted at because this verse uses the word <i>netiyah</i>, implanted for eternal life.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Eternal life is implanted just as the tree of life is planted.</i>
<b>May He open our heart to His Torah,</b> This is a rabbinic expression. <b>He instilled in our heart awe of Him,</b> is based on the verse, “Revere only your God,” (Deut. 6:13, 10:20) Although reverence for God is our choice, (whether one is righteous or wicked,) as the sages say, “Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven,”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 33b</i> one can ask God to help us along the way, as the sages say, “When one who comes to be purified, heaven assists him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">BT Shabbat 104a</i>
<b>And to do His will,</b> based on the passage, “To do what pleases You, my God, is my desire…” (Ps. 40:9) <b>And serve Him with a perfect heart,</b> based on the passage, “Serving God with all your heart,” (Deut. 11:13) <b>So that we shall not labor in vain nor bring forth that which causes dismay i</b>s based on the verse, “They shall not toil to no purpose; “They shall not bear children in vain,” (Is 65:23) <b>May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,</b> this is a rabbinic expression.
<b>That we keep Your statutes in this world,</b> based on the verse, “Would that my ways were firm in keeping Your laws.” (Ps 119:5) It says this world because this is the world of action and through which we may merit and inherent goodness and blessing for the life of the world to come. It concludes this subject with other verses from Psalms. The prayer leader then recites <i>Kaddish Titkabel.</i>
It is customary to recite <i>Tefilah LeDavid</i> (Ps 86) on the six weekdays because it states, “Teach me Your ways, Adonai,” (Ps. 86:11) and to add other verses of supplication and entreaty. <i>Bikol Tachanuti,</i> “The voice of my supplication” is written beginning with a <i>veit.</i> <b>There is none like You among the gods (<i>veilohim), Adonai</i>.</b>” (Ps. 86:8) is written with a soft <i>veit.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The word באלהים is written without a dagesh, a dot in the letter ב even though the first letter of the word כְּֽמַעֲשֶֽׂיךָ is written with a dagesh.</i> “(<i>Vayiru</i>) that my enemies may see and be frustrated,” is written with a <i>vav.</i>
It is also customary to recite a psalm for each day of the week just as the Levites did in the Temple. 
On the first day, Sunday, they would recite, <b>“A psalm of David: the earth is Adonoy's and the fullness thereof,</b>” (Ps 24:1) because “because on that day God acquired the world and transferred it to man, and He was the only ruler in His world.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Rosh Hashanah 31a All of the following statements regarding the days of the week are taken from this passage</i>
On the second day of the week, Monday, one recites, <b>“A song, a psalm by the sons of Korach. Adonai is great and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary.”</b> (Ps. 48:1) because “He separated His works, dividing between the upper waters and the lower waters, and ruled over them as King, ascending on high to His throne.”
On the third day of the week, Tuesday, one says, <b>“A psalm of Assaf God stands in the congregation of the Almighty, in the midst of the judges He gives judgment,</b>” (Ps. 82:1) because, because on the third day of Creation God revealed the land in His wisdom and thereby prepared the world for His assembly that could now live on the dry land.”
On the fourth day of the week, Wednesday, one says, <b>“Almighty of vengeance, Adonai, Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself,”</b> (Ps. 94:1) because on this day God created the sun, the moon and the stars and in the future God will avenge those who worship them.
On the fifth day of the week, Thursday, one says, “<b>To Him Who grants victory, upon the Gittit, a psalm of Assaf: Sing joyously to God, our strength, shout for joy to the God of Jacob,”</b> (Ps. 81:1) because on this day God created the birds and the fish to praise God’s name.
On the sixth day of the week, Friday, one says, “<b>Adonai has begun His reign, with majesty He has clothed Himself; Adonai clothed Himself, with strength He has girded Himself,”</b> (Ps. 93) because on this day God created the work of creation and ruled over them.
On the seventh day of the week, Shabbat, we recite “<b>A Psalm, a song, for the Sabbath day,”</b> (Ps 92) because God rested on that day.
A mnemonic for the six weekdays is לש"ם אל"י In the name of my God. One then says the Kaddish, “May His great Name be blessed forever and for all eternity.” and then the community takes leave with blessings of peace.
In some places it is customary to recite, <b>“For the leader; with instrumental music. A psalm. A song. May God be gracious to us and bless us…”</b> (Ps. 67) during the period of <i>Sefirat HaOmer</i>, because it contains 49 words excluding the introductory phrase. They correspond to the 49 days of the <i>Omer</i>. Further there are seven verses excluding the opening verse, for the seven weeks leading up to Shavuot. In some places it is customary to recite it every day since it is called the Psalm of the <i>Menorah.</i> One who recites it every day is considered to be like one who kindles the menorah in the Holy Temple and receive the face of the Divine Presence, since the Psalm has seven verses corresponding to the seven branches and 49 like the number of cups (<i>gaviim</i>), calyxes (<i>kaftorim</i>), petals (<i>perachim</i>) and candles (<i>neirot</i>) in the seven branches of the menorah:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 25:31</i> There are 22 cups, 9 petals and 11 calyxes and 7 candles equaling 49…. There are four words in the first verse corresponding to the two tongs and the two firepans. (Ex. 25:38)
In some places where it is customary to recite <b>Shir HaMaalot LiDavid…</b> (Ps. 124). One adds verses from Psalms at the end of it. One says, “There is none like <i>Adonai…</i>” (I Sam. 2:2) “Truly, who is a god except <i>Adonai</i>…” (Ps 18:32)
One says, Eyn Keloheinu…”There is none like our God,” through “You will deliver us…You are Adonai, our God, that our Forefathers burned before You the incense spices at the time that the Holy Temple stood – like You commanded them through Moses, Your Prophet, as is written in your Torah: “And Adonai said to Moses, ‘Take for yourself spices…” (Ex. 30:34) One recites <i>pithom haKetoret, keitzad,</i> <b>The compound of the Incense, how was it done?</b> The <i>Targum Yerushalmi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Targum refers to the Aramaic translation of the Torah.

What does the verse teach? Has it not already been stated: “And you shall grind some of it finely” (Ex. 30:36)? Rather, it teaches that on <i>Yom Kippur</i> the incense must be superfine by returning it to the grinder.”<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">BT Yoma 45a</i>
There are eleven types of ingredients (in the incense.) Four are explicitly mentioned in the <i>Torah: nataf</i> (balsam sap), shach'elet (onycha), <i>h'elbona (</i>galbanum),&amp; l<i>evona zachah</i> (pure frankincense). (Ex. 30:34) The remainder are traditions passed on from Moses at Sinai. Our sages of blessed memory, based them on the verse which states, “<b>Take unto thee spices -</b> This is two<b>;</b> <b>n<i>ataf, shach'elet, h'elbona</i></b> – this makes five; <b>sweet spices -</b> to include other spices adding up to ten; <b>with pure frankincense</b> – this makes eleven. The second <i>samim,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">When the sages find a word in the plural the rabbis assume that it is equal to two; yet here the second time the word appears it is said to be equal to five:וַיֹּ֩אמֶר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֜ה קַח־לְךָ֣ סַמִּ֗ים נָטָ֤ף ׀ וּשְׁחֵ֙לֶת֙ וְחֶלְבְּנָ֔ה סַמִּ֖ים וּלְבֹנָ֣ה זַכָּ֑ה בַּ֥ד בְּבַ֖ד יִהְיֶֽה׃ The word spices here, samim is plural and the smallest possible plurality would be two.</i> spices, should be like the first samim, spices. Just as the first reference to spices signifies two, so the second reference to spices should also be equal to two. But then the same word would have been repeated. In the end it suggests that the second use of the word <i>samim,</i> spices, is different because it reflects the combination of the first use of the word along with <i>nataf, shach'elet,</i> and <i>h'elbona</i>  – the second use of the word is therefore, five.
<b>And these are the spices: balsam</b> (<i>tzari</i>) <b>-</b> this is the <i>nataf</i> which is mentioned in the <i>Torah.</i> It is called <i>nataf</i> because it is the resin that drips from balsam trees, as is explained later: “Rabban Shimeon Son of Gamliel says : The <i>Tzorit</i> is sap that flows from the Balsam tree.”
<i>Tziporen</i> is the <i>shachelet</i> (onycha), It is translated into Aramaic as <i>torfa.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See The onycha of antiquity cannot be determined with certainty. The original Hebrew word used for this component of the ketoret was שחלת, shecheleth, which means "to roar; as a lion (from his characteristic roar)" or “peeling off by concussion of sound." Shecheleth is related to the Syriac shehelta which is translated as “a tear, distillation, or exudation.” the Greek word “onycha” which means "fingernail" or "claw," was substituted for shecheleth. (Wikipedia)</i> It is also translated in the verse, וּתְגַלַּח יָת רֵישַׁהּ <b>וּתְרַבִּי</b> יָת טוּפְרָנָהָא: The Aramaic translation of Deut. 21:12 -“She will shave her head and allow her nails to grow.” It is called <i>Tziporen</i> because it is shiny like a person's fingernails and they place it in the spices….

This is what is stated, And he shall put the incense upon the fire before Adonai, that the cloud of the incense (<i>anan haketoret</i>) may cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not.”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Yoma 53b</i> (Lev. 16:13) This verse implies that when the cloud of incense covers the altar it must be properly made with all its ingredients so that the <i>Kohen</i> doesn’t die. But if it is lacking even one of its ingredients, it is not considered to be, “the cloud of the incense” (<i>anan haketoret</i>) and the <i>Kohen</i> is liable for the death penalty. This is what we read in Yoma, Ch. 5: “The Sages taught: “And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord” (Lev. 16:13); this means that he should not prepare by placing the incense outside, and bring into the Holy of Holies a coal pan holding the burning incense….”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid Yoma 53a</i> If so, why does it state, “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover” (Lev. 16:2)?

It is stated, ““He shall put the incense on the fire before <i>Adonai,</i> so that the cloud from the incense screens the cover that is over the Covenant, lest he die..” (Lev. 16:13) This implies that if he did not include smoke-maker or one of the other spices he is liable for the death penalty. <b>Rabban Shimeon ben Gamliel says: <i>Tzori</i> is none other than balsam, that flows from the Balsam tree.</b> This does not come to disagree but to explain what <i>Tzori</i> is.
<b>The wine of <i>Kafrisin</i>:</b> Some say that this is the name of a place whose wine was very strong.

If you ask, why do we teach that you cannot mix urine (in the spices) for the Temple, since the innards are brought to the altar. The answer is that we only have what the sages taught on this matter. This is as far as we have about the <i>Braita</i> which is taught in the first chapter on Keritut and in the Jerusalem Talmud in Yoma.
One says, <b>“You will surely arise and take pity on Zion….” (Ps. 102:14) “</b>The school of Elijah taught: Anyone who studies halakhot every day…” “Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Chanina. Sages increase peace in the world.” Then one says Kaddish al Yisrael.
There are places where it is customary for the prayer leader to recite the <i>Borchu</i> at the end of the service for those who came late, so that they do not lose out on hearing the <i>Borchu</i>. However, one does not recite the blessings associated with the <i>Shema</i>. Others say that it is not fitting to say it if one does not recite a blessing after (the <i>borchu</i>) since the <i>borchu</i> is an invitation, as in, "Let us bless Him of whose bounty we have eaten."<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The is part of the introduction to<i> BIrkat HaMazon</i>, the blessings after the meal.</i> It would seem, according to Rav Amram that one can say it since the prayer leader is able to stop after he concludes, “Praised are You <i>Adonai,</i> who rules forever over us and over all his creations,”<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Tefillah</i> 1:10 – ונהגו מקצת העם לברך פסוקים באמצע ברכה וקוראין בנוסח זה: וירא כל העם ויפלו על פניהם</i> and then he can say <i>borchu</i> for those who came in between the passages of the service and did not hear it. It is not considered an interruption of the verses and we are not concerned about an interruption.
It is customary to call a prayer leader, the <i>hazan</i>. The source of this word is related to “guarding” or “watching” as we see at the end of <i>Perek HaSocher</i> (Ch. 7): “To what extent is a paid guard (<i>shomer sachar</i>) obligated to safeguard? He is obligated to the extent that Jacob said to Laban: “Thus I was: In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night” (Gen. 31:40)....There the <i>baraita</i> is speaking of city guards <i>(chazanei)</i>, whose responsibility extends even further.” The <i>Talmud</i> asks "Is that to say that Jacob, our forefather, was a city watchman (c<i>hazana</i>)?” the term <i>chazan</i> implies leading and safeguarding.”<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Bava Metzia 93b, with slight changes</i> The one who safeguards and leads the house of worship is the <i>chazan.</i> It is customary to call this person <i>chazan</i> from the Aramaic translation of the word <i>vayar,</i> “And he saw.” <i>V’chaza</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Onkoles</i> on Genesis 18:2</i> since it is the <i>chazan</i>’s job to watch carefully how he reads and how others read the <i>Torah</i>. It is his job to stand between the reader and the <i>mitargaim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mitargaim</i> is the person who publicly reads the Aramaic out loud as the Torah is read, verse by verse. This practice is still practiced by Yemenite Jews today. The Metargaim alway interprets the text with the Aramaric translation.</i> as one says, the prayer leader stands and oversees between the others.
The prayer leader in our time serves in place of the <i>Kohen Gadol</i>, the high priest; that is why the prayer leader is also called <i>karov</i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>Karov</i> is associated with the word <i>Korban</i>, sacrifice – pointing to the prayer leader’s priestly role.</i>. As is stated in Shir <i>Hashirim Rabbah</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Actually this quote appears in <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> but it includes a verse from Shir HaShirim 30:1. Also see <i>Shir HaShirim Rabbah</i> 3:6 for another interpretation of this verse.</i> “Rabbi Elazar beRabbi Shimon died, his generation quoted Scripture about him (Song 3:6), "Who is she that comes up from the desert like columns of smoke, in clouds of myrrh and frankincense, from all the powders of the merchant?" What is "from all the powders of the merchant?" He reads and studies, is a lyricist and an orator. In <i>Brachot</i> in the Jerusalem Talmud we read, “Rebbi Zeïra was attentive to the <i>Kerova</i> (the <i>chazan</i>) to bow his head at the beginning and at the end (of the Modim prayer).”<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See JT Berachot 1:5 The full passage is as follows: “Rebbi Ḥalaphta ben Shaül stated: Everybody bows down with the cantor for the benediction of thanksgiving. Rebbi Zeïra said: But only for the word <i>modim</i>. Rebbi Zeïra was attentive to the <i>kerova</i> to bow his head at the beginning and at the end. Rebbi Yose when he came up here saw them bowing down and whispering (Modim)</i> Further, the sages state, Rabbi Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Menachem of Galya, “One does not say to the person who is invited to lead prayers, “Come and pray.” Rather who says, “Come close (<i>karev</i>) and fulfill our needs. Fight our battles and pacify on our behalf.”<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">See JT Berachot 4:4</i> It is for this reason the special prayers are called <i>piyutim</i> which the prayer leader adds in the middle of the other prayers – because they are recited in the midst and the middle (<i>Bikerev</i>) of the Amidah prayers
