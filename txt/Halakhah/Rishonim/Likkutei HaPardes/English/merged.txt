Interpretation of the Kaddish



















And why did they decree that the congregation answer kaddish [with], "Amen. May His great name be blessed for ever and ever?” [These] seven words correspond to two verses that each have seven words, and are both equal in their words and letters. And these are them: The beginning of [God’s] speech in, “In the beginning He created.”
And the beginning of the Law, “And the Lord spoke all these words, saying.” This is to tell you that if Israel did not accept the Torah, the world would not have survived. As so do we find – that the Holy One, Blessed be He, established a condition with the act of creation, as it is written (Psalms 76:9), “the earth feared, and was silent.” At first, it was afraid, and in the end, it was silent. And it is written (Psalms 75:4), “I established its pillars forever, selah.” Hence the whole congregation answers, “Amen. May His great name be blessed for ever and ever.” And that is [the meaning of] that which David said with the holy spirit (Psalms 119:164), “Seven in the day have I praised You.” And [we answer it also] because we have found that the Ten Commandments are included in the Ten Utterances (of creation); and kaddish is said about the Ten Utterances. And in the same way as the Commandments are only said with ten, so too was the ordinance that kaddish be with ten. And we bow four bowings during kaddish. And these are them: “May His great name be glorified and sanctified in the world that He created” – all that is with one bowing. “Quickly and soon” – he bows and says, “May His name […].” Then when be begins to say the seven praises, “Blessed, praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the name of the Holy One, blessed be He" – he bows for all of them [once]. And when he reaches, “praise and consolation,” he bows. All of these bowings are of prostration. And the bowing of, “He who makes peace in His heights,” is optional. I have found that these four bowings correspond to the four names [of God] found in the verse (Malakhi 1:11), “For from where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honored among the nations, and everywhere incense and pure oblation are offered to My name; for My name is honored among the nations, said the Lord of Hosts.” The meaning of [the words of] Kaddish: “May [His great name] be glorified and sanctified,” based on the verse (Ezekiel 38:23), “I will be glorified and sanctified.” But how can man glorify (literarily, grow) the holy name of the Holy One – lest it is lacking, as it were, God forbid?...
Yes, it is certainly lacking, as it is written (Exodus 17:16), “For the hand is upon the throne of the Lord (<i>Y-ah</i>).” The Holy One, blessed be He, swore that the throne will not be complete until the memory of Amalek shall be erased. And we find that his name is [four letters], but when it says, “the throne of <i>Y-ah</i>,” it is only half the letters of the name. Therefore we pray, “May [His great name] be glorified (grow) and sanctified” – meaning to say, may it be the will of the One who spoke and the world existed, that He should redeem us from among the nations and erase the memory of Amalek, and sanctify His name to be complete. “His great name,” is like His great name [as it was] created. 
Accordingly one then says, “May His great name be glorified and sanctified,” in the same way that the Holy One, blessed be He, created His world. And this is [the meaning of], “in the world that He created according to His will,” His will! “And may His kingdom reign” – and then the kingdom and rulership will be established, His kingdom, may He be blessed. So there will be no foreigner among them, nor one who worships another god, as it is written (Zechariah 14:19), “And the Lord shall be King over all the earth.” And this thing that one prayed for the redemption should be “in your lives and in your days, and in the days of all of the House of Israel!” And the entire congregation answers, " May His great name be blessed forever,” with all of their strength. [Meaning,] may it be His will like you said. “His name” – being the name, <i>Y-ah</i>, with which He created His world – should be blessed forever, that it should grow; and our redemption is dependent upon that growth of the name. For the name will not be complete, as I explained, until the memory of Amalek is erased. And the memory of Amalek will not be erased until we are redeemed.
