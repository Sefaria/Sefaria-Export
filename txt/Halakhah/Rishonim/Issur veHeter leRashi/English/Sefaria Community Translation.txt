Siman 1

 The Laws of Pesach, from the Beis Midrash of our Rabbi Shlomo [son of] Yitzchak, zt"l. How to Search for Chametz. On the 14th (of Nisan) we search for leaven by candellight. And in the first measure that He finds, makes the blessing: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who sanctified us with His commandments, and His desire for the elimination of chametz. And he goes and searches here and there. When he finishes checking and he comes to stash away food, two meals before him, he nullifies by the saying of covering of the eye, as it is written Return light to your houses. "All Chametz that is now in my house is adjudged as if it was burned, nullified and as if as dust". There are many great laws using this language, "All chametz in my household and I do not know about it to nullify it, is rendered as dust". And this is the essence.

The Shabbat that is before Passover people are accustomed to call Shabbat haGadol [the Great Shabbat], but they do not know for what reason there is no greater one of all the Shabbatot but this one in Nisan, for in it Israel went out from Egypt on a Thursday, as it says in Seder Olam, and took their Passover-lamb on the Shabbat before Passover. Israel said, "Hey, if we sacrifice the abominations of Egypt, will they not stone us?" The Holy Blessed One said to them, "Now you will see the miracle that I will do for you." So they went, and each took their Passover-lamb to be guarded for four days, until the fourteenth day. When the Egyptians saw this, they wanted to rise up and take vengeance on it, but their bowels were stretched and their fire was going out and they were sentenced to torture and horrible and constant and bitter sicknesses, and they could not injure Israel at all. And because of the miracles that were done for Israel on that Shabbat that was before Passover, thus we call the Shabbat before Passsover Shabbat haGadol. From the mouth of Rav Avraham whose soul is in paradise.
