Mishneh Torah, Murderer and the Preservation of Life



Chapter 1













Whosoever can save [a pursued victim] by [injuring one] of the limbs [of the pursuer] and he did not bother with [limiting himself to only doing] that [measure], rather he saved [the victim] with the life of the pursuer [i.e.] he killed [the pursuer], this [vigilante] is a spiller of blood [i.e. a murderer] and is liable to death, though a [human] court does not execute him [for this crime].

Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4






[If] ten people strike him [the victim] with ten sticks and he dies, whether they struck him one after the other, whether they struck him at the same time, they are all exempt from execution by the court, as it says (Leviticus 24:17) "all the soul of man" until one [alone] killed the entire soul [of the victim].  The same law applies to two people that pushed him [the victim] or forced him into water, or many people are sitting [together] and an arrow emerges from among them and kills, that all are exempted [from court-imposed execution].

Chapter 5



Chapter 6

There are three types of unintentional killers.
There is the killer who acts unintentionally in complete ignorance, and this is as it said "as long as he does not lie in wait."  And the law is that he should be exiled to a Sanctuary City and take advantage of that, as we have explained.
And there is the unintentional killer who acts as one under compulsion, and where the death is caused by a very rare set of circumstances.  And the law is that he is exempt from exile.  And if the Blood Redeemer kills him, the Blood Redeemer is liable for a death sentence himself.
And there is the unintentional killer who acts in a way very similar to an intentional killer, that he acts in an almost criminal fashion due to excessive carelessness or negligence.  And the law is that there is no exile available for him due to his grave sin, and exile does not provide him atonement.  Sanctuary Cities are not meant for him as they exist only for those who have merited exile.  Therefore, if the Blood Redeemer finds him anywhere and kills him, the Redeemer is held not guilty.  

Chapter 7

A scholar who is exiled to a city of refuge, his teacher is exiled with him, as it says, "[And he shall flee to one of these cities] and live (Deuteronomy 19:5)."  Give him [his teacher]in order that he may live and a scholar must have his teacher because without Torah study, one is thought to be dead.  Similarly, if a teacher is exiled, his academy is exiled with him.

Chapter 9



Chapter 10

The law of the cow who's neck is broken is only practiced in the land of Israel and in Transjordan.

Chapter 11




...The roof is like every other thing that has danger in itself, and which is possible that a person will make a mistake with it and die. An example is having a pit in one's property, whether it has water or not - one is obligated to make a wall of ten tefachim (32 inches/80cm.) around it, or a covering over it, so a person won't fall in it and die. And so too any stumbling block in which there is a danger to life: it is a positive mitzvah to remove it, and to guard against it, and to be exceedingly cautious about it, as it is written "take care of yourself and guard your life" (Deut. 4:9). And if one has not removed the stumbling blocks that bring people to danger, one has cancelled a positive commandment and transgressed "do not bring bloodguilt" (Deut. 22:8).
Our Sages forbade many matters because they involve a threat to life. Whenever a person transgresses these guidelines, saying: "I will risk my life, what does this matter to others," or "I am not careful about these things," he should be punished by stripes for rebelliousness.

Chapter 12












It is forbidden to sell to a gentile any instrument of war; nor may you sharpen their swords, nor may you sell them any knives, manacles, iron chains, nor bears, lions, nor anything that could cause damage to the public.  But you may sell them shields to be used defensively.
