How [or in what circumstance]? The one who throws a stone into the public domain and it kills [someone] or the one who is taking down his wall into the public domain and a stone fell and it killed [someone]. Either when he took it down during the day or when he took it down at night, behold, he is [considered] grossly negligent and is not exiled [to the city of refuge] because it is a crime, because he should have looked and [only then] afterwards he can throw [the stone] or take down the wall.
If he takes down the wall into the garbage heap at night, if many people are common there, behold, he is [considered] grossly negligent and is not exiled [to the city of refuge]. If many people are not common there at all, behold, it is [considered to be] a freak accident and he is exempt from exile.
If there was a garbage heap that people regularly use [as a bathroom] at night and it is not regularly used [as a bathroom] during the day, and a person is found there, sitting [and using the bathroom], and a stone fell on him at the time of the taking down [of the wall] and he dies, behold, he is exiled.
And this [is also the case when], the one who throws a stone and after it left his hand, that person put out his head and he received [the stone to his face and he died, the thrower] is exempt from exile, as it is said, "and it found his friend” (Deuteronomy 19:5) excludes the one who places himself [in danger].
