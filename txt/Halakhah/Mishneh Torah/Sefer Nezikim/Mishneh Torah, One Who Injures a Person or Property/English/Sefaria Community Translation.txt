Mishneh Torah, One Who Injures a Person or Property



Chapter 1

One who injures his friend is obligated to pay him for five items, and they are: damage, pain, healing, loss of work, and embarrassment. And these five iterms are all paid for from the best of his property, as is the law for all damagers.
Damage, in what manner? If he chopped off the hand or the foot of his fellow, we look at [the fellow] as if he was a slave being sold in the marketplace: how much was he worth [then] and how much is he worth now. And he pays the depreciation of his value that he caused. As it is stated, "An eye for (<i>tachat</i>) an eye" - from the tradition, they learned that that which it states, "for (<i>tachat</i>)" means to pay money.
That which it states in the Torah, "In the way that he gives a blemish to a man, so will it be given to him," is not  [coming] to injure this one as he injured his fellow; but [rather] that it is fitting to remove a limb from him or to wound him as he did [to another]. And therefore, he must pay his damage. And behold, it states, "And you shall not take ransom for the soul of a murderer" - for a murderer only may you not take ransom, but for the loss of limbs or wounds, there is ransom.
And so [too], that which it states about one who injures his fellow and causes him damage, "Your eye should not pity;" is [to mean] that you should not pity [him] concerning payments, lest you will say, "This one is a poor person and he injured him unintentionally, [so] I will have mercy on him." Hence, it states, "Your eye should not pity."
And from where [do we know] that that which it states with regards to limbs, "An eye for an eye," is [to be understood as] payments? Since it is stated about it, "A wound for a wound," and it is explicitly stated, "And when a man strikes his neighbor with a stone or with a fist, etc... he should surely give him his rest and his rehabilitation." Behold, you have learned that "for (<i>tachat</i>)" mentioned with regards to a wound means payments. And this is [also] the case with "for (<i>tachat</i>)" mentioned concerning the eye and concerning the other limbs.
And even though these things are apparent from perusal of the written Torah, they are all explained from the mouth of Moshe, our teacher, and they are all laws [given] to Moshe (<i>halacha le'Moshe</i>) that are in our hands. And like this did our ancestors see that they were judging in the court of Yehoshua and in the court of Shmuel the Ramati and in each and every court that stood from the times of Moshe, our teacher,  until today.

Chapter 8











If the informer has executed what he planned, and reported, it seems to me that it is forbidden to kill him, unless he is a confirmed informer, in which case he should be killed lest he continue to inform against others. There are frequent cases in the cities of Northern Africa where informers, who are known to report Jewish funds to oppressors, are killed or handed over to the non-Jewish authorities to be executed, beaten, or imprisoned, in accordance with their wickedness. One may inform on individuals who pressure or cause pain to the community to an idolater who may beat, incarcerate or fine them. However, one may not inform to protect a single individual from pain. It is forbidden to destroy the property of an informer, even though it is permissible to destroy him physically, since his property belongs to his heirs.
