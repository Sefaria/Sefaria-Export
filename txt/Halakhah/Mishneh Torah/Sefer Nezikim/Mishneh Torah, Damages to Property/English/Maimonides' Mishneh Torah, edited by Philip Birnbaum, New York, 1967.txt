Mishneh Torah, Damages to Property



Chapter 1

If any living creature under a man's control caused damage, the owner of the animal must compensate, because the injury was occasioned by his chattel, as it is written: "If a man's ox hurt the ox of another man…" (Exodus 21:35), implying not only domestic animals but also wild beasts and birds. In using the term <i>ox</i>, the Torah merely speaks of a common occurrence.
How much must the owner compensate? If the animal occasioned damage by doing habitual things within its nature, as when it ate straw or hay or inflicted injury with its foot in the course of walking, the owner must pay full compensation with the best of his estate, as it is written: "He shall make restitution with the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard" (Exodus 22:4). If, however, the animal acted strangely and did things that were not habitual, as when an ox gored or bit, the owner has to pay only half-damages from the body of the injurious animal itself, as it is written: "They shall sell the live ox and divide the money" (Exodus 21:35).
Accordingly, if an ox worth one hundred denars gored an ox worth twenty and killed it, and the carcass is worth four, the owner of the goring ox has to pay eight, amounting to half of the remaining damage, which is to be paid only from the body of the ox that caused the damage, as it is written: "They shall sell the live ox…" Hence, if an ox worth twenty killed an ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worth one hundred, the owner of the carcass cannot say to the owner of the live ox "give me fifty," since the latter may say to him: "Here is the ox that caused the damage, take it and go." This relates even to an ox that is worth no more than one denar. The same applies to all similar cases.
An animal is called <i>mu'ad</i> [and the owner stands forewarned] with regard to any damage that should be expected from a creature of its kind; an animal is called <i>tam</i> (harmless) with regard to any damage that is strange and unlikely to be done by an animal of its kind, as when an ox has gored or bitten. If an animal acts in a strange manner repeatedly, it becomes a <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to the injurious action to which it got used, as it is written: "If the ox is known to have been in the habit of goring" (Exodus 21:36).
An animal is considered a <i>tam</i> with regard to five classes of damages, [concerning which legal warning is required before the owner is made fully responsible and liable to pay in full for any thrice-repeated act] namely: an animal is not a natural attested danger as to goring, jostling, biting, squatting upon large utensils, or kicking. If, however, it became an attested danger with respect to any of these acts, it becomes a <i>mu'ad</i> in reference to it. The tooth, on the other hand, is an attested danger from the very beginning as to eating fit food; the foot is an attested danger from the very beginning as to breaking things in the course of walking; any animal is an attested danger from the very beginning as to squatting upon small pottery and the like and crushing them.
Five kinds of animals are an attested danger from the outset even when they are tamed. Hence, if any of them did damage or killed by goring, biting, clawing, or the like, the owner must restore in full. They are: the wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, and the panther. So too, the snake, even if tamed, is an attested donger as to biting, and the owner must pay in full for the damage done.
Any <i>mu'ad</i> pays full damage, collectible from the owner's best property; any <i>tam</i> pays half-damage from the sale of its own body. This rule applies to the animal that entered the premises of the injured party and caused him damage there. If, however, the plaintiff entered the premises of the defendant and the owner's animal caused him damage, the defendant is exempt from any claim, for he can say to the injured party: "If you had not entered my premises, no injury would have been inflicted upon you." The Torah is explicit when it says: "If he lets his beast loose and it feeds in another man's field…" (Exodus 22:4).
If the animal caused damage in a public domain, or in a courtyard which belonged neither to the defendant nor to the plaintiff, or in a courtyard which belonged to both of them, where they both had the right of placing their produce and cattle, such as a stretch of fields and the like, the law is that if the animal caused damage by tooth or foot, in a normal manner, its owner is not liable, because it had the right to walk in various directions, and it is natural for an animal to walk about and eat or to break things as it walks along. If, however, it gored or jostled or squatted or kicked or bit, the owner must pay half-damage if it was a <i>tam</i>, and full-damage if it was a <i>mu'ad</i>.

Three primary causes of injury are to be found in an ox: damage done by the horn, the tooth, and the foot. Subordinate damages by the horn are jostling, biting, squatting, and kicking. Subordinate damages by the tooth are in cases where the animal rubbed itself against a wall for gratification and caused damage by its rubbing, or soiled fruit products for gratification. Subordinate damages by the foot are in cases where it occasioned injury with its body while walking along, or with its hair while treading along, or by swishing its tail, or with the saddle on its back, the bridle in its mouth, or the bell on its neck. So too, if a donkey caused injury with its load as it treaded along, or a heifer occasioned injury with the wagon it was pulling. All these are sub-damages by the foot, and the owner is exempt if the injury was occasioned in a public domain, but must pay in full if it was occasioned on the premises of the plaintiff.

Chapter 2

Both the primary and the secondary causes of injury are alike: if the primary cause is considered an attested danger, the secondary cause is likewise considered an attested danger; if the primary cause is not regarded as an attested danger, neither are its derivatives. All primary and secondary causes are considered forewarned from the very outset, except the horn and its derivatives, which are counted as innocuous to begin with until they are proved to be an attested danger, as we have explained.






This is the rule: Compensation for damage caused is due indemnity; whenever one is required to pay more than this or less, such as double compensation for theft or half-damage for injury caused by a <i>tam</i>, both the excess and the lesser amount are regarded as a fine. Fines are payable only on the basis of witnesses; anyone who admits liability in the case of any fine is exempt from paying it.










If a man incites somebody's dog against another man, he is morally liable, though he is legally exempt. But the owner of the dog must pay half-damage, because he knew that his dog would bite if incited; he should not have let him loose.— —

Chapter 3

An animal is deemed a <i>mu'ad</i> (forewarned) as to eating fruit or vegetable products and the like. Accordingly, the defendant must pay full damage if his animal entered the premises of the plaintiff and ate things that it normally eats, as it is written: "When it feeds in another man's field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field…" (Exodus 22:4). If, however, it ate them in a public domain, he is exempt. If the animal benefited thereby, the owner must pay for the benefit it derived and not for the damage.

Chapter 4

If a man brought his flock into a fold and shut it in with a door that could withstand a normal wind, and it nevertheless came out and caused damage, he is exempt. If, however, the door could not withstand an ordinary wind, or if the walls of the sheep fold were flimsy, which means that he failed to shut in the flock properly, he is liable if it emerged and caused damage.— — But if there was a strong partition and it came down at night, or burglars broke it down, and the sheep got out and caused damage, he is exempt. If burglars brought the sheep out and it caused damage, they are liable.
If a man broke a fence enclosing someone's animal, and it got out and caused damage, he is liable if the fence had been strong and firm. If, however, it had been weak, he is legally exempt but morally liable. So too, if a man placed deadly poison in front of another man's animal, he is legally exempt and morally liable.

If a man entrusted his animal to an unpaid or a paid guardian, to a hirer or a borrower, the keeper takes the place of the owner and is held responsible for the damage the animal has caused. This is so only if they failed to guard it at all; but if they took excellent care of it, as it should be, they are quit of liability if it went out and caused damage, but the owner is liable, even if it killed a person [and the compensation exacted would be relatively high]. If they failed to take adequate care of it, an unpaid guardian is exempt, whereas a paid guardian, a hirer, or a borrower is held responsible.

Chapter 5

If a pasturing animal strayed into fields and vineyards, the owner should be warned three times even if it caused no damage as yet. If he took no care of his animal and failed to prevent it from pasturing there, the owner of the field has the right to slaughter the animal properly and then say to its owner: "Come and sell your meat," since one is forbidden to do damage and pay for it; even to cause damage indirectly is forbidden.
For this reason, the sages prohibited the raising of small cattle or small wild animals in Eretz Yisrael in areas containing fields and vineyards, though they allowed this in the wooded and desert areas of Eretz Yisrael. In Syria, however, such animals may be raised anywhere.






The sages also prohibited the breeding of swine in any place, or of dogs, unless they are chained. One may, however, breed dogs in a town near the border. A dog should be tied up by day and untied at night. The sages said: "Cursed be the man who breeds dogs or pigs," because the damage they do is substantial and frequent.

Chapter 6

What kind of animal is accounted an attested danger? One against which evidence of injury has been brought within three separate days. If, however, it gored or bit, or lay down or kicked or jostled, even a hundred times on a single day, it is not accounted an attested danger.— —
Warning given of a mischievous animal should be conveyed only in the presence of the owner and before a court of three judges, as it is written: "And its owner has been warned" (Exodus 21:29), and any warning must be before a court of law.



If an ox against which evidence has been brought is sold or given away, it reverts to the status of harmlessness, because the change in ownership entails a change in the legal status of the animal. But if the owner has lent it to someone or entrusted it to a guardian, it retains the status of an attested danger.— —
If an animal against which evidence has been brought discontinues the behavior of attested danger, it reverts to the status of harmlessness. If, for instance, evidence has been brought against a goring ox, and it stops goring, even though it jostles, it is deemed harmless with respect to goring. From what time is it assumed that the animal has turned harmless? If it does not gore when the children put their hands on it. So too, with respect to other actions concerning which evidence has been brought against an animal, it remains an attested danger unless it refrains from those actions when children put their hands on it.
If an ox is an attested danger to its own species, it is not an attested danger to another species. If evidence has been brought against it with respect to human beings, it is not deemed an attested danger to animals; if it is an attested danger to children, it is not an attested danger to adults. Hence, if it caused damage to a species to which it has been an attested danger, the owner must pay full compensation; he pays only half-damage, if the animal caused damage to other species.— —

Chapter 7

If the owner of an ox had tied it with a halter, or shut it in properly, but it nevertheless came out and caused damage, he must pay for half the damage if it was accounted harmless, but is exempt if it was accounted an attested danger, as it is written: "If he has not kept it in" (Exodus 21:29), meaning that if he did keep it under guard, he is exempt; and this ox was guarded indeed.— —






An appraisal is made with regard to damages. If, for instance, a man or his animal broke someone's article, we must not say to the defendant: "Take the broken article and pay its original value to the plaintiff." Instead, the amount of depreciation of the article is estimated, and the defendant must pay the entire amount of depreciation to the plaintiff if the animal that caused the damage was an attested danger, or half the amount of depreciation if it was accounted harmless, as it is written: "He shall keep the dead animal to himself" (Exodus 21:34), meaning: the plaintiff. The value depreciation of the carcass is borne by the plaintiff; the value improvement of the carcass is shared between the plaintiff and the defendant.
If, for instance, an ox worth two hundred was gored and died, and the carcass was worth one hundred at the time of death, but decreased in value by the time the case was tried, being worth only eighty, the defendant has to pay only one hundred if his animal was a <i>mu'ad;</i> if it was a <i>tam</i>, he has to pay fifty from the price of the animal itself.
If the carcass grew in value and is worth one hundred twenty by the time the case is tried in court, the defendant has to pay ninety if his animal was a <i>mu'ad;</i> if it was a <i>tam</i>, he has to pay forty-five from the animal itself. This is what the Torah means by saying: "They shall divide the dead animal as well" (Exodus 21:35).

Chapter 8



Chapter 9



Chapter 10

An ox that killed a human being anywhere, whether an adult or a minor, a slave or a freeman, must be stoned, whether a <i>tam</i> or a <i>mu'ad</i>.— —
It does not matter whether an ox or any other animal, wild beast or bird, if it kills a human being it is to be stoned. What difference is there between a <i>tam</i> that killed a human being and a <i>mu'ad</i> that killed a human being? The <i>tam</i> is exempt from ransom [paid to the heirs of the slain person], and [the owner of] the <i>mu'ad</i> must pay ransom, provided that evidence has been brought against it as being prone to killing.
Since any domestic or wild animal or any bird is to be stoned if it killed a human being, how can any <i>mu'ad</i> be found as to killing, so that the owner might have to pay ransom? For example, — — if the animal killed three Jewish persons who were afflicted with a fatal disease and then it killed one in good health; or if it killed and escaped and was caught after a fourth killing, for the owner is not required to pay ransom till the ox is stoned. So too, if the animal fatally injured three human beings in succession [and they did not die until it killed a fourth person], or if it killed three animals, it becomes a <i>mu'ad</i> as to killing, and its owner must pay ransom.— —
What is written in the Torah, "and the owner shall also be put to death" (Exodus 21:29), has been traditionally interpreted to mean death at the hands of Heaven (by an act of God); the owner obtains atonement upon payment of a ransom for the slain person. Even though the ransom is a form of atonement, the court may forcibly seize a pledge from anyone who has to pay ransom.
If an ox belonging to two partners has killed, each must pay the full ransom, for each must obtain complete atonement.


If a man incited a dog against another man and it killed him, the dog is not to be stoned. So too, if he incited a domestic or wild animal against another person and it killed him.— —

Chapter 11

How much ransom is one required to pay? Whatever the judges consider to be the value of the slain individual. All depends on the value of the slain man, as it is written: "He must redeem his life by giving whatever is imposed upon him" (Exodus 21:30).— —
The ransom is paid to whom? To the heirs of the slain individual. If the animal killed a woman, the ransom goes to her heirs on her father's side and not to her husband.— —

Chapter 12

If a man dug a pit in a public domain and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, he must pay the full damage even if the pit was full of wool shearings and the like, as it is written: "The owner of the pit shall make good the loss" (Exodus 21:34). This applies to an ox or a donkey or any other domestic or wild animal or bird. Ox and donkey are mentioned in the Torah only because they are the usual cases.




















If a man dug a pit in a public domain and an ox fell upon him and killed him, the owner of the ox is exempt. If the ox died too, the owner of the ox can collect for his ox from the heirs of the owner of the pit.

Chapter 13

If utensils fell into a pit and were broken, the owner of the pit is exempt, as it is written: "If an ox or a donkey fell into it" (Exodus 21:33). This has been traditionally interpreted to mean: an ox, but not a human being; a donkey, but not utensils.— —
The pit is one of the primary causes of injury, and its derivatives are like it, — — deemed forewarned from the very beginning. Anyone who interposes an obstacle is deemed a derivative of pit, and if a person or an animal has been injured by it, the one who interposed the obstacle must pay full indemnity.— —


If a man left a jug in the public domain, and a pedestrian stumbled over it and broke it, he is exempt, because it is not usual for people to watch the road as they walk along. If the pedestrian was hurt, the owner of the jug must pay for the damage.— —
















The early men of piety used to hide their thorns and pieces of glass, burying them three handbreadths deep in the ground so that the plough might not stir them up again to the surface. Others used to burn them; still others used to cast them into the sea or river, so that none might be injured by them.

Chapter 14












If a man set fire to a building belonging to another, he must pay for everything in it, since it is usual for people to place all their utensils and valuables in their homes.— —


If a fire spread and harmed an individual, the one who started the fire is liable for damages, loss of time, healing expenses, pain, and humiliation of the injured party, just as if he had injured him with his own hand. Even though the fire is the man's chattel, it is as if it did the damage by means of his arrows. If, however, a man's animal or pit injured a person, the owner is liable only for the damage done, as we have explained.
All derivatives of fire bear the same legal liability as fire itself. If, for instance, a man placed a stone or a knife or a load on top of his roof, and one of these fell down because of an ordinary wind and caused damage, he must pay full indemnity, since all these are derivatives of fire. If any of these fell down on account of an unusual wind and caused damage, he is exempt.
