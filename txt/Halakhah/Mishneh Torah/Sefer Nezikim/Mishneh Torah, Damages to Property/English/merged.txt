Mishneh Torah, Damages to Property



Chapter 1

Whenever a living animal owned by a person causes damages, the owner is required to pay, for the damage was caused by his property. [This is implied by Exodus 21:35:] "When a person's ox will gore an ox belonging to a colleague...."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Sefer HaMitzvot (Positive Commandment 237) and Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 51) consider this to be one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. This mitzvah can be defined as compensating an owner for damages caused by one's animals through an action that they would not ordinarily perform.</i> These laws apply equally to an ox and to any other animal, beast or fowl. The verse mentions an ox only because that is a common instance.
How much must [the owner] pay? If [the animal] caused damage through the performance of an act that it performs frequently and that is its natural habit - e.g., an animal ate straw or fodder, or it caused damage by [treading on an object] with its feet while walking - [the owner] is obligated to pay the full amount of the damage, [giving up, if necessary,]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the owner is obligated to reimburse the person whose property was damaged for his loss. If the owner does not have cash readily available, his most valuable landed property should be expropriated and sold to pay the damages his animal caused.</i> his most choice property, as stated in [Exodus 22:4]: "Payment should be exacted from his choice field and his choice vineyard."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Payment of these damages is also considered one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot Sefer HaMitzvot (Positive Commandment 240) and Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 55). This mitzvah can be defined as compensating an owner for damages caused by one's animals through an action that they would ordinarily perform.</i> If [the animal] deviated from its ordinary habit and performed acts that it does not usually perform and caused damage in this manner - e.g., a ox gored or bit [another animal] - the owner is obligated to pay half the damages caused. [The payment must be exacted] from the animal that caused the damage, as [Exodus 21:35] states: "And they shall sell the ox that is alive and divide the money."
What is implied? When an ox that is worth a<i> maneh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">  100 zuz.</i>gores an ox that is worth 20 <i>zuz</i> and kills it, [leaving] a corpse that is worth four <i>zuz</i>, the owner of the ox [that caused the damage] is liable to pay eight <i>zuz</i>, half of the loss [suffered by the owner of the ox that was killed]. The payment must be exacted from the body of the animal that caused the damage,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> As the Rambam proceeds to illustrate, the damages caused by the ox do not create a lien on all the property belonging to the owner of the ox.</i> as it is written: "And they shall sell the ox that is alive."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The commentaries have cited the apparent redundancy in the citation of the proof-text.</i> Therefore, if an ox that was worth 20<i> zuz</i> killed an ox that was worth 200 <i>zuz</i> and its carcass was worth [only] a <i>maneh</i>, the owner of the dead ox cannot compel the owner of the living ox to give him 50 [<i>zuz</i>]. Instead, he should tell him: "Here is the ox that caused the damage. Take it and depart."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">  Thus the owner of the dead ox receives only the worth of the ox which gored, 20 zuz, 30 zuz less than what would be due him.</i>[This applies] even if the [ox that gored] is worth only a<i> dinar</i>. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations.
[An animal] that performs a deed it is accustomed to performing by nature is called a <i>mu'ad</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Mu'ad literally means forewarned - i.e., the animal is prone to perform such acts, and the owner should be forewarned.</i> [When an animal] deviates from its ordinary pattern and performs an act that its species does not usually perform - e.g., an ox gores or bites - it is called a <i>tam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Tam literally means simple, implying that the animal is not habituated in the performance of the abnormal behavior.</i> If the animal continues to follow the deviant pattern on several occasions, it is considered to be <i>mu'ad </i>with regard to the deviation to which it has become habituated, as [implied by Exodus 21:36]: "Or it is known that it is a goring ox."
Five types of activities are considered to be abnormal for an animal. If it repeatedly performs any of them, it is considered to be <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to that activity.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., for that activity alone, and not for any other abnormal activity (Maggid Mishneh).</i> An animal is not considered to be prone to gore, to butt,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., to attack an animal with a part of its body other than its horns (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, Bava Kama 1:4).</i> to bite, to lie down on large utensils or to kick. If it becomes accustomed to such an activity, its owner should be forewarned. At the outset, [an animal] is, however, considered prone to eat foods that are appropriate for it and to break utensils [on which it treads] as it walks. Similarly, an animal is considered prone to lie down on small utensils and crush them.
Five species of animals are considered prone to cause damage from the beginning of their existence. [This applies] even if they have become domesticated.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> Even when these animals have been raised in a home and do not outwardly show wild traits, their tendency to violence is considered part of their instinct, never to be eradicated fully.The Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 389:8) states that these animals are considered mu'adim only with regard to the specific negative traits for which they are known. If they cause damage in other ways, they are considered as tamim.</i> Therefore, if they cause damage or death by goring, biting, treading, lying down upon, or the like, [the owner] is liable for the entire amount of the damages. They are a wolf, a lion, a bear, a tiger and a leopard. Similarly, a snake that bites is considered to be <i>mu'ad</i>, even if it has been domesticated.
Whenever [an animal] is <i>mu'ad</i>, [the owner] must pay the entire amount of the damage, [even if this requires expropriating] his most choice property. Whenever, by contrast, an animal is considered a <i>tam</i>, [the owner] is required to pay [only] half the amount of the damages. [Moreover,] that half is taken only from the animal itself. When does the above apply? When the animal entered into the domain belonging to the person to whom damage was caused, and caused damage. When, however, the person to whom damage was caused entered into the domain of the person [whose animal] caused the damage, [the owner] is not liable for anything. For he can tell [the party who suffered the damages]: "If you had not entered my domain, you would not have suffered any damages." Indeed, this is explicitly stated in the Torah, as [Exodus 22:4] states: "And if he shall send forth his animals, and they pasture in another's field."<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> This is the verse that describes the payment of damages caused by grazing. It emphasizes that the owner is liable for damages caused in another's field, and not in his own.The Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 389:10) and others cite Bava Kama 21b, which interprets this verse in a more specific and somewhat different manner. It would appear, however, that the Rambam is not referring to the exegesis of the verse by the Talmud, but is instead presenting the simple meaning of the verse as a support for the premise stated previously.</i>
[The following rules apply when a person's] animal causes damage in the public domain or in a courtyard that belongs neither to the owner of [the animal that] caused the damage nor to the party who suffered the damages,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> This applies when the party who suffered the damages placed produce there without receiving permission from the owner. If, however, he received permission from the owner, it is considered as though it were his own courtyard. See Shulchan Aruch and Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 389:16).</i> or in a courtyard owned jointly by both parties that is set aside to leave produce there and/or to harbor an animal - e.g., a valley. If [the animal] caused damage by eating or treading in its ordinary manner, the owner is not liable. For [the animal] has permission to go from here to there, and it is the habit of an animal to go and eat as it proceeds and to break [anything lying in its way] as it proceeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> In the Guide for the Perplexed, Volume III, Chapter 40, the Rambam explains that this law is based on a logical premise. Since this is an animal's natural habit, it is difficult for the owner to prevent his animal from causing such damage. Moreover, the person whose property was damaged should have foreseen the problem and not left anything of value in such places.</i>[Different rules apply if] it [caused damage by] goring, butting, kicking or biting.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> For this represents a departure from the animal's natural pattern, for which its owner is held responsible.</i> If its status is <i>tam</i>, [the owner] must pay for half the damages. If its status is <i>mu'ad</i>, [the owner] must pay the entire amount of the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> Although both types of animals have the right to proceed in the public domain, neither has the right to damage the other animal. Therefore, the owner of the animal that caused the damages must assume responsibility.</i>
When a courtyard owned jointly by both parties<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the owner of the animal that caused the damage and the party who suffered the damages.</i> is designated for produce and not for harboring an animal, and one of the parties lets his animal in and it causes damage, [the owner] is liable even for damage caused by eating or treading.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> Since he brought his animal into a place where an animal should not enter, he must bear responsibility.</i> Similarly, if both of them had the right to harbor an animal there, but only one had the right to keep produce there, if [an animal belonging to the other] damaged [that person's] produce, [its owner] is liable even for damage caused by eating or treading.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> Since only the other partner was allowed to bring his produce there, in this regard it is considered his courtyard, and the owner of the animal is liable.</i>
There are three categories of damages [caused by] an ox: a) goring, b) eating and c) treading. The derivatives of goring are butting, biting,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> When it has no desire to eat, i.e., biting for a violent and destructive intent (Maggid Mishneh).</i> lying upon and kicking.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> All these are acts performed by an animal with a desire to harm the animal (or object) it strikes, without any intention to derive any benefit from it.</i>The derivatives of eating are<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> The acts that follow are damages caused by an animal when it follows its ordinary pattern and seeks its own benefit.</i> causing damage when scratching itself on a wall for its benefit, and soiling produce<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> This refers to soiling produce by rolling upon it, not by defecating (Ibid.). Ruining an object by defecating is considered to be a derivative of kicking stones (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 390:8). See Chapter 2, Halachah 13.</i> for its benefit. The derivatives of treading are<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> All the acts that follow are damages caused by an animal without any intent, that are likely to be caused when it proceeds in an ordinary manner (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 390:1).</i> causing damage with its body while walking; causing damage with its hair while walking or by swishing its tail, or with its saddle, the bit in its mouth or the bell around its neck. Similarly, a donkey that causes damage with its burden while walking or a calf that is pulling a cart that causes damage while pulling it. All of these are derivatives of treading. In a public domain [the owner] is not liable, and in a domain belonging to the party who suffered the damages, he must pay for the entire amount of the damages.
When [an animal] swishes its tail repeatedly in an abnormal manner and causes damage in the public domain, or when it swishes its sexual organ and causes damage in the public domain, [the owner] is not held liable. If the person whose property was damaged seizes possession [of property belonging to the owner], he may take payment for half of the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> As the Rambam proceeds to explain, these instances are the subject of an unresolved Talmudic debate (Bava Kama 19b). Because of the doubt involved, payment is not exacted from the owner, and for this same reason the person whose property was damaged may not seize the owner's property. If, however, he did seize the owner's property, the same rationale is advanced on his behalf. Since the property may rightfully belong to him, because of the doubt, we do not expropriate the property and return it to its owner.In any case, all that is involved is half of the damages, because the reason why one might hold the owner liable is that these activities are derivatives of goring. And for goring, the owner is required to pay only half the value of the damages.The Rambam's opinion is quoted by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 390:2). The Ramah cites the opinion of the Ramban and the Tur, who maintain that when a question of law is unresolved, and one party seizes the other's property, the property that was seized must be returned.</i> [The rationale for that ruling is that] there is an unresolved question whether these acts are derivatives of goring, in which case [the owner] is liable [for damage caused] in the public domain, or whether they are derivatives of treading, in which case [the owner] is not liable [for damage caused] in the public domain, as has been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> See Halachah 8.</i>

Chapter 2

[The following laws apply with regard to] the major categories of damages and their derivatives. [If a person's property is considered] <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to the major category, it is considered <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to its derivatives. [If it is considered] <i>tam</i> with regard to the major category, the same law applies with regard to its derivatives. From the outset, [a person's property is considered] to be <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to all the major categories of damage and their derivatives, with the exception of goring and its derivatives. In that instance, [an animal is considered] <i>tam</i> until it has been deemed prone [to goring],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad emphasizes that when an animal has been deemed prone to cause damage through goring or one of its derivatives, it is deemed mu'ad only with regard to the particular activity that it performed repeatedly, but not with regard to any of the other derivatives of goring.</i> as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 1, Halachah 4-5.</i>
All the derivatives of a category of damages are governed by the same laws as the major category, with the exception of stones that are propelled by an animal while walking. This activity is considered a derivative of the category of treading,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> For like damages caused by treading, it involves damages caused accidentally by an animal when walking in its ordinary manner.</i> and one is therefore not liable for damage caused in the public domain. Nevertheless, if such stones cause damage in a person's private domain, [the owner of the animal] must pay [for the damages] from his most choice property,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The Lechem Mishneh raises questions regarding this point, but the Rambam's ruling is justified by the later commentaries.</i> as he must pay for damages caused by treading, the major category. And yet, he is required to pay only half the amount of the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> See Halachah 7, which clarifies the distinction between this and other instances where half payment is required.</i>
What is implied? When an animal enters a courtyard belonging to another person and proceeds to walk, and in doing so propels stones from under its feet that break utensils, [the owner of the animal] must pay half the amount of the damage from his most choice property. This matter is a law communicated by the Oral Tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., it is a law that was communicated orally to Moses on Mount Sinai and then transmitted orally from generation to generation. Although such laws are usually not even alluded to in the Written Law, their authority is the same as that of a law stated in Scripture. See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (Sanhedrin, Chapter 6).</i>
Similarly, if [an animal] was proceeding in the public domain<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> Despite the fact that the animal was walking in the public domain, since the damage took place in a private domain, the owner is liable.</i> and stones were propelled from under its feet into a domain belonging to someone else, and they broke utensils there, [the owner of the animal] must pay half the damages. If [an animal] treads on a utensil in a domain belonging to someone else and breaks it, and shards from the broken utensil fall on another utensil and break it, [the owner of the animal] must pay the entire [damages for the destruction of] the first utensil, and half [the damages for the destruction of] the second utensil.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> The damage to the first utensil is an ordinary instance of treading, while the damage to the second utensil is a case of the law illustrated in the previous two halachot.</i>
If an animal was walking in the public domain and it kicked<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Intentionally.</i> [the ground] and propelled stones that caused damage in the public domain, [the owner] is not liable. If the person whose property was damaged seized a fourth [of the cost] of the damages, it should not be expropriated from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 1, Halachah 11 and notes.</i> [The rationale is that] there is a doubt regarding the matter: perhaps this is considered a deviation from the ordinary pattern and it is not a derivative of treading, for [the animal] kicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> This law is the subject of an unresolved question in Bava Kama 19a. The question is whether kicking the stone is considered like goring - for the kicking was done intentionally - in which case the owner would be liable for damage caused in the public domain, or it is considered to be an ordinary instance of stones that were propelled, and since the damage took place in the public domain, the owner is not held liable.Even according to the logic that maintains that the owner is liable, he is liable for only a fourth of the damage. This figure is arrived at as follows: When damage is caused by propelling stones, the owner is required to pay only half. Since the animal is considered to be a tam - i.e., it is not prone to cause such damages - the owner is required to pay only half of the amount for which he would be liable. Thus, one half of a half is a quarter.Since the question was not resolved by the Sages, the owner should not be held liable. Conversely, if the person whose property was damaged seized the money involved, it should not be expropriated from him.The Ra'avad raises objections to the Rambam's ruling, based on a different understanding of the Talmudic passage. The later authorities, however, follow the Rambam.</i>
If the animal kicked the earth in the domain belonging to another person and stones were propelled because of its kick and caused damages, [the owner] is liable to pay a fourth of the damages, for this is a deviation from the ordinary manner of propelling stones. If the person whose property was damaged seized half [of the cost] of the damages, it should not be expropriated from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> This law is an extension of the unresolved question mentioned in the previous halachah. Since the damage took place in a private domain, the owner is definitely held liable. The question is whether he is liable for half the damages or for only a quarter of the damages. According to the opinion that maintains that kicking is considered a deviation, he should be held liable for only a fourth. According to the opinion that maintains that a deviation is not significant with regard to this category of damages, he is liable to pay half the damages.Since the matter was left unresolved, the owner may be required to pay only one fourth. If, however, the person whose property was damaged seized the owner's property, he need not relinquish half the value of the damages.</i> Even if an animal was walking in a place where it would be impossible for it not to propel stones, and it kicked [the earth] and propelled stones, [the owner] is liable to pay a fourth of the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> The principles operating in this instance are the same as those operating in the first clause. The only reason for mentioning this law is that since it is impossible that the animal would not propel stones, one might not think that the deviation is significant, and the owner should be held liable for half the damages, as in an ordinary case of this nature. This premise is, nevertheless, not accepted.</i> If the person whose property was damaged seized half [of the cost] of the damages, it should not be expropriated from him.
Whenever a person must pay full damages, the payment is considered to be a monetary obligation that he is liable to pay, as if he had borrowed [money] from his colleague. When, by contrast, a person must pay half the damages, the monetary obligation is considered a fine, with the exception of the half damages liable from stones,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> In this instance, although the owner does not pay for the full extent of the damages, none of the leniencies stated below apply.With  regard to the payment of half-damages, according to ordinary logic - and indeed, this was the practice of the secular laws at that time - since the animal was not mu'ad, prone to cause damage, one would not think to hold the owner liable. Nevertheless, to insure higher standards of respect for property, Torah law fined the owner of the animal for half the damages.</i> which is a halachah [transmitted by the Oral Tradition], as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> See Halachah 3.</i>
This is the operating principle: Whenever a person pays for the damage that he caused, it is considered a monetary obligation. Whenever he pays more or less - e.g., the double payment (for theft) or half the amount of damages - the amount that is greater or less than the principal is considered to be a fine. A fine is required only when one is obligated through the testimony of witnesses. When a person admits that he is liable for a fine, he is absolved of the obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> This applies even if after a person admits that he is liable for a fine, witnesses testify to that effect (Hilchot Geneivah 3:8-9 and the Maggid Mishneh). There are also other distinctions between fines and monetary obligations; for example, cases involving fines were arbitrated only by judges who were given semichah. Thus, they are not arbitrated in the present era.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a rooster sticks its head inside a glass container, crows while doing so and breaks it [as a result of the sound]. If there were spices or the like inside [the container, and the rooster] stuck its head in to eat them, [the owner] must pay full damages for the spices<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> As is the case when one's animal eats produce belonging to someone else.</i> and half the damages for the container, as one pays half damages for stones [that are propelled].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> The parallel between this instance and stones that are propelled can be explained as follows: When an animal propels a stone and the stone causes damage, the damage is not caused directly by the animal's body, but indirectly by the power it generated. Similarly, when the rooster breaks the container by crowing, the damage is caused indirectly, as a result of the animal's energy.</i> [The rationale is that this is the animal's] ordinary pattern.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., a rooster is likely to stick its head into a container in order to eat food, and it is likely to crow while eating.</i> If, however, the container is empty, this is a deviation from the norm, and [the owner] is liable to pay half the damages, as in the case with other fines.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> Since this is a deviation from the animal's ordinary pattern, one is liable only for half the damages. The Ra'avad raises the question: Since the first clause of the halachah draws an analogy between the rooster's crowing and an animal's propelling stones, how is this instance different from the law stated in Halachah 6, where the owner is held liable for only a quarter of the damages his animal caused?The Maggid Mishneh states that the Rambam's rationale is difficult to understand, but offers the following explanation. When there are no spices in the container, crowing and breaking the container is considered to be a derivative of goring, not of propelling stones.The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 390:9) does not resolve the issue, explaining that since a deviation from the ordinary pattern is involved, the case is considered a fine and is not arbitrated in the present era.</i>
Similarly, if a horse yelped or a donkey bellowed and utensils were broken as a result, the owner is obligated to pay only half the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> These are not considered departures from the norm. Instead, they are considered derivatives of the category of propelling stones. Therefore, payment is required for only half the damages.</i> Roosters are considered prone to break utensils as they proceed in their ordinary pattern. If there was a string or a strap tied to [a rooster's] legs<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad raises many questions concerning the Rambam's decision, and similarly, Rabbenu Asher interprets the passage in Bava Kama 17a differently from the Rambam. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 390:10) quotes the Rambam's interpretation, while the Ramah refers to the Rambam's rulings as satum, closed to us, and follows the approach of Rabbenu Asher.</i> and a utensil became entangled with the string and rolled and broke, [the owner] is required to pay half the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> It appears that the Rambam considers the string to be like stones propelled by an animal's feet (tz'rurot). They are not considered as a pit, an inanimate object that causes damage, for as the Ra'avad notes, one is liable for the full damages caused by a pit and not half the damages.</i>When does the above apply? When the string was tied to the rooster by a person.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., by the rooster's owner. If it was tied by another person, the owner is not held liable, and the others are required to pay half the damages.</i> If, however, the string became ensnarled around the rooster's foot, its owner is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> As mentioned, the string is considered to be a pit. With regard to that category of damages, Bava Kama 19b states that the pit must be brought into being by a person. If it is brought into being by an animal, the owner of the animal is not liable. In this case, since the owner did not tie the string to the rooster, he is not liable.</i> If that string was owned by a given person,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> Other than the owner of the rooster.</i> rather than being ownerless, the owner of the string is liable to pay half the damages, because the string is like a moving pit.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> As stated by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 411:4), when an object belonging to a person is left in the public domain, moved by an animal and then causes damage, the owner of the animal and the owner of the article must share the cost of the damages equally.</i>
If the owner of the string hid the string, and the roosters trod on it and took it out, and then it became ensnarled around their feet, and as a result utensils were broken, the owner of the string is also freed of liability,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the owner of the rooster is freed of liability, because as above, he did not tie the string to the rooster.</i> for [the damage] was beyond his control.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., he did everything he could to prevent the damage from occurring.</i>
[The following rules apply when] roosters flew from place to place and broke utensils. If they broke the utensils with their wings, [the owner] is liable for the entire damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., this is comparable to an animal's breaking a utensil by treading upon it.</i> If the utensils were broken by the wind generated by [the roosters'] wings, [the owner] is liable for half the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> The wind produced by the roosters' wings is comparable to an an animal's propelling stones.</i>
[If roosters] were digging<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"> Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 2:1).</i> at dough or at produce and soiled it or pecked at it, [the owner] is liable for the entire damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., since the roosters caused the damage in an ordinary fashion with their bodies, the owner is liable for the entire amount.</i> If they caused damages with the dust or stones that they raised with their feet or with their wings, [the owner] is liable for half the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"> This is also comparable to an animal's propelling stones.</i>
If [roosters] were pecking at a rope [that held a bucket], the rope tore, and the bucket broke, [the owner] is liable for the entire damage. [This applies when] the bucket rolled until it fell and broke because of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the roosters pushed the bucket until it fell and broke. They were thus the direct cause of its breaking, and this is considered as treading.If the bucket broke as a result of the rope's tearing, the ruling depends on whether the rope is new or worn. We assume that a rooster will peck at a rope slightly to sip its moisture. Thus, if the rope is worn, it is normal for it to snap. Hence, the owner is liable for the entire damages. If the rope is new, for the rope to tear from such pecking is not ordinary, and the owner is liable for only half the damages (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 390:11).</i> If there was food on the rope, and the rope tore while they were eating, they are liable to pay the entire amount of the damage to the rope as well.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"> Since there is food on the rope, we assume that the roosters will peck on it exceedingly, and it will tear even if it is new.</i>
When a dog or a goat jumps from a roof downward and breaks utensils, [the owner] is liable for the entire damages, because they are prone to this.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"> This is considered to be a derivative of treading.</i> Similarly, if they fell and caused damages, [their owner is liable], because the fact that they climbed to the roof is considered negligence.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the animals' owner should have known that his animals are prone to climb to the roof, and he should have taken precautions against that happening.</i> [Therefore,] even if they fell because of forces beyond [the owner's] control, [he is liable], because whenever a person is negligent at the outset, and damage subsequently occurs because of forces beyond his control, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"> Bava Metzia 42a explains that the logic is that, if not for the negligence, the damage would never have been caused by forces beyond their control.</i>
If [the animals] jump upward [and cause damage], [the owner] is liable for half.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"> For this is a departure from the norm.</i> This applies when a goat climbs upward or a dog jumps. If, however, a dog climbed upward and a goat leaps, whether upward or downward, [the owner] is liable for the entire damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"> For this is their ordinary pattern. The Rambam's ruling follows the version of Bava Kama 22a cited by Rabbenu Chanan'el and Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi. The standard version of the Talmud we possess today differs.Our translation differs from that of Rashi and the Nimukei Yosef who translate  as lowered itself while hanging.</i> Similarly, if a rooster jumps either upward or downward, [the owner] is liable to pay for the entire amount of the damage.
[The following laws apply when] a dog takes a cake [from a fire where it is cooking, a coal is stuck to the cake], and [the dog] takes [the cake] to a grain heap. If it places [the cake] down on the grain heap, eats the cake and kindles the grain heap, [the owner] is liable to pay the full damages for the cake and the place where it placed the cake [in the grain heap].<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"> This is the ordinary pattern of a dog, who will grab food from a fire in order to eat it. And since it is likely that a coal will remain attached to the cake, the owner of the dog is liable for the place where the cake is placed down as well.</i> For the remainder of the grain heap, he is required to pay only half the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"> The standard printed texts of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 2:3) offer the following rationale: This is a deviation from the ordinary pattern. This does not follow any of the explanations given in the Talmud. Rav Kapach's text of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah explains that the burning of the rest of the grain heap is compared to stones that are kicked, for in both cases the damage is caused indirectly. This follows Rabbi Yochanan's position, Bava Kama 22a.</i> If [the dog] dragged the cake all over the grain heap, burning it as it proceeded, [the owner] is liable to pay the entire damages for the cake. For the place of the coals,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"> According to the Radbaz (Volume V, Responsum 1662), this refers to all the places over which the dog dragged the coals.</i> [the owner] is liable to pay half the damages,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"> For this is considered comparable to stones that are kicked.</i> and for the remainder of the grain heap he is not liable at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that the owner is forced to pay one fourth of the damages, because he considers this case comparable to propelling stones, except that a deviation from the normal pattern is involved. The Tur also follows this approach. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 392:1) follows   the opinion of the Rambam, while the Ramah mentions that of the Tur.The Rambam's opinion can be substantiated based on Hilchot Rotze'ach 6:15, which states that a person is not liable for ko'ach kocho, an activity that comes about as an indirect result of his exertion of energy. It appears that the Rambam considers the damage caused by propelling stones to be kocho, a direct result of the person's energy, and not ko'ach kocho (Kessef Mishneh, Radbaz). The Ra'avad, by contrast, considers propelling stones to be ko'ach kocho.</i>
When does the above apply? When the owner of the coal guarded his fire and closed the door, and yet the dog dug underneath [until it could enter and] take the cake from the fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"> In which case, the owner of the dog is responsible for all the damages, for the fire took place because of his negligence.</i> If, however, he did not guard his fire, the owner of the fire is liable for the burning of the grain heap,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"> For it is his negligence that made the fire possible.</i> and the owner of the dog is liable for the cake and the place where it was placed.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"> For the dog caused this damage directly.The Ra'avad and the Tur, who in the previous law maintain that the owner of the dog must pay one fourth of the damages to the grain heap, maintain that he is liable for that amount in this instance as well. Hence, the owner of the fire is liable for only three fourths of the damages. In this instance as well, the Shulchan Aruch (loc. cit.) follows the opinion of the Rambam, while the Ramah mentions that of the Tur.</i>
When a person sets a dog belonging to a colleague on a [third] individual, he is not held liable by mortal courts;<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"> This reflects a fundamental principle in the laws of damages. Grama, being an indirect cause, does not generate liability.</i> the laws of heaven, however, obligate him to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., he has a moral and ethical obligation to pay for the damages. See Bava Kama 55b, which gives several instances of grama and states that the person who indirectly caused the damage has a moral obligation to compensate for it.</i> The owner of the dog is liable to pay half the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"> Dogs do not usually bite. Therefore, the fact that the person who set the dog on the third person provoked it to do so is considered a departure from the norm, and the owner is liable for only half the damages.The Ra'avad adds that if the dog is known to be prone to bite, the owner is liable for the entire amount of the  damages. The Maggid Mishneh differs, maintaining that since the dog was provoked by the person who set it, this is considered a departure from the norm. (See also Chapter 6, Halachah 5.) Sefer Me'irat Einayim 395:2 quotes the Maggid Mishneh's view.</i> Since he knows that if his dog is set upon [a person] maliciously he will bite him, he should not have allowed [his dog to be left to do this]. If [a person] set a dog [belonging to a colleague] to bite the person himself, the owner of the dog is not liable.

When there are two cows in the public domain, one lying down and one walking, if the one walking kicks the one lying down, [the owner] is liable for half the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"> This is considered a derivative of goring. Since the cow is not known to be prone to kick other animals, the owner is liable for only half the damages.</i> Even though it would be the ordinary practice for [the cow] to tread on the cow that is lying down, it is not its ordinary practice to kick it.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"> The owner would not have been liable if the cow had caused the damage by treading on the other cow. Since he did cause the damage by kicking, the owner is liable.</i>

Chapter 3

It is taken for granted that an animal is prone to eat fruit, vegetables or the like. Therefore, if [an animal] enters a domain belonging to another person and eats produce that it would normally eat, [the owner of the animal] is liable for the entire amount of the damages, as stated [in Exodus 22:4]: "And if he shall send forth his animals, and they shall pasture in another's field, payment should be exacted from his choice field." If [the animal] ate produce belonging to another person in the public domain, [the owner] is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The proof-text stated above explicitly states that the owner is liable when his animals pasture in another's field. This is understood as excluding the public domain.In Chapter 1, Halachah 8, the Rambam explains the rationale for this exclusion: It is the habit of an animal to go and eat as it proceeds - i.e., if a person leaves produce in the public domain, he should take it for granted that it will be eaten by the animals passing through.</i> If [the animal] benefits [from eating the produce], the owner must pay for the benefit [his animal received], but not for the damages caused.
What is implied? If [an animal] entered another person's domain and ate sesame seeds, chestnuts or the like that were worth a <i>dinar</i>, [the owner] must pay a <i>dinar</i>. If [the animal ate these foods] in the public domain and derived benefit, we consider [these foods] as if they were barley or fodder, and  [the owner is required to] pay the wholesale<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> Our translation is loose. The Hebrew b'zol literally means as they are cheap. Rashi (Bava Kama 20a) states that he should pay 2/3 of the market price of the fodder. The reason for this reduction is that the owner is being forced to pay against his will.Based on his interpretation of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 2:2), the Shiltei Gibborim interpret b'zol as meaning when they are cheap - i.e., if they cost less than the substance eaten by the animal.</i> price of fodder<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Here also we have used a loose translation, because as mentioned in the Maggid Mishneh, the Kessef Mishneh and the Lechem Mishneh, there are several different interpretations of the Hebrew term emir.</i> or barley.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., although the chestnuts or the sesame seeds are more valuable than the simple fodder, the owner is required to pay only the market price for the fodder, for that is what he would have fed his animal.</i>
If the animal ate foods that are harmful to it - e.g., it ate wheat - since it did not derive any benefit, [the owner] is not liable. If it ate substances that it would not usually eat - e.g., it ate a garment or a utensil - [the owner] should pay half the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The commentaries explain that this damage is considered a derivative of goring.</i> [This applies] both in a private domain and in a public domain. [The rationale is that] this is a deviation. [Hence, the owner is liable for only half the damages. He is liable for damage caused in the public domain, however] because it is the ordinary practice of people to leave their utensils or garments in the public domain while they rest.
There is a doubt [regarding the liability of the owner when his] animal is standing in a private domain, but takes produce [belonging to the owner of the private domain] from the public domain and eats it in that private domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> There are two dimensions to the damage: the place from which the produce was taken, and the place where it was destroyed. One is not liable for produce taken from the public domain, but one is liable for produce eaten in a private domain. Hence the doubt mentioned by the Rambam. See Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 391:12.</i> Therefore, [the owner] is liable only for the benefit [his animal] derived.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> Because of the doubt, money cannot be exacted from its owner.</i> If, however, the person whose property was damaged seizes possession of the full worth of the damage [caused by the animal], it should not be expropriated from him,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Since the money is now in possession of the person whose property was damaged, it can also not be exacted from him. See the notes to Chapter 1, Halachah 11.</i> for [the produce] was eaten in his domain.
When a dog entered a courtyard, took bread or meat, brought it into the public domain or to another courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Belonging to another person.</i> and ate it there, [the owner] should pay for the benefit [the dog] received.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., he does not pay the full price of the food. The rationale is, as in the previous halachah, that the food was eaten in the public domain.</i> If [the dog] ate [the food] in a field belonging to the owner of the courtyard, the [dog's owner] must pay the full extent of the damages as if it had been eaten in the courtyard, because it was eaten in a domain belonging to the person whose property was damaged.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> The fact that it was taken away from the place from which it was originally taken is not significant, provided that it is eaten in a domain belonging to that owner.</i> The same [laws] apply in all analogous situations.
[The following rules apply when] an animal eats foods that it would not ordinarily eat, but would eat under constraint: e.g., a cow that ate barley, a donkey that ate vetch<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> A type of bean usually eaten by cows.</i> or fish, a pig that ate a piece of meat, a dog that licked oil, a cat that ate dates and the like. If the foods were eaten in a domain belonging to the person whose property was damaged, [the owner] must pay the entire amount of the damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> Despite the fact that this is not the animal's ordinary food, since it ate it, the owner is liable for the damages. If, however, an animal eats food that it would never eat - e.g., a cow ate meat - the owner must pay only half the damages Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 391:3).</i> [If the foods were eaten] in the public domain, he is not liable. If [the animal] benefited, the owner must pay for that benefit.
When a beast enters a private domain and seizes an animal or meat<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 391:6) interpret this as referring to raw meat alone.</i> and eats it, [its owner] must pay the full extent of the damages, for this is its ordinary course of behavior. When, however, a dog eats small sheep,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., even small sheep; certainly this applies with regard to large sheep.</i> or a cat eats large cocks,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> Eating small cocks, however, is not considered a deviation.

Once an animal has died, however, it is natural for a dog or cat to eat from its corpse regardless of its size.</i> and [the owner] is liable for [only] half the damages.
When there is a basket of bread [in a private domain], and a donkey enters and breaks the basket and eats the bread, [the owner] is liable for the full extent of the damages, for this is [a donkey's] ordinary behavior. Similarly, if a goat sees a turnip or the like on the opening of a jug, stumbles over the jug and eats the turnip and breaks the jug, [the owner] must pay the full damages for both, for it is the ordinary pattern [for such an animal] to hang on to utensils and climb on them in order to eat. The same applies in all analogous situations. If, however, a donkey came in and ate bread and then broke a basket, [the owner] is liable for full damages for the bread, but only half damages for the basket.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> This is considered a derivative of goring. Hence the payment must be exacted from the body of the animal that caused the damage Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 391:4).</i> The same applies in all analogous situations.
When an animal eats [produce] in the marketplace, whether when walking or when standing, [its owner] must pay [only] for the benefit it received.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> For the marketplace is considered to be part of the public domain.</i> This applies even if the animal turns [its head] to the corners of the marketplace and eats.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> For this is also the ordinary practice of an animal in the public domain.</i> If, however, the animal left the marketplace and went and stood at the corner of the marketplace and ate [produce], [its owner] must pay for the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> The area on the side of the marketplace is considered to be a private domain, and considered like the private property of the person whose property was damaged (Tosafot, Bava Kama 21a).</i> If the animal ate from [produce in] the storefront, [the owner] must pay [only] for the benefit it received. If it ate from [produce] within the store, he must pay the full extent of the damages.
If an animal was walking in the public domain and stretched out its neck and ate from [produce] that was [loaded onto] another animal's back, [its owner] must pay [only] for the benefit it received, for it is common for animals to eat from [a load] being carried by another.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> Therefore, it is considered to be an ordinary instance of an animal's eating produce in the public domain.</i> [This law applies] even when [the animal] stands.

By doing so, it is considered to have left the public domain and entered the domain of the person whose produce was damaged.</i> to eat from the [produce] that was [loaded onto] another animal's back, [its owner] must pay the full extent of the damages,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 391:11) differ and maintain that this ruling applies only when it is impossible for the animal to eat the produce without jumping on the other animal.</i> because the back of another animal is considered to be the private domain of the person who suffered the damage.
If an animal slips on a stone or on its urine and falls into a garden of fruit or vegetables or if it eats from the garden, [the owner] is required to pay [only] for the benefit it receives. Even if it walks from one row to another row, and even if it stays there the entire day, he is required to pay [only] for the benefit it receives.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> Since the animal entered the private domain by accident, its owner is not held responsible for the damage it caused.</i> What benefit could it receive from falling? That it fell on a soft place and did not crush its limbs. If, by contrast, an animal descended [into private property] in an ordinary manner and ate produce, [the owner] must pay the full extent of the damages. Even if it soiled produce with its afterbirth, [the owner] must pay the full extent of the damages, because the first stage involved negligence.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> Even if the owner did not know that the animal was about to give birth, and thus the damage can be considered to have come about by forces beyond his control. Since the animal's entry into the private domain came as a result of negligence, the owner is held liable. See Chapter 2, Halachah 15.</i> Similarly, if it was pushed by another animal and fell, [the owner] must pay the full extent of the damages, because he should have had them pass one by one so that they would not push each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., this is also considered negligence on the owner's part. The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 394:1) consider this to be accidental, and free the owner of responsibility.</i>
If it slipped and fell [into another person's garden], departed<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 394:2) state that this law applies when the owner is aware that the animal entered the garden and departed.</i> and then returned to that garden, [the owner] must pay the full extent of the damages, even if it returned without his knowledge. He was obligated to watch it, [and prevent it] from returning.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> The Maggid Mishneh, the Tur and the Ramah (ibid.) state that if the owner locked the animal in a stall in an ordinary manner, and the animal managed to escape and return to the garden, the owner is not liable, because he did everything necessary to prevent this from happening.</i> For it is known that if an animal knows the way to a garden, it will return on its own initiative.
When a potter brings his wares into a person's courtyard without his permission, and an animal belonging to the owner [of the courtyard] broke the pottery, [the owner] is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> His animal has free rein within his own courtyard; it can be assumed that it will walk freely and trod on anything placed there.

The animal should not have eaten it.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the owner of the courtyard should take responsibility for making sure that his animal does not overeat (Sefer Me'irat Einayim 393:4).</i> When the owner of a courtyard allowed a person to bring his produce into [the courtyard] and left [the owner of the produce] to watch it, if an animal belonging to the owner of the courtyard ate from the produce and suffered damages, the owner of the produce is liable. Since he saw the animal eating produce that could damage it and took no action, he is liable. For the owner of the courtyard is not present to banish his animal from them. An incident occurred when a woman entered to bake in the house of her neighbors.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"> Sefer Me'irat Einayim 393:5 explains that this incident teaches that even when the owner of the produce does not know that the owner of the courtyard has left, under certain circumstances, he should take responsibility for the animal belonging to the owner of the courtyard.</i> They left her alone, so that they would not see her while she was kneading and baking.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"> It is common for a woman to roll up her sleeves and bare her arms when she is kneading dough.

The Sages obligated her to reimburse [the owners] for the goat. These principles apply in all similar situations.
When a person made a grain heap in a field belonging to a colleague without the latter's permission, and an animal belonging to the owner of the field ate it, [the owner of the field] is not liable. If the animal slipped on it and suffered injuries, the owner of the produce is liable.

When a person entrusts his animal to an unpaid watchman, a paid watchman, a renter or a borrower, these individuals assume the owner's responsibilities. If [the animal] causes damages, the watchman is held liable. When does the above apply? When he did not guard the animal at all. If, however, he guarded the animal in an excellent manner, as he should,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., enclosing it behind a gate capable of withstanding winds of unusual force.</i> and it got loose and caused damage, the watchman is not liable, and the owners are liable, even if the animal kills a human being.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> The wording of this halachah has raised questions for there is an obvious difficulty: If the watchmen guarded the animal in an excellent manner, why is the owner liable? The Maggid Mishneh explains that the liability refers only to damage caused by the animal by goring. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 1.) The Kessef Mishneh refers to a responsum purported to have been sent by the Rambam to the Sages of Lunil, which states that there was a printing error and the text should read: If, however, they guarded the animal in an excellent manner, as they should, and it got loose and caused damage, the watchman is not liable. If the watchman guarded the animal in an inferior manner, he is not held liable if he is an unpaid watchman. Instead, the owners are liable, even if the animal kills a human being. The watchman is held liable if he is a paid watchman, a renter or a borrower.In his Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 396:8), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the interpretation of the Maggid Mishneh. The Sefer Me'irat Einayim 396:18 questions this, referring to Karo's Kessef Mishneh.</i>Should the watchman guard the animal in an inferior manner,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> Enclosing it behind a gate capable of withstanding ordinary winds.</i> he is not held liable if he is an unpaid watchman.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> For an unpaid watchman is not expected to take as thorough care of an animal as a paid watchman. See, however, note 13.</i> If he is a paid watchman, a renter or a borrower, he is held liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> Such watchmen are expected to watch the animal in a thorough manner.</i>
If [a person] leaves an animal in the sun and it gets loose and causes damage, even if it must dig [under the fence to do so], the one who left it in the sun is liable. [The rationale is that because of] the discomfort [the animal] feels, it will do anything it possibly can to flee.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 396:5) state that even if the person tied the animal with a strong rope, he is liable if it breaks loose in these circumstances.</i>
When [a person] gives his animal to a deaf mute, a mentally incompetent individual or a minor<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> All of these three types of people are considered mentally incompetent. They are not responsible for their actions, and the owner is considered negligent for charging them with watching his animal.</i> to watch, the owner is liable. [This applies] even if the ox is tied, for an ox - and similarly other [animals] - will break open the knot and go out and cause damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> The owner is considered negligent because these individuals will frequently play with the rope, and by doing so loosen the knot, enabling the animal to break free.</i> Even if the animal was guarded in an excellent manner, and it dug [under the fence] and escaped and caused damage, the owners are liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> Although escaping in this manner is considered to be a factor beyond the owner's control, since he was originally negligent in entrusting the animal to a mentally incompetent person, he must bear the consequences.The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling. It is, however, accepted by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 396:6).</i>
[The following rules apply when] a person entrusts his ox to five men, one of them was negligent, and the ox escaped and caused damage. If all five are required to guard the ox, the person who was negligent is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> For the damage is due to his negligence.</i> If the ox can still be watched by the others, they share in the liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> For had they not been negligent as well, the ox would not have escaped. Although the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 396:7) appears to favor the Rambam's ruling, it also quotes the opinion of the Tur, which states that the person who is negligent shares the liability only when the others tell him that because of his negligence, they are withdrawing their responsibility. Otherwise, it is they who are liable, and not he.</i>
[The following rules apply if a person] borrowed an ox under the presumption that it was an ordinary ox, and it was discovered that it had already been classified as one that gores. If the borrower knew that it had a tendency to gore,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> But did not know that it had been placed in the category of a goring ox.</i> the owners are required to pay half the damages, for wherever the ox goes, it remains the owner's property.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., when an animal is sold, its status is changed with the change in ownership. (See Chapter 6, Halachah 6.) This, however, does not apply when it is merely borrowed (Kessef Mishneh).</i> The borrower is also required to pay half the damages, because even if it had been an ordinary ox, as he had thought, he would have been required to pay half the damages, for he knew that the ox had a tendency to gore.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, explaining that it applies only when the court takes possession of the ox.</i> If, however, the borrower did not know of this tendency, he is not liable at all,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> For it is more difficult to guard an ox that has a tendency to gore, and the borrower did not accept this responsibility.</i> and the owners must pay the entire amount of the damages.
When a borrower borrows an ox that is classified as an ordinary ox, and it becomes classified as a goring ox when in the possession of the borrower, it is removed from that category when it is returned to its owner. Since the domain [under which the animal is] changes, its classification also changes. [If the ox gores,] the owners must pay half the damages, and the borrower is not held liable at all, for he returned it to its owners.
When a watchman accepts responsibility only for watching the body of an animal [entrusted to him], but [does not accept responsibility] for the damage it causes, if [the animal] causes damage the watchman is not held liable, and its owners are.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> The Rambam's statements imply that if the watchman makes no specific statement with regard to whether or not he is responsible for the damages the animal causes, he is liable for the damage it causes (Maggid Mishneh). The Ra'avad understands the Rambam as making such an implication, and he objects, maintaining that the watchman should not be held liable. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 396:8) follows the Maggid Mishneh's conception. They maintain that the principle followed by the Rambam should be accepted with the exception of a goring ox.</i> If [the watchman] accepted responsibility [only] for the damages [the animal] causes, he is liable if it causes damage. If it is injured, the watchman is not liable, and the owners should sue the person who caused the injury.
When a watchman entrusts [an animal] to another watchman, [and it causes damage], the first watchman is liable to pay the person whose property was damaged. For whenever one watchman delegates [an entrusted object] to another watchman, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> The first watchman is considered negligent in entrusting it to a second watchman (even if an unpaid watchman entrusts it to a paid watchman). Therefore, the first watchman is liable, even in an instance when the object was destroyed by forces beyond the second watchman's control.</i> For the person whose property was damaged will tell him: "Why didn't you watch it yourself instead of delegating it to someone else? Pay me yourself, and sue the watchman to whom you delegated it." If, however, the watchman entrusted [the animal] to his son, a member of his household or one of his helpers, they assume the responsibility that was the watchman's, and they are liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> The rationale is that a watchman will frequently delegate an entrusted article to these individuals. The owner should have taken this into account when he entrusted the article to the watchman at the outset.</i>
[The following rule applies when] a watchman is liable to pay [for the damages an animal caused], but he is insolvent. If the animal that caused the damage is considered to be an ordinary animal, in which case half the damages must be paid from the body of the animal itself, the person whose property was damaged should take his due from the animal, and the sum that he collects should be considered to be a debt owed by the watchman to the owner of the animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> If the animal was already classified as prone to cause damages, this law would not apply, because the obligation would rest solely on the watchman's person. When, however, the animal is not placed in that category, since its own body is on lien for the damages, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 7, it is expropriated in lieu of payment.</i>
Whenever an animal causes damage to crops that are growing, the damage is assessed by comparison with a field sixty times the size of the crops that were damaged. The one who is liable - either the owner or the watchman - is obligated to pay that sum.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> Since the produce was growing, it would be unfair for the person whose animal caused the damages to be required to pay for it as if it were harvested fruit that was damaged. Instead, one considers the damaged crops as a part in a larger whole, thus reducing the amount of the damages. A compromise is accepted that takes in consideration the positions of both the owner of the land and the owner of the animal.The produce is not evaluated individually, for this would inflate the amount of damages paid. Nor is its share evaluated in comparison with the entire field, for then the amount of damages would be unfairly low. Instead, it is evaluated when compared with an area sixty times its size as explained.A se'ah is six kabbin. A kab is 1.376 kilograms according to Shiurei Torah. Thus a se'ah is 8.256 kilograms. The area where a se'ah of seeds would be sown is 50 cubits by 50 cubits.</i> What is implied? If [an animal] ate the amount of produce that would grow when a <i>se'ah</i> [of seeds] were sown in that field, we calculate the worth of an area in which sixty <i>se'ah</i> [of seeds] could be sown in that field, [evaluating] how much it would be worth [before the animal ate from it] and how much it is worth now. [The owner or the watchman] is liable for the remainder. Similarly, if the animal ate an amount of produce that would grow when a <i>kav</i> or a quarter of a <i>kav</i> were sown - [or even if it ate] one stalk of grain - the damages are assessed by comparison with a field sixty times the size of the crops that were damaged.
When, [by contrast,] an animal ate fruit that ripened and no longer needed [the nurture of] the land, [the owner of the animal is required to] pay the full value of ripe produce. If [the animal ate] a <i>se'ah</i>, he must pay for a <i>se'ah</i>. If [it ate] two<i> se'ah</i>, he must pay for two <i>se'ah</i>. [The following laws apply if an animal] ate the fruit of one date palm, or a person gathered the fruit of a colleague's date palm and ate it. If it was a Roman date palm, whose fruit is not of very high quality, it should be measured in comparison with a orchard of date palms sixty times the size of its land. If it was a Persian date palm or the like, whose fruit is of very high quality, the date palm should be evaluated individually. An assessment should be made of its worth before the fruit was eaten and its worth after the fruit was eaten.

Chapter 5

[The following laws apply when] an animal was pasturing and entered fields and vineyards [belonging to others]. Even though it did not cause any damage,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad and Rabbenu Asher take issue with the Rambam on this point, explaining that the owner of the field generally does not have the right to slaughter an animal belonging to another person. Bava Kama 23b does speak of the owner of a field slaughtering goats belonging to someone else, but this was a special instance. He knew that the goats were being taken to the market to be slaughtered.The Maggid Mishneh explains that the Rambam had a different interpretation of that passage. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 397:1-2) follows the Ra'avad's interpretation.</i> a warning should be given to its owner on three occasions.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Shulchan Aruch (op. cit.) interpret this to be implying that if the owner of the animal says, Why come to me with a complaint? Let the owner of the field build a strong fence around his field to prevent animals from entering, his claim is not accepted. He is required to take responsibility for his animal.</i> [Afterwards,] if he does not watch his animal and prevent it from pasturing [in other people's fields], the owner of the field has the right to slaughter the animal in a ritually acceptable manner,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> This minimizes to the greatest degree possible the loss that the owner of the animal would suffer.</i> and tell its owners: "Come and sell your meat." [The rationale is that] it is forbidden for a person to cause damages and then to pay for the damages he caused. Even being an [indirect] cause of damage is forbidden.
For this reason, our Sages forbade [our people] from raising small animals<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> E.g., sheep and goats.</i> and small beasts<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> E.g., deer.</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, where there are fields and vineyards.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> For they will harm the produce. The Maggid Mishneh explains that this law (and those that follow) were instituted as part of the provisions of yishuv Eretz Yisrael, the settlement of our Holy Land. (See also Hilchot Edut 10:4, which states that a shepherd of sheep or goats is not acceptable as a witness, because it is likely that he will pasture his flocks in fields belonging to others. See also Hilchot Bechorot 3:6.)It is, however, permissible to raise large animals like cows in Eretz Yisrael.</i> One may, however, raise these animals in the forests and deserts of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">  Where the damage is not significant.</i>In Syria,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hilchot Terumot 1:4,9, which defines the status of Syria as less than that of Eretz Yisrael, but greater than that of the diaspora as a whole.</i> it is permitted to raise these animals everywhere.
Joshua and his court established ten conditions at the time they divided the land [into ancestral plots]: a) One may pasture a small animal in forests that are thick with trees;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the owner of the forest has no right to protest.</i> one may not, however, pasture a large animal there.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> For it could damage the forest.</i> In a forest that is not thick with trees, one may not pasture either a large animal or a small animal without the permission of the owners.  b) Any person is permitted to collect wood from a field belonging to a colleague. This refers to wood that is not valuable - comparable to thorns, brambles and prickly shrubs. Moreover, this refers to fresh twigs that are still connected to their source of nurture,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> If they are dry and severed from the ground, they are fit to serve as firewood for the owners of the field.</i> and applies only when the person will not uproot them entirely.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> Significantly, the Tur (Choshen Mishpat 274) does not mention this dimension.</i> It is forbidden to take other types of wood. c) Any person may collect grass that is growing on its own accord anywhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> This is beneficial for the owner of the field, because the grass detracts from the field's growth potential.</i> except for a field of fenugrec that was sown to be used as animal fodder.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> For grass and fenugrec make excellent fodder. For that reason, if the fenugrec is being grown for human consumption, one may pick the grass. Bava Kama 81a states that if the fenugrec is growing in rows, one may assume that it has been planted for human consumption.</i> d) A person may cut off a branch from any tree in any place,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> This is allowed to enhance the settlement of Eretz Yisrael, for it will enable more trees to be grown there.</i> except from the branches left in an old olive tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> When an olive tree has become old, and it no longer produces a significant amount of fruit, all of its branches are cut off except two, so that its growth potential will become concentrated. Cutting off one of these remaining branches would damage the future of the tree.</i> One may not, however, cut off closer than the length of an egg from the place where the branches begin to spread from an olive tree. And one may cut only from the place where a shoot is joined to the trunk of a reed or a vine. With regard to other trees, one may cut from the center of the tree and not from its higher branches. [Although] permission was granted to cut off a branch, this applies only to [cutting] from a new branch<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> One that is less than a year old.</i> that does not yet produce fruit, but not from an old branch that produces fruit. One may cut off [a branch] only from a portion of the tree that is not exposed to the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> For it is the branches that are exposed to the sun that provide a tree with its nurture.</i> e) When a new spring of water emerges, the inhabitants of the city in whose territory it emerges may make use of it,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> Without payment.</i> even though its source is elsewhere. No others may take water from it together with them. f) Any person may catch fish in Lake Kinneret, provided he fishes with a small net. Only the tribe<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the tribe of Naftali.</i> to which the lake was awarded as part of their ancestral portion may spread out large nets that will prevent the passage of other boats.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur (loc. cit.) and others differ with the Rambam and maintain that even the owner of a lake may not fish with nets large enough to prevent the passage of a boat.Others interpret large nets as referring to nets that will catch large quantities of fish. Fishing privileges of that nature are not granted to another tribe.</i> g) Any person who needs to relieve himself may turn off the path, go behind any fence he sees and defecate there. [This applies] even with regard to a field of saffron.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> A type of spice that will be damaged by the unpleasant odor of feces.</i> One may pick up a stone from there and clean oneself with it. h) Any person who loses his way in a vineyard or the like may break through the vines and ascend, or break through the vines and descend until he is able to find his way. i) When the public thoroughfare is filled with mud, or the ravines are filled with water, passersby may take side paths, even though they are private property. j) A corpse that has no one to bury it<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> We have used a loose translation. The Hebrew term meit mitzvah, literally a corpse that we are commanded to bury, refers to a Jewish corpse lying on the road, that has no one to bury it (Hilchot Eivel 3:8).</i> acquires its place and should be buried there by the person who finds it. This applies provided the corpse is not lying lengthwise across the path,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> Our translation is taken from Rashi's commentary on Bava Kama 81b. In these instances, the presence of a grave will be likely to impart impurity to a large number of people.</i> or within the Sabbath boundaries of a city. In those instances, the corpse should be transported to a cemetery.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> The commentaries question why the Rambam requires a corpse found in the road to be taken to the cemetery. In Hilchot Tum'at Meit 8:7, he states that in such an instance, a corpse may be buried in a nearby field. This indeed is the ruling of the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah 364:3).</i>
King Solomon ordained that passersby are permitted to walk on private paths in the fields during the summer months until the second phase of fall rains descend.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., from the seventeenth of Cheshvan on. Until then, passersby will not do any damage to the fields. Once the rains descend, however, the seeds begin to take root, and treading on them would damage them.</i>
These rules apply in all places, even in the diaspora.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur (Choshen Mishpat 274) quotes this ruling. The Shulchan Aruch, however, does not mention these laws. The Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 274:1) quotes the Tur's view and questions why the Shulchan Aruch ignored these laws. He explains that it is possible that the Shulchan Aruch also maintains that these laws are applicable in the diaspora, but failed to mention them because it was uncommon for Jews to own land at that time.The concept that these laws apply in the diaspora is somewhat difficult according to the Maggid Mishneh (and Rashi), who explain that the motivating rationale for these laws is the concern for yishuv Eretz Yisrael, the settlement of our Holy Land. Others explain that these provisions are intended to avoid strife and friction.</i>
From the time dew descends in Babylonia, it is forbidden to walk through private pathways belonging to others.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> For this will cause damage to the land there.</i>
Although it is forbidden to raise a small animal in<i> Eretz Yisrael</i>, one may maintain possession of one for 30 days prior to a pilgrimage festival,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> In the time of the Temple, these animals were offered as sacrifices. Even after the Temple's destruction, it is still a mitzvah to celebrate on the festivals by eating meat (Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov 6:18).</i> or prior to the wedding of one's son.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> For these feasts are also considered to be se'udot mitzvah (feasts associated with the performance of a mitzvah).</i> A butcher may buy an animal for slaughter and may leave it for a certain time until he slaughters it, as long as it does not pasture with the flock. Instead, whoever maintains possession of a small animal must keep it within his house, so that it does not cause damage.
[Our Sages] established an equation between Babylonia and Israel, prohibiting the raising of small animals and beasts there as well. For [in Talmudic times,] the majority of the fields and vineyards there belonged to Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> From this, we can assume that these laws would apply in any community where most of the lands are owned by Jews.</i>
Similarly, our Sages forbade raising pigs in all places.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 7:7), the Rambam states that this law applies to all animals that are forbidden to be eaten. (See also The Guide for the Perplexed, Volume III, Chapter 48, which speaks of the unfavorable tendencies brought about by eating pork.)From the conclusion of this halachah, however, it appears that the Rambam is focusing on a different rationale: the material and not the spiritual damage that pigs can cause.</i> Also, [our Sages forbade raising] dogs unless they are tied by a chain. One may, however, raise dogs in a city near the border.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> For they will serve as watchdogs and raise a clamor in the event of attack.</i> During the day [the dogs] should be chained, and at night let loose. Our Sages said:<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"> Bava Kama 82b, 83a.</i> "Cursed be one who raises dogs and pigs, because they frequently cause a great degree of damage."
When a shepherd repents, he should not be obligated to sell [his entire herd] immediately. Instead, he should sell a bit at a time.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"> If he were required to sell his entire herd immediately, it is possible that he would have to reduce the price of the animals. Our Sages feared that the possibility of this loss would intimidate the shepherd and prevent him from repenting.</i> Similarly, if a person has inherited dogs and pigs, he is not required to sell all of them immediately, but instead may sell them bit by bit.

Chapter 6

What is meant by the term <i>mu'ad</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Mu'ad literally means forewarned - i.e., the animal is prone to perform such acts, and the owner should be forewarned.</i> [An animal regarding which] testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> From two acceptable witnesses.</i> was given on three [different] days. If, however, an animal gored [other animals] on one day, or it bit, lay upon, kicked or butted [other animals many] - even one hundred - times in one day, it should not be considered to be <i>mu'ad</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> For it is possible that the animal was disturbed by certain factors on that day, and its conduct is not indicative of its ordinary pattern.</i> If three pairs of witnesses gave testimony [concerning an animal]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., that it gored three other animals on three days (Ra'avad, Maggid Mishneh).</i> on one day, there is an [unresolved] doubt whether it is classified as <i>mu'ad</i> or not.
The warning administered to an owner [for an animal] must be administered in the owner's presence, as [implied by Exodus 21:29]: "And the owners shall be warned." The warning must be administered in a court.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> Hilchot Sanhedrin 5:12 states that this refers to a court of three judges who received semichah. For this reason, ever since this semichah was nullified, animals were no longer placed into the category of mu'ad. Accordingly, these laws do not apply in the present age.</i>
When an ox belonging to a deaf mute, a mentally incompetent individual, a minor<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> All the first three people are considered to be mentally incompetent and are not held responsible for their conduct.</i> or a person who is overseas gores, [the owner] is not liable. The court should, however, appoint a guardian for the ox and administer the warning to the guardian.
[The following rules apply when this ox] causes damage after the warning was administered to the guardian:<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the Rambam explains that the ox gored another ox, a guardian was appointed, and then it gored again. (See Or Sameach.)</i> If the ox is still classified as a <i>tam</i>, an ordinary animal, half the damages must be paid from the body [of the ox].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Rashi (Bava Kama 39a), Rabbenu Asher and the Ra'avad differ and maintain that a guardian is not appointed unless the ox gores three times. Otherwise, the owners are not held liable.</i> If a warning was administered on three [different] days, and afterwards [the ox] causes damage, the guardian must pay for the damage from the choicest properties he owns.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur (Choshen Mishpat 406) states that the payment is made from the property of the orphans, and not from that of the guardian.</i> When the orphans attain majority, they must enter into litigation with the guardian and repay him.
When oxen are used for sport,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> Bava Kama 4:3 uses the expression A bull from a stadium. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains This one sends out his bull and the other sends out his bull. After having trained their animals to gore, they call to them to attack the other animal to see who will be victorious. This is done with the owner's consent. This is the habit of many foolish people.</i> and they are trained to gore each other, they are not considered to be <i>mu'adim</i> [to gore] each other. [Moreover,] even if they kill a human, they should not be executed, for [Exodus 21:28] states: "When an ox gores...," [implying that it does so on its own initiative,] not that it was prompted to gore.
When an ox was sold or given away as a present after its owners had been warned, its status reverts back to that of a <i>tam</i>. With the change in ownership, its status changes. If, however, an ox was borrowed or entrusted to a watchman, its status remains unchanged. Similarly, if a warning regarding an ox was given to a guardian, and then the owner who was a deaf mute regained his faculties, or the owner who was mentally incompetent regained competence, or the owner who was a minor attains majority, the status of the ox remains unchanged,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> See Halachah 3. Although previously the guardian was responsible for watching the ox, the change in responsibility is not a change in ownership, and the ox's status is not changed.</i> for it remains in the domain of the [same] owner.
When an animal was classified as <i>mu'ad</i>, and then it changes its conduct, its status changes and it is considered to be a <i>tam</i>. What is implied? If an ox was classified as <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to goring and it ceased goring, it is considered to be a <i>tam</i> with regard to goring, even though it still butts. When is it considered to have ceased [goring]? When children play<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 2:4). In neither source does the Rambam mention how often the children must play with the ox. With this ruling, the Rambam rejects an opinion stated in Bava Kama 23b, which states that if three days pass when the ox sees other oxen and does not gore them, the warning is rescinded.</i> with it and it does not gore them. Similarly with regard to other tendencies regarding which warnings were given, [the status of the animal remains unchanged] until [children] play with it, and it does not do [what it was wont to do previously].
When an ox has been classified as <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to [other oxen], it is not considered to be <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to other types of animals. An ox that has been classified as <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to humans is not considered to be <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> Conversely, an ox that has been classified as mu'ad with regard to animals is not considered to be mu'ad with regard to humans.</i> If it has been classified as <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to young animals, it is not considered to be <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to older animals. Therefore, if it caused damage of the type regarding which the warning was given, the owner is liable for the full amount of the damages. If it caused damages of another type, regarding which a warning was not given, [the owners] must pay [only] half the damages. If it has been classified as <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to Sabbaths, it is not considered to be <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to weekdays.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> Rashi (Bava Kama 37a) explains that on the Sabbath, an ox is not required to work. Hence, it may not feel the yoke of its master as thoroughly and may therefore cause damage. Others cite the Jerusalem Talmud which explains that since people dress differently on the Sabbath, the ox will not be familiar with them, and may gore them because it views them as strangers. This does not apply during the week.</i> If it causes damage on the Sabbath, the owner is liable for the full amount of the damages. During the week, [the owners] must pay [only] half the damages. When is the warning rescinded? When children will play with it on the day concerning which the warning was given, and it does not harm them in the way it is known to cause harm.
If [an ox] gored another ox on one day, a donkey on the following day, and a camel on the day afterwards, it is classified as <i>mu'ad</i> for all [these three] types [of animals].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> Our translation is based on the gloss of the Maggid Mishneh, which reflects the Rambam's wording in Halachot 10 and 12. The Rambam is explaining that to be classified as mu'ad for a type of animal, an ox does not have to gore that type of animal three times. The Ra'avad differs and explains that the ox is considered to be mu'ad for all types of animals.</i> [A warning should also be administered to an owner in the following situation. His ox] saw another ox on one day and gored it. On the next day, it saw another ox but did not gore it. On the third day, it saw another ox and gored it. On the fourth day, it saw another ox but did not gore it. On the fifth day, it saw another ox and gored it, and on the sixth day, it saw another ox but did not gore it. [In these circumstances, the ox] becomes classified as <i>mu'ad</i> to gore oxen on alternate days.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> Thus, if it gores an ox on an odd day, its owner will be liable for the full extent of the damages, and if it gores on an even day, he will be liable for only half the damages.</i> Similar laws apply in other analogous situations.
[Similarly, a warning should also be administered to an owner in the following situation. His ox] saw another ox on one day and gored it. On the next day, it saw a donkey, but did not gore it. On the third day, it saw a horse and gored it. On the fourth day, it saw a camel but did not gore it. On the fifth day, it saw a mule and gored it, and on the sixth day, it saw a wild ass but did not gore it. [In these circumstances, the ox] becomes classified as <i>mu'ad</i> to gore all [these three] types [of animals] on alternate days. If it gores one of these types of animals that it had gored on alternate days on a day on which it is <i>mu'ad</i>, [the owner must pay the full damages, as is required for an ox that is] <i>mu'ad</i>.
[When an ox] gores [an animal] on the fifteenth of one month, on the sixteenth of the following month, and on the seventeenth of the third month, it is not classified as <i>mu'ad</i> until it adds a day a third time, in the fourth month.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> A parallel to this law is found with regard to fixing the pattern of the onset of menstruation. See Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah 8:6.</i> If an ox hears a shofar blast and gores on three [successive] occasions, it is considered <i>mu'ad</i> [to gore after hearing] shofar blasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., it appears that the shofar blasts prompt the ox to gore.</i> Similar laws apply in other analogous situations.
[There is an unresolved doubt in the following situations.] An ox gored three other oxen on three successive days. On the fourth day it gored a donkey, and on the fifth day it gored a camel. Or at first it gored a donkey and a camel, and then it gored three oxen one after another. There is a doubt if it is classified as <i>mu'ad</i> only for oxen or for all three types of animals. Similarly, if an ox gores on three successive Sabbaths and then on the Sunday and the Monday [following the third Sabbath], or it gored on Thursday, on Friday and then on three successive Sabbaths, there is a doubt whether it is classified as <i>mu'ad</i> only for Sabbaths or for a block of three days, two of which are ordinary weekdays.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, asking why the animal would be considered to be mu'ad for only this block of three days.</i>
With regard to these unresolved questions and the like, [the owner of the ox] that caused the damage is required to pay for only half the damages. If the person whose property was damaged seizes property belonging to the other person equivalent to the full amount of the damages, it is not expropriated from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 1, Halachah 11.</i>

Chapter 7

[The following rules apply when] an ox breaks loose and causes damage after its owner had tied it with a rope and locked it [in a corral] in an acceptable manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., with a gate that can withstand an ordinary wind. According to the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 396:1), this halachah is speaking about guarding the animal in an inferior manner as explained in the notes to Chapter 4, Halachah 4. If the animal is guarded in an excellent manner, there is no liability.</i> If it is a <i>tam</i>, he is required to pay only half the damages. If it is <i>mu'ad</i>, he is not liable at all,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> According to the Rambam, the owner is not liable for even half the damages. Rabbenu Asher and others differ. According to their view, since he did guard the ox to some degree, he is not liable for the full damages. He is, however, liable for half the damages, for there is no reason why the laws governing him should be more lenient than those governing an ordinary ox. See Sefer Me'irat Einayim 396:1.</i> as [implied by Exodus 21:29]: "[If the owners were warned,] and they did not guard him." [One can infer that] if they did guard, they are not liable. [And in the above instance, the ox] was guarded.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama, conclusion of Chapter 4), which states that since this ox frequently gores, it is a mitzvah to slaughter it.</i>Similarly, if an ox caused damage through an activity for which he is <i>mu'ad</i> at the outset - e.g., it ate a type of food that it usually eats or it broke objects by treading on them - [the owner] is not liable [in the above instance].
If the ox has been classified as <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to its right horn, but it is not <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to its left horn, and it got loose after it had been guarded in an acceptable manner, [the owner is required to] pay half the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> Since the ox is considered to be a tam with regard to one element of goring, the owner is never freed from the obligation to pay the half damages that the owner of an ordinary ox would pay.</i> [This applies] regardless of whether it gored with its right horn or its left horn.
[The following rules apply when] an animal injures a human being, whether intentionally or unintentionally. If the animal is a <i>tam</i>, half the damages must be paid from the body of the animal. If it is <i>mu'ad</i>, [the owner] must pay the entire amount of the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> Although these principles are stated in the Torah explicitly with regard only to damage done to another animal, Bava Kama 33a explains how an equation to human injury is derived.</i> He is, however, not liable for compensation for unemployment, embarrassment, pain and medical expenses. For the Torah required redress for these matters only when one person injured a colleague.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> For Leviticus 24:19, the source for the laws applying to human injury, states: When a man will cause a blemish to a colleague.... Implied is that these laws apply only when the injury is caused by another man.</i> When, by contrast, it is an animal which caused the injury, it is as if [the animal] damaged the person's property, and [the owner] is liable for only half of the damages.For this reason, if a person's ox causes [another individual] embarrassment, he is not liable. If, however, he causes that embarrassment himself, he is liable, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> Hilchot Chovel UMazik 1:1,9.</i>If a person's ox injures his father or mother, or it sets fire to a person's grain heap on the Sabbath, [the owner] is liable, although if the person performed these same actions himself, he would not be liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> A human being is not liable in these instances. The rationale is that he is liable for capital punishment for injuring his parents or desecrating the Sabbath. Whenever a person incurs both liability for capital punishment and monetary restitution with the performance of a single deed, he is freed of responsibility for the monetary claim. See Hilchot Chovel UMazik 4:5,7.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a person brings his ox into a courtyard belonging to another person without his permission. If the [uninvited ox] was gored by an ox belonging to the owner or bitten by the owner's dog, the owner is not liable. If the [uninvited ox] gored an ox belonging to the owner [of the courtyard], [the owner of the uninvited ox is liable.] If [his ox] is <i>tam</i>, [its owner] must pay half the damages. If it is<i> mu'ad</i>, he must pay the entire damages, as if it had gored [the other ox] in the public domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> The words as if it had gored in the public domain refer to the fact that the owner of an ox that is tam pays for only half the damages. One might draw a comparison to the damage caused by eating or treading, in which instance the owner of the ox is not held liable for damage caused in the public domain, but he is liable for the entire amount of damages caused in the domain of the owner of the produce. To counter this hypothesis, the Rambam emphasizes that with regard to goring, one is liable as in the public domain, but not more.</i>
[In the above situation, the following rules apply if the uninvited ox] falls into a cistern in this courtyard and spoils its water. If it spoiled the water immediately upon falling within,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> E.g., the ox was covered with filth at the time it fell into the cistern.</i> [the owner of the ox] is liable for the loss caused by the ruining of the water. If [the water] was not spoiled until afterwards,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> E.g., the ox spoiled it with its wastes.</i> [the owner] is not liable. [The rationale is that] the ox is considered to be an obstruction in the cistern, and the water is considered to be a utensil. And one is never liable for damage to utensils caused by an obstruction.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 13, Halachah 1.</i> If [the owner of the ox received] permission to bring in his ox, the owner of the ox is not liable for any damage the ox caused.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachot 8-9, when an ox causes damage in a courtyard belonging jointly to its owner and another person, the owner of the ox is liable for the damage it causes. Why then, asks the Ra'avad, is the owner of the ox not liable in this situation? The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 398:5), however, quotes the Rambam's ruling.</i> If the owner of the courtyard accepted responsibility for the ox,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> As mentioned in the notes on Chapter 3, Halachot 13-15, the Tur differs with Rambam and maintains that granting the owner of the ox permission to bring his ox into the courtyard is equivalent to accepting responsibility for any damage to it caused by the owner or his property. With regard to damages caused by others, however, the owner of the courtyard is not liable unless he accepts responsibility. The Shulchan Aruch (loc. cit.) quotes the Rambam's wording, while the Ramah follows the perspective of the Tur.</i> he is liable for the damages it suffers from falling into the cistern.
[The following rules also apply when] a person brings his ox into a courtyard belonging to another person without his permission. If the [uninvited ox] injures the owner of the courtyard, the owner of the courtyard suffers injury [because of the ox], or [the ox] digs pits or trenches, or burrows in the courtyard, the owner of the ox is liable for the damage to the courtyard [or to the owner]. [If another person] is injured because of these pits,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> The Maggid Mishneh and Sefer Me'irat Einayim 398:2 state that the owner of the courtyard is generally not liable for the injury another person suffered because of these pits, since he can always claim: Who gave you permission to enter my property? Only when the owner gives up ownership of his property or gives others the right to enter is he liable.</i> the owner of the courtyard is liable, for it is his responsibility to fill them up.
[The following rules apply if] the owner of the courtyard damaged the ox: If he caused the damage unknowingly, he is not liable. For he can tell [the owner of the ox], "Why did you bring [your ox] in without permission. I was not aware of it until I [damaged it] unknowingly."<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> This phrase has attracted the attention of the commentaries, for it implies that if the owner of the courtyard knew that the animal had entered his property, he would be liable even when he caused the damage accidentally. From Hilchot Chovel UMazik 1:16, 6:3, however, it appears that he would not be liable in such an instance. See Migdal Oz, Lechem Mishneh.</i> If he caused the damage knowingly, he is liable for the full extent of the damage. He has the right to take the [intruding animal] out of his property; he does not have the right to damage it.
We evaluate the amount of damages caused. What is implied? If either a person or his ox broke a utensil belonging to a colleague, we do not tell the person who caused the damage, "Take the broken utensil and pay its worth to its owner."<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> Note the contrast to Hilchot Geneivah 1:15. See Sefer Me'irat Einayim 403:1.</i> Instead, we evaluate the loss caused to the utensil. This amount is paid by the person who caused the damage. [If the damage was caused by his ox, and the ox] was <i>mu'ad</i>, he is liable for the full amount of the damages. If it is <i>tam</i>, he is liable for half the damages.[This is implied by Exodus 21:36]: "And the carcass will be his" - i.e., it belongs to the one whose property was damaged. If the carcass loses value, the person whose property was damaged suffers the loss. If its value rises, the increase is divided between the person who caused the damage and the person whose property was damaged.
What is implied? When an ox that is worth 200 [<i>zuz</i>] is gored and dies - its carcass was worth 100 [<i>zuz</i>] at the time of its death,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur maintains that the time that is significant is not the time of the animal's death, but the time when its owner is notified regarding its death. Until that time, the one who caused the damage is responsible for the loss. The Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 403:2) mentions this view.</i> but at the time of the trial, it decreased in value and was worth only 80. [In such an instance,] the person whose [ox] caused the damage is required to pay only 100 [<i>zuz</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> And not 120.</i> if [the ox] was <i>mu'ad</i>. If it was a <i>tam</i>, the owner is required to pay only 50 [<i>zuz</i>] from the body of the ox.
If the value of the carcass increased, and it is worth 120 [<i>zuz</i>] at the time of the trial, the one who caused the damage must pay 90<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the 100 zuz that the owner of the ox lost, minus 10 zuz, which is the share of the profit given to the person who caused the damage.</i> if the ox was <i>mu'ad</i>, and 45 from the body of the ox if it was a <i>tam</i>. [This is implied by Exodus 21:35]: "And they shall also divide the dead [ox]" - i.e., they shall divide the profit from the dead ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 403:2) emphasize that although the person who caused the damage is given a share in the value of the dead ox, this applies only with regard to the loss. If the price of meat rises to the extent that the meat of the ox is worth more than the ox was worth when it was alive, the one who caused the damages is not given a share of the profits.</i>
[The amount that the person whose ox caused the damage must pay is subject to change in some, but not in all, circumstances. To illustrate:] An ox that was worth 200 [<i>zuz</i>] gored another ox worth 200 [<i>zuz</i>], causing it to depreciate 50 [<i>zuz</i>]. At the time of the trial, its value increased and it was worth 400 <i>zuz</i>. If, however, it had not been gored, it would have been worth 800 [<i>zuz</i>]. Whether its value increased because it was fattened or because of market fluctuations,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the price of cattle increased.</i> the damages are evaluated according to the loss at the time the damage took place.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., 50 zuz if the ox was mu'ad. With regard to the larger sum, the matter is considered one of grama, an indirect cause of damage. Therefore, the owner of the ox is not liable (Sefer Me'irat Einayim 404:2).</i> If the ox became weak because of the injury it received and the damages amounted to 100 <i>zuz</i> at the time of the trial, the damages are evaluated according to the loss at the time of the trial.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> Tosafot, Bava Kama 10b draws a distinction between this instance and Halachah 8, which states that the increased loss to the carcass is suffered by its owner. The rationale for this distinction is that once the ox died, its owner should have sold it immediately. In this instance, since the ox was still alive, its owner thought that it would recover and that the loss would be less.</i>
[The following rules apply if] the value of the ox that caused the damage increased at the time of the trial.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> This increase is significant, because the owner of the ox that was damaged can collect the payment (half of the damage) for the damages, only from the body of the ox that caused the damage. Thus, if the damage to an ox was 200 zuz, and the ox that caused the damage was worth only 80 zuz, the fact that its value increased to 100 zuz could affect the amount the owner of the damaged ox receives.</i> If its value increased because the owner fattened it, only its value at the time it caused the damage is considered to be on lien for payment.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., in the above instance, the payment would be only 80 zuz. The rationale is that the owner of the ox who caused the damage will say: Did I fatten my ox so that you will take the profit?The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 404:2) differ and maintain that if the increase in the value of the ox exceeds the cost of fattening it, the cost of fattening it is deducted from its value, and the person whose ox was damaged receives half of the difference.</i> If its value increased because of market fluctuations, half of the damages may be collected from its value at the time of the trial.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., in the above instance, the payment would be 100 zuz. The rationale is that since the body of the ox that caused the damage is on lien for the damages, and now that body is worth 100 zuz, the entire amount may be expropriated. Note the Or Sameach, who emphasizes that although the payment is taken from the body of the ox that caused the damages, the lien is not established until the time of the trial. Thus, if the owner of the ox that caused the damage consecrates it, it is consecrated, and the owner of the damaged ox receives no payment at all.</i>
It is the responsibility of the person who caused the damage to make the effort to bring the carcass of the ox that was damaged to the person [whose ox] was damaged. What is implied? An ox fell into a cistern and died. [The owner of the cistern] must raise the carcass [of the ox]<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur (Choshen Mishpat 403) writes that although the responsibility to raise the ox is that of the owner of the cistern, if the owner of the ox becomes aware that his ox fell into the cistern, he must raise it and then bill the owner of the cistern for his costs. Sefer Me'irat Einayim 403:8 quotes this ruling.</i> from the cistern and give it to its owner. Then we evaluate the extent of the loss.[This is derived from Exodus 21:34]: "He shall give monetary recompense to the owners, and the carcass will be [the owners']." This teaches that he is obligated to return the carcass and the decrease in the value of the ox [from the time]<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> It is as if the verse reads He shall give monetary recompense and the carcass to the owners (Bava Kama 10b).</i> when it was alive, to its owner. If [the ox that caused the damage was a <i>tam</i>], [its owner is required to pay only] half the damages, as explained above.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> Halachah 8.</i>

Chapter 8

When an ox belonging to an Israelite gores an ox that was consecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the owner of the ox consecrated it to serve as a burned offering or a sin offering, or (if it was blemished) to donate its value to the Temple, but he did not bring it to the Temple as yet.</i> or an ox that was consecrated gores an ox belonging to an Israelite, [the owner of the goring ox] is not liable, [as implied by Exodus 21:35]: "[If one person's ox injures] an ox belonging to a colleague...."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> One can infer that since the ox that is consecrated no longer belongs to a colleague, the laws that follow in the verse do not apply.</i> All consecrated entities for which one is held liable for using them for one's own purposes<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hilchot Me'ilah, which describes these laws.</i> are not bound by the laws of damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> For they are all considered to be consecrated unto God.</i> Animals that were consecrated and then disqualified<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim, which describes when a consecrated animal is placed into this category.

For they have been redeemed and can be considered ordinary.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> Although it is forbidden to work with, or shear these animals, they are still considered the private property of their owners and are thus an ox belonging to a colleague.</i>
When [an animal consecrated for] a peace offering causes damage, the damages may be collected from its meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> Since the meat of a peace offering is eaten by the owners, the animal is still considered to be their personal property, despite the fact that it is consecrated. Therefore, payment for the damages can be expropriated from the meat.See the commentary of the Lechem Mishneh, who questions the apparent contradiction between the Rambam's ruling here and his ruling in Hilchot Geneivah 2:1.</i> [The person whose property was damaged] does not, however, collect his due from the portions burned on the altar. For the prohibition against using consecrated property for one's own purposes applies to the portions of sacrifices of lesser sanctity<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Those that may be eaten outside the Temple Courtyard.</i> burned on the altar, as explained in <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Hilchot Me'ilah 2:1.</i> Similarly, [if an animal consecrated for] a thanksgiving offering causes damage, the damages may be collected from its meat. They may not, however, be collected from the bread that accompanies it,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> Forty loaves of bread are offered together with the thanksgiving offering. These are, however, considered to be a separate entity and are not on lien to the person whose property was damaged.</i> for the bread is not considered to be part of the meat.
How can [the person whose property was damaged] collect [his due]? He and his company should eat, in a holy manner, a portion of the meat equivalent to half the damages he suffered.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., as befits sacrifices of lesser sanctity.</i> What is meant by the statement that [the person whose property was damaged] does not, however, collect his due from the portions burned on the altar? That if half the damages he suffered was equivalent to a <i>dinar</i>, and the meat and the portions to be offered on the altar together were worth two<i> dinarim</i>, but the meat without the portions to be offered was worth only a<i> dinar</i> and a half, [the person whose property was damaged] receives only half the meat, and not two thirds of the meat.
Similarly, an ox that is ownerless and causes damage is also not held responsible for the damage it causes. [This is also derived from the phrase,] "an ox belonging to a colleague," implying that the ox must be defined as the property of an owner. What is implied? When an ox that is ownerless gores [another ox], and before the person whose property was damaged takes possession of [the goring ox] another person does so, that other person is not liable for the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., one might think that the person whose property was damaged might be entitled to expropriate the amount of the loss from the body of the ox. Nevertheless, since the ox was acquired by its present owner after the damage took place, he is not held responsible.</i>Moreover, even if an ox that is defined as the property of an owner causes damage, and afterwards the owner consecrates it or declares it ownerless, [payment is] not expropriated [from the body of the ox]. [For payment to be expropriated], it must be owned by one person at the time it caused the damage and at the time of the trial.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> Bava Kama 44b derives this concept from the exegesis of Exodus 21:29. If, however, the previous owner retakes possession of the ox, he is liable for the damages even though he declared it ownerless Tur and Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 406:3). With regard to the sale of the ox, see Halachah 6. (See also Halachah 8 and notes.)</i>
When an ox - whether a <i>tam</i> or a <i>mu'ad</i> - belonging to a Jew gores an ox belonging to a gentile, [the Jew] is not liable. [The rationale is] that the gentiles do not hold a person responsible for damage caused by his livestock.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad differs with the rationale stated by the Rambam, and objects because the gentiles seize animals in lieu of payment for the damage that they cause. The Ra'avad maintains that by speaking of a colleague's ox, the Torah excludes one belonging to a gentile. The Tur and the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 406:1) quote the Rambam's ruling.</i> Therefore we judge this case according to their laws.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hilchot Melachim 10:12, which states:The following rules apply when there is a dispute between a Jew and an idolater: If the Jew will fare better according to their laws, they are judged according to their laws.... If the Jew will fare better according to our laws, they are judged according to Torah law.... It appears to me that this approach is not followed with regard to a resident alien. He is always judged according to their laws.See also the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 4:3), which echoes and expands upon this principle.</i>  When, by contrast, an ox - whether a <i>tam</i> or a <i>mu'ad</i> - belonging to a gentile gores an ox belonging to a Jew, [the gentile] must pay the entire amount of the damages. This is a penalty imposed upon the gentiles because they are not careful about [the observance of] the mitzvot,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> It would appear that the intent of the word mitzvot, meaning commandments, is the seven universal laws commanded to Noach and his descendants. One of them is the law obligating societies to set up a system of civil law. See Bava Kama 38a.</i> and they do not remove factors that can cause damage. If we will not hold them liable for the damage caused by their animals, they will not guard them, and [the animals] will destroy other people's property.
When an ox that is <i>tam</i> causes damage and then is sold by its owner before the trial takes place, the person whose property was damaged may collect his due from it<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> For the damages that an ox that is tam causes are collected from its body. Thus, it is as if the ox is on lien for the damages it caused.</i> despite the fact that it was sold.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> This implies that the sale is not nullified. The purchaser may plow with the ox directly after the purchase. Moreover, he cannot return it to the original owner because of the claim against it.</i> Afterwards, the purchaser should collect that sum from the [previous] owner who sold it to him. [The rationale for this ruling is]<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., why the purchaser is at all responsible for the damage the ox caused previously.</i> that once an ox has gored, the matter becomes known, and the purchaser should not have purchased the animal until the one whose property was damaged had collected his due.
If [the owner of an ox that] caused damage consecrates [the ox], it is consecrated. [This law was instituted] so that people will not say, "An animal that was consecrated can lose its status without being redeemed."<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> Implied is that in essence the person whose property was damaged should be allowed to collect his due from the ox without redeeming it. Our Sages, however, did not allow this, because a person who knew that the ox was consecrated, but did not know that it had gored, might see it being given to the person whose property was damaged and think that an animal that was consecrated can lose its sacred status without being redeemed. Instead, they required that the person whose property was damaged redeem the ox for a minimal fee and then collect his due from it (Maggid Mishneh).The Chatam Sofer (Choshen Mishpat, Responsum 165) notes that there appears to be a contradiction between this halachah and Halachah 4. From Halachah 4, it appears that the person can consecrate the ox and thus totally nullify the lien of the person whose property was damaged. From this halachah, by contrast, it appears that the lien remains.In resolution, the Chatam Sofer makes a distinction between the sanctification of the value of the ox (as in this halachah), in which instance the lien remains, and the sanctification of the body of the ox (as in Halachah 4), in which instance the lien is nullified.</i> [If the owner] slaughters the ox, [the person whose property was damaged] may collect his due from the meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 407:2) state that if the slaughter causes the value of the ox to depreciate, the owner must reimburse the person whose property was damaged for the loss.</i> [If the owner] gives it away as a present, [the present] is binding,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> And therefore the recipient of the present may work with the animal.</i> but [the person whose property was damaged] may collect his due from [the animal].
If [an ox] caused damage, there was a trial, and afterwards, [the owner] sold it, the sale is of no consequence. If he consecrated it, it is not consecrated, and if he gave it away as a present, the present is of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> For the lien on the body of the ox possessed by the person whose property was damaged has now been firmly established. He thus becomes a partner in the ownership of the ox, and the original owner cannot carry out a sale without informing him.</i> If the creditors of the owner [of the ox] seize it first, [to collect their due from it], they are not entitled to retain possession. Instead, the person whose property was damaged collects his due from it. This applies whether the debt was undertaken before the damage was done<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., if the obligation were incumbent on the person whose ox caused the damage himself or on his property, those who had a prior claim would be entitled to take the ox as payment. In this instance, the obligation is associated with the body of the ox itself, and therefore the person whose property was damaged is entitled to the ox for the reason mentioned by the Rambam.</i> or afterwards. [The rationale is] that even if it belonged to the creditors at the outset and caused damage, [the person whose property was damaged] would be entitled to collect his due.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> The Rambam's ruling is quoted by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 407:4). The Tur and the Ramah differ and state that if the owner of the ox had already designated the ox as payment for a specific debt that existed before the damage took place, that creditor has a right to the ox.</i>
[The following rules apply when] an ox that is <i>mu'ad</i> causes damage: Regardless of whether the trial took place already or not, if [the owner] has consecrated it, sold it, given it as a present or slaughtered it, his deed is binding. If the creditors of the owner lead [the ox] away before [the person whose property was damaged takes possession of it], they acquire it. [This applies] whether the debt owed them was made before the damage took place or afterwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> According to Talmudic law, an earlier debt takes precedence over a later one with regard to landed property. With regard to movable property, by contrast, whichever creditor takes control of an asset first is entitled to it.</i> [The rationale is that] the person whose property was damaged is entitled to collect his due from the choicest property belonging to the owner. All of [the owner's] property is on lien because of the damage caused.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> This explains the fundamental difference between damage caused by a tam and a mu'ad. When a tam causes damage, its own body is on lien for the damage; the damage is not considered to be a debt owed by the owner of the ox. When, in contrast, a mu'ad causes damage, the opposite is true. The person whose property was damaged has no claim to the ox itself; his claim is borne by all the holdings of its owner.</i>
When the court is required to expropriate property belonging to the person who caused the damages for the person whose property was damaged,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> These laws, though applicable to damage caused by an ox that is mu'ad, apply to all other cases of damage for which a person is held responsible.</i> the movable property [of the person who caused the damages] should be expropriated first.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> Bava Kama 7b explains that movable property is considered to be easier to sell after it has been expropriated than landed property. Therefore, it is considered to be choicer and should be given priority.Sefer Me'irat Einayim 419:1 writes that the person who caused the damages has the prerogative of giving the person whose property he damaged movable property or landed property, whichever he desires. The Siftei Cohen 419:2 differs and states that according to the Rambam, the Beit Yosef and others, if the person who caused the damages possesses movable property, he must pay in movable property, regardless of whether or not he desires.</i> If he does not own any movable property, or the property he owns is not sufficient to pay for all the damages, the remainder should be expropriated from the choicest properties he owns. As long as movable property is found, even property of inferior quality,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> The Hebrew term used by the Rambam literally means bran. As long as the person pays for the damage with movable property, the quality of the movable property with which he pays is of no consequence. The Hagahot Maimoniot state that according to the Rambam and Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, even if the person who caused the damage possesses cash, he may pay the person whose property he damaged with movable property of inferior quality.Although there is debate concerning this concept among the commentaries, it is accepted as binding by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 419:1).</i> landed property should not be expropriated.
If the person who caused the damage dies before he pays, the court does not expropriate the movable property belonging to his heirs. Instead, [they expropriate] the landed property [in the estate], taking that of least value.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> During the lifetime of the person who caused the damage, the choicest property in his holdings is expropriated. After his death, however, the status of the obligation changes, and the property of least value is expropriated (Gittin 48b).This law applies regardless of the age of the heirs, even if they are past majority (Maggid Mishneh; Siftei Cohen 419:7). See, however, Sefer Me'irat Einayim 419:5.</i> [The rationale is that] the person whose property was damaged becomes one of the creditors [of the person who caused the damage], and movable property is never considered to be on lien to a creditor. If the person whose property was damaged [seized] possession of movable property [belonging to] the person who caused the damage in the latter's lifetime, payment for the damages may be collected from this [movable property] after his death.
The <i>Geonim</i> have already ordained that a debt owed a creditor can be expropriated from the movable property [in the estate].<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"> In his gloss on Hilchot Ishut 16:7, the Maggid Mishneh explains that this ruling reflects a difference in the socio-economic status of the Jewish people. Land was commonly owned in the Talmudic period. In contrast, the ownership of land was less common in the era of the geonim. Movable property thus rose in importance, and a creditor would feel secure even when an obligation was supported only by movable property.</i> This ruling has been accepted by all the [Jewish] courts of law.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> Thus, although it is post-Talmudic in origin, it should be adhered to because of its universal acceptance. See, however, Hilchot Ishut 16:8.</i> Therefore, damages may also be expropriated from movable property left to heirs. If [the deceased] did not leave any movable property, [the creditor] may expropriate the landed property of least value. For as explained [in the previous halachah], whenever a person seeks to expropriate property from heirs, he is given the property of the least value.
Damages should not be collected, nor is an atonement fine imposed, nor is an animal executed<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"> When an ox that is mu'ad kills a human being, the ox should be executed, and its owner is obligated to pay an atonement fine, as explained in Chapter 10. The Ra'avad explains that if a person admits that either he or his property caused damage, he is obligated for financial payment and for an atonement fine. His ox is not, however, executed because of his statements.</i> unless definite proof is brought [as substantiated] by acceptable witnesses. We do not say that since only shepherds,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"> Who are disqualified from serving as witnesses, because they are suspected of pasturing their flocks in fields belonging to other people, for this is equivalent to stealing (Hilchot Edut 10:4).</i> servants,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"> Who are not acceptable witnesses (Hilchot Edut 9:2,4,7).</i> and the like are found in the stables of horses, the stalls of cattle and the corrals of sheep, their testimony should be accepted if they testify that one animal damaged another. Similarly, if minors or women<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"> Who are not acceptable witnesses (Hilchot Edut 9:2,4,7).</i> testify that one person injured another or caused another type of damage, [one might think] that we rely on them. This is not so.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 35:14) writes that although this is the legal standard, it has already become customary to accept witnesses whose testimony would ordinarily be disqualified, if there is no way of finding witnesses who are acceptable. Note, however, Sefer Me'irat Einayim 35:30, which states that the Ramah's leniency does not apply with regard to damages.</i> Instead, financial redress is required because of the testimony of witnesses only when the witnesses are acceptable and fit to testify with regard to other matters, and they give testimony, [on which basis] the court obligates the one who caused the damage to pay.
When an ox was pasturing at the edge of a river, and another ox is found dead near him, even though the dead ox was gored, and this ox was prone to gore - or the dead ox was bitten and this ox was prone to bite - we do not say: "One can be certain that this bit it, or this gored it." Even if one of a group of camels is known to bite, and another camel is found dead at its side, we do not say that it is certain that this one killed it, unless the matter was observed by acceptable witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"> In this as in many other instances, the Rambam emphasizes that circumstantial evidence - no matter how indisputable - is not sufficient. According to Torah law, a claim can be established only through the testimony of witnesses. (See also Hilchot Chovel UMazik 5:4; Hilchot Sanhedrin 20:1, 24:1.)</i>

Chapter 9

When an animal that is pregnant causes damage, the sum of half the damages may be expropriated from the mother and its offspring,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., if the body of the animal that caused the damage is not worth half the damage it caused, the remainder may be collected from its offspring. Even if for some reason the cow is not found, the entire sum may be collected from the calf Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 399:1).</i> for the offspring are considered to be part of its body. When, by contrast, a chicken causes damage, the amount due may not be collected from its eggs. [The rationale is that a chicken's] eggs are not considered to be part of its body, but rather separate and distinct from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> It would appear that according to the Rambam, this applies even before the eggs are laid. Even while within the chicken, they are not considered part of its body. The Maggid Mishneh offers a different explanation, stating that while the eggs are within the chicken, they are considered to be part of its body (Ramah, Choshen Mishpat 399:1).</i>
When a cow that is pregnant gored [another cow], and the calf [of the goring cow] is found at its side, but it is not known whether it had given birth before it gored or not, the sum of half the damages may be collected from the cow [alone]. Nothing may be collected from the calf, unless [the plaintiff can bring proof that it was pregnant when it gored. [The rationale is that] when a person desires to expropriate money from a colleague, the burden of proof is upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> This is a fundamental principle, applicable in many contexts of Jewish business law.</i>
[Similarly,] if a bull gores a pregnant cow and we find its calf stillborn at her side, and we do not know if it gave birth to the stillborn calf before it was gored,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> And thus the owner of the bull has no responsibility for the death of the calf.</i> or it gave birth to the stillborn calf because it was gored, [the owner of the bull] is required to pay for [only] the damage to the cow and not the damage to the calf. For when a person desires to expropriate money from a colleague, the burden of proof is upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> Even when the owner of the ox does not know whether or not his ox caused the damage, as long as the owner of the cow cannot support his claim with witnesses, the owner of the ox is not liable Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 399:3).</i>
When [an ox] gores a pregnant cow and causes it to miscarry, we do not evaluate the damage to the cow separately and the damage to the calf separately,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the difference in value between a living calf and a dead one.</i> [and obligate the owner of the ox for the total]. Instead, we evaluate the worth of the cow when it was pregnant and healthy<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> Implied is that when a cow is pregnant it adds weight, which increases its value.</i> and compare it to its present worth and that of the body of the fetus. The owner of the ox must pay the difference<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Obviously, a lesser amount.</i> [if it was <i>mu'ad</i>] or half the difference if it was <i>tam</i>.
If the cow was owned by one person and the calf by another,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the owner had sold the rights to the calf to another person before it was born.</i> the loss in the fat of the cow [caused by the miscarriage] is owed to the owner of the cow; the loss of the cow's bulk<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> Which appears larger and is therefore worth more Tur and Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 399:5).</i> is divided between the owner of the cow and the owner of the calf. The carcass of the calf belongs to the owner of the calf.
[The following rules apply when] one ox was pursuing another ox, and one was damaged. [If the owner of the ox] that was damaged said: "It was your ox that caused the damage," and [the owner of the other ox] said, "I do not know, perhaps it was damaged by a rock,"<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> Even when it ran into the rock because it was pursued, the other ox is considered to be merely an indirect cause of damage (grama), and the owner is not liable (Sefer Me'irat Einayim 400:1).</i> the burden of proof is upon the one who wishes to exact payment. [This ruling applies] even though the one whose property was damaged states: "I am certain [that your ox caused the damages], and the other person says: "I do not know." If the person whose property was damaged claims: "You certainly know that your ox caused the damage,"<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> And are withholding payment only because you know that I cannot produce witnesses.</i> if [his ox] was<i> mu'ad</i>, [the other person] is required to take a Rabbinic oath that he does not know [that his ox caused the damage]. If, however, [his ox] was <i>tam</i>, he is not required to take a Rabbinic oath. [The rationale is that] even if he admitted [that his ox had caused the damage], he would not be liable. For the liability for half the damages is a fine,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 2, Halachah 7.</i> and a person who admits culpability for a fine [when there are no witnesses to obligate him] is not liable.
[A person whose ox was damaged has no legal redress in the following instance.] Two [oxen belonging to two separate owners] were pursuing a third ox. Witnesses saw that one of the oxen caused the third ox damage, but were not able to identify which ox caused the damage. [Since] one of the owners claims, "Your ox caused the damage," and the other claims, "Your ox caused the damage," neither is liable. If both oxen belong to the same person, he is liable to pay from the body of the less valuable [ox, if that ox is <i>tam</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> One of this man's oxen caused the damage, and the damage must be paid for from the body of the ox itself. If the damage was worth more than the value of the lesser ox, the owner of the damaged ox can collect only the value of the lesser ox. The rationale is that there is no proof that the damage was caused by the more valuable ox.</i> If both oxen are <i>mu'adim</i>, he must pay the full amount of the damage from his property.
When does the above apply? When both oxen are present before us. If, however, one of the oxen died or was lost, and it was<i> tam</i>, [their owner] is not liable even though they both belong to him. For he can tell the person whose property was damaged: "Prove to me that it was the ox that is here that caused the damage, and I will pay you."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> Payment for damage caused by an ox that is tam must be expropriated from the body of the ox. If that ox is not present, the damage cannot be collected.</i>
[Similar principles apply in a case where an ox was damaged by one of two oxen belonging to the same owner.] One of the two oxen that pursued [the damaged ox] was large and one was small. If the person whose ox was damaged claims that it was the larger one that caused the damage,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> This is significant when the extent of the damages exceeds the value of the smaller ox.</i> and the person whose oxen caused the damage claims that the smaller one caused the damage, [the burden of proof is upon the one who wishes to exact payment].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> If there are no witnesses present at all (in contrast to the instance described in the following halachah), in both this and the second clause of this halachah the person whose ox caused the damage is not liable at all. For the obligation that he admits (that the smaller ox or the tam) caused the damage, is not the obligation claimed by the person whose ox was damaged (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, Bava Kama 3:11). (See also Halachah 11 and notes.)</i> [Similarly,] if one of the oxen was <i>tam</i> and the other<i> mu'ad</i>, and the person whose ox was damaged claims that it was the<i> mu'ad</i> that caused the damage,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> This is significant because it determines whether the person receives half the amount of the damages or the full amount.</i> and the person whose oxen caused the damage claims that the <i>tam</i> caused the damage, the burden of proof is upon the one who wishes to exact payment.
If there was no clear proof which of the oxen caused the damage, but witnesses testify that one of the two oxen [owned by this person] caused the damage, the person whose oxen caused the damage must pay the amount he admits.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> In this instance, as opposed to an instance where there are no witnesses at all, the owner is obligated to pay the debt he admits, because of the testimony of the witnesses (Maggid Mishneh).The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 400:3) quotes the Rambam's decision. The Tur and the Ramah, however, differ and maintain that if the person whose ox causes the damage makes a definitive claim saying that the other ox caused the damage, he is not liable at all.</i> If the person whose property was damaged claimed, "You know that the damage was caused by the other ox in your presence,"<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., if the owner of the goring ox indeed did not know which ox caused the damage, he could not be held liable for the greater amount. The person whose ox was damaged is, however, maintaining that the owner in fact does know and is concealing the matter so as not to be held liable.</i> the person whose ox caused the damage must take an oath mandated by Scriptural law.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> As the Rambam explains, whenever a person admits a portion of a claim lodged against him, he is obligated to support his claim with an oath. He is referred to as a modeh b'miktzat (Hilchot To'en V'Nit'an 1:1).The Ra'avad maintains that an oath is required only in a case when one ox is tam and one ox is mu'ad, for the claim against the tam can be considered to be part of the claim against the mu'ad. When, however, both oxen are tam, the two claims are considered to be unrelated and no oath is required. Rabbenu Asher goes further and considers the claims to be unrelated in both instances. See Siftei Cohen 400:5, which discusses this issue.</i> He then pays the amount he admitted. [The oath is required] because he admitted a portion [of the claim levied against him].
[The following rules apply when] two oxen were damaged, one large and one small, and there were two oxen that caused the damage, one large and one small. The person whose oxen were damaged claims: the large ox damaged the large ox, and the small ox damaged the small ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> This difference is significant if the oxen that caused the damage are tamim, for then the payment is expropriated from the body of the ox, and it is possible that the value of the small ox that caused the damage will be less than that of the large ox that was damaged.</i> The person whose oxen caused the damage, by contrast claims: "No. It was the small ox that damaged the large one, and the large ox that damaged the small one." [A similar dispute arises if] one [of the oxen that caused the damage] was <i>mu'ad</i> and the other <i>tam</i>. The person whose oxen were damaged claims: the ox that was <i>mu'ad</i> damaged the large ox, and the ox that was <i>tam</i> damaged the small ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> This difference is significant, because when an ox is mu'ad, its owner is responsible for the entire amount of the damages, while when it is tam, only half the damages are required. Needless to say, the full value of the large ox is far more than the full value of the small ox.</i> By contrast, the person whose oxen caused the damage claims: "It was the ox that was <i>tam</i> that damaged the large one, and the ox that was <i>mu'ad</i> that damaged the small one." [In both these instances,] the burden of proof is upon the one who wishes to exact payment. If there is no proof,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> If, however, witnesses observed that the oxen belonging to the same owner caused the damage, but were not able to identify which one caused the damage, the owner is obligated to pay the amount he admits, as in the previous halachah (Maggid Mishneh).</i> the one who caused the damage is not liable [at all]. To what can this be compared? To an instance where a person claims that a colleague owes him wheat, and the colleague admits to owing him barley. In such a case, [the defendant] is required to take a Rabbinic oath and then is not liable, even for the barley, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot To'en</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> Chapter 3, Halachah 10. The rationale is that with regard to the instance when one ox is mu'ad, the defendant does not accept any liability with regard to the claim that the plaintiff makes, and the plaintiff has not made a claim regarding the sum the defendant admits liability for; therefore, the defendant is not held liable.With regard to the instance where both of the oxen are tamim, the defendant is not liable, because payment of half the damages is considered a fine, and a person who admits culpability for a fine is not liable (Maggid Mishneh).</i>If the person whose oxen were damaged seizes possession [of property belonging to the person whose oxen caused the damage], he may take payment for the damages to the small ox from the body of the large ox and may take payment for the damages to the large ox from the body of the small ox, as the person who caused the damages admitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> Even the Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 400:3), who view this situation more stringently than the Rambam, accept this principle. Moreover, according to their logic (see Choshen Mishpat 399:3), if there are no witnesses that the plaintiff seized possession of the property of the defendant, the plaintiff may keep an amount equal to his own claim.The above applies only when the plaintiff seizes possession of the defendant's property before taking the matter to court. If, however, he took the matter to court, and the court ruled in favor of the defendant, as the Rambam states, and then the plaintiff seizes the defendant's property, he must return it.</i> If he did not seize possession [of such property], however, no money at all is expropriated from the person whose oxen caused the damage.
When one ox gores [another ox] and then gores a third ox, the owner of the first ox that was gored and the owner [of the goring ox] are considered to be partners.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> Since the owner of the gored ox is granted a share in the body of the ox that gores, he is also given a share in the responsibility for its damages.</i> What is implied? When an ox that is worth 200 [<i>zuz</i>] gores another ox that is worth 200 [<i>zuz</i>] and the carcass is not worth anything, the owner of the damaged ox is entitled to 100 [<i>zuz</i> from the ox that gored] and its owner 100 [<i>zuz</i>]. If that ox gores another ox that is worth 200 [<i>zuz</i>] and its carcass is of no value, the owner of the latter ox is entitled to 100 [<i>zuz</i>] and the owner of the first ox and the original owner of the ox are each entitled to 50 [<i>zuz</i>]. If that ox gores another ox that is worth 200 [<i>zuz</i>] and its carcass is of no value, the owner of the latter ox is entitled to 100 [<i>zuz</i>], the owner of the second ox that was gored is entitled to 50 [<i>zuz</i>], and the owner of the first ox and the original owner of the ox are each entitled to 25 [<i>zuz</i>]. This pattern is followed in the future [if the ox continues to gore].<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> See Sefer Me'irat Einayim 401:1, which notes that generally after goring three times, an ox becomes considered mu'ad, and from that time onward, full damages for the damage caused by the ox must be paid. This complicates the matter.</i>
When a person whose [ox] was damaged seizes the animal that caused the damage in order to collect half the damages from its body, he is considered to be a paid watchman with regard to any damages it causes. Therefore, if it causes damages, the person whose ox was first damaged is liable, and its owner is not liable. What is implied? An ox that is worth 200 [<i>zuz</i>] gored [another ox], causing damages of 200 [<i>zuz</i>]. The person whose ox was damaged seized [the goring ox] in order to collect the 100 [<i>zuz</i>] that is due him,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., half the damages, as required when a tam gores.</i> Afterwards, [the ox that caused the damage] gored [another ox], causing damages of 140 [<i>zuz</i>]. The person whose property was damaged last receives 70 [<i>zuz</i>], the person who took possession of the ox because it damaged his property receives the remainder of the damage done to his ox - 30 <i>zuz</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., since he was responsible for the ox at the time it caused the damages, he bears the entire financial responsibility.</i> - and the original owner, 100 <i>zuz</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> The Rambam's view is also shared by Rashi (Bava Kama 36b) and Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, and is quoted by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 401:2).

If it gores a servant... or a maid-servant... the ox should be stoned.</i> whether the ox is <i>tam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> Exodus 21:28 states that this penalty should be given to an ox that is tam, and the following verse speaks about a mu'ad.</i> or<i> mu'ad</i>, [the ox] must be stoned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">  See The Guide for the Perplexed, Volume III, Chapter 40, which states that this sentence is not considered punishment to the animal that killed the person, but rather punishment for its owner, so that he will know to restrain his animals. Some of the laws of this chapter (e.g., Halachot 6 and 8) indicate, however, that the intent is to kill an animal that is prone to kill.</i>If an ox kills a gentile, it is not executed, for this is their law.
[Not only] an ox, but any other animal, beast or fowl that kills a human should be stoned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The verse mentions an ox because it speaks about situations that are most probable.</i> What is the difference then between an <i>ox</i> that is <i>tam</i> killing a person, and that act being performed by an <i>ox</i> that is <i>mu'ad</i>? [The owner of] an ox that is <i>tam</i> is not liable for the atonement fine, while [the owner of] an ox that is <i>mu'ad </i>is liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> Exodus 21:28, which speaks about an ox that is tam, states: the owner will not be punished. The following verses, which speak about a mu'ad, state that the owner will pay an atonement fine. The nature of that fine is discussed in the following chapter.</i> when his ox is <i>mu'ad</i> to kill.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., that the owner was warned three times that his ox killed (or came close to killing) an animal or a man, as mentioned in the following halachah.</i>
Since every animal, beast or fowl that kills a human being should be stoned to death, how is it possible to find an animal that is <i>mu'ad</i> to kill, so that its owner will be liable to pay an atonement fine?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the animal should seemingly have been executed after he killed one human being. How was it possible for him to kill three?</i> It killed three gentiles,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> In which case it is not obligated to be executed, as stated in Halachah 1.</i> and then it killed a Jew. For an ox that is <i>mu'ad</i> [to kill] a gentile, is also <i>mu'ad</i> for a Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> The Maggid Mishneh questions the Rambam's ruling, noting that although Bava Kama 41a, the source for this halachah, mentions this resolution (and the following one), according to the commonly accepted version of the Talmud, it appears that these hypotheses are rejected. The Maggid Mishneh explains that most likely the Rambam possessed a different version of this Talmudic passage.</i> Alternatively, it killed three Jews who were classified as <i>t'refot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> The word t'refah refers to an infirmity that will cause the person (or animal) possessing it to die within a year. Since the person will die anyway, the ox is not executed for killing him (Bava Kama, loc. cit.).</i> and then killed a healthy person. [Other possible situations are the following:] [On three occasions,] it killed a person and then fled, and it was captured on the fourth occasion. [We must say that it was captured, because] the owners are not obligated to pay an atonement fine unless the ox is executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> There are exceptions to this principle, as reflected in Halachot 9 and 10.</i> It mortally wounded three individuals at the same time [and they and the fourth person the ox gored all died at the time]. It killed three animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> In Chapter 6, Halachah 8, the Rambam states that an ox that is mu'ad with regard to a human is not mu'ad with regard to an animal. From that, we can derive that an animal that is mu'ad with regard to an animal is not mu'ad with regard to a human.This does not necessarily represent a contradiction to this halachah. For there, the Rambam is speaking about causing damage, and here we are speaking about causing death (Kessef Mishneh).</i> In all these instances, it is deemed as<i> mu'ad </i>to kill, and the owner is liable to pay an atonement fine. There is also another instance. On three occasions [one of the oxen belonging to a person killed a human]; on each of these occasions, the witnesses recognized the owner, but did not recognize the ox. On the fourth occasion, they saw an ox that killed a person [and were able to recognize it afterwards]. They did not, however, know if this was the same ox that had killed [people] on the three previous occasions or not.[In this instance, the owner of the ox is liable to pay an atonement fine. The rationale is that] since the owner was warned that he had an ox in his herd that had killed [people] on three occasions, he should have guarded all his oxen [more carefully]. Since he did not, he must pay the atonement fine.
The Oral Tradition interprets the Torah's statement [Exodus 21:29]: "And its owner shall also be put to death," as implying death by the hand of God [and not execution by a mortal court]. If [the owner] pays an atonement fine for the person killed, he is pardoned. Although the obligation of the atonement fine is for [the owner's spiritual] pardon,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> And it is not a monetary obligation imposed by civil law.</i> the property of a person who is obligated to pay an atonement fine is forcefully expropriated, [even] against his will.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> With regard to a sin offering or a guilt offering that also comes for the purpose of atonement, we do not find an obligation to expropriate the sacrifice from the person's property. Nevertheless, it is possible to explain that since the atonement fine is paid to a colleague, and not offered in the Temple, people might view its obligation more laxly. See Lechem Mishneh.</i>
When an ox belonging to two partners kills [a man], each of [the partners] must pay an entire atonement fine. For each requires a full measure of atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> This is a reflection of the concept that this fine is not recompense for the person's death, but rather a means for the person who caused his death to attain atonement.</i>
If an ox is owned by a person, the adjudication of the ox must be concluded in its owner's presence. If the ox does not have an owner - e.g., a wild ox, an ox that was consecrated, an ox belonging to a convert who died without leaving any heirs - it should be executed [if it kills a human], and its judgment is concluded despite the fact that it lacks an owner. Similarly, an ox belonging to a woman, a minor,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> For whom a guardian was not appointed.</i> or a guardian<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> The intent is an ox belonging to a minor, deaf mute or mentally incompetent person that was entrusted to a guardian for safekeeping.</i> is stoned [if it kills a human]. The guardians are not required to pay the atonement fine,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> In contrast to the damages an ox in their care causes, for which they are required to reimburse the party whose property was damaged, as stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 4.</i> for that fine is [as implied by its name] for the purpose of atonement. Minors, deaf mutes and mental incompetents are not men of responsibility who require atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> All of these individuals are considered to be mentally incompetent and are not held responsible for any aspect of their conduct.</i>
When an ox that is a <i>t'refah</i> or an ox belonging to a person who is <i>t'refah</i> kills a human, the ox is not executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad writes that if an ox kills a person in the presence of a court, it is executed. The leniency applies only when it kills in the presence of witnesses.The Ra'avad's statement is based on a comparison to a human being. When a human being who is t'refah kills another human in the presence of witnesses, he cannot be executed, because there is no way that the witnesses can be disqualified through the laws of hazamah. When, however, he kills in the presence of a court, there is no need for the testimony of witnesses, and the court is charged to obliterate the evil from your midst. (See Hilchot Rotzeach 2:9.)The Maggid Mishneh does not accept this equation, because he maintains that the obligation to obliterate evil applies with regard to a man who performs an evil act and not to an ox.</i> [This is derived from Exodus 21:29:] "And its owner shall also be put to death." [This is interpreted to mean] that a parallel is established between the owner and the ox being put to death. Since the owner is [already] considered as if he is dead and need not be put to death [by God], so too, the ox is not held liable.
When a person sets a dog upon a colleague, and [the dog] kills him, the dog is not stoned to death. The same law applies if he sets another animal or beast upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> The rationale is that the animal is not considered to have killed as a result of its own tendency, but in response to prompting by the other person.</i> If, however, he sets a snake upon him, even if he actually places the snake's mouth on the other person, the snake is stoned to death. [The rationale is that] the snake releases the lethal venom on its own volition. For this reason, the person who sets the snake upon a colleague is not liable to be executed by [an earthly] court.
An animal that kills [a person] is not stoned to death unless it had the intent to kill a person for whom it would be executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> If, however, it intended to kill one Israelite, and instead it killed another, it is executed (Maggid Mishneh). There is a debate among our Sages (Bava Kama 44b) regarding both a human and an ox who kills with such an intent. With regard to a human, the Rambam rules that the killer is not liable for execution (see Hilchot Rotzeach, ch. 4), while with regard to an ox, he rules that it should be executed. See the Ra'avad and the Kessef Mishneh to Hilchot Rotzeach.</i> If, however, an ox intended to kill an animal and instead killed a human being, it intended to kill a gentile and instead killed a Jew, or it intended to gore a stillborn child and instead killed an ordinary child, [the ox] is not executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> Our Sages (ibid.) derive this law from the parallel established between the owner and the ox being put to death mentioned in Halachah 6. Since a human being would not be executed for killing in such a manner, the animal is also not executed.</i> If [the ox] was<i> mu'ad</i>, the owners are liable to pay the atonement fine or the fine paid for killing a servant. [This applies] even [if the ox] killed unintentionally. [The owners are held responsible] because [the ox] is <i>mu'ad</i> [to kill].
[The owner of an ox is liable to pay an atonement fine in the following instances. An ox] was <i>mu'ad</i> to leap on people in pits. It saw a vegetable in a pit, leapt into the pit, [and fell] on a person there and killed him. It was <i>mu'ad</i> to rub itself against walls and knock them over onto people, and it rubbed itself against a wall for its own benefit, and caused the wall to fall on a person and kill him. [In both these instances,] the ox is not liable to be executed, because it did not intend to kill. The owners are, nevertheless, liable for the atonement fine, because the ox is<i> mu'ad</i> to leap into pits on people or to knock walls over onto them.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> And the owners should therefore have watched it to prevent this from happening.</i> How can we know whether any animal is rubbing itself against a wall for its own benefit? If it continues rubbing itself after it knocks the wall down and kills.
The owners are not liable to pay the atonement fine unless their animal kills [the person] outside their property. If, however, [their animal] kills [a person] in a domain belonging to [the owner of the animal], the owner is not liable for the atonement fine,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 1, Halachah 7.</i> although the animal is stoned to death. What is implied? If a person enters a courtyard belonging to a person without his permission<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> If the owner grants his consent, he is liable for the atonement fine if his ox kills the visitor.</i> - even if he enters to demand payment for wages or a debt [owed to him]<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> The Maggid Mishneh and others note that Bava Kama 33a appears to present a difficulty to the Rambam's ruling. Several resolutions are, however, offered.</i> - and an ox belonging to the owner of the courtyard gores him and kills him, the ox should be stoned to death. The owner is, however, free from the atonement fine, because [the deceased] did not have permission to enter his property without his consent.
[The owner is not required to pay an atonement fine in the following situation. A person] stood at the entrance and called to the owner, and the latter said: "Yes." [The guest] entered and he was gored by an ox belonging to the owner. The owner is not liable. For "yes" does [not necessarily] mean [more than] "Stand where you are, until I [come] to speak to you."
When an animal enters a courtyard belonging to another person and kills a child by treading on it as it proceeds, the owner [of the animal] must pay an atonement fine. [The rationale is that an animal is considered to be] <i>mu'ad</i> to tread on things as it proceeds, and in the domain of another person [the owner of animal] is liable for the damages it causes by eating or treading, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> Chapter 1, Halachot 5,7.</i> Thus, one can conclude: When an animal that is <i>mu'ad</i> kills intentionally, it should be stoned to death, and the owners must pay the atonement fine. If it killed unintentionally, it is not liable to be executed, but the owners must pay the atonement fine. When [an animal that is] <i>tam</i> kills unintentionally, it is not liable to be executed, nor must the owners pay the atonement fine. If it intended to kill, it should be stoned to death. The owners, however, are not liable for the atonement fine or for the fine paid for killing a servant.
It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> This expression indicates a conclusion drawn by the Rambam that has no explicit source in the works of our Sages.</i> that even though [the owner of an ox that is] <i>tam</i> that killed a servant or a maid-servant intentionally is not liable for the fine of 30 <i>selaim</i> mentioned in the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"> Exodus 21:32.</i> if it killed [a servant or maid-servant] unintentionally,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> If it killed the servant intentionally, the law requires that the ox be stoned to death, and no benefit to be derived from it. Thus it is impossible to exact payment from its carcass. When, however, it kills unintentionally, it is not stoned and remains the property of its owner.</i> [the owner] must pay half the value of the servant or the maid-servant from the body of the ox, as if [the ox] had killed another ox or donkey belonging to his colleague.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"> The Rambam's rationale can be described as follows: If an ox kills a Jewish male or female, the owner is not obligated to pay damages, because the case is considered to involve capital matters. A servant, by contrast, is considered to be his owner's property, and therefore, just as the owner of an ox that is tam must pay half the cost of any damages caused by his ox, so too, he is liable for half of these damages.</i>

Chapter 11

How much is the atonement fine? The amount the judges evaluate as being the worth of the person who was killed; everything depends on his worth, as [implied by Exodus 21:30]: "And he shall give the ransom of his<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The antecedent of the pronoun his is a matter of debate among our Sages (Bava Kama 40a), who debated whether it refers to the soul of the owner or that of the person who was killed. According to the Rambam, there are dimensions of both opinions that are relevant. As evident from the previous chapter, by paying the atonement fine the owner of the ox is ransoming his own soul. On the other hand, as the Rambam states in this halachah and in Chapter 10, Halachah 4, the atonement fine is for the person killed, and the amount is determined according to the worth of the person who was killed.</i> soul according to all that will be imposed upon him." The atonement fine for a servant, whether an adult or a minor, whether a male or a female, is the amount determined by the Torah: 30 <i>selaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See Exodus 21:32. A sela is equivalent to four dinarim (zuzim).</i> of fine<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., pure silver.</i> silver. [This applies] whether the servant was worth 100 <i>maneh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> 10,000 zuz.</i> or only one <i>dinar</i>.If a servant is lacking only a bill of release,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> E.g., a servant who has been declared ownerless by his master, or one whom his master caused to lose one of the limbs that require his release.</i> a fine is not imposed, for he does not have a master, for he has already attained his freedom.
To whom is the atonement fine paid? To the heirs of the deceased. If a woman is killed, the atonement fine is paid to her heirs [as though she had not married], and not to her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> A woman's property is inherited by her husband. He, however, is entitled only to the property that she possesses at the time of her death, but not property that will accrue to her afterwards. For this reason, he is not entitled to the atonement fine. Needless to say, if the woman has already borne children, the atonement fine is given to them.</i> If a person who is half a servant, and half a freed man<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> E.g., a servant was owned by two partners, and one of them freed him while the other did not.Note the gloss of the Maggid Mishneh, who states that this law applies only to a maid-servant, but not to a male servant. The Radbaz (Volume VI, Responsum 2249), however, justifies the Rambam's view.</i> is killed, half of the fine should be given to the owner, and the other half is fit to be given, but there is no one to take it.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> For the half-servant is dead, and he or she has no heirs. Even if he or she bore children as a servant, they are not considered as the half-servant's sons or daughters.</i>
When an ox gores a pregnant woman and causes her to miscarry, its owners are not liable for the value of the fetus. [This law applies] even when the ox is <i>mu'ad</i> to gore. For the obligation [stated in] the Torah to pay for the value of the fetus applies only when it is a human who causes the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Exodus 21:22 speaks about men fighting together, and one of them causing a woman to miscarry.</i>
If, however, an ox [that is <i>mu'ad</i>] gores a maid-servant and causes her to miscarry, [the owner] is required to pay for the value of the fetus. For this is equivalent to having gored a pregnant donkey.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> As mentioned at the conclusion of the previous chapter, servants are considered in certain contexts to be no more than their master's chattel.</i> If the ox is <i>tam</i>, [the owner] must pay half the value of the fetus from the body of the ox.
How is this sum evaluated? We assess the value of this maid-servant when she was pregnant, and how much she is worth now.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> Our Sages note that there are two elements lost with the miscarriage: a) the fetus, which would otherwise become the owner's property, and b) the fact that while pregnant, a woman looks larger and healthier (Bava Kama 49a).</i> [The owner of the ox] must pay [the owner of the maid-servant] the difference or half the difference.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., if the ox was mu'ad, the owner must pay the entire difference. If it is tam, he must pay half the difference.</i> If [the ox] kills the maid-servant, [despite the fact that she is pregnant, its owner] need pay only the fine determined by the Torah, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> See Halachah 3. No extra renumeration is made in consideration of the miscarriage.</i>
When an ox intended to gore an animal and instead gored a man, [the owner is not liable], even if the man dies, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> Chapter 10, Halachah 9.</i> Nevertheless, if [the ox] injures him, [the owner of the ox] is liable for the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> Our Sages explain that one might think that although the owner is liable if his ox damages another ox in this manner, he would not be liable for injuring a man. The rationale is that an animal does not have a spiritual source protecting it, while a person does. If injury occurs despite that spiritual protection, one might think that it is willed by God, and therefore the owner of the ox is not liable. (See Bava Kama 2b).</i> If the ox is <i>tam</i>, he should pay half the damages from the body of the ox. If it is <i>mu'ad</i>, he must pay the entire amount of the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 7, Halachah 3.</i>
When an ox that is <i>tam</i> kills [a man] and then causes damage,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> To a man or to another animal.</i> it is sentenced to execution, but there is no financial claim on its owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> For the payment for the damages caused by an ox that is tam must come from the body of the ox itself. In this instance, since the ox must be stoned to death, we are forbidden to benefit from its carcass. Thus, there is no source from which this obligation can be met.</i> If an ox that is <i>mu'ad</i> kills and then causes damage, the liability [resulting from the damages] is determined,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> They must pay from resources other than the body of the ox.</i> and then it is sentenced to execution. If it is sentenced to execution first, the liability [resulting from the damages] is determined afterwards.
How is this money collected? From the profit that will accrue from the labor of the ox after it has been sentenced.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the ox is hired out by the court to work for different people. When enough money accrues to pay for the damages, it is executed.</i> [This step is taken] because once it is sentenced to be stoned to death, it no longer has owners who are considered liable for the damages it caused.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> The Maggid Mishneh explains the Rambam's position as follows. It is clear to the Rambam that once an animal is sentenced to be executed, it is no longer considered the property of its owner, and the owner is not considered responsible for the damages, even if the damages took place before the death sentence was delivered. (It appears that the Rambam considers that the obligation for the damages takes place only after the matter is taken to court.) For this reason, the Rambam maintains that the ox itself should be made to work for the damages.For this reason, the ox will not be executed immediately after being sentenced. Although it is not proper to delay the execution of a human, there is no such principle with regard to the execution of an ox. There are other authorities who differ with several elements of the Maggid Mishneh's interpretation.</i> If [in the above situation] it was sentenced to death and then it<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the ox. Rashi interprets Bava Kama 91a, the source of this halachah, as referring to the flight of the owner of the ox.</i> fled, no liability [resulting from the damages] is assigned.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> For the ox is not present to be hired out to work.</i>
When an ox killed a human, and afterwards its owner consecrates it, it is not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> Once an ox has been sentenced to death, it is no longer considered to be the property of its former owner.</i> Similarly, if he declares it ownerless, it is not ownerless. If he sells it, the sale is not effective. If a watchman returns it to its owner, it is not considered to have been returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> And the watchman must reimburse the owner for his ox, for he is responsible for it.</i> If it is slaughtered, one is forbidden to benefit from its meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot 4:22, Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach 4:2 and other sources.</i> When does the above apply? After it has already been sentenced to death. If, however, it had not been sentenced to death [different rules apply]. If its owner consecrates it, it is consecrated. If he declares it ownerless, it is ownerless. If he sells it, the sale is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> The purchaser should slaughter the ox immediately. Otherwise, its meat will become forbidden.</i> If a watchman returns it to its owner, it is considered to have been returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> Although the ox will be sentenced to death, the watchman is considered to have fulfilled his obligation, for the owners have the option of slaughtering the ox before it is sentenced to death.</i> If it is slaughtered first, one is not forbidden to benefit from its meat.
When an ox [that killed a human] becomes intermingled with other oxen before it was sentenced to death, they are all not held liable. [The rationale is that] just as the judgment of a human being [must be concluded in the presence of that person], so too, the judgment of the ox must be concluded in the presence of the ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> And since the ox cannot be identified, that is not possible.</i> If an ox becomes intermingled with other oxen - even 1000 - after it was sentenced to death, they all must be stoned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> The animal is not considered to become bateil b'rov, insignificant because it is mixed with a larger quantity of permitted substances. Indeed, even when it becomes mixed with a far larger number of oxen, its identity is never considered insignificant. The rationale is that a live animal is important. And an important entity is never considered to be insignificant (Zevachim 72a; Sanhedrin 79b-80a).</i> It is forbidden to benefit from them, and their carcasses must be buried, as is required whenever an animal is stoned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot 16:7 and Hilchot Pesulei Hamukdashim 19:11.</i>
When a pregnant cow kills a person - and similarly, all animals that were used for a sinful purpose [that requires their execution]<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"> This apparently refers to an animal used by a human for sodomy, which must be executed, as stated in Leviticus 20:15. For no other sin is an animal executed.</i> - the laws that apply to it apply to its calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> This follows the principle stated in the next halachah: A fetus is considered to be an extension of its mother.</i> For it and its calf gored; it and its calf were sodomized.
[The following rules apply if a cow] gored a person to death and then became pregnant: If it became pregnant and bore a calf before it was sentenced to death, the calf is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"> For it was not part of its mother's body, neither at the time of the killing, nor at the time of the sentence.</i> If it bore a calf after the sentence was delivered, the calf is forbidden, for a fetus is considered an extension<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"> Literally the thigh.</i> of its mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"> And so, just as the sentence caused the mother to become forbidden, it also caused the calf to become forbidden. The calf is not executed, however. Instead, it is left to die.</i> If [the calf] became intermingled with other calves, they must all be enclosed in a closed room until they die.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"> In this instance as well, all the calves need not be executed. It is, however, forbidden to benefit from them, because the presence of a live animal in a mixture is never considered to be insignificant.</i>
When the witnesses whose testimony caused an ox to be sentenced for execution are disqualified because they lied, whoever first takes possession of the ox acquires it as his own. [The rationale is that] once it was sentenced to death, the owners gave up their ownership of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"> Since the owner of the ox does not know whether or not the ox gored, he is dependent on the testimony of the witnesses. Once their testimony establishes that the ox gored, the owner assumes that it will be executed and despairs of retaining ownership. After he has made such a decision, even in error, anyone has the right to take possession of the ox. A parallel ruling is delivered in Hilchot Avodat Kochavim 4:8.</i> If witnesses testify that the owner [of an ox sodomized his animal] and they were disqualified because they lied, the ox remains the property of its [original] owner. Although another person drew it after him,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"> Thus performing the kinyan of meshichah, a formal act of acquisition.</i> he does not acquire it. [The rationale is that] since the owner knows that he did not sin, and that these are false witnesses, he was planning to have them disqualified. Therefore, he did not give up ownership [of his animal].

Chapter 12

When a person digs a cistern<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The Rambam has completed his discussion of the first two general categories of damages: grazing and goring. He now goes on to the third category. The damages caused by a cistern.Payment of these damages is also considered one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot (Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Commandment 238, and Sefer HaChinuch, Mitzvah 53). This mitzvah can be defined as compensating a person for the death or damage to animals he owns that came as a result of an object owned by another person, which serves as a stumbling block.</i> in the public domain, and an ox or a donkey falls into it and dies,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The Rambam's wording is taken from Exodus 21:33.</i> the owner of the cistern is liable and is required to pay the full amount of the damages, as [Exodus 21:34] states: "The owner of the cistern must pay." [This applies] even if the cistern was filled with wads of wool or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> In which case the death of the animal was not caused by its fall, but by the foul air of the cistern. Even so, the owner of the cistern is held liable.</i> [The intent] is not only an ox or a donkey, but any animal, beast or fowl. An ox and a donkey are mentioned only because these are the commonplace [examples].
[The above applies] regardless of whether the person digs a cistern in the public domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> Although the cistern does not actually belong to him - for it is in the public domain - since he dug it without permission, the Torah holds him liable for the damages as if it were his own.</i> he digs it in his own property - but it is open to the public domain or to a domain belonging to a colleague<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> Since the opening of the cistern is accessible to others, its owner should have taken precautions and made certain that it was covered.The Tur (Choshen Mishpat 410) maintains that this applies only until the owner of the adjoining courtyard is made aware of the cistern's presence. Once the owner of the courtyard knows about the presence of the cistern, he is liable.</i> - or he digs it in his own property with the opening to his own property, but afterwards, he declares the property - but not the cistern - ownerless.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> Since he declared the property ownerless, the cistern is accessible to others and therefore should be covered.</i> In all these instances, [the person who digs the cistern] is liable for the damages suffered. If, however, he declared his domain and the cistern ownerless, or he declared the cistern ownerless [while retaining possession of] his domain, or he consecrated it, he is not liable. [This is derived from the phrase:] "The owner of the cistern will pay." [Implied is that the cistern] must have an owner, while this cistern is ownerless. [Moreover, it cannot be compared to a cistern dug in the public domain,] since at the outset he was permitted to dig [the cistern], because it was on his property.
[The above applies whether the person] dug the cistern himself, it came into being [on his property] through natural means, or it was dug by an animal or a beast.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> This applies even when the cistern was dug by an animal belonging to someone else. As long as a cistern accessible to the public exists within a person's domain, he is liable to cover it. Moreover, the Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 410:4) add that even if the cistern is dug by another human being, the owner of the cistern is liable for any damages caused as soon as he discovers it.</i> Since he is required to fill it up or cover it, and he did not, he is liable for the damages. [Similarly, the above applies] whether the person digs [the cistern himself] or purchases or receives as a present [a domain with a cistern]. This is derived from the phrase:] "The owner of the cistern will pay." [Implied is that if the cistern] has an owner [he is liable].
Just as a person who digs [a cistern is liable], so too, is one who opens a cistern that was covered, as [Exodus 21:33] states: "If a person opens a cistern, or if a person digs a cistern." If [an owner] covered up a cistern in an appropriate manner and the cover decayed from within, and [because of this], an ox fell into the cistern and died, the owner is not liable. For the above verse continues: "And he did not cover it." And in this case, he covered it.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> From this, Ki'nat Eliyahu draws the conclusion that the owner is not required to check the cover continually to see that it is strong enough to serve its purpose.</i> [The following laws apply if the owner] covered [the cistern] with a covering that was strong enough to have oxen tread on it, but was not strong enough to have camels tread on it, camels trod on it and it became weakened, and then oxen trod on it and fell in. If camels are not [usually] found in such a place, [the owner] is not liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 410:23) state that if, however, a camel falls into the cistern, the owner is liable. This is not considered a factor beyond his control.</i> for this is considered a factor beyond his control. If camels pass through this place, even infrequently, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> For he should have protected against such a possibility.</i>
If [the cover] decayed from within and oxen fell into [the cistern], [the owner] is not liable. [This applies even when] camels frequent this area, and [the owner] is consider negligent with regard to the camels. Nevertheless, since the oxen fell into [the cistern], because [the cover] decayed [it is considered to be a loss beyond the owner's control].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, explaining as follows: As mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 15, even though ultimately damage was caused because of forces beyond one's control, if one has been negligent at the outset, one is liable. Therefore, in this instance, although the decay of the cover is considered to be beyond the owner's control, since he had been negligent in not covering the cistern with a cover strong enough to support camels, he should be held liable.The Maggid Mishneh justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that the above principle applies when the negligence can, at least to a certain extent, be considered a cause of the loss suffered by forces beyond one's control. In this instance, however, the fact that the cover was not sufficient to support camels can in no way be considered a cause of the decay of the cover.The Maggid Mishneh's resolution is accepted by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:24). Note the Tur and the Ramah, who develop the latter principle further.</i> The same applies in all similar situations.
When a person discovers a cistern and covers it, and afterwards uncovers it, the owner<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the one who dug the cistern in the public domain, who is held responsible for its damages.</i> of the cistern is liable, and the person who [covered and uncovered it] is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> For he has merely returned the situation to its original state.Note the comments of the Maggid Mishneh, who - in response to the objections of the Ra'avad - explains that this law applies even when the owner saw the other person covering the cistern. The owner should know not to rely on a person who is not the cistern's owner (Sefer Me'irat Einayim 410:3).</i> If, however, he filled [the cistern] with earth and then removed the earth, he [and not the original owner of the cistern] is liable. Since he filled the cistern with earth, the actions of the person who originally [dug the cistern] are considered to have been nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> It is as if the second person had dug the cistern himself (ibid.:4).</i>
[The following rules apply when] a cistern is owned by two partners. If the first passed by and did not cover it, and then the second passed by and did not cover it, the first is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> It appears that the Rambam's intent is that only the first partner is liable. Rabbenu Asher and his conception is quoted by the Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 410:25) explains that since both partners saw the cistern uncovered, they are both liable. The Talmud's intent by saying the first is liable, is that he must share in the liability. He cannot excuse himself by saying: Since the other partner saw it after me, he must bear the entire responsibility.</i> until he gives his buckets<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> Note the Lechem Mishneh who, based on Halachah 9, explains that the buckets were used as the covering for the  cistern. See the commentaries of Rashi and Rabbenu Chanan'el on Bava Kama 51b.</i> to the second [partner]. Once he gives his buckets to the second partner to draw water from it, the first is freed of liability, and the second becomes liable. If the first [partner] covered it, and the second partner passed by and saw it uncovered and left it so, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 410:26) explain that the second partner is also given time to hire workers to cover the cistern.</i> Until when does the second [partner] bear the sole responsibility of covering it? Until the first [partner] becomes aware<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad interprets the Rambam's words as meaning until he would ordinarily know, while the Maggid Mishneh explains that the intent is until he actually finds out.</i> that it is open and has the opportunity to hire workers to cut down trees and cover it. If any animal dies during this time, the second partner alone is liable. If an animal dies afterwards, both [partners] are liable, for they both were negligent.
When a person transfers [the responsibility for] his cistern to a watchman, [the watchman] is liable for the damages. If, however, the owner gave it to a deaf mute, a mentally incompetent individual or a minor to watch, the owner is liable. [This applies] even if he left it covered, because it is likely that a cistern will be uncovered, and these individuals are not mentally competent [to know that it must be covered at all times].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, explaining that if the cistern is covered thoroughly, the owner is not held liable. The Maggid Mishneh upholds the Rambam's ruling, and Sefer Me'irat Einayim 410:45 explains that furthermore, we have reason to believe that the mentally incompetents opened the covering themselves.</i>
When a person covers his cistern with buckets belonging to a colleague,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> That were taken without his colleague's permission.</i> and then the owner of the buckets comes and takes them, the owner [of the cistern] is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> For he should have taken into consideration the possibility that the owner of the buckets would take them back. The owner of the buckets is not obligated to notify him.</i>
[The above laws apply whether] one digs a cistern, a ditch, a cave or a trench. Why does the Torah mention a cistern? [To teach that its depth] must be sufficient to kill. How much is considered sufficient to kill? A depth of ten handbreadths.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> For a cistern is usually at least ten handbreadths deep, while the others may not be that deep.See parallels to this ruling in Hilchot Shechitah 9:8 and Hilchot Rotzeach 3:7.</i> If a cistern was less than ten handbreadths deep<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> Even if its depth is small, if it presents a difficulty that could cause an animal to stumble and suffer damage, the owner is liable (Maggid Mishneh). See Halachah 15.</i> and an ox or another animal, beast or fowl falls in and dies, [the one responsible for the obstruction] is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> For under ordinary circumstances, a fall of less than ten handbreadths will not cause an animal to die.</i> If the animal is damaged, the one responsible for the obstruction must pay the full extent of the damages.
If a cistern was nine handbreadths deep, and one of those handbreadths was filled with water, [the owner] is liable [if an animal falls in and dies]. [The rationale is] that one handbreadth with water is considered equivalent to two handbreadths without water.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> The rationale is that the water impairs the quality of the air in the cistern and hastens the animal's death.</i> If [the cistern] was eight [handbreadths] deep and two handbreadths [were filled with] water, or it was seven [handbreadths] deep and three handbreadths [were filled with] water, and an ox or the like fell in and died, [the owner of the cistern] is not held liable to pay [for the death of the animal]. If [the owner of the animal seized [compensation for his loss from the owner of the cistern's property],<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 1, Halachah 11 and notes.</i> [the property he seized] is not expropriated from him. [The rationale is] that there is a doubt regarding this issue.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> Therefore, the money is allowed to remain in the possession of the litigant - either the owner of the pit or the owner of the animal - in whose possession it is at the time the matter is brought to court.</i>
When one person digs a cistern ten handbreadths deep, a second person comes and [digs deeper], making it twenty handbreadths deep, and a third person comes and [digs deeper], making it thirty handbreadths deep, they all share in the liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> Since each of them dug an amount sufficient to cause death, the damages are equally divided among them.</i> When the first digs even one handbreadth less than ten handbreadths, and another makes it ten handbreadths deep - either by digging another handbreadth deeper or building a rim of a handbreadth at its edge - the latter person [alone] is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> He is solely liable both for damages and for death. The rationale is that the original cistern was not deep enough to cause death. Hence, when the second person deepened it, making it deep enough to cause death, he is considered to have brought into being a new entity for which he alone is liable if it causes damages.</i> If afterwards he filled up the handbreadth he added or destroyed the rim he built, it is unresolved whether the first person's deed is no longer considered of consequence<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> According to this view, once the second person deepened the cistern, it is considered to be his handiwork entirely, as if the first person no longer had any connection to it. Therefore, the second person has the responsibility of covering the cistern, and paying for any damages that might be caused.</i> [and therefore, he is not liable,] or whether his actions are still considered significant.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> Therefore, neither of the people who dug the cistern can be held liable. According to the views that maintain that a person who seizes property when an unresolved doubt exists is allowed to maintain possession, if the person whose property was damaged seizes property from either or both of the persons who dug the cistern, he is entitled to maintain possession (Sefer Me'irat Einayim 410:33).</i>
[The following rules apply when a person] dug a deep cistern,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., ten or more handbreadths deep.</i> another person came and made it wider, and an ox fell into it and died. If [it is obvious that<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> This addition is made based on the comments of Sefer Me'irat Einayim 410:24.

Therefore, he is considered to be the owner of the cistern and is held responsible for the damages, even when the animal fell from the other side.</i> Similarly, if the ox fell from the side that the person widened, [and died because of the air of the cistern],<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"> This addition is made on the basis of the comments of Sefer Me'irat Einayim 410:25.</i> the second person is held liable despite the fact that [the ox] died from [the cistern's foul] air.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"> And the second person improved the quality of the air. Nevertheless, he is held liable, because had he not widened the cistern, it is possible that the ox would not have fallen in.</i> If [the ox] fell from the side that was dug by the first person, the first person is liable, for the second person improved [the quality of] the air.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"> The Rambam's ruling has attracted the attention of the commentaries, because it appears to fuse together two dissenting Talmudic opinions (Bava Kama 51b). As the Maggid Mishneh explains, according to the first of the opinions mentioned in that passage, it appears that what is significant is whether the animal died because of the blow it received or because of the foul air in the cistern, while according to the second opinion, what is significant is the side from which the animal fell.The Kessef Mishneh reconciles the Rambam's interpretation, explaining that the Rambam did not see the two interpretations as being contradictory, for if that were the case, each one could be refuted by an obvious question. According to the first opinion: Why would the first person be held liable if the ox died because of the air in the cistern if the ox fell in from the side that the other person widened? Had he not widened it, the ox might not have fallen in.According to the second opinion, the question arises: Since the second person's action makes him liable if an ox falls in, what difference does it make from which side it fell.For these reasons, the Rambam maintains that the two opinions are complementary. See the D'rishah (Choshen Mishpat 410), which offers an alternate resolution of the Rambam's view. Rabbenu Asher, the Tur, and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 410:16) differ with the Rambam and follow the second opinion, which maintains that the liability depends on the side from which the ox fell.</i>
The liability that the Torah imposed for [damages caused by falling into] a cistern applies even when the animal died merely because of the [foul] air within the cistern. Needless to say, it applies when the animal dies because of the blow it received.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"> This ruling is the subject of a difference of opinion among the Sages of the Talmud (Bava Kama 50b). The Rambam accepts the opinion of the sage Shmuel.</i> If the width of the cistern was the same as its depth, it will not have [foul] air. Thus, if the animal did not receive a blow [when it fell] and yet it died, [the owner of the cistern] is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"> For the animal is considered to have died because of forces beyond the owner's control (Sefer Me'irat Einayim 410:28).</i> If the depth exceeds its width, it has [foul] air. If an animal dies [after falling in], [the owner] is liable, even though it did not receive a blow from the bottom [of the cistern].<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., there were substances at the bottom of the cistern that cushioned the animal's fall (Tur, Choshen Mishpat 410).</i>
[The following rules apply when] a person erects a high mound in the public domain, and an animal receives a blow from it and dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">  The Rambam's wording is carefully chosen. As opposed to the owner of a cistern, who can be held liable whether the animal dies from the blow it receives or from the foul air, a person who erects a mound can be held liable only when the animal dies because of the blow it receives.</i>If [the mound] was ten handbreadths high, he is liable to pay [for the damages]. If it was less than ten handbreadths high, he is not liable if the animal dies. If, however, an animal is merely injured, he is liable for the full extent of the damages. Even if a mound is of minimal height, or one digs [a pit of] minimal depth, [and an animal is injured, one is liable]. For it is a frequent occurrence for injuries to be caused by a mound or a pit of minimal height or depth. For [an animal] to die because of such a mound or pit is not a frequent occurrence; it is considered to be an event beyond one's control.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hilchot Chovel UMazik 1:18.</i>
Similarly, a person is not liable for the death of an animal that [fell] into a cistern or that received a blow from a mound unless the animal was small, a deaf mute or mentally incompetent,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">  In all three of these instances, the person who dug the cistern or who erected the mound is liable, for the animal is considered to be mentally incompetent and unable to appreciate the danger that the cistern or mound could cause.</i>or it was blind, or it fell at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"> In these instances, although the animal was mentally competent, since it could not see the cistern or the mound, it was unable to appreciate the danger.</i> If, however, the animal was mentally competent, and it fell into [the cistern] during the day, [the owner of the cistern] is not liable. This is considered like an event beyond a person's control. For it is the ordinary practice for an animal to see where it is going and to avoid obstacles. Similarly, if a human fell into the pit and died, the owner is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"> This is a decree of Torah law. Commenting on Exodus 21:33: If an ox or a donkey fall into it, Bava Kama 28b, 52a states: An ox' and not a man, a donkey,' and not utensils.</i> This applies even if he was blind or fell at night,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"> For the leniency is not a result of the fact that a person takes care while walking, but a result of the Torah's decree.</i> and regardless of whether he was a free man or a servant. If a mentally competent human or animal suffered injury because of [the cistern], [the owner] is liable for the full extent of the damages,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"> Although the owner must pay the full extent of the damages, he is not liable for the medical treatment, pain, embarrassment, and loss of employment suffered by the person, as stated in Chapter 14, Halachah 15.</i> as explained [in the previous halachah].<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"> With regard to an injury suffered by a human being, Tosafot, Bava Kama 27b explains that the Torah freed the owner of a cistern from liability only when a person died because of a fall (as is the case in the verse cited above), and not when he became injured. Even if the injury is suffered during the day, the person is liable, because it is not common for a person to look carefully at the road on which he is walking.With regard to an injury suffered by an animal, the Rambam's ruling is the subject of a difference of opinion among our Rabbis. The Ra'avad maintains that just as the owner of the cistern is not liable for the death of a mentally competent animal that falls during the daytime, he is not liable for its injury.The Maggid Mishneh justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that although an animal may act with caution with regard to obstacles that can cause more severe damages, it will not be as sensitive with regard to obstacles that can cause lesser damages. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:20) quotes the Rambam's view, while the Tur and the Ramah follow that of the Ra'avad. Note, however, the ruling of the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 412:3), which appears to follow the approach of the Ra'avad.</i>
If an ox that had been consecrated as a sacrificial offering and then disqualified<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"> E.g., an animal that suffered a disqualifying physical blemish after being consecrated. This law applies even in the present age, with regard to a firstborn animal.</i> fell into [the cistern] and died, the owner is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"> In Hilchot Chovel UMazik 6:16, the Rambam states that this leniency applies even when the animal is merely injured.</i> [This law is derived as follows. Exodus 21:34] states: "The dead body will belong to [its owner]." [The liability for the animal's death stated in the verse applies only] when the dead body belongs to [the owner].<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"> And he is permitted to benefit from it.</i> This excludes the case at hand, for it is forbidden to benefit from [the body of this animal], and it must be buried.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"> Note the Ra'avad, who states that this leniency applies even when the disqualified animal has already been redeemed by its owner. Although the Rambam's wording does not appear to include such an instance (for then, it is permitted to benefit from the animal), the Maggid Mishneh states that he would accept the Ra'avad's ruling.</i>
[The following laws apply when] a person was digging a cistern and the noise of the digging caused an animal to fall into the pit and die. If [the animal] fell forwards, [the owner of the cistern] is liable. If it fell backwards - i.e., it was startled [by the sound] and retreated and then fell - [the owner] is not liable. [The latter law is derived as follows. Exodus 21:33 states: "When an ox...] falls," [implied is that for the person to be liable], the ox must fall in an ordinary manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, because it appears to contradict the understanding of Bava Kama 52b-53a. First of all, the Talmud explains that this matter is dependent on a difference of opinion between Rav and Shmuel. In Halachah 15, the Rambam rules according to Shmuel, while here his ruling appears closer to that of Rav. According to the Ra'avad, if the animal fell backwards into the cistern, the owner of the cistern is not held liable, but if the owner seizes property belonging to the other, it is not expropriated from him.The Rambam's interpretation of this passage is obviously problematic. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 5:6), his interpretation also appears to differ from this halachah. There he writes that if the ox falls backwards into the cistern, the owner of the cistern is liable. If he falls backwards outside the cistern, the owner of the cistern is not liable. This understanding is reflected in the ruling of the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:31).</i> If [the animal] fell forward outside the cistern because of the sound of the digging and died, the court does not hold the owner of the cistern liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"> For the animal died because of the blow it received from the land in the public domain, and not that of the cistern. The Ra'avad differs with regard to this clause as well and maintains that the property of the cistern's owner may not be seized. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:31) also follows that understanding.</i> If the person [whose ox died] seizes property [belonging to the owner of the cistern], it is not expropriated from him. If [the animal] fell backward outside the cistern and died or was injured, the owner of the cistern is not liable.
[The following rules apply when] an ox pushes another animal into a cistern and it dies. If [the ox] is <i>mu'ad</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"> In which case, its owner is ordinarily responsible for the full extent of the damages it causes.</i> the owner of the cistern is required to pay half [the damages], and the owner of the ox the [other] half.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"> The ox that pushes the animal and the cistern into which it fell are considered equally responsible for the damage. Had the ox not been pushed, it would not have fallen. Had the cistern not been uncovered in the public domain, the ox would also not have fallen.</i> If [the ox] is <i>tam</i>, the owner of the ox must pay one-fourth [of the damages] from the body of the ox,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"> For the owner of an ox that is tam is required to pay half of the damages (in this case, half of a half), and that payment can be expropriated only from the body of the ox that did the damage. If the ox is not worth that amount, the owner is not obligated to pay any more.</i> while the owner of the cistern must pay three-fourths of the damage from his most choice property. For the owner of the dead animal may say to the owner of the cistern: "You owe me for the depreciation in value of this dead animal. Although it was a mature animal and mentally competent, it is as if it fell at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., one cannot say that the animal should have avoided the obstacles.</i> I will collect whatever I can from the owner of the ox. You are liable to pay me the remainder."<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"> For had the cistern not been there, the animal would not have died.</i>
Similarly, if a person places a stone at the edge of a cistern, and an ox stumbles over it and falls into the cistern and dies, the person who placed the stone there must pay [half the damages],<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"> As explained in the following chapter, placing any obstacle in the public domain is a derivative of digging a cistern and causes one to be liable for the damages suffered. In this instance, the person who placed the stone and the one who dug the cistern are considered to be partners in this liability, for were it not for the stone, the animal would not have fallen. And were it not for the cistern, the fall would not have resulted in its death.</i> and the owner of the cistern must pay the [other] half.
Similarly,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"> This is another example of a case where two people are considered to be partners in damage that is caused. Each is considered to be liable for the entire amount. Nevertheless, since the person whose property was damaged does not have to receive more than the amount he lost, the loss is divided between the two (Bava Kama 53a). In this instance, as in Halachah 19, the owner of the dead animal cannot collect from the owner of the ox that was disqualified as a sacrifice. Hence, he collects the entire amount from the owner of the other ox.</i> [the following laws apply when] an ordinary ox and an ox that was consecrated as a sacrifice and then disqualified gored another ox together. If the ordinary ox is a<i> tam</i>, [its owner] should pay half the damages. If it is <i>mu'ad</i>, [its owner] must pay the entire damages. [The entire burden falls on this person,] because the owner of the ox that suffered the damage will say to him: "I will collect all that I can from the other ox, and you are liable for the remainder. In this instance, since the other ox is consecrated and therefore [its owner is] not held liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 8, Halachah 1, from which it is evident that the present halachah refers to an ox that was consecrated, disqualified, but not redeemed as yet.</i> you must pay me the entire amount."
When a person was digging a cistern in the public domain, and an ox fell upon him and killed him, the owner of the ox is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., he does not have to pay an atonement fine, nor is the ox stoned, as reflected by the ruling in Chapter 10, Halachah 9.

Chapter 13

When utensils fall into a cistern and break, the owner of the cistern is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Similarly, as stated in the following halachah, the owner of the cistern is not held liable if the utensils are damaged. With regard to a human, by contrast, the owner is liable for damages. (See Chapter12, Halachah 16; Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 410:21.)</i> [This is derived from Exodus 21:33, which] states: "And an ox or a donkey fell there." The Oral Tradition interprets<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Bava Kama 28b, 53b.</i> this as an exclusion: "'An ox' and not a man;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> See Chapter 12, Halachah 16.</i> 'a donkey' and not utensils." Even when an ox fell [into a cistern] when carrying utensils and died and broke the utensils, the owner is liable for the ox, but not for the utensils.
A cistern is considered one of the general categories of causes of damage. Its derivatives, like it, are considered <i>mu'adim</i> from the outset. Whenever a person leaves an obstacle [in the path of other living beings], it is considered to be a derivative of a cistern.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> See the Tur (Choshen Mishpat 410), which defines the derivatives of a cistern as including any property that causes damage in its place, which does not move. Although the Rambam mentions a moving obstacle in Chapter 2, Halachah 19, the intent is that the obstacle is being moved by another force.</i> If a person or an animal is injured because of it, the person who caused the obstacle to exist is liable, whether or not he renounced ownership of it. If it caused damage to utensils, [the person responsible] is not held liable.
What is implied? When a person leaves his stone, his knife, his straw, his burden or the like in the public domain, and they cause injury to another human or to an animal, [the first person] is liable for the full amount of the damages. Similarly, if he left such items on his property and declared his property - but not these items - ownerless, and a person stumbled on the ground<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The person stumbled on the earth, and this is what caused the injury. Nevertheless, since the earth is ownerless, he collects the damages from the person who left the obstacle in its place. Were it not for the obstacle, the damage would not have taken place.</i> and received a blow from such an item that caused him injury, the person who caused the obstacle to exist is liable. If the person's utensils became damaged or soiled in such a situation, [the person who caused the obstacle to exist] is not liable.
If a person brought his ox into a courtyard belonging to another person without permission, the ox defecated, and the feces soiled utensils belonging to the owner, [the owner of the ox] is not liable. For the feces are considered to be a derivative of a cistern, and [the owner of] a cistern is never liable for damage to utensils.
[The following laws apply when a person] leaves his jug in the public domain, and a passerby stumbles over it and breaks it. The passerby is not liable, because it is not the practice of people to look out on the way as they walk. If [the passerby] was injured, the owner of the jug is liable for his injury. [This applies] even if he declared his jug ownerless. For whenever a person declares ownerless an obstacle that he has created in a domain in which he has no permission to place it at the outset,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he left a jug on his own property and then declared it ownerless, he is not liable. At the outset, he had permission to leave the jug there. See Chapter 12, Halachah 2.</i> he is liable, as if he had never declared it ownerless.
If the person placed the jug down in a place where he had permission to place it - e.g., the marketplace before the wine vats or the like<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. a place in front of oil vats or beehives, where jugs of oil or honey would be filled.</i> - and a passerby stumbles over it and breaks it, [the passerby] is liable. If the passerby was injured, the owner of the jug is not liable, because [the passerby] should have looked to see [if there was anything in his way].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Although, as stated above, it is not the general practice for people to watch for obstacles as they walk, since jugs are often left on the ground in places like these, a passerby should watch his step (Kessef Mishneh).</i> If it was dark or [if the owner of the jugs] filled the entire path with jugs, the passerby is not liable for breaking it. If he is injured, the owner of the jugs is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the dark, the owner of the jugs should have removed them before nightfall, for he knows that a passerby will not be able to see. If he filled the path with jugs, he made it likely that a person would break a jug as he passed by. Note the quotation of this law in the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 412:2). There a further category is added: an instance where a person places so many jugs in the road that it is impossible for people to pass without breaking some of the jugs: the passerby is not liable even if he intentionally broke enough jugs to allow him to pass.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
[The following rules apply when] a jug belonging to a person breaks [accidentally] in the public domain, and another person slips on the water [that spilled] or receives a blow from its shards. The owner cannot be held liable by an earthly court, because [the jug] was broken by accident.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since the jug broke accidentally, the owner is not considered negligent with regard to the damages that were caused. For this reason, the laws stated in Halachah 5 are not applied to him.</i> He has, however, a moral and a spiritual obligation, because he did not gather the shards.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> If he did not have time to gather the shards before the other person was injured, he does not have such a moral obligation (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 412:4.)</i> The shards and the water are like ownerless entities, [even though] he did not rescind his ownership until after the accident, he is not held liable. If he intended to take possession of the shards, and another person was damaged by them, he is liable. Similar laws apply to a person whose camel fell and he did not raise it up, or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> For the camel, like the broken pitcher, fell accidentally as the pitcher broke, and is thus considered to be an obstacle unintentionally placed in the public domain. Bava Kama 29astates that this is speaking of an instance where the camel died, and its owner rescinded his ownership over its carcass. Otherwise, he would be held liable.</i> In all these situations, if utensils were damaged, the owner of the obstacle is not liable, whether he declared his object ownerless or not, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> Halachah 1.</i>
[The following laws apply when] two potters were following each other on a path, the first tripped and fell, and the second tripped over the first. If the first could have stood up but failed to do so, he is liable for the damages suffered by the second. Although he accidentally fell, the accident did not [force him to remain] lying in the road. [Therefore,] since he could have stood up, [he is liable].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., his body is considered like an obstacle in the public domain.</i> If he was unable to have risen [before the second potter tripped over him], he is not liable. [This applies] even though he did not warn [the potter] who tripped over him. [The rationale is] that he is concerned with his own [difficulties].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> Although one might think that he could have been held liable for not warning his colleague, this presumption is not accepted. His concern for his own welfare takes priority. Rabbenu Asher (and his opinion is accepted by the Tur and the Ramah Choshen Mishpat 413:1) differs and maintains that if the first potter had the opportunity to warn the second and failed to do so, he is liable.</i>
When do we say that he is liable for the damages to the second [potter]? When he suffers damage to his body. If, however, his utensils are damaged, [the first potter] is not liable. For [an owner of] a cistern is not liable for the damage to utensils, and any obstacle is considered to be a derivative of a cistern, as explained above.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> Halachah 2. Implied by the Rambam's wording in this halachah (and the following one) is that the body of the first potter is considered to be an obstacle. He is not considered to have caused damage to his colleague with his person.</i>
[The following rules apply when] potters, glass blowers and the like were walking one after the other, the first one tripped and fell, the second tripped over the first one, and the third tripped over the second. Each of them had time to stand up, but failed to do so. The first is liable for the damages to the body of the second, regardless of whether he was injured by the body of the first person who is lying on the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> This reflects the concept mentioned in the previous note. A person's body is considered to be an obstacle. Therefore, the Rambam mentions damage to the body of the second person, implying that if the second person's utensils were damaged, the first would not be held liable.</i> or he was injured by his burden.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> From Halachah 7, it would appear that this ruling applies only when the potter did not declare his wares ownerless. See the Ra'avad, the Maggid Mishneh, the Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 413:2).</i> The second is liable for the injuries suffered by the body of the third person if he was injured by the second person's body. If, however, he was injured by the second person's burden, [the second person] is not liable. For he will say: "I did not dig this cistern - i.e., my burden." For it was the first person who caused the second person and his burden to fall.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> This argument does not apply, however, with regard to injury caused by the body of the second person. Since he had time to rise, he is liable for the injuries suffered.</i> In all cases, [if the person who fell] warned [the person who tripped over him or his burden], [the person who fell] is not liable.
If the first person fell and was lying lengthwise across the road and one person tripped over his head, another [tripped] over his legs and a third over his abdomen, he is liable for the injuries each suffered, for he had the potential to arise.
When a person pours water into the public domain, and another person is injured by it, [the one who poured out the water] is liable for the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> In this instance, there is no difference whether or not the person declared the water ownerless, as reflected in Halachot 2 and 7.</i> If the other person's garments were soiled, [the one who poured out the water] is not liable, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> For the owner of a derivative of a cistern is not liable for damages to property (Halachot 1 and 2).</i> If the water was absorbed by the earth, but the earth remained slippery,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad explains that this ruling applies only when the ground is still muddy because of the water. The Maggid Mishneh states that even when the water has been absorbed totally, if the ground is still slippery, the person is liable. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 412:5) appears to follow the Ra'avad's view.</i> and a person slipped and fell and was injured by the ground, [the one who poured out the water] is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Although the ground did not belong to him, since the fall was caused by the water that he poured, he is liable.</i>
All those who open their sewage vats and rake out their cesspools do not have permission to pour this water into the public domain during the summer months.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> During these months, the streets are clean and it is forbidden for someone to soil them. Moreover, in Eretz Yisrael it does not rain during these months, and the sewage will remain in the streets for months.</i> In the rainy season, a person has permission [to release such sewage].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> For the streets are muddy at that time, and there is water flowing to wash away the sewage. Needless to say, as our sewage and sidewalk shave become more sophisticated, the relevance of these laws has faded.</i> Nevertheless, if a person or an animal is damaged by the water, the one who released it is responsible for the entire sum of the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> Although our Sages granted a person permission to release his sewage at this time, they did not absolve him of responsibility.</i>
A person should not take his straw and hay out to the public domain so that it will be trod upon and become fit to use as fertilizer. If he did take it out, our Sages penalized him and declared the straw to be ownerless. The first person to take possession of it acquires it as his own, once it has been trod upon and its value has increased.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> There is an unresolved difference of opinion among the Sages (Bava Kama 30b) if the penalty takes effect from the time thestraw was taken out, or from the time it became useful asfertilizer. Note the Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 414:1), who state that at the outset a person who asks whether he may take the straw and the hay, should not be told that he may retain possession of its initial value. Instead, he should be told that he may keep only the increment. After the fact, he is allowed to keep the initial value as well.</i> If a person took possession of it before that time - i.e., directly after it was taken out to the public domain - it should not be expropriated from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Ramah differ with regard to this point as well and maintain that in this instance, the straw should be expropriated from the person who took possession of it.</i> Although the straw and the hay are ownerless, if [they cause damage to] a person or an animal, the person who brought it out [to the public domain] must compensate [for the damages].<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> Whenever damage is caused by an object that was declared ownerless after being placed in the public domain without permission, the person who placed it there is liable.</i>
A person may take out compost and manure to the public domain at a time when everyone does so and amass them there for 30 days so that they will be trodden upon by people and animals. Although [permission is granted], if these substances cause damage the owner is liable for the damages. [If another person takes] this manure,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Hilchot Gezelah 6:5, this applies even if aperson takes his compost out at a time when it is forbidden to do so.A person who takes it is liable for theft.</i> he is liable for theft. Since its value will not increase [appreciably] by being trodden upon, [our Sages] did not penalize him [by declaring it ownerless].<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 414:2) statethat if the compost causes damage, it is considered to be ownerless, and it may be taken by another person.</i>
Mortar may not be left to soak in the public domain, nor may bricks be fashioned there.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For these will remain in the public domain for an extendedperiod.</i> One may, however, mix mortar<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> To be used for building in the near future.</i> in the public domain. One may not, however, mix bricks.
When a person constructs a building in the public domain, the one who brings stones may bring stones, and the one who builds may build. If any of them causes damage, they are obligated to pay for the entire sum of the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"> In this instance as well, the license to perform an activity in the public domain does not absolve a person of liability.</i>
When a quarrier hews out a stone and gives it to a stonecutter, and it causes damage to a human or an animal, the stonecutter is liable. If the stonecutter gives it to a donkey-driver<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">To transport to a construction site.</i> [and it causes damage], the donkey-driver is liable. If the donkey-driver gives it to a porter<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">To carry it to the builder.</i> [and it causes damage], the porter is liable. If the porter gives it to a builder [and it causes damage], the builder is liable. If the builder gives it to the person who positions it on the building [and it causes damage], the latter is liable. If they were working as contractors [in a partnership], and after it was positioned in its place on the building it fell and caused damage, they all share in the liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">If they were partners, once the task is completed they all sharein the responsibility. Until the entire task is completed, however, the person who is responsible for the activity at the time the damage was caused must pay for the damages, even when they were all partners.</i> If they are hired laborers, the one [who positioned the stone in its place] is liable, and the others are not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., each person is liable for the portion of the task that he performs.</i>
When a wall or a tree falls into the public domain and causes damage,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"> The Maggid Mishneh emphasizes that this applies when damage is caused by the tree or the wall as it falls.

The Maggid Mishneh clarifies that this applies only when the wall was constructed properly to begin with. When, however, it is built faultily, the owner is liable.</i> [This applies] even when he declared [the tree or the wall] ownerless.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"> Generally, despite the fact that a person declares an obstacle that he created in the public domain as ownerless, he is liable. In this instance, however, since he had permission to plant the tree or build the wall, and it fell because of forces beyond his control, he is not held responsible.The Maggid Mishneh explains that the owner is liable, if he desires to establish his possession over the entities which fell. The Tur and the Ramah (loc. cit.) differ.</i> [The rationale is that these entities] do not resemble a cistern, for at the outset, [it is not likely] that they will cause damage. If they were not sturdy, the court sets a time for the person by which he must cut down the tree and tear down the wall. How much time is granted him? Thirty days.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"> As Bava Metzia 118a states, this is the ordinary time granted by the court to adjust difficulties.</i> If the tree or the wall falls within this time and causes damage, he is not liable. [If it falls] afterwards, he is liable, because he delayed [beyond the limits set].
When a person places thorns or glass [within a wall], or when a person makes a fence of thorns that project into the public domain, and it causes damage to another person,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"> The thorns or glass that projects is considered to be an obstacle placed in the public domain.</i> he is liable for the full extent of the damages. If he makes a fence of thorns that are contained within his property,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"> Even if they project beyond the wall itself, as long as they are contained within the owner's property, he is not liable.</i> he is not held liable, for it is not ordinary for people to rub against a wall [in the public domain].
[The following laws apply when] a person hid his thorns and [fragments of] glass in a wall belonging to a colleague, the owner of the wall came and tore down his wall into the public domain, and [the thorns or glass] caused damage. If the wall was shaky,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"> And thus one could assume that it would be torn down in the near future.</i> the person who hid [the thorns or glass] is liable. If the wall was strong, its owner is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"> The owner of the thorns or glass is not liable, because he had no reason to think that someone would tear down a sturdy wall. If the damage was done when the wall was being destroyed, the owner of the wall is liable, because he should have taken care that no passersby were hurt. If the damage was done after the wall was destroyed, the owner of the wall is liable, because he was responsible for clearing the debris remaining from his wall (Tur, Beit Yosef, Choshen Mishpat 415).</i>
The pious men<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., men who went beyond the measure of the law. This teaching is based on the examples of sages cited by Bava Kama 30a.</i> of the early generations would bury thorns and [fragments of] glass in their fields [at least] three handbreadths below the ground, so they would not be lifted up by a plow. Others would burn them in fire. Still others would throw them to the sea or to the river so that other people would not be injured by them.
A person should not clear stones from his private property into the public domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"> Lest another person stumble over them and be injured.</i> One should not dig a cavity, a cistern, a trench or a cave under the public domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 417:1) states that in his era, it had already become customary to dig below the streets of the public domain. This is surely the case in our age, when engineering has progressed to the point that safety is not compromised by digging in this manner.</i> [This applies] even when [the covering of the cavity is so strong] that it can support a carriage laden with stones, for there is the possibility that [at a later date] it will open from below without his knowledge. It is permitted for a person to dig a cistern for the needs of people at large.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., to provide travelers with drinking water. This law is stated in a separate paragraph, because as is stated in the Tur and the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat410:7, but see 417:1), it is a separate clause, and not a continuation of the previous idea. The Tur and the Shulchan Aruch also mention that the person must cover the cistern and entrust the cover to the trustees of the people at large, or at the very least inform the court that he has dug a cistern for people, but is expecting the court to arrange for its being covered.</i>
One should not build projections and balconies that protrude into the public domain unless it is possible for a camel and its rider<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"> A camel was the highest popular means of conveyance in Talmudic times.

If he desires, he can withdraw the walls [of his building into his own domain] and build [the projection].<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., knock down the existing walls and build new walls further removed from the public domain.</i> If he did withdraw the walls [of his building], but has not built [a projection], he may do so at any time he desires. Never, however, may he return the walls to their original place. Once people at large have been granted permission to pass through a particular property, it cannot be withdrawn.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"> If, however, people do not frequently walk through this space (e.g., the person prevented that by building a platform there), he may rebuild the walls in their original place when he desires Rabbenu Yerucham; Beit Yosef, Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 417:2).</i>
When a person purchased a courtyard with projections and balconies protruding into the public domain, we operate under the presumption [that they were built legally].<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., that the person who originally constructed the building built its walls removed from the public domain, so that the protrusions and balconies were permitted.</i> If the building falls, he is allowed to rebuild it according to its original proportions.
When [the foliage of] a tree leans into the public domain, it should be trimmed so that a camel and its rider can pass under it. An empty space should be left next to the banks on both sides of a river wide enough for the crewmen who descend and pull a boat.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the rivers of Eretz Yisrael and Babylon were for the most part neither wide nor deep. When a ship wanted to dock, several of its crewmen would descend and they would pull the ship to the riverbank by ropes. This halachah requires that enough empty space be left along the river banks to allow these crewmen to maneuver. From Hilchot Geneivah 8:2, it appears that we are speaking about four cubits.</i> Any tree that is found in this space should be cut down immediately. A warning need not be given to its owner,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This can be derived by the conduct of Rabbah bar Rav Nachman (Bava Metzia 108a), who cleared space without informing the owner of the property.</i> for it blocks the crewmen from pulling ships.

How wide is a path for people at large? Not less than sixteen cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"> This is derived from the width of the public thoroughfare in the camp of the Jews in the desert.</i>

Chapter 14

When a person kindles a fire in a field belonging to someone else<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Without permission.</i> and the fire spreads and causes damage, [the person who kindled it] is liable to pay the full extent of the damages,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> This is considered as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah by Sefer HaMitzvot (positive commandments 241) and Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 56).As the Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 418:2) point out, this applies even when the person took the precautions mentioned in the following halachot. Since he kindled a fire on his colleague's property without permission, he must bear the consequences.</i> as [Exodus 22:5] states: "When a fire spreads through thorns and consumes bound or standing grain..., [the one who started the fire] must pay." Kindling a fire is considered one of the major categories of sources of damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> As the Rambam states in Halachah 16, a major category has derivatives. The derivatives of fire are any asset that one owns that is transported further by the wind and causes damage.</i>
When a person kindles [a fire] on his own property, he must retreat a sufficient distance from his boundary to ensure that the fire will not spread to a field belonging to a colleague.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> This communicates a fundamental principle. Although he is acting within his own domain, a person must take the necessary precautions to ensure that he will not cause damage to another person's property.</i> How far must he move?

If he retreated an appropriate distance, and [the fire] nevertheless spread and caused damage, he is not liable. This is considered an act of heaven. Similarly, if [the fire] crossed a stream<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The Hebrew wording used by the Rambam leads to the inference that a stream or irrigation ditch that is dried out is not considered to be a sufficient fire barrier.</i> or a pond of rainwater that was [at least] eight cubits wide, [the person who kindled the fire] is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> For it is not usual for a fire to spread across a body of water that size.</i>
If the fire passed a wall, we measure the height of the wall and the height of the fire and the amount of foliage<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Or wood.

From the commentary of Rabbenu Chanan'el (Bava Kama 61a), it appears that the intent is a very hot fire that burns powerfully, but does not produce a high flame.</i> If, however, the flame ascends upward and warps downward because of the height of the flame, and there were trees<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> Or wood.

Even if the fire spread for 1000 cubits, [the person who kindled it] is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> When a flame is this high, there are no limits to the extent the fire may spread.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a fire breaks out in a person's domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., he kindled a fire, and the flame flew out of control.</i> and his wall falls from causes other than the fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> Had the wall not fallen, it would ordinarily have been considered sufficient to impede the spread of the fire. If the fire was so great that it toppled the wall, the person would be liable for the damages the fire caused. In the instance at hand, however, the question is: Is he held responsible for the damages the fire caused, because he couldhave rebuilt the wall and thus prevented the fire from spreading.</i> If he had had the opportunity to rebuild the wall that fell, and he neglected to do so, he is liable. To what can the matter be compared?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> The comparison is taken from (Bava Kama 23a).</i> To a person's ox that broke loose<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., the ox was placed in a corral that was not securely locked.

A person who sends a fire in the hands of a deaf mute, a mentally incompetent person or a child is not held liable by an earthly court;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"> These three individuals are not liable, because their incompetence causes them to be freed of responsibility for their conduct. The person who gave them the fire is not held liable, for he did not set the fire himself.</i> he does, however, have a moral and a spiritual obligation [to make restitution for the damages].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> For he is an indirect cause of the damage.</i> When does the above apply? When he gave them a coal and they fanned it into a flame, for it is normal for a coal to burn out before it causes a flame. If, however, [the person] gave them a flame, he is liable, for his deeds caused the damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> In this instance, he is considered a direct cause of the damage.</i>
When a person sends a fire with a mentally competent individual, the agent who spread the flame is liable, and the principal is free of liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> This follows the principle When a student's (the principal who charged the agent with causing damage) words conflict with a master's (God's, who forbade causing damage), whose words should be heeded?

When one person brings a flame, and [then] another person brings the wood, [and a fire is started, which causes damage], the person who brought the wood is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> For were it not for the wood, the fire would not have spread.</i> When one person brings the wood, and [then] another person brings a flame, [and a fire is started, which causes damage,] the person who brought the flame is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> Since the wood was already there, it is the person who kindled the fire who must accept responsibility.</i> If another person comes and fans the fire, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> Because it is the fanning that causes it to spread.</i> If the fire is fanned by an uncommon wind,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> If, however, such winds are common, the persons who brought the wood and started the fire must accept responsibility. They should have taken this factor into consideration. Note Maggid Mishneh and the gloss of Sefer Me'irat Einayim 418:9, who explain that the term an uncommon wind does not refer to a storm wind that rarely comes, but rather to a wind that is an infrequent and out-of-the-ordinary matter, but still a somewhat recurrent meteorological occurrence.</i> none of them is held liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> For without the wind's influence, the fire would not have spread.If, however, the wind is blowing at the time a person is involved with the fire, and he ignores the possible danger, he is held liable (Maggid Mishneh; Ramah, Choshen Mishpat 418:9).The Ramah (based on the Tur) also maintains that if it is a common wind that caused the fire to spread, the last person who had anything to do with the fire is liable.</i> If a person fanned a fire, but it was also fanned by the wind, the person is liable, for his [actions] caused damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statements, maintaining that the liability of the person who fanned the fire is dependent on the viability of his deeds. Were his fanning sufficient to have caused the fire to spread even if it had not been fanned by the wind, he is liable. If not, he is not held liable. The Maggid Mishneh justifies the Rambam's ruling, citing several interpretations by the Sages in Bava Kama 60a. He nevertheless questions the Rambam's decision here, based on the Rambam's own words in Hilchot Sh'chenim 11:1-2.The Kessef Mishneh resolves this difficulty, explaining that in Hilchot Sh'chenim, the Rambam mentions a situation in which a person winnows grain in his own domain, but the wind carries the chaff outside his domain. There, even though an ordinary wind is involved, the person is not held liable. This appears to contradict the ruling here. Nevertheless, as the Rambam himself states in Hilchot Sh'chenim, had it not been for the wind, the chaff would never have caused damaged. In this instance, the person's fanning of the fire would have caused it to spread sufficiently to cause damage.</i> And whenever a person's [actions] cause damage, he is liable to pay for the full amount of the damages from the choicest property he owns, as if the damage was inflicted directly.
When a fire spread and consumed wood, stone or earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"> Wood is consumed entirely by fire. Stone and earth are not consumed entirely. Nevertheless, a fire might cause them to deteriorate until they are no longer useful (or as useful as they had been). The liability for both these types of substances is alluded to in the verse the Rambam cites: Thorns are consumed entirely by flames (as are standing and bound grain, which the verse also mentions). Why does the verse also mention a field (for the liability for standing grain is mentioned explicitly)? To teach that even when the field is lying fallow, but its value deteriorates because it is charred, the person is held liable. See Bava Kama 60a.</i> [the person who kindled the fire] is obligated to make restitution, as it is written: "[When a fire] spreads through thorns [and consumes...] a field." [The following rules apply when] a fire consumes a grain heap or the like and there were utensils hidden in the grain heap. If [the utensils include] a thresher, a yoke for cattle or other articles that it is likely for farmers to hide in their grain heaps, [the person who kindled the fire] is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> Since it is the ordinary practice for such articles to be hidden in a grain heap, the person who kindled the fire should have considered this possibility. Therefore, he is liable for their destruction.</i> If [the utensils include] clothes, glassware and the like, he is not liable for the damage to the utensils.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"> Since it is abnormal for such articles to be hidden in a grain heap, the person who kindled the fire is not held liable. As stated in the notes on the following halachah, the place taken by the utensils is considered as if filled with grain, and restitution for that must be made.</i>
When does the above apply? When a person kindles a fire in a field belonging to a colleague.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"> As in Halachah 1, since he kindled a fire in another person's domain without permission, stricter rules apply.</i> If, however, he kindles the fire in his own [domain] and it spreads to a colleague's field, he is not liable for utensils hidden in a grain heap.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"> Bava Kama 60a derives this law from the above verse, which mentions standing grain. It comments: Just as standing grain is openly revealed, so too, a person is liable only for entities that are openly revealed. Note the Tur and Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat418:13), which state that this applies in an instance where the fire would have been stopped by a wall, the wall fell for reasons not dependent on the fire, and the person had the opportunity to repair the wall. Although he is liable for the grain heap, he is not liable for the articles hidden in it. The rationale is: If the fire were large enough to spread by itself, the person would be liable. If its spread was caused by factors not dependent on the person who kindled the fire - e.g., an abnormal wind - he is also not liable for the grain heap.</i> He must, however, compensate [the owner] as if the space taken by the utensils had been filled with wheat or with barley.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., if the utensils took up a cubic foot of space, the person who kindled the fire must pay for a cubic foot of grain. This also applies with regard to a person who burns clothes or glassware hidden in a grain heap, as mentioned in the previous halachah.</i>
A person who kindles a fire in a field belonging to a colleague is also liable [in the following instance]. The fire spread and consumed a kid that was tied to the grain heap or a servant near the grain heap.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"> The Rambam's words are based on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 6:7).The Maggid Mishneh states that the intent is that the person is liable only for the kid. Since the kid is tied, it cannot flee. He is not liable for the servant, because the servant is mentally competent and should have fled.</i> For this is also the ordinary practice near a grain heap. If, however, the servant was tied [to the grain heap], or the goat was near the grain heap, [the person who kindled the fire is not liable].<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"> He is not held liable financially for the death of the servant, because he is considered to have murdered him, and is liable for capital punishment for his death. Therefore, we follow the principle that a person who is liable for capital punishment (even when that sentence cannot be administered) is free of liability for monetaryloss. There is a question if he is liable for the loss of the kid in this instance even when a servant is not killed.. Some explain that he is not liable, because the kid should have fled. Others explain that a kid is not of sufficient mental competence to know whether or not to flee (Maggid Mishneh). Significantly, these laws are not mentioned by the Tur and the Shulchan Aruch.</i>
When a person lends a colleague space to make a grain heap, the colleague makes that grain heap and hides utensils in it, and then the person who lent him the space burns the grain heap, [the person who kindled the fire] is liable to pay [his colleague] only for the grain heap.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"> For he gave him permission to store grain in his domain, not utensils.</i> If he lent him space to make a heap of wheat and he made a heap of barley,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"> Wheat is more valuable than barley. Nevertheless, since in actuality it was barley that was burned, the person who kindled the fire is liable only for the barley.</i> or he lent him space to make a heap of barley and he made a heap of wheat,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"> In this instance, he is liable to pay him only for barley, because that is what he gave him permission to store.</i> or he made a heap of wheat and covered it with barley,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"> This applies even if he was granted permission to make a heap of wheat. Since the person who kindled the fire saw only barley, he is liable only for that (Sefer Me'irat Einayim 418:20).</i> or he made a heap of barley and covered it with wheat,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"> If he gave him permission to make a heap of barley, he is liable to pay him only for the barley. If he gave him permission to make a heap of wheat, he is liable to pay the value of the wheat that was actually burned, and the value of remainder of the barley (Sefer Me'irat Einayim 418:21).</i> [the person who kindled the fire] is not liable to pay any more than the value of a heap of barley.
When a person sets fire to a home belonging to a colleague, he must compensate for everything it contains,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., all the personal goods the person claims.</i> for it is the ordinary practice for people to keep all their utensils and possessions in their homes. The person whose house [was burned] is entitled to collect everything he claims,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"> Note the gloss of the Maggid Mishneh, which states that when it is supported by an oath, the claim of the house owner is accepted, not only when the person who kindled the fire is uncertain about the value of the articles in the home he destroyed, but even when he claims to be certain that they were not worth the money the house owner demands.</i> provided he takes an oath while holding a [sacred] article.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"> A Torah scroll (Hilchot Sh'vuot 11:8). In certain circumstances, tefillin are substituted for a Torah scroll (Ibid.:12).</i> This oath is a Rabbinic institution, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hilchot Chovel UMazik 7:17; Hilchot To'en V'Nit'an1:2.

[The following rules apply when] a camel that is loaded with flax passes through the public domain, the flax that enters the shop<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"> In that era, retail outlets were usually stalls in the public domain, rather than enclosed edifices. The flax protruded into the stall, where it caught fire from the shopkeeper's oil lamp.</i> is ignited by the lamp belonging to the shopkeeper and then sets fire to the entire building.

Nevertheless, even when he does keep his animal moving, since he caused the fire to start, he is liable for all the damages.</i> If the shopkeeper had placed his lamp outside, the shopkeeper is liable and must reimburse the camel driver even for the flax that burned, because he placed his lamp outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"> This is considered an act of negligence on the part of the shopkeeper.

[The following rule applies when] a person bends standing grain belonging to a colleague toward a fire until it ignites. If the fire would not reach the grain unless it was spread by an uncommon wind, [the person who bent the grain] is not held liable by a mortal court.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"> In and of themselves, the actions of the person who bent the grain were not sufficient to cause the fire to reach the grain; the influence of the wind was also necessary.

When a fire spreads and harms a human being and injures him, the person who kindled the fire is liable for the damages, unemployment benefits, medical costs, pain and embarrassment suffered by the injured party,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hilchot Chovel UMazik, ch. 1, for a detailed explanation of these five categories of compensation.</i> as if he had personally injured him. Although fire is one of a person's possessions, it is as if he caused him damage with his arrows.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"> This is the subject of a difference of opinion among our Sages (Bava Kama 22a). Rabbi Yochanan maintains, as the Rambam rules, that kindling a fire is regarded like shooting an arrow. Resh Lakish differs and maintains that a fire is regarded no differently from a person's cistern or his animals. To explain Rabbi Yochanan's opinion: When a person shoots an arrow, he is considered to have caused damage with his person although the damage took place far from him. So too, when he kindles a fire, despite the fact that the damage occurs in a distant place, it is as if he caused the damage with his person. Note the Maggid Mishneh, who points to an apparent contradiction in the Rambam's rulings. For Rabbi Yochanan does not free a person of liability for articles that are buried. It is, however, possible to explain that the Rambam does not accept Rabbi Yochanan's perspective blindly. He accepts it in this instance, but follows the other interpretations with regard to buried property.</i> If, by contrast, injury to a man is caused by a person's animal or cistern, he is liable for the damages alone, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"> Chapter 11, Halachah 6, and Chapter 13, Halachah 2.</i>
