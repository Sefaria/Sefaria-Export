Mishneh Torah, Levirate Marriage and Release



Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 216) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 598) include this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>In his <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i>, the Rambam explains that marriage of this nature was a custom carried out before the giving of the Torah (as reflected by Genesis 38:8 , and the Torah allowed this rite to be perpetuated. <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> explains that the closeness shared with the deceased by both his widow and his brother enjoins them to come together and produce a child who will perpetuate the deceased's memory and virtue. As <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> mentions, there are also profound mystic concepts associated with this mitzvah.</i> of Scriptural law for a man to marry the widow of his paternal<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is an exclusion. One should not perform this rite with the widow of one's maternal brother (<i>Yevamot</i> 17b; Halachah 7 below).</i> brother if he died without leaving children, as [Deuteronomy 25:5] states: "[And one of them dies] childless,... her husband's brother should cohabit with her." [This applies to a widow] from <i>nisu'in</i>, or from <i>erusin</i>.<br>[The childless widow is referred to as a <i>yevamah</i>; the rite through which they marry, <i>yibbum</i>.]<br>Scriptural law does not require a man to consecrate his <i>yevamah</i>, for she is his wife that heaven acquired for him. [All that is necessary] is that he cohabit with her. Her deceased husband's estate is responsible for her marriage contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 22:10-14.</i>
If the <i>yavam</i> does not want to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>, or if the woman does not consent,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam's conception, the woman cannot be compelled to marry her brother-in-law against her will. See Chapter 2, Halachah 10 and notes.</i> he should [free her from this obligation through the rite of] <i>chalitzah</i>. [Only] afterwards is she permitted to marry another man.<br>It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 217) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 599) include this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> of Scriptural law for [a brother] to perform <i>chalitzah</i> for [the deceased's widow], if he does not want to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>, as [Deuteronomy 25:9] states: "She shall... remove his shoe."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The woman also participates - indeed she plays a more active role - in the rite of <i>chalitzah</i>. Nevertheless, the mitzvah is considered to be incumbent on the brother of the deceased, because the effect of this mitzvah is that he foregoes a right - the right to marry the woman - that belongs to him. Until he performs <i>chalitzah</i>, the woman is bonded to him, and through performing <i>chalitzah</i> he severs this connection. Therefore, the mitzvah is considered his.<br>Moreover, <i>chalitzah</i> is a means to dissolve the connection established by <i>kiddushin</i>. Since <i>kiddushin</i> are established by the man, <i>chalitzah</i> is also his initiative. See the <i>Kovetz</i> who questions whether the man is obligated to perform <i>chalitzah</i> or he merely has the opportunity of doing so.</i><br>The mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> takes precedence over the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The concluding mishnah of the first chapter of <i>Bechorot</i> states:<br>The mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> takes precedence over the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i>. [This applied] originally, when the participants [in the rite] intended to perform a mitzvah. In the present age, when they do not intend to perform a mitzvah, the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i> takes precedence over the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i>.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that the Mishnah follows the opinion of Abba Shaul, who maintains that the prohibition against marrying one's brother's wife is not removed entirely by the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i>. Instead, it is merely temporarily superseded. And therefore, if the couple have any intentions other than the fulfillment of the mitzvah, they transgress this prohibition. As such, rather than involve oneself in such a challenge, one should perform the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i>.<br>In that commentary, and in a subsequent responsum, the Rambam explains that the halachah follows the opinion of the Sages who differ with Abba Shaul. These Sages maintain that when a man dies childless, the prohibition against his brother's marrying his wife is lifted entirely. Even if the brother marries the widow because of her looks, or because of her money, there is no prohibition involved. For that reason, the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> takes precedence.<br>The Ashkenazic community, following the rulings of Rabbenu Tam and the authorities who succeeded him, do not accept this ruling and follow Abba Shaul's opinion. Accordingly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 165:1) quotes the Rambam's view, while the Ramah states that <i>chalitzah</i> is preferable, and that a couple should not be allowed to perform <i>yibbum</i> unless the court is certain that their intent is solely to perform the mitzvah.<br>There is some discussion of the Rambam's intent by the commentaries, for his ruling in <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 10:16 implies a recognition of the importance of <i>chalitzah</i>. Nevertheless, the clarity of his statements in his Commentary on the Mishnah and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> makes it obvious that he follows the opinion of the Sages who differ with Abba Shaul. At present, even within the Sephardic community, the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i> is generally observed.<br>[Note also the opinion of the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 174:3, who states that even according to the Ashkenazic authorities, by Scriptural law <i>yibbum</i> takes precedence, and that the primacy given to <i>chalitzah</i> is a Rabbinic institution.]</i>
The Torah's words [Deuteronomy 25:5], "When one of them dies childless" [should not be interpreted narrowly].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word בן, translated as "son," can also mean "child" or "descendant." Hence, the ruling mentioned by the Rambam.</i> [When the deceased] has a son, a daughter, a descendant of a son, or a descendant of a daughter, as long as he has left progeny<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, a man fathered a child [or children], and he [they all] died in the father's lifetime, the man's wife is obligated to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>.</i> - whether from the woman [to whom he is presently married] or from another woman, his wife is free from the obligation of <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>.<br>Even if he has a descendant who is illegitimate or an idolater, [that descendant] frees [the deceased's] wife from the obligation of <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>.
[The above applies to children born from a Jewish woman.] If, however, [a deceased man] has a child born from a maidservant or a gentile woman, his wife is not free of these obligations. For the offspring of a maidservant are servants. And the offspring of a gentile woman are gentiles, and considered as if they have no connection to him.<br>[These concepts are derived as follows:] With regard to a maidservant, [Exodus 21:4] states: "The woman and her children will belong to her master," teaching that her offspring have the same status as she.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Regardless of who the father is.</i> And with regard to a gentile woman, [Deuteronomy 7:4] states: "They will lead your son away from Me" - i.e., prevent him from being considered part of the congregation.<br>Even when a man's son born from a maidservant is freed, or his son born from a gentile woman converts, he is regarded in the same way as other converts or freed slaves and does not cause [the deceased's] wife to be freed [from the obligation of <i>yibbum</i>]. [Even when a man] fathered a son with a maidservant, freed the son and the mother, and married her - if he dies without fathering any other children, his wife should perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i> with his brother, although the son [whom the deceased] fathered is alive and has been freed.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 10:19.</i>
[The following rules apply when a man] dies and leaves his wife pregnant: If she miscarries after he dies, his wife [is obligated to] perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>. If she bore the child, and the fetus emerged into the world alive, the mother is free of the obligation to perform the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>. This applies even when the child dies immediately after being born.<br>According to Rabbinic decree, however, [this does not apply] unless it is known that the child was carried for a full term pregnancy and was born after nine full months had passed.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 156:4) states that these laws apply as long as we know that the pregnancy lasted into the ninth month.</i> If, however, the term of the pregnancy is unknown [the following rules apply]: If the child lives 30 days, the child is considered viable, and he frees his father's wives from the obligation of <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>.<br>If the child dies within 30 days [of his birth], even on the thirtieth day, there is a doubt whether the child is viable or non-viable. This applies regardless of [the cause of the infant's death], whether he died as a result of illness, fell from a roof or was eaten by a lion. According to Rabbinic law, [the deceased's wives] must perform the rite of <i>chalitzah</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>ibid.</i>) rules that even if a fetus is stillborn, these laws still apply.</i> they may not perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For according to Scriptural law, there is no obligation for <i>yibbum</i>, and the prohibition against relations with her husband's brother remains in force.</i>
Whenever a man has a brother, even if the brother is illegitimate or an idolater, whether he is above the age of majority or below the age of majority,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In such an instance, the brother may not perform the rites of <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> until he comes of age, as is explained below.</i> as long as his head and the majority [of his body]<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Gur Aryeh</i> notes that <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 10:6 appears to imply that the emergence of an infant's forehead alone is sufficient for it to be considered having been "born." Hence, he interprets the Rambam's words as meaning either the forehead or the majority of the body.</i> emerged into the world before his brother's death,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the brother is not born until after the man's death, the deceased's wife is not obligated to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>, as explained in Chapter 6, Halachah 16.</i> his existence causes [his brother's wife] to be obligated to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, the woman should not marry the illegitimate man or the idolater. Instead, she should seek to be freed from her obligation through <i>chalitzah</i>.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 157:4) and the Ramah mention the possibility of leniency, if the deceased's brother was an apostate at the time the deceased married his wife.</i><br>If [the deceased] had a brother who was born to a maidservant or to a gentile woman, he is not considered to be his brother in any [halachic] context. [His existence] does not cause [his brother's wife] to be obligated to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>. Even when [the brother] was born as a member of the Jewish people,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the maidservant was freed, or the gentile woman was converted, before the baby was born.</i> since his mother was not Jewish when he was conceived, he is not considered to be [the deceased's] brother.
Maternal brothers are considered to be brothers only with regard to the laws of mourning<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Aveilut</i> 2:1.</i> and the laws of witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 13:1.</i><br>With regard to the laws of inheritance,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 1:6.</i> and the laws of <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i>, [maternal brothers] are considered as if they did not exist. For fraternity is derived from the father alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 17b derives this concept from Genesis 42:13: "We are twelve brothers, the son of one father."</i>
There is no concept of fraternity among converts and freed slaves. [Thus, even two converts or two freed slaves born from the same father] are considered unrelated.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">And therefore, one is not obligated to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i> if his brother dies childless.</i> Even if one of them was conceived before his parents were converted and born after they were converted, and the other was conceived and born after the parents were converted, they are not considered to have any family connection.<br>Even if they are twins who were born after their parents were converted, they are not considered to be brothers<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling applies with regard to the laws of <i>yibbum</i>. With regard to the laws of forbidden relationships, by contrast, in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> the Rambam rules that if one twin has relations with the other's wife, he is liable for transgressing the prohibition against relations with his brother's wife.</i> unless they were also conceived after their parents converted.
When a man who has many wives dies, [a brother who] engages in relations or performes the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> with one of them frees the others from all obligations. [The deceased's brother] may not marry two [of the deceased's wives], as [implied by Deuteronomy 25:9]: "...who did not build his brother's house." [This is interpreted as an exclusion:] he may build one house, but not two houses.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected in Halachah 12, there is a prohibition involved.</i><br>Similarly, if [the deceased had many brothers, one of them should perform either the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i> with one of the widows. This frees the others of all obligations.
[The following rules apply if] the widows include some who are fit to marry into the priesthood, and some who are not fit to marry into the priesthood: If [the brother] desires to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>, he may choose any of the widows that he desires. If he desires to perform the rite of <i>chalitzah</i>, he should perform this rite with one of the wives who is already forbidden to the priesthood, so that he will not disqualify one of the women who may marry into the priesthood through the rite of <i>chalitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages forbade a priest from marrying a woman who performed the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:7). Since it makes no difference to the brother with which widow he performs the rite of <i>chalitzah</i>, our Sages counsel that it be performed in a manner that does not damage a woman's future possibilities. See <i>Yevamot</i> 44a.<br>A court should enforce the application of this law (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 161:2).</i>
[The following rules apply if] many [of a man's] brothers die and he [becomes obligated to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>] to [all] their wives: If it is possible for him to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i> with all of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if he is capable of meeting the responsibilities a husband has - providing for his wife's livelihood, her clothing and her conjugal rights.</i> he should. If not, he may perform <i>chalitzah</i> with all of them, or perform <i>chalitzah</i> with whomever he desires, or perform <i>yibbum</i> with whomever he desires, [choosing one of the widows] from each [of his deceased brother's] households.
When [a <i>yavam</i>] marries a <i>yevamah</i>, all the other widows from that household become forbidden to him and to his other brothers. If he or his other brothers have relations with one of the other widows, they transgress a positive commandment, for [Deuteronomy 25:9] states: "Her <i>yavam</i> will engage in relations with her." [This is interpreted to mean:] With her, and not with another woman from that household. A prohibition stemming from a positive commandment is considered to be a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">A person who transgresses a positive commandment is not liable to receive the forty lashes given when a negative commandment of the Torah is violated. Hence, the Rambam clarifies that although a prohibition is involved, it is a prohibition stemming from a positive commandment, and not one stemming from a negative commandment.</i><br>Similarly, when [one of the brothers] performs <i>chalitzah</i> with his <i>yevamah</i>, the woman with whom <i>chalitzah</i> was performed and all the other widows from that household become forbidden to [the brother who] performed <i>chalitzah</i> and to the other brothers. They are all forbidden to the brothers by Rabbinic decree,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramban (Nachmonides, <i>Hasagot L'Sefer HaMitzvot, Hosafot</i> Negative Commandment 14) differs and maintains that the violation of a Scriptural prohibition is involved. The difference between their opinions stems from their interpretation of <i>Yevamot</i> 10b.<br>That passage interprets Deuteronomy 25:9: "... who did not build his brother's house," as implying a prohibition. "Once he did not build it, he no longer has the right to build it." The Ramban follows the authorities who maintain that this is a Scriptural prohibition, while the Rambam (based on <i>Yevamot</i> 40b) maintains that the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin, and the reference to the verse is merely an <i>asmachta</i>, a support.</i> sharing the status of <i>sh'niyot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, "prohibitions of a second degree," relatives with whom relations are permitted by Scriptural law, but forbidden by Rabbinic decree. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:6.</i> [This is the only prohibition involved,] for since their brother died childless, the severe prohibition against sexual relations (<i>issur ervah</i>) is removed. Therefore, [if one of the brothers consecrates such a woman,] the consecration is binding, as it would be if he consecrated one of the <i>sh'niyot</i>.
When a person performs the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> with his <i>yevamah</i>, not only does she become forbidden to him, but her relatives<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to seven women who are included in the category of <i>arayot</i> and with whom sexual relations are forbidden, as mentioned in Leviticus, Chapter 18, and <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 2:7,9. They include her mother, both her maternal and paternal grandmothers, her daughter, the daughter of her son, the daughter of her daughter and her sister.</i> - e.g., her mother and her daughter - also become forbidden. Similarly, she is forbidden to marry his son and his brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even a brother who was not born during the lifetime of the widow's husband.</i> Even the <i>sh'niyot</i> - e.g., her daughter's granddaughter - related to her are forbidden to him, and she is forbidden to his son's grandson. To summarize: Her status is like that of a divorced wife.<br>Similarly, if his <i>yevamah</i> dies while she is still under obligation to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., before she performs either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>.</i> he is forbidden to marry these relatives of hers, as if she were his wife and she died in his lifetime.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">He is, however, permitted to marry the woman's sister, just as he is allowed to marry his wife's sister after her death.</i> All these prohibitions are of Rabbinic origin.<br>[If the deceased had two wives, his brother] may marry the sister of the wife with whom he did not perform the rite of <i>chalitzah</i>, or any other of her relatives.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Although the woman herself is forbidden, as stated in the previous halachah, her relatives are permitted.</i>
It is forbidden for a man to marry a close relative of a woman with whom he is obligated to perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> - e.g., her mother or her daughter - until one of his brothers performs <i>yibbum</i> with the woman who is obligated, or performs <i>chalitzah</i> with her to free her of her obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 8.</i><br>Afterwards, [the other brother] may marry the woman's mother, daughter, or any of her other relatives, despite the fact that these relatives are all forbidden to the brother who performed either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>, as explained [in the previous halachah].
When a man marries his <i>yevamah</i> and then divorces her, he may remarry her if he so desires. She is considered to be his wife with regard to all matters. There remains no trace of the prohibition [that existed when she was] his brother's [wife], neither from Scriptural law nor from Rabbinic law.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not say that he has already fulfilled the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i>, and now the woman's status reverts to the prohibition under which she was previously forbidden. See <i>Yevamot</i> 39a.</i>
As explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 11, Halachah 3.</i> the sexual relations in which a boy of nine years and one day engages are halachically significant. This is a law received through the Oral Tradition.<br>Accordingly, when a <i>yavam</i> who is below the age of majority, but over the age of nine, engages in sexual relations with his <i>yevamah</i>, he should maintain [his bond with her].<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., none of the other brothers should marry her instead. See Chapter 5, Halachot 18-19.</i> He may not, however, perform the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> until he attains the age of majority and is inspected [for signs of physical maturity].<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Two pubic hairs, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:10.</i> For with regard to <i>chalitzah</i>, the term <i>ish</i> ("man") is specifically mentioned in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 25:7 states: "If the man does not desire...."</i><br>If [a <i>yavam</i>] is below this age, sexual relations in which he engages are of no halachic significance. [Moreover,] even the sexual relations in which a nine-year-old engages do not acquire [the <i>yevamah</i> for him in a manner that is] binding [entirely].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Rather, these sexual relations are considered to be equivalent to a <i>ma'amar</i>, the status of which is discussed in Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> Therefore, his <i>yevamah</i> is not permitted to marry another man until he engages in relations with her after he attains majority [and divorces her], or performs the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> [at that age], as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 21, where this situation is described in detail.</i>
Similarly, with regard to a <i>yevamah</i> who is below the age of majority: If her <i>yavam</i> desires to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i> with her, he may.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 119a explains that there is a certain dimension of leniency implied by this ruling. Since the woman is below the age of majority, it is possible that as she grows older she will manifest signs of being an <i>aylonit</i>, a woman who lacks female sexual characteristics (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:3,6). If that were to be the case, then the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> would not apply to such a woman, as stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 8, and relations with her would still be forbidden. Nevertheless, since the overwhelming probability is that a woman will not be an <i>aylonit</i>, our Sages did not impose any restrictions.</i> He may not, however, perform the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> with her until she attains the age of majority and is inspected [for physical signs of maturity]. Even if she engaged in sexual relations after she became twelve years old,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Rav David Arameah interprets this to be referring to engaging in relations with her previous husband before her death. Although with regard to her husband, we assume that she has manifested signs of physical maturity, as stated in <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 11:5, with regard to the laws of <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i> an inspection is required. Note an alternative explanation offered by the <i>Or Sameach</i>.</i> she may not perform the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> until she undergoes an inspection and manifests signs of physical maturity.
Just as a <i>yavam</i> may not perform <i>chalitzah</i> until he attains manhood, so too, a <i>yevamah</i> may not perform <i>chalitzah</i> until she attains womanhood.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6, Halachah 6.</i><br>When a <i>yavam</i> who is below the age of majority engages in sexual relations with a <i>yevamah</i> who is also below the age of majority, they should grow up together.
As all other women,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 11:18, which prohibits a widow or a divorcee from remarrying within 90 days of her husband's death or their divorce, to preclude the possibility of questions arising concerning who is the father of her child.</i> a <i>yevamah</i> should not perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> until she waits a 90-day interval. [These 90 days] do not include the day of her previous husband's death or the day of <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>.<br>Why may she not perform <i>chalitzah</i> within these 90 days?<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For performing <i>chalitzah</i> will not prevent the determination of a child's father.</i> Because she is not fit to perform <i>yibbum</i> [at that time]. [Deuteronomy 25:7-9] states: "And if the man does not desire to take his <i>yevamah</i>,... she should remove his shoe" [establishing an equivalence between these two rites]. [Thus,] when she is fit to perform <i>yibbum</i>, she is fit to perform <i>chalitzah</i>. And when she is not fit to perform <i>yibbum</i>, she is not fit to perform <i>chalitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The converse of this principle - that one who does not perform <i>chalitzah</i> (e.g., a king) does not perform <i>yibbum</i> - also applies. See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 2:1 and <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 2:3).</i><br>Should [a brother] perform <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> with her within these three months, since she is not pregnant, she has discharged her obligation and need not perform any further activity.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 164:1) differs and maintains that such a woman requires <i>chalitzah</i> from her deceased husband's other brothers after the three months have passed. See also <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 164:4.</i>
[The following rules apply when a brother] performs <i>chalitzah</i> with his <i>yevamah</i>, and afterwards it is discovered that she is pregnant: If she gives birth and the child is viable, it is considered as if she had never performed <i>chalitzah</i>. She is permitted to [marry into the] priesthood, and [the brother who performed <i>chalitzah</i> with her] is permitted [to marry] her relatives.<br>If the woman miscarries, or if the child who is born does not live for 30 days after being born, this - or another - brother<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 164:2) states that the <i>chalitzah</i> should be performed by another brother, and not by the brother who had originally performed <i>chalitzah</i> with her.</i> should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her again. For <i>chalitzah</i> performed with a pregnant woman is not considered <i>chalitzah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 26.<br>The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 164:5 quotes the view of <i>Tosafot</i>, who maintain that, according to Rabbinic law, performing <i>chalitzah</i> while pregnant disqualifies a woman from marrying into the priesthood and prevents her from performing <i>yibbum</i> if she miscarries.</i> nor are relations with a pregnant woman considered <i>yibbum</i>.
Therefore, when [a man] marries or performs <i>chalitzah</i> with his <i>yevamah</i> who is pregnant, another woman who was married to the deceased husband should not remarry until this woman gives birth. For a child does not remove [the obligation of <i>yibbum</i>] until it emerges into the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">And the <i>yibbum</i> or the <i>chalitzah</i> performed by the woman is of no consequence whatsoever.</i>

Chapter 2

It is a Rabbinic ordinance that a <i>yavam</i> should not enter into marital relations with his <i>yevamah</i> until he consecrates her in the presence of two witnesses, with a <i>p'rutah</i> or an article worth a <i>p'rutah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>ma'amar</i> can also be effected with a <i>sh'tar</i>, a legal document (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>From <i>Yevamot</i> 52a it would appear that this practice was instituted as an expression of modesty. Just as with regard to marriage, although it is acceptable to consecrate a woman through sexual relations according to Scriptural law, our Rabbis ordered a ban of ostracism to be placed on a person who does so; so too, with regard to <i>yibbum</i>, they required that the man designate the woman as his wife before entering into marital relations with her.</i> This [act] is called a <i>ma'amar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ma'amar</i> means "statement." The <i>Tosefot Yom Tov</i> explains that the term was chosen because the <i>yavam</i> must make a statement of intent. Rav Kapach offers an alternative interpretation, citing Deuteronomy 26:17,18, which uses the root אמר to mean "designate," or "declare allegiance to."</i><br>A <i>ma'amar</i> does not complete the acquisition of a <i>yevamah</i>, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachot 2-3.<br>The standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> continues "as does sexual relations." Nevertheless, authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> do not contain this addition. Based on that version, Rav Kapach explains that the comparison may be, not to sexual relations with a <i>yevamah</i>, but rather to the effectiveness of the transfer of money in ordinary <i>kiddushin</i>.</i><br>When [a <i>yavam</i>] performs a <i>ma'amar</i> with his <i>yevamah</i> without her knowledge, his deed is of no consequence. For a woman can be consecrated only willingly.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:1.</i> When a minor is widowed after being merely consecrated,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">If the minor's marriage is consummated, she leaves her father's authority and acts independently. As long as she is merely consecrated, however, she is under her father's authority. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:11-12.</i> a <i>ma'amar</i> can be performed only with the consent of her father.
Just as [the <i>yavam</i>] must consecrate his <i>yevamah</i>, so too, he should recite the marriage blessings in the presence of ten men<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:3 for the text of these blessings. The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 166:2) states that the ceremony of <i>chuppah</i> should also be performed, and the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> adds that <i>Birkat Erusin</i> (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:23) should be recited.</i> and compose a <i>ketubah</i> ("marriage contract"), as is required of any man who marries a woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The text of the <i>ketubah</i> to be composed by the <i>yavam</i> appears in Chapter 4, Halachah 32.</i><br>When [a <i>yavam</i>] enters into marital relations with his <i>yevamah</i> without previously performing a <i>ma'amar</i> with her, he acquires her in a binding manner;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that he disobeyed our Sages' wishes does not cause his deed to lose its effectiveness.</i> he does not have to consecrate her after engaging in marital relations with her. He should be given stripes for rebellious conduct<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment given for disobeying a Rabbinic ordinance. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:21.</i> and should write a <i>ketubah</i> for her.
When [a <i>yavam</i>] engages in marital relations with his <i>yevamah</i>, he acquires her [as his wife]. [This applies] regardless of whether he entered into these relations unintentionally<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 166:9), which cites a minority opinion that differentiates between whether the <i>yevamah</i> had been married to her first husband or merely consecrated by him. In the latter instance, she must be consecrated a second time.</i> or with a licentious intent,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on Rashi's gloss, <i>Yevamot</i> 53b.</i> under duress or willingly, whether he acted with a licentious intent and she acted unintentionally or under duress, or she acted with a licentious intent and he acted unintentionally or under duress, whether she was asleep<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Although it is improper for a husband to engage in relations with his wife when she is asleep, this does not negate the effectiveness of the <i>yavam's</i> act.</i> or awake, whether he performed vaginal or anal intercourse,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The purpose of <i>yibbum</i> is to "perpetuate the name of his brother" (Deuteronomy 25:7  - i.e., to conceive progeny. Although this objective cannot be achieved through anal intercourse, it is still an effective means of acquisition. Since both the man and the woman are capable of conceiving children, the fact that they cannot accomplish that through this sexual act does not detract from its effectiveness (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 166:6).</i> whether he inserted merely the head of his penis or the entire organ.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 1:10.</i>
When does the above apply? When [the <i>yavam</i>] intends to perform a sexual act. If, however, he fell from the roof [with an erection] and [accidentally] inserted his organ into his <i>yevamah</i>, had relations with her when he was so intoxicated that he was not conscious of anything,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Or Sameach</i>, who questions this ruling based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yevamot</i> 6:1, quoted by the Rambam in Chapter 6, Halachah 3), which states that when a mentally incompetent person performs <i>yibbum</i>, his act is binding. The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that a mentally incompetent person may have the intent to engage in sexual relations. In this instance, however, the person has lost control of his faculties to the extent that he has no intent whatsoever.</i> or when he was asleep, he does not acquire her [as his wife].<br>If he intended to masturbate in a hole in the wall and unintentionally inserted his organ into his <i>yevamah</i>, he does not acquire her [as his wife].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For masturbation is not considered to be sexual relations.</i> If he intended to sodomize an animal and unintentionally inserted his organ into his <i>yevamah</i>, he does acquire her [as his wife].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For sodomy is considered to be a forbidden form of relations.</i>
[The following rules apply when a <i>yavam</i> takes] his <i>yevamah</i> [home to] perform <i>yibbum</i>, and within 30 days she claims that they did not engage in sexual relations. [The <i>yavam</i>] claims that they did engage in relations and then divorces her. Since he already took the initiative and divorced her, we compel him to perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is within 30 days, we accept the possibility that the <i>yavam</i> did not engage in relations with her, and compel him to perform <i>chalitzah</i> so the <i>yevamah</i> can remarry another man (<i>Yevamot</i> 111b).</i><br>If he did not divorce her, we compel him to engage in relations with her,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">And remain married to her.</i> or to perform <i>chalitzah</i> and also to divorce her, giving her a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Since he brought her home as his wife, even if he agrees that they did not engage in relations, he is required to divorce her, because it is likely that they did engage in relations (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 167:6). Nevertheless, since she claims that they did not, and there is plausibility to her claim, he is also required to perform <i>chalitzah</i>.</i><br>If he divorced her after thirty days had passed, and she claims that they did not engage in sexual relations, we request that he perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">After a couple have lived together for thirty days, we assume that they have engaged in relations, for a man will not restrain himself any longer. Hence, the man cannot be compelled to perform <i>chalitzah</i> (<i>Yevamot, ibid.</i>). Nevertheless, we ask him to perform this rite, for otherwise the woman will not be permitted to remarry.</i> If, however, he admits that he had not entered into relations with her, we compel him to perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">He has nothing to lose in this concern, for since he divorced her without entering into relations with her, he is no longer permitted to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i>. Therefore, he should fulfill the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i> so that she can remarry.</i><br>If she claims that they engaged in sexual relations, and he denies engaging in relations, she is not required to engage in <i>chalitzah</i>, for his word is not accepted [when he desires] to cause her to be forbidden to all other men, once he brings her to his home as his wife.
When a man dies [childless], and he is survived by many brothers, the mitzvah is incumbent on the eldest brother to perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>, as [implied by Deuteronomy 25:6]: "The firstborn son whom she bears [will perpetuate the name of the deceased brother]." The Oral Tradition interprets the verse as referring to the eldest of the surviving brothers, causing the verse to be rendered: "The eldest brother will perpetuate the name of the deceased brother." The subject of the phrase "whom she bears" is the mother of the brothers and not the <i>yevamah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">According to the simple meaning of the verse, the subject is - as reflected in our translation - the <i>yevamah</i>. Nevertheless, in a halachic context, it is possible for one verse to have several interpretations. Accordingly, <i>Yevamot</i> 2:8 (see the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah) interprets this verse to be referring to the deceased's mother. (See also <i>Yevamot</i> 24a, quoted in Chapter 6, Halachah 8, which considers the <i>yevamah</i> the subject of the phrase in a different halachic context.)</i>
If the eldest brother does not desire to perform <i>yibbum</i>, all the other brothers are given that option.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 12.</i> If they also do not desire, we return to the eldest brother and tell him: "The mitzvah is incumbent on you. Perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>." We do not compel the <i>yavam</i> to perform <i>yibbum</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam maintains that the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> takes priority over the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i>, we cannot compel a man to wed a woman with whom he does not desire to live.</i> we do, however, compel him to perform <i>chalitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For until this mitzvah is performed, the <i>yevamah</i> may not remarry.</i>
If the eldest brother says: "Give me a respite until [a brother] who is a minor attains majority," "... until [a brother] who is on a journey returns," or "... until [a brother] who has [temporarily] lost his powers of speech and hearing recovers; if he refuses, I will perform <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>" - his request is not accepted. He is told: "The mitzvah is incumbent on you. Perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the <i>yevamah</i> should not be subjected to an unnecessary delay, if possible.</i>
Similarly, if the eldest brother is in another country,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">When stating this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 161:5) uses the expression "an overseas country." The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 161:6 cites the expression used by the Rambam and explains that it refers to a country in which a different language is spoken, even if it is relatively close. He cites a ruling of Mahari Mintz, which states that if the eldest brother is in another city, and the <i>yevamah</i> does not have the funds to pay for travel there, the younger brother can be compelled to perform the mitzvah. (<i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes that the Rambam often uses the word <i>medinah</i> to mean metropolis. He questions whether that is the Rambam's intent here.)</i> [the obligation is transferred to his younger brother]. The younger brother does not have the option of saying: "The mitzvah is incumbent on my older brother. Wait until he comes." Instead, we tell the brother that is present: "Perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, the intent is not to subject the <i>yevamah</i> to an unnecessary delay.</i>
The laws pertaining to a <i>yevamah</i> who is fit to perform <i>yibbum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there is no halachic reason preventing her from doing so.</i> and refuses to do so are the same as those governing a woman who rebels against her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 14:8, which states that a woman who refuses to engage in marital relations because she is repelled by her husband, should be divorced by her husband, because "she is not like a captive, [to be forced] to engage in relations with someone she loathes." She does, however, forfeit the money due her by virtue of her marriage contract and any presents that her husband gave her. As mentioned in the notes on <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 77:2) follows a different perspective with regard to this ruling.<br>There is also a difference of opinion among the authorities whether a woman who refuses to engage in <i>yibbum</i> is considered to have "rebelled." As mentioned in the notes on Chapter 1, Halachah 2, the Ashkenazic authorities maintain that the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i> takes precedence over the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i>. Therefore, they maintain that a woman has the right to refuse to engage in <i>yibbum</i>, and she is not judged to have "rebelled" for this reason.</i> We compel her <i>yavam</i> to perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 77:2) differs with the Rambam and maintains that a husband should not be compelled to divorce a woman who "rebels." According to that perspective, a <i>yavam</i> should also not be compelled to perform <i>chalitzah</i>.<br>According to the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 165:1), who favors <i>chalitzah</i>, when a <i>yavam</i> desires to perform <i>yibbum</i> and the <i>yevamah</i> refuses, the <i>yavam</i> cannot be compelled by force to perform <i>chalitzah</i>. He should, however, be convinced to do so. Note the gloss of the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 165:1, which discusses this ruling in detail.<br>All authorities agree that if the <i>yavam</i> is one of the individuals considered unfit to marry (see Halachah 14), he should be compelled to perform <i>chalitzah</i>.</i> and she forfeits [the money due her by virtue of her] marriage contract.<br>When the deceased is survived by many wives, the one that the <i>yavam</i> asks to perform <i>yibbum</i> and refuses is considered to have "rebelled." He should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her, and she forfeits [the money due her by virtue of her] marriage contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if one of the other women would be willing to marry the <i>yavam</i>; the choice is his and not hers.</i> The other wives who were not asked [to perform <i>yibbum</i>] receive [the money due them by virtue of their] marriage contracts, as other widows do.
If [the deceased was survived by] many [brothers], and the eldest brother states that he wants to perform <i>yibbum</i> with [one of the deceased's wives], [she is under obligation to him].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the woman must either consent to <i>yibbum</i> or be considered to have "rebelled."</i> Even if she does not desire [to marry] him, but is willing to marry one of his brothers, her desire is not considered. For the mitzvah is that the eldest brother perform <i>yibbum</i>.
[The following rules apply when] the eldest brother says: "I do not want to perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>. Behold, my brother is present." If one of the brothers asks her to perform <i>yibbum</i>, and she does not desire [to marry] him, but she does desire [to marry] another brother, and he desires [to marry] her, she is not considered to have "rebelled." Once the eldest brother upon whom the mitzvah is incumbent demurs, all the brothers are equal.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and others differ with the Rambam on this point and maintain that if the eldest brother demurs, the prerogative is given to the brother who is next in the order of age. This perspective is followed by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 161:4).</i> Since she desires [to marry] one of [the brothers], and he desires [to marry] her, she is not considered to have "rebelled."<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the brother she desires to marry does not desire to marry her, she is considered to have "rebelled," as stated in the following halachah.</i><br>Moreover, if one of the brothers was in another country, and the woman says: "I would prefer to wait for him to come and perform <i>yibbum</i> with me. I do not want [to marry] this one," she is not considered to have "rebelled." [Since] the brother who asks [to marry her] is not the eldest, we tell him: "If you desire to perform <i>chalitzah</i> and pay her [the money due her by virtue of her] marriage contract, you may.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Although, according to the Rambam, the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> takes priority over the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i>, this is the case only when <i>yibbum</i> can be performed immediately. In this instance, this brother is not forced to wait until his other brother returns, for having the obligation to perform <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> is a detriment to a man, as stated in Halachah 16 (Rav David Arameah).</i> If not, she wants to wait until your brother comes. Since you do not have a prior claim, [she is granted that prerogative].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, the court makes an effort to have the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> performed as soon as possible, as reflected in Halachot 8 and 9. This, however, is a measure of consideration for the woman, so that she will not be forced to remain without a husband. In this instance, it is she who desires the delay. Hence, she is given that prerogative (<i>Or Sameach</i>).</i>
If the brother [whom the <i>yevamah</i> desired to marry] returned and did not desire [to marry] her, we turn again to the brother who desired to perform <i>yibbum</i>, but was not desired by the woman. We tell the woman: "There is no one who desires to perform <i>yibbum</i> with you except this one, and the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> is given priority. Either perform <i>yibbum</i> with this one, or leave without receiving [the money due because of your] marriage contract, as is the law with regard to all women who rebel."
Whenever the law is that a woman should perform <i>chalitzah</i> and not <i>yibbum</i>, as we have mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 5. (See also Chapter 3, Halachot 4, 13-14 and Chapter 6, Halachah 7.)</i> if she is entitled to receive [the money due her by virtue of] her marriage contract,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., her first husband or his estate would have had to pay her the money due her by virtue of her marriage contract.</i> she may collect that money in the same way as other widows.<br>Similarly, if the <i>yavam</i> was a leper or he has other blemishes [for which] men [are required to divorce],<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">He has constant bad breath or a smell coming from his nose, or he works as a copper miner, a tanner, or a collector of dog feces, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 25:11.</i> he must perform <i>chalitzah</i> for her, and she is entitled to receive [the money due her by virtue of] her marriage contract.<br>If a <i>yevamah</i> suffered blemishes while she was waiting for <i>yibbum</i>, it is the <i>yavam's</i> lack of fortune.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">A man is entitled to divorce his wife if he discovers that she possessed physical blemishes that mar her appeal before her marriage, and he is not required to pay her the money due her by virtue of her marriage contract, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 7:8, 25:2. Nevertheless, in this instance this law does not apply, because the connection between the <i>yavam</i> and the <i>yevamah</i> begins directly after her first husband's death.</i> If he does not desire to perform <i>yibbum</i>, he must perform <i>chalitzah</i> and give her [the money due her by virtue of] her marriage contract.
When, during her [first] husband's lifetime, a <i>yevamah</i> takes a vow prohibiting her from deriving benefit from her <i>yavam,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., she took a vow not to benefit from the <i>yavam</i> in her husband's lifetime for other reasons, without the explicit intent that she would free herself from obligation to him.</i> or from all Jews,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the woman took a vow not to benefit from any Jews.

If, however, he desires to remain married to the woman, he must write a marriage contract for her, for it is forbidden for a man to remain married to a woman without a marriage contract, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:10. The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 168:9) quotes this interpretation.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that this interpretation does not fit the Rambam's wording. In that light, the <i>Or Sameach</i> offers the following interpretation: The <i>yavam</i> is never obligated to write a marriage contract for the <i>yevamah</i>. Why did our Sages require a man to write a marriage contract for his wife? So that there would be a financial responsibility attached to divorce, and hence a husband would not consider it to be a light matter. In this instance, the <i>yavam</i> is held responsible for the additional amount that the husband added to the marriage contract. Hence, there is financial responsibility attached to divorce, and there is no imperative for a further obligation.</i> The laws regarding the <i>yavam's</i> obligation for the additional amount to be paid the woman are the same as those that applied with regard to her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:2-3, although her husband is not obligated for the fundamental requirement of the marriage contract, he is obligated for the additional amount that he promised her. This obligation is transferred to the <i>yavam</i>.</i><br>If, however, a husband did not write his wife a marriage contract, or she sold him or waived to him the rights to her marriage contract, the <i>yavam</i> is obligated to write a new marriage contract for her as he would be required for another widow.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>yavam</i> is not, however, obligated to write a marriage contract equivalent to the one that the woman's first husband gave her. It is sufficient that he write her a marriage contract for 100 <i>zuz</i>, as explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 22:14.</i>
Before the <i>yavam</i> performs <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> with the <i>yevamah</i>, she is forbidden to marry another man,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Both <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 357) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 596) include this as one of the Torah's 613 commandments.</i> as [Deuteronomy 25:5] states: "the wife of the deceased should not be allowed to [marry] an outsider."<br>If she marries another person,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if she married without knowing of the existence of the <i>yavam</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 159:2).</i> and they engage in sexual relations, they are both punished by lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the couple do not engage in relations, they are not punished with lashes.</i> and he must divorce her with a <i>get</i>.

If she was consecrated by another man, she does not become forbidden to her <i>yavam</i>. Instead, the man who consecrated her should divorce her, and her <i>yavam</i> may perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 159:1) states that this law applies even when the man consecrates her without knowing of the existence of the <i>yavam</i>. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 159:1 differs and cites the opinion of the Rashba and the Ramban, who maintain that in such an instance, if the <i>yavam</i> desires to perform <i>chalitzah</i>, the woman may remain married to her second husband.</i><br>If her <i>yavam</i> was a priest who is forbidden to marry a divorcee, she should be divorced by the man who consecrated her, so that the sinner should not benefit, and her <i>yavam</i> should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one might think that since the <i>yavam</i> cannot perform <i>yibbum</i> with her, she should be allowed to remain married to her second husband. If so, however, the man's transgression - marrying the <i>yevamah</i> - will have brought him benefit. Hence, he is required to divorce her (<i>Yevamot</i> 92b).</i>
If the man who consecrated [the <i>yevamah</i>] and then divorced her, marries her [after] her <i>yavam</i> performs <i>chalitzah</i> with her, they are not forced to separate.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that since the prohibition is merely a disciplinary measure, if the couple marry again they may remain married (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 159:1) states that if the second husband knew of the existence of the <i>yavam</i> and consecrated the woman anyway, he is forbidden to remain married to her, even if he remarried her after <i>chalitzah</i>.</i> If, by contrast, a man divorced [a <i>yevamah</i>] after being married to her and then remarried her again, the couple are forced to separate. For this resembles the case of a married woman who [thought that her husband had died and] remarried, who is forbidden to both her first and second husbands, as has been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 10:5,7).</i><br>A <i>yevamah</i> who engages in licentious sexual relations does not become forbidden to her <i>yavam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 159:3) states that she does, however, become forbidden to the man with whom she engaged in relations.

Chapter 3

When a man says: "This is my son," or "I have sons," his word is accepted,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this ruling is the principle of <i>migo</i>. If the husband's statements were untrue, and his intent were merely to free his wife from the obligation of <i>yibbum</i>, he would not have to lie. Instead, he could give her a <i>get</i> (<i>Bava Batra</i> 134b).<br>See also the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 156:6) and commentaries, which mention other opinions regarding whether this ruling applies when the prevailing presumption is that the man is childless, when the prevailing presumption is that he has brothers, or when witnesses testify that he has brothers.</i> and he frees his wife from [the obligation of] <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>.
When<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when the prevailing presumption is that he does not have a brother, and hence his wife would not be obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i>.</i> a man says: "This is my brother," or "I have brothers," his word is not accepted, and his wife does not become forbidden [to others because] she is required to perform <i>yibbum</i>. [We assume that] his intent was to cause his wife to be forbidden [to other men] after his death.
When the prevailing presumption is that [a man] has brothers and he says at the time of his death,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the statements are being made at the time of the person's death, when it is unlikely that he would lie, we still suspect that he is speaking falsely to spare his wife the difficulty of <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>.</i> "I do not have brothers," his word is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">One might assume that, as in Halachah 1, the husband's statements would have been accepted based on the principle of <i>migo</i>. For in this instance as well, the husband could free his wife from <i>yibbum</i> by giving her a <i>get</i>. Nevertheless, our Sages explain that the principle of <i>migo</i> does not have the power to counteract a prevailing presumption.<br>Still, even if the prevailing presumption is that a person has brothers, his word is accepted if he says that he has sons. The rationale is that, in this instance, his statements are not contradicting the prevailing presumption, but rather introducing a new factor (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 157:9).</i> Similarly, if he says that a person presumed to be his brother is not his brother, his word is not accepted.<br>If there was no prevailing presumption that he has brothers, but a rumor becomes circulated<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis whether or not this rumor has to be substantiated in a court. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets the Rambam's opinion as being that even a rumor that is not substantiated should be taken into consideration. Needless to say, in the contemporary era, when communications have advanced and travel is easier, this question is far less significant than in previous ages.</i> that there are witnesses who will testify that he has brothers, but these witnesses are overseas, the woman must take this factor into consideration and wait until the witnesses who were mentioned come, and are asked [concerning the matter]. [This ruling applies] even when the husband says, "I do not have a brother" at the time of his death.
[The following rules apply when] a man engaged in licentious relations with either a single woman or a married woman, she became pregnant, and he claims that he fathered the child. Even if [the mother] acknowledges his statements, and thus the son is considered his with regard to the laws of inheritance,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 4:1.</i> the matter is considered to be one of doubt with regard to the laws of <i>yibbum</i>. For just as the woman engaged in relations with him, she could have engaged in relations with another man.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If the woman is married, there is no question regarding the Rambam's ruling, for we presume that by and large, she engaged in relations with her husband. If she is single, the matter is more complex.<br>In this context, the commentaries draw attention to the Rambam's ruling in <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 8:14, which states that when a priest had relations with a woman and she became pregnant, she is allowed to partake of <i>terumah</i> for the sake of her child. This indicates that we assume that she was impregnated by that priest.<br>As indicated by the Rambam's wording in <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> and in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 15:17-18, the matter depends on the woman's reputation. If she is known to be promiscuous, we consider the possibility that she was impregnated by another man. If, however, everyone presumes that she engaged in relations only with this man, he is considered to be the father of the child (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 156:9) quotes the Rambam's wording without making this distinction. See the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 156:15.</i> How is it possible to know with certainty that this is his son? There is no prevailing presumption to that effect.<br>The matter thus remains one of doubt, and the more stringent perspective should be taken. Hence, his wife [is obligated to] perform <i>chalitzah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Lest the child have been fathered by another man, and the deceased in fact be childless.</i> and she [is forbidden] to perform <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Lest the child have been fathered by the deceased, in which case relations with his brother would be prohibited.</i>
The testimony of one witness is accepted with regard to the death of a woman's husband, and she may perform <i>yibbum</i> on this basis. [Similarly, such testimony is acceptable if he states that] her <i>yavam</i> died,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher differs with the Rambam regarding this matter and maintains that the testimony of one witness is not acceptable with regard to the death of a <i>yavam</i>. Although the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 158:3) quotes his opinion, many Ashkenazic authorities recommend leniency. (See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 158:2.)</i> or that her husband fathered a son,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and Rabbenu Asher differ with the Rambam with regard to this point, for unlike the death of a person, the birth of a child is not a matter that will surely become undeniable public knowledge. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 156:8) quotes the Rambam's opinion, while the Ramah follows the other view.</i> on which basis she would be granted permission to marry another person [without <i>chalitzah</i>].<br>Even the testimony of a servant or a woman, or statements of a gentile made in the midst of conversation are acceptable with regard to the death of a <i>yavam</i>, as they are acceptable with regard to a married woman whose husband has died, to enable her to be permitted to remarry, as mentioned in <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i>, Chapters 12 and 13, the Rambam explains that the testimony of one witness is accepted in such instances, because:<br>When the matter can be verified definitively without the testimony of a witness, and the witness cannot justify [his statements] if they are not true - e.g., when one testifies that a person died - the Torah did not necessitate [that the requirements of formal testimony be met in these instances]. For it is unlikely that a witness will testify falsely.<br>For this reason, our Sages [extended] the leniency with regard to this matter and accepted the testimony of a single witness that is based on the testimony of a maidservant, [testimony] from a written document, and [testimony] that was not investigated by the ordinary process of interrogation. [These leniencies were accepted] so that the daughters of Israel will not be forced to remain unmarried.<br></i>
Just as the statements of five [specific] women are not accepted with regard to testimony regarding the death of a woman's husband,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 12:16, which states that the statements of a woman's mother-in-law, the daughter of her mother-in-law, [her husband's] other wife, her <i>yevamah</i> (i.e., the wife of her husband's brother) and her husband's daughter are not accepted with regard to her husband's death, because the prevailing presumption is that they hate each other.</i> so too, the statements of these five women are not accepted with regard to the death of her <i>yavam</i>.<br>The laws of the testimony governing the death of a <i>yavam</i> are the same as the testimony [governing the death of the woman's husband] with regard to disparities between the statements of the witnesses and all other matters.
[The following rule applies when] two widows, [each one married to one of two brothers,]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the women are married to two brothers. Thus each one is considered the <i>yevamah</i> of the other.</i> come from an overseas country, this one says: "My husband died," and this one says: "My husband died." Each one is forbidden [to remarry] because of her obligation to the husband of the other one.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the testimony of each woman is accepted with regard to the death of her own husband. With regard to the death of her <i>yavam</i>, by contrast, the only testimony is that of her <i>yevamah</i>, and that testimony is not accepted.</i> For the testimony of a <i>yevamah</i> is not acceptable with regard to the death of the woman's <i>yavam</i>, as stated [in the previous halachah].
If one of these women has a witness who can testify that her husband died, she is still forbidden to remarry - for she is not forbidden to remarry because of [an apprehension that] her own husband [is alive], but rather because of [the apprehension that] her <i>yavam</i> [is alive].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And with regard to the death of her <i>yavam</i>, there is no testimony that is acceptable to the court.<br>Even if the woman actually remarries, at which point it would be likely to assume that her husband is dead, her <i>yevamah</i> is still prohibited. Our Sages feared that a woman would risk ruin in both this world and the next, in order to cause her foe to be forbidden to her husband.</i><br>The woman who does not have a witness supporting her, by contrast, is permitted [to remarry], for a witness has testified that her <i>yavam</i> died, and her own testimony is accepted with regard to the death of her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 12:15.</i>
If one of the above-mentioned women has children, and the other is childless,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">And neither has witnesses to support her testimony.</i> the one who is childless is forbidden [to remarry],<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For she is dependent on the testimony of her <i>yevamah</i>, as above.</i> and the one who has children is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For her authorization to remarry does not depend on whether or not her <i>yavam</i> is alive.</i><br>If there is another living brother to perform <i>yibbum</i>, he should perform <i>yibbum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Or <i>chalitzah</i>.</i> with both of them.
If [in the latter instance], the <i>yavam</i> who married them died, they are forbidden to marry another man as they were originally.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there were only three brothers. Since the death of the first two brothers was never verified adequately to allow these women to marry freely, the original prohibition applying to them remains in force.</i> If, however, the <i>yavam</i> married them and then divorced them, they are free to marry other men.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For her marriage and divorce releases each of the women from their obligation to their missing <i>yavam</i>.</i>
A woman's testimony is accepted with regard to the death of her husband, and she may marry [another man] or perform <i>yibbum</i> [on this basis]. Nevertheless, the testimony of a <i>yevamah</i> is not accepted with regard to the death of her <i>yavam</i>, and it is not considered to be sufficient basis for her to marry another man. The rationale is that the prohibition [against marrying another man when under obligation to a <i>yavam</i>] involves merely a negative commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment - lashes - is lesser, and the woman's children are not considered illegitimate.</i> And therefore the woman may regard it casually.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Having relations with another man while married, by contrast, is a prohibition punishable by execution by the court, her children are considered illegitimate, and it brings severe retribution in the world to come. Because the prohibition against marrying while under obligation to a <i>yavam</i> is less severe, our Sages feared that the woman might lie about the <i>yavam's</i> death and transgress this prohibition.</i><br>Similarly, the testimony of a <i>yavam</i> is not accepted with regard to the death of his brother, and it is not considered to be sufficient basis for him to marry his brother's wife. [We fear that] perhaps he desired her.<br>Similarly, a woman's testimony is not accepted with regard to the death of her sister, and it is not considered to be sufficient basis for her to be permitted to marry her sister's husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden for a husband to marry his wife's sister while his wife is alive. Our Sages feared that the second sister or the husband may desire to give false testimony, so that they can marry.</i> [By the same token,] a man's testimony that his wife has died is not accepted as sufficient basis for him to marry her sister. In this instance, it is necessary that two witnesses testify that one sister has died before the other sister can enter her household. For the testimony of one witness was accepted only so that license to marry could be granted to a woman who would otherwise be forced to remain unmarried, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., generally, the testimony of two witnesses is required with regard to matters involving marriage and divorce. As mentioned in the concluding passage of <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> (cited in the notes on Halachah 6), in order to allow a woman to remarry, leniency is granted and we rely on the testimony of one witness. In this instance, however, there is no difficulty in the man's or the woman's remarrying; the only difficulty is that they cannot marry each other. In such an instance, our Sages were not willing to extend leniency.<br>[There is a slight difficulty when comparing the Rambam's statements here to his statements at the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Gittin</i>. As explained by the <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i>, Volume I, Responsa 27 and 33), the Rambam's wording indicates that, according to Scriptural law, with regard to a point of fact that can be verified, it is not necessary for two witnesses to testify, and the statements of one witness are sufficient. The leniency granted by our Sages was to accept the testimony of women, relatives and others whose testimony would not ordinarily be accepted. Here, however, the Rambam is stating (as he does in <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 5:2) that the acceptance of the testimony of a single witness is a leniency of Rabbinic origin. (See the Responsa of the Rivash, Responsum 181.)]</i>
Accordingly,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., based on the premise stated in the first clause of the previous halachah.</i> when a woman, her husband and her <i>yavam</i> journey overseas, and she comes and says: "My husband died, and afterwards my <i>yavam</i> died," or "My <i>yavam</i> died, and then my husband died," her word is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For the prevailing presumption when she departed was that she would be obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i> if her husband dies.</i><br>If, however, she and her husband depart alone, and she returns and says: "A <i>yavam</i> was born for me overseas, but he died," her word is accepted, regardless of whether she says "My <i>yavam</i> died, and then my husband died," or "My husband died, and afterwards the <i>yavam</i> who was born for me died." [The rationale is] the source for the statements [on which basis the woman was] forbidden [states that she is] permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The prevailing presumption when she departed was that she would not be obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i> if her husband dies. It is only because of her own statements that we might suspect that she is required to do so. Therefore, her statements are sufficient to offset this suspicion.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a woman journeys overseas together with her husband and her son: If she returns and says: "My husband died and then my son died," her word is accepted, for at the time she departed the prevailing presumption was that she was permitted to marry another man.<br>If she says: "My son died, and afterwards my husband died," her word is not accepted as the basis for <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">We suspect that perhaps she is lying in order to marry her brother-in-law.</i> Nevertheless, we grant a certain degree of credence to her words,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., were it not for her statement that her son died first, she would be permitted to marry without any restrictions. Because we give her statements some credence, we require her to perform <i>chalitzah</i>.</i> and she should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum</i>.
[The following rules apply when] a woman journeys overseas together with her husband alone: If she says, "I "bore a son overseas, he died, and then my husband died," her word is accepted and permitted her to perform <i>yibbum</i>. [The rationale is that] the prevailing presumption when she departed was that she was permitted to perform <i>yibbum</i>.<br>If she says: "My husband died, and then the son who was born to me died," her statements are not accepted as grounds to free her of the obligation for <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>. Nevertheless, we grant a certain degree of credence to her words, and she should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., were it not for her statement that her son died after her husband, she would be required to perform <i>yibbum</i>. We do not accept her word to the extent that we allow her to marry without restrictions.

When does the above apply? When she was forbidden to the priesthood at the outset - e.g., she had been divorced or a <i>chalalah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A woman who is born from a relationship that is forbidden to a priest, but not to an Israelite.</i> beforehand,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In which case, the <i>chalitzah</i> does not make any difference, for the woman was forbidden to the priesthood regardless.</i> - or she said: "We were [alone] in a cave when he died."<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In which case, there is no apprehension of witnesses coming.</i><br>If this is not the situation, she may not perform <i>chalitzah</i>, lest she perform <i>chalitzah</i> and then witnesses come and confirm her statements that her husband died first. Thus, it will be evident that this <i>chalitzah</i> was unnecessary, and she [is permitted to] marry a priest. An observer may see that she performs <i>chalitzah</i> and then marries a priest, and he would think that a priest is permitted to marry a woman who performed <i>chalitzah</i>, for he is unaware that witnesses came. Therefore, she should not perform <i>chalitzah</i>, nor should she perform <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For according to her testimony, she is forbidden to do so.</i> Instead, she should remain under the obligation to perform <i>yibbum</i> as she was when she departed, until witnesses come [and clarify the situation].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Note the discussion of this ruling by the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 156:17, and the opinion mentioned there that this ruling applies only when there were witnesses who testified that the woman's husband and son both died. Otherwise, the woman's word would be accepted based on the principle of <i>migo</i> - i.e., if she desired to lie, she could have said that her son was still alive.</i>
Similar laws apply when a woman's husband and a second wife journeyed overseas, and two witnesses came and told [the first wife], "Your husband died." She should not perform <i>chalitzah</i>, nor should she perform <i>yibbum</i> until she knows whether or not her husband's second wife bore a child.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This law applies even if the second wife was not pregnant when she left. Our Sages considered the possibility of the woman becoming pregnant as a reasonable probability.</i><br>Why should she not perform <i>chalitzah</i> nine months after the death of her husband, in which case she would be permitted to marry another man from any standpoint? If the other woman bore a child, that frees her of all obligations. And if the other woman did not bear a child, she [should be permitted, because] she performed <i>chalitzah</i>.<br>[Our Sages prohibited this] as a decree, lest after the woman performed <i>chalitzah</i>, it become known that her husband's other wife bore a viable child. This woman will then not be [bound by the prohibitions of] a woman who performed <i>chalitzah</i>, and she may marry a priest despite performing <i>chalitzah</i>. An observer - who did not know about the witnesses [who informed her of the birth of her husband's child] - might conclude that a priest is permitted to marry a woman who performed <i>chalitzah</i>, and he will testify that a Rabbinic court gave her license to marry a priest. Therefore, if she was forbidden to the priesthood at the outset, she may perform <i>chalitzah</i> nine [months after the death of her husband and] she may marry another man.<br>The wife who accompanied her husband when he died should wait 90 days, as other <i>yevamot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 19.</i> Thus, she may perform <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>.

When a woman's husband dies, and her mother-in- law is living overseas, she need not suspect that her mother-in-law bore a child [before her husband's death], and that there is a <i>yavam</i> for her living in another country.

Both [the <i>yevamah</i>] and the <i>yavam</i> should be taught to read until they are familiar [with the words they must recite].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For, as explained in the halachot to follow, both the <i>yavam</i> and the <i>yevamah</i> must recite certain phrases within the <i>chalitzah</i> ceremony.</i><br>The <i>yevamah</i> should be trained to say <i>lo avah</i> in one breath, [pause,] and say <i>yabmi</i>, so that her words cannot be interpreted to mean <i>avah yabmi</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lo avah yabmi</i> means "My <i>yavam</i> did not desire" [Deuteronomy 25:7].

After the fact, however, if the <i>chalitzah</i> was performed while the <i>yavam</i> and the <i>yevamah</i> were seated, it is acceptable (Ramah, <i>ibid.</i> 169:12).</i> The phrase [Deuteronomy 25:7], <i>Me'ein yevami....</i> ("My <i>yavam</i> refuses....") is read in Hebrew for the <i>yevamah</i> to repeat.

Significantly, the commentaries cite the Rambam's source as the <i>Zohar</i>, Volume III, page 180a, which states that the removal of the shoe signifies the cutting of the woman's connection with her deceased husband.</i> At the moment she removes the majority of the heel [of the shoe from his foot], she becomes free to marry another man.
Afterwards, she stands and spits on the earth before his face,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Although the literal meaning of Deuteronomy 25:9 is "she spits in his face," <i>Yevamot</i> 106b explains that in a halachic context, the phrase should be interpreted as above.</i> in a manner that the spittle can be seen by the judges. For the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i> requires that both [the <i>yevamah</i> and the <i>yavam</i>] should stand when they recite [the phrases they must say] and when she spits. The judges must see the spittle that emerges from her mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>, states that she must spit "before the eyes of the elders."</i><br>Afterwards, the phrase <i>Kachah ye'aseh...</i>, "This is what should be done to a man who does not build his brother's household. And his [family] shall be called within Israel 'the household of the one whose shoe was removed' [Deuteronomy 25:9-10] is read for the <i>yevamah</i> to repeat.
All [the statements mentioned] above should be made in Hebrew. This is derived from the phrase "This is what" [in the above verse, which is interpreted] to mean "with these words."<br>All those seated<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 12:6) and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 169:42) mention "those standing there."</i> in attendance recite <i>chalutz hana'al</i>, "the one whose shoe was removed," three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">We find a threefold repetition of a phrase employed by the Sages as a means of publicizing the matter. See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 7:11.<br>The <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> interprets the threefold repetition as a reprimand. It is as if God told him: "Wicked man! With your body, you could have performed a mitzvah, and you refused.... The judges will proclaim: 'The one whose shoe was removed' like a mourner. 'The one whose shoe was removed' like one placed under a ban of ostracism. 'The one whose shoe was removed' like a person who rebels against [God's] commandments."</i><br>The <i>yevamah</i> must remove his shoe with willful intent, and [the <i>yavam</i>] must have the intent that he performs this rite on her behalf. They must perform these acts with the intent of enabling her to marry other men.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation of <i>lishmah</i> is based on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 169:44).</i><br>A blind man<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one who is blind in both eyes (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>, Ramah, <i>loc. cit.</i>:48).</i> should not perform <i>chalitzah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected by Halachah 15, this is just an <i>a priori</i> ruling. After the fact, the <i>chalitzah</i> is acceptable.<br>The Ra'avad states that this law applies only when there is another brother who can perform <i>chalitzah</i>. If there is not another brother, the blind man should perform this ritual on the woman's behalf. Although the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> contests the Ra'avad's decision, the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 169:48 upholds it.</i> for [Deuteronomy 25:9] states: "[She] shall spit before his face," and he cannot see her spittle.
Thus, the order of <i>chalitzah</i> should be as follows: First she recites: "My <i>yavam</i> refuses to perpetuate his brother's name within Israel. My <i>yavam</i> did not desire [to marry me].<br>Afterwards, [the <i>yavam</i>] says: "I do not desire to take her." At which point, she removes his shoe and then spits. Afterwards, she recites: "This is what should be done to a man who does not build his brother's household. And his [family] shall be called within Israel 'the household of the one whose shoe was removed.'
This order is not, however, an absolute requirement. Instead, even though neither [the <i>yevamah</i>], nor [the <i>yavam</i>] recited [the required phrases], she spit and then removed his shoe, or she recited [the phrases] and then spit, the <i>chalitzah</i> is acceptable.
Why, [in the above instance,] should she not spit [again], [so that all the required activities] will be performed in the proper order? Lest people [mistakenly] think that spitting alone is of no consequence, and [they err and think] that it does not prevent [the <i>yavam's</i>] other brothers [from performing <i>yibbum</i> with the <i>yevamah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 14.</i>
[Even if] she merely removed his shoe, did not recite [the required phrases], and did not spit, the <i>chalitzah</i> is acceptable. Needless to say, if she removed his shoe and recited the required phrases, but did not spit, or if she removed his shoe and spat, but did not recite the required phrases, the <i>chalitzah</i> is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Eliezer maintains that the phrase (Deuteronomy 25:9 , <i>kachah ye'aseh</i>, "this is what should be done," implies that all the deeds and the order required by the Torah is imperative for the <i>chalitzah</i> to be effected. The final opinion of Rabbi Akiva does not, however, accept this view (<i>Yevamot</i> 104b).</i>
When does the above apply? When [the <i>yevamah</i> and the <i>yavam</i>] are able to speak, for then they are able to recite [the appropriate phrases].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This reflects a Talmudic principle frequently applied and stated explicitly with regard to the meal offering brought in the Temple.

Nevertheless, as long as the quantity of flour is not too large to be mixed with the oil, the offering is acceptable, even when in actual fact the two were not mixed together (Rashi, <i>Yevamot</i> 104b).</i> When, however, [the <i>yevamah</i>] or [the <i>yavam</i>] is dumb, they may not perform <i>chalitzah</i>, and if they do perform <i>chalitzah</i>, the <i>chalitzah</i> is not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between a <i>chalitzah</i> that is <i>pasul</i>, "not acceptable," and a <i>chalitzah</i> that is not significant at all is discussed in Halachah 26.</i><br>[Their deeds are, nevertheless, effective to a certain degree.] They are not comparable to a <i>chalitzah</i> performed by [a <i>yevamah</i>] or [a <i>yavam</i>] who was a deaf-mute, in which case their deeds are of no consequence whatsoever,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, the Rambam's view is dependent on the <i>Tosefta</i>, while on the surface, the Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 104b) appears to accept the position that a <i>chalitzah</i> performed by a deaf-mute is unacceptable, but not of no consequence. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> attempts to justify the Rambam's ruling, but notes that the Ramban and the Rashba follow the latter view. [Significantly, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 12:4), the Rambam also appears to favor the latter view, and his decision in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> represents a reversal of his thinking.] The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 169:44) mentions both views without appearing to favor either one.</i> for a deaf-mute is not of sufficient mental capacity to take responsibility for his [or her] actions.
If [the <i>yevamah</i>] only spits, without removing [the <i>yavam's</i> shoe] or reciting [the appropriate phrases], or spits and recites [the appropriate phrases], without removing [the <i>yavam's</i> shoe], it is as if she has performed an unacceptable <i>chalitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 26, the <i>chalitzah</i> does not permit the <i>yevamah</i> to remarry, but prevents her from performing <i>yibbum</i>.<br>There is a difference of opinion among the commentaries whether the effectiveness of spitting is a Scriptural law or a Rabbinic institution. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that it appears that the Rambam is deriving the concept from the exegesis of a verse, but this is not accepted by all authorities.</i><br>If both [the <i>yevamah</i> and the <i>yavam</i>] recite [the appropriate phrases], but the <i>yevamah</i> does not remove [the <i>yavam's</i> shoe] or spit, they have not accomplished anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yibbum</i> is permitted, and she is not disqualified from marrying into the priesthood.</i> [This is implied by the verse:] "This is what should be done to a man" - i.e., a deed removing the shoe or spitting has an effect.

An observer will thus realize that the fundamental aspect of the ceremony is still to be performed.</i>

Other commentaries maintain that if the stump of the <i>yavam's</i> leg can be placed in a shoe and that shoe tied beneath his knee, the <i>chalitzah</i> is acceptable. Although the Rambam accepts, after the fact, <i>chalitzah</i> performed when the straps of the shoe are tied below the <i>yavam's</i> knee, that is only because it is theoretically possible to have tied them on his foot. When it is impossible to tie the shoe on to his foot, as in the instance at hand, the <i>chalitzah</i> should not be performed (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 169:35) mentions both opinions, but appears to favor the Rambam's view. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> states that according to the Rambam, such a <i>chalitzah</i> is of no consequence at all. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 169:33 states that since there are authorities who maintain that such a <i>chalitzah</i> is acceptable, the later authorities agree that a woman may not perform <i>yibbum</i> after such a <i>chalitzah</i>.</i> If he performs <i>chalitzah</i> with his left leg, the <i>chalitzah</i> is unacceptable.<br>If [the <i>yavam</i>] is bowlegged, his foot turns to his side, or he always walks on the tips of his toes, she should not perform <i>chalitzah</i>, for the man performing <i>chalitzah</i> must press his heel to the ground, and such a person is incapable of this. If a person with such a disability in his legs performs <i>chalitzah</i>, the <i>chalitzah</i> is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">After the fact, if a <i>yavam</i> does not press his heel to the ground in an ordinary instance, the <i>chalitzah</i> is, nevertheless, acceptable. The distinction between an ordinary <i>chalitzah</i> and the case at hand is that ordinarily, it is possible for the <i>yavam</i> to press his heel to the ground, and therefore the fact that he does not actually do so is not significant. In this instance, the <i>yavam</i> is incapable of doing so. Hence, the <i>chalitzah</i> is unacceptable.<br>Although the Ra'avad and others differ with the Rambam on this issue, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 169:34) accepts the Rambam's view.</i>

(See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8-9.) As such, there is a possibility that such a sandal will not have to be destroyed. An object offered to a false deity, including the hide from which a sandal was made, can never be separated from its association with the false deity (<i>ibid.</i>).

With regard to <i>chalitzah</i>, however, the <i>yavam</i> did perform all the required acts. His protest is accepted to the extent that it is considered that he performed these acts without intending to release the woman from her obligation. This, however, merely causes a <i>chalitzah</i> to be unacceptable, as stated in Halachah 16. It does not nullify it entirely.</i> Therefore, it is proper for the judges to tell [the <i>yavam</i>] to nullify all protests [before he performs <i>chalitzah</i>], as they do with regard to a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 6:20.</i><br>[The following rules apply when] Jews compel [a <i>yavam</i>] and beat him until he performs <i>chalitzah</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The equivalence established by <i>Yevamot</i> 106a applies in this context as well.

Whenever we have used the terms, "the <i>chalitzah</i> is of no substance," "his actions are of no consequence," or "nothing has been accomplished," the intent is that it is as if the <i>chalitzah</i> had not been performed at all.

When a <i>yevamah</i> grows up together with [her deceased husband's] brothers, she is permitted to perform <i>yibbum</i>.

The document recording the <i>chalitzah</i> that we compose is merely a legal record,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This distinguishes it from a bill of divorce (a <i>get</i>), which is actually necessary to effect the divorce.

The three judges, two of the three judges, or two other individuals who witnessed the <i>chalitzah</i>, but who did not serve as the judges presiding over the <i>chalitzah</i>, may testify concerning the matter, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 29.</i><br>Even [the testimony of] a woman, a servant or a minor who is perceptive and understanding is accepted if they say that "This is so and so, the brother of so and so, and this is his <i>yevamah</i>."

When, by contrast, the matter can be verified definitively without the testimony of a witness, and the witness cannot justify [his statements] if they are not true - e.g., when one testifies that a person died, the Torah did not necessitate [that the requirements of formal testimony be met in these instances]. For it is unlikely that a witness will testify falsely.<br>As interpreted by the <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i>, Volume I, Responsa 27 and 33), the Rambam's statement implies that since the matter will ultimately become public knowledge, no formal testimony is required, and the statements of an individual who witnessed the matter himself are sufficient to be accepted.</i><br>If the <i>yavam</i> desires to perform <i>yibbum</i>, he should consecrate her, perform <i>yibbum</i> and write her a <i>ketubah</i>, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 2; <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 22:14.</i>

When a legal record of the <i>chalitzah</i> or a <i>ketubah</i> for a <i>yevamah</i> is written, the place where the verses [from the Torah] are written should be ruled with a stylus, for it is forbidden to write three words [from the Torah] without ruling [the surface on which one writes].<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note the apparent contradiction between the Rambam's ruling here [which is also reflected in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sotah</i> 2:4)], and his ruling in <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> 7:16, where he states that one may write three words, but not four, without ruling the writing surface.

Chapter 5

When a <i>yavam</i> gives a <i>yevamah</i> a bill of divorce (a <i>get</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a <i>get</i> given before the brother made a statement of intent to marry the <i>yevamah</i> (<i>ma'amar</i>). See Halachot 4 and 5.</i> he disqualifies her and all of [his deceased brother's] other wives [from performing <i>yibbum</i>] with him or with any of the other brothers. It is considered as if he has performed <i>chalitzah</i> with her.<br>The power of a <i>get</i> to affect a <i>yevamah</i> is Rabbinic in origin. [They instituted this decree based on the following rationale:] Since a <i>get</i> has the power to bring about the divorce of a married woman, and every <i>get</i> causes a woman to be disqualified from the priesthood, [they decreed] that it should also disqualify a <i>yevamah</i> from performing <i>yibbum</i>. [The <i>yevamah</i>] is not permitted to marry another man, however, until she performs <i>chalitzah</i>.
A statement of intent to marry (<i>ma'amar</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> does not fully effect the establishment of a marriage bond for a <i>yevamah</i>, and it does not cause her to become a married woman in the full sense. Nevertheless, [if the <i>yavam</i> desires to nullify the <i>ma'amar</i>,] he must give [the <i>yevamah</i>] a <i>get</i>. For her to marry another man, however, <i>chalitzah</i> must be performed.
What is implied? When [a <i>yavam</i>] gives a <i>ma'amar</i> to his <i>yevamah</i>, but does not desire to engage in sexual relations with her, he must write a <i>get</i> for her, since she was consecrated unto him, and he must perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her to cause her to be permitted to others.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 3:5), the Rambam writes that at the outset, the <i>get</i> should precede the <i>chalitzah</i>.</i><br>For a <i>yevamah</i> is not permitted to marry another man unless she enters into sexual relations with her <i>yavam</i> [and then is divorced or widowed], or if she performs <i>chalitzah</i>. A <i>get</i> disqualifies her for <i>yibbum</i>, but does not permit her to marry another man. A <i>ma'amar</i> does not effect a marriage bond in a complete sense, as sexual relations do.
When [a <i>yavam</i>] gives a <i>ma'amar</i> to his <i>yevamah</i> and then gives her a <i>get</i> [to nullify his <i>ma'amar</i>], he has negated what he brought about,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the <i>get</i> nullifies the <i>kiddushin</i> brought about by the <i>ma'amar</i>.</i> and [the <i>yevamah</i>] is free [to perform <i>yibbum</i>]. It appears to me that she is free only [to perform <i>yibbum</i>] with his brothers, but she is forbidden to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Whenever the Rambam uses the expression "It appears to me," he is referring to a ruling that is not specifically mentioned in the Talmud. In this instance, Rashi (<i>Yevamot</i> 32a, 52a) agrees with the Rambam, but the Ra'avad and <i>Tosafot</i> differ and maintain that if the <i>yavam</i> who gave her the <i>ma'amar</i> and the <i>get</i> desires, he may still perform <i>yibbum</i> with her. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 170:15) quotes both opinions, but appears to favor that of the Rambam.</i>
When [a <i>yavam</i>] gives a <i>get</i> [to his <i>yevamah</i>] [to nullify] his connection to her and not {to nullify his <i>ma'amar</i>}, he disqualifies her [from performing <i>yibbum</i>] with him and his other brothers, as stated above.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 1. The Rambam is adding that even if the <i>yavam</i> had already given the <i>yevamah</i> a <i>ma'amar</i>, this ruling still applies.<br>If the <i>yavam</i> gives a <i>get</i> without specifying the reason, we assume that his intent is to sever his connection with the <i>yevamah</i> and not merely to nullify his <i>ma'amar</i> (Rashi, <i>Yevamot</i> 32a; Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 170:15).</i><br>He must give her [another] <i>get</i> [to negate] his <i>ma'amar</i> and perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her to permit her to marry another man.
When a <i>ma'amar</i> is given to a <i>yevamah</i> at the outset, without its having been preceded by any other activity and without its having been followed by any activity other than the sexual relations between [the <i>yavam</i>] who gave the <i>ma'amar</i> and the <i>yevamah</i>, the <i>ma'amar</i> is referred to as "an acceptable <i>ma'amar</i>."<br>By contrast, a <i>ma'amar</i> is referred to as "an unacceptable <i>ma'amar</i>" when:<br>a) before the <i>ma'amar</i> either this <i>yavam</i> or one of his brothers gave a <i>get</i> to this <i>yevamah</i> or one of the deceased brother's other wives or performed <i>chalitzah</i> with her,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Once a <i>yavam</i> has performed <i>chalitzah</i>, neither he nor his brothers may perform <i>yibbum</i> afterwards.

What is implied? If [a <i>yavam</i>] a) gave a <i>get</i> or performed <i>chalitzah</i> with his <i>yevamah</i> and afterwards he or one of his brothers gave her or another of his deceased brother's wives a <i>ma'amar</i>, or b) he entered into relations with his <i>yevamah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Although the <i>ma'amar</i> that follows the relations is nullified, the marriage bond established by the relations remains in effect (Rav David Arameah).</i> or gave her a <i>ma'amar</i>, and then he or one of his brothers gave another of his deceased brother's wives a <i>ma'amar</i> or entered into relations with her, the <i>ma'amar</i> is unacceptable.

Thus, we may conclude that whether a <i>ma'amar</i> was preceded by another <i>ma'amar</i>, a <i>get</i>, a <i>chalitzah</i>, or sexual relations, or whether any of these acts preceded a <i>ma'amar</i>, the <i>ma'amar</i> is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Although the <i>ma'amar</i> is unacceptable and <i>yibbum</i> is not allowed, a <i>get</i> is necessary (from both brothers, when two <i>ma'amarim</i> are involved), nevertheless, to nullify the <i>kiddushin</i>.

Our Sages, however, reduced the level of connection established and caused their marriage bond to have only the effectiveness of a <i>ma'amar</i>.<br>[The rationale why <i>yibbum</i> performed by a minor is effective although a minor does not possess the intellectual maturity to take responsibility for his conduct is that we find that <i>yibbum</i> does not require intent at all; what is significant is the act of sexual relations. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 3.)]<br><i>Tosafot</i> differ and maintain that, in this context, the relations of a nine-year old are of no consequence according to Scriptural law. Nevertheless, the Rabbis enforced a stringency and considered these relations to be equivalent to a <i>ma'amar</i>.</i> [the <i>yevamah</i>] is not acquired as a wife in a complete manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This concept is illustrated in the halachah that follows, as is another consequence of the principle that the sexual relations that this youth engages in are considered equivalent to a <i>ma'amar</i> given by an adult.</i><br>When [a <i>yavam</i> who is below the age of majority, but more than] nine years and one day old, gives a <i>ma'amar</i> at the outset, it is effective and causes [the <i>yevamah</i>] to be forbidden to [his brothers] who are past majority. If, however, he gives [the <i>ma'amar</i> after a <i>ma'amar</i> has been given by his brothers who are past majority, his <i>ma'amar</i>] is of no consequence.<br>[Similarly,] a <i>get</i> that he gives or <i>chalitzah</i> that he performs is always of no consequence, whether it precedes [his brothers' actions] or follows them.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Chapter 4, Halachah 16, <i>chalitzah</i> performed by a minor is of no consequence, because the passage concerning <i>chalitzah</i> explicitly mentions an איש - i.e., a male past majority. Since <i>chalitzah</i> performed by a minor is of no consequence, a <i>get</i> given by him is of no consequence, because the disqualification caused by a <i>get</i> is an extension by the Rabbis of the Scriptural prohibition caused by <i>chalitzah</i>.<br>Significantly, the Rambam's statements here represent a reversal of his ruling in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 10:6), in which he rules that a <i>get</i> given by a minor does disqualify a <i>yevamah</i> from performing <i>yibbum</i> with the minor's brothers.</i>
What is implied? When a [<i>yavam</i> who is below the age of majority, but more than] nine years and one day old, engages in relations with his <i>yevamah</i>, or gives her a <i>ma'amar</i> at the outset, he disqualifies her [from performing <i>yibbum</i>] with his other brothers. If, however, [one of the brothers] past majority gave his <i>yevamah</i> a <i>ma'amar</i>, and then [the brother who is below the age of majority, but more than] nine years and one day old, gives her or another one of the wives [of the deceased brother] a <i>ma'amar</i>, his actions are of no consequence, and he does not cause [the <i>yevamah</i>] to be forbidden to his elder brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Had the younger brother been past the age of majority, he would have disqualified the <i>yevamah</i> from performing <i>yibbum</i> with his older brother, as stated in Halachot 7 and 14.</i><br>If, however, [the brother who is below the age of majority, but more than] nine years and one day old engages in relations with her or with another one of the wives of [the deceased brother], he causes [the <i>yevamah</i>] to be forbidden to his elder brother, as would be the case when two [brothers] past majority each gave a <i>ma'amar</i> one after the other, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 7 and 14.</i>
When a [<i>yavam</i> who is below the age of majority, but more than] nine years and one day old, has engaged in relations with his <i>yevamah</i>, and then one of his brothers past majority entered into relations with her, performed <i>chalitzah</i> with her, gave her a <i>get</i>, or performed one of these activities with another [one of the deceased brother's] wives, he disqualified the minor [from marrying his <i>yevamah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since the minor's relations possess only the strength of a <i>ma'amar</i>, their effectiveness can be nullified by the actions of an older brother.</i><br>Similarly, if the minor has engaged in relations with another [one of the deceased brother's] wives, or another brother who is also [below the age of majority, but more than] nine years and one day old, has engaged in relations with this woman, or with another [one of the deceased brother's] wives, [the woman with whom the first brother originally engaged in relations] is disqualified [from marrying him], as is the ruling whenever two <i>ma'amarim</i> are given one after the other.
When a [<i>yavam</i> who is below the age of majority, but more than] nine years and one day old, engages in relations with his <i>yevamah</i> and then does not engage in relations with her again after he attains majority, [he is] required [to give her] a <i>get</i> and perform <i>chalitzah</i>. The <i>get</i> [is necessary] because the relations in which he engaged are considered equivalent to a <i>ma'amar</i>. The <i>chalitzah</i> [is necessary] in order to permit the woman to marry another man, for she did not engage in relations that established a complete marriage bond.<br>If [her <i>yavam</i>] engaged in relations with her after he attained majority, all that is required [to enable her to marry another man] is a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For the relations in which they engaged after the <i>yavam</i> attained majority complete the marriage bond.</i>
[The same laws that apply to a <i>yavam</i> who is below the age of majority, but more than] nine years and one day old [apply to a <i>yavam</i> who] is twenty years old and has not manifested signs of physical maturity, but has also not manifested physical signs of impotency, as explained in the beginning of this book.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:11, a male who does not manifest signs of impotency is considered a minor until he attains the age of 35.</i>

This marriage is not binding according to Scriptural law. Accordingly, when creating this option, our Sages gave the girl the possibility of nullifying the marriage before she reaches majority merely by making a verbal statement.</i> and [the consecration of a girl who is] a deaf-mute are Rabbinic institutions. Nevertheless, they are two different types of ordinances. [For] the consecration of a minor was ordained so that [men] will not relate to her in an unrestrained manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, she marries, they would respect the limits of modesty and her husband would protect her (<i>Yevamot</i> 112b).</i> Her consecration is thus tentative until she comes of age. Consecration was ordained for a deaf-mute [for a different reason,] so that she will not remain unmarried forever.<br>Accordingly, if all the <i>yevamot</i> coming from one household are below majority or all are deaf mutes,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, one is a mentally capable woman past the age of majority, <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> should be performed with her - for her marriage is binding according to Scriptural law - and not with those whose marriage is binding only by virtue of a Rabbinic ordinance.</i> entering into relations with one of them frees them all from their obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">For their marriage bonds all share the same status.</i>
If [by contrast, the deceased was married to] a deaf-mute and a minor, engaging in relations with one does not free the other of her obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The marriage relationship of each one possesses an advantage over the other. The marriage with the minor, had it not been interrupted, could have blossomed into a marriage bond binding according to Scriptural law. On the other hand, there is an advantage to the marriage to the deaf-mute, because the minor had the option of ending her marriage at will, while that of the deaf-mute was binding. As evident from Halachot 27 and 28, the marriage to the minor is preferable.</i><br>What is the alternative? The minor should be instructed to [nullify her marriage through] <i>mi'un</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For just as she can dissolve her relationship with her husband while he is alive, she can nullify it afterwards, freeing herself from any obligation to the <i>yavam</i> (<i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 11:3).<br>The Ra'avad differs and maintains that a minor is permitted to free herself from an obligation to the <i>yavam</i> through <i>mi'un</i> only when this facilitates the establishment of a marriage bond that is binding according to Scriptural law. (See Halachah 30 and Chapter 7, Halachah 15.) In this instance, however, she is not given the privilege. Instead, she must wait until she attains majority and then perform <i>chalitzah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 171:1) quotes the Rambam's view.</i> and [a <i>yavam</i>] should marry the deaf-mute.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Since the deaf-mute is not considered responsible for her actions, she cannot perform <i>chalitzah</i>. She must either perform <i>yibbum</i> or remain unmarried for the remainder of her life.<br>If the <i>yavam</i> performs <i>yibbum</i> with the minor, he may not perform <i>yibbum</i> with the deaf-mute, for he is permitted to perform <i>yibbum</i> only with one of his deceased brother's wives.</i> If he desires to divorce her, he may write a <i>get</i> for her after they engage in relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The deaf-mute is not considered responsible for her actions. Nevertheless, since according to Scriptural and Talmudic law a <i>get</i> may be given without the woman's consent, the divorce is binding (<i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 10:23).</i> She is then permitted [to marry] another man.
If one [of the deceased's wives] was mentally competent, and one was a deaf-mute, engaging in relations with the mentally competent woman, or performing <i>chalitzah</i> with her frees the deaf-mute of her obligation. Engaging in relations with the deaf-mute, by contrast, does not free the mentally competent woman [from her obligation]. For the consecration of the deaf-mute is merely a Rabbinic institution.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">And performing <i>yibbum</i> with a woman who is consecrated only according to Rabbinic law does not free a woman who is consecrated according to Scriptural law from her obligation.</i><br>Similar [laws apply when one of the deceased wives was] above majority, and one was a minor. Engaging in relations with the woman past majority, or performing <i>chalitzah</i> with her frees the minor of her obligation. Engaging in relations with the minor, by contrast, does not free the woman past majority [from her obligation].
[The following rules apply if] both [the deceased's wives] were minors who are entitled to absolve their marriages through <i>mi'un</i>. If the <i>yavam</i> engages in relations with one of them, and then he or one of his brothers engages in relations with the other, this does not disqualify the marriage to the first.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For, as mentioned in Halachah 14, after a <i>yavam</i> engages in relations with his <i>yevamah</i>, their relationship cannot be disqualified.</i> Nevertheless, we should instruct [the second one] to dissolve her marriage through] <i>mi'un</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">If the second wife does not perform <i>mi'un</i>, her consecration is also binding.

Similar laws apply if [the deceased was married to] a minor and a deaf-mute. If the <i>yavam</i> first enters into relations with the minor, and then he or one of his brothers engages in relations with the deaf-mute, this does not disqualify the marriage to the minor. The deaf-mute, however, must be divorced via a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For relations with her are forbidden, and yet her consecration is binding.</i><br>[The rationale is that] the relations with the minor are considered superior to relations with the deaf-mute, for ultimately the minor will be fit [to enter into a marriage bond that is binding according to Scriptural law].

Moreover, far fewer legal details are involved (<i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i>).<br>Note the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 171), which interprets the Ra'avad's comments on this halachah as implying that the <i>yavam</i> should remain married to the minor.

[The following rules apply if the deceased was married to] a woman past the age of majority and one below the age of majority.

How is it possible for a woman to be forbidden [to her <i>yavam</i>] as one of the <i>arayot</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">And yet to be permitted to her deceased husband, so that her original marriage was binding (in contrast to the instances mentioned in Halachah 12).</i> For example, [the <i>yevamah</i>] was the sister, the mother, or the daughter of [the <i>yavam's</i>] wife. Such a woman is not obligated to perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i> at all and is under no obligation to [the <i>yavam</i>], as implied by the verse: "And he shall take her as a wife, thus performing <i>yibbum</i>." Only a woman who is fit to be married, and whose consecration [by the <i>yavam</i>] is binding is obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i>.
If the <i>yevamah</i> was forbidden to her <i>yavam</i> because of a negative commandment or a positive commandment, or she was one of the <i>sh'niyot</i>, she should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum</i>.<br>Why is she obligated to perform <i>chalitzah</i>? Because she is fit to be married, and her consecration [by the <i>yavam</i>] would be binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, after engaging in relations once to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i>, the <i>yavam</i> would be obligated to divorce the <i>yevamah</i>, as evident from <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:14.</i> Therefore, she is under obligation to the <i>yavam</i>. And according to law, she should perform <i>yibbum</i>, for <i>yibbum</i> is a positive commandment, and whenever the observance of a positive commandment conflicts with the observance of a negative commandment, the positive commandment takes precedence.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Note the statements of the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 174:3, who connects this concept with the difference of opinion between the Sephardic and Ashkenazic authorities with regard to which takes precedence: <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>.

They explain that his omission holds the key to the comprehension of a more general question.<br>Although the observance of a positive commandment supersedes the observance of a negative commandment, the observance of one positive commandment does not supersede the observance of another positive commandment. And therefore, the question arises: Why does <i>yibbum</i> establish a binding marriage bond when the transgression of a positive commandment is involved? Such a transgression is not mandated by law.<br>The commentaries explain that indeed the <i>yavam</i> should not - even according to Scriptural law - perform <i>yibbum</i> in such a situation, and therefore the Rambam omits mention of those forbidden by a positive commandment in this clause. If, however, the <i>yavam</i> does violate the positive commandment, the marriage bond created is binding. For just as the positive commandment of <i>yibbum</i> is not greater than the positive commandment involving the prohibition, the positive commandment involving the prohibition is not greater than the positive commandment of <i>yibbum</i>. See the conclusion of the Responsa of the <i>Noda Biy'hudah</i> on <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> and the commentary of the <i>Or Sameach</i> on this halachah.</i> should perform <i>yibbum</i>, lest [the <i>yavam</i>] engage in relations with her a second time. [At that time,] relations with her are forbidden, and there is no mitzvah, for the positive commandment [of <i>yibbum</i>] applies only with regard to the first time [the couple] engage in relations.<br>Therefore, if [the <i>yavam</i>] transgresses and engages in relations with a <i>yevamah</i> who is forbidden to him because of a negative commandment or because of a positive commandment, he acquires her [as his wife] in definitive manner and must divorce her with a <i>get</i>.

When a <i>yevamah</i> has been widowed after her marriage [to the deceased] had been consummated, and a High Priest performs <i>yibbum</i> with her, the other wives [of the deceased] are not released from their obligation.

If she became a widow when she had merely been consecrated, only a negative commandment is involved, and the laws mentioned in the previous halachah apply.</i> [Therefore,] he does not acquire [the <i>yevamah</i> as a wife] in a definitive manner, and as such, another wife [of the deceased]<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries infer that the Rambam's wording implies that if the High Priest divorces the woman, she herself may marry others; she does not require <i>chalitzah</i>.

[The following principle applies when] a <i>yevamah</i> was forbidden to her [deceased] husband as one of the <i>arayot</i> - e.g., he transgressed or he erred and married his paternal sister, and she is now under obligation to his brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Who is also her brother.</i> She is not considered to be [the deceased's] wife, for his consecration of her is not binding.

There is one exception - when the deceased remarried his divorcee after she had married another man. She should perform <i>chalitzah</i> and not <i>yibbum</i>.<br>Similarly, when there is a doubt whether a <i>yevamah</i> was forbidden to her [deceased] husband as one of the <i>arayot</i>, or<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, which suggests altering the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and substituting the word "and" for "or."

Nevertheless, since that has not been established definitively, the <i>chalitzah</i> is necessary, and as a consequence, the <i>yavam</i> must divorce the woman whom he originally desired to marry.</i>
[The following principle applies when a man's] brother dies [childless] leaving two wives: one forbidden to [the <i>yavam</i>] as an <i>ervah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">But not to the deceased - e.g., the <i>yavam's</i> daughter.</i> and one who is not forbidden in this manner. Just as the woman who is forbidden is not under the obligation to perform <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>, so too, [the deceased's] other wives are not obligated.<br>This household is not under any obligation [to the <i>yavam</i>], as our Sages derived from [Deuteronomy 25:9]: "...Who did not build his brother's house": [Women from] a household from which he can take [any wife] he desires is under obligation [to the <i>yavam</i>]. But if he cannot "build" a portion of the household - i.e., he is forbidden to marry the woman - he should not "build" even the portion that is permitted to him.<br>Thus, [when one of the wives of the deceased] is forbidden to [the <i>yavam</i>] as an <i>ervah</i>, the other wife also remains forbidden to him as an <i>ervah</i>. [She is still forbidden as] his brother's wife, for she is not under any obligation at all to him.
Accordingly, [the following rules apply when] Reuven dies [childless], leaving two wives, one of whom is forbidden as an <i>ervah</i> to [his brother] Shimon, and both are fit to marry [his brother] Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., Reuven married Shimon's daughter. She is thus forbidden to Shimon and permitted to Levi.</i> [The wives of] this household are under no obligation at all to Shimon, and both are under obligation to Levi.<br>[The following rule applies if] Levi performed <i>yibbum</i> with the woman who was married [to Reuven] but who was not an <i>ervah</i> to Shimon, [Levi] had another wife, and then he died [childless], and both women fell before to Shimon. They are both free of the obligation to perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i> with Shimon.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">If Levi had another brother, they would, however, be under obligation to him.</i> [Levi's <i>yevamah</i>] is forbidden because she was married to the same man as was a woman forbidden [to Shimon] as an <i>ervah</i>, and the other wife is forbidden because she was married to the same man [as the <i>yevamah</i>].<br>This principle applies whenever a woman is married to the same man as a woman who was the other wife [of a woman forbidden to the <i>yavam</i>] and to any further extension of this principle.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if Reuven, Shimon, and Levi had another brother and he performed <i>yibbum</i> with the woman who was not previously married to Reuven, that brother had another wife, and then he died without children - his wives are also under no obligation to Shimon. Since one of the wives was once freed from an obligation to him, even if she remarries she can never be obligated to him. Moreover, she frees all the other wives of her second husband from an obligation to him.</i> As long as a woman is under no obligation [to her <i>yavam</i>], she remains forbidden to him as his brother's wife.
Similarly, the wife of a brother who died before [his younger brother was born is forbidden to him]. She is under no obligation to him, as implied by [Deuteronomy 25:5]: "When brothers dwell together," interpreted to mean: when they live at the same time. She remains forbidden to him forever, and she frees all of her husband's other wives from an obligation to him.
What is implied? Reuven died [childless], leaving a wife who fell before Shimon [his brother]. After Reuven died, whether before Shimon performed <i>yibbum</i> with Reuven's wife or afterwards, Levi [another brother] was born.<br>Reuven's wife remains forbidden to Levi as an <i>ervah</i> forever. Therefore, if Shimon dies [childless], and this woman and another woman [who was married to Shimon] fall before Levi, neither are obligated to perform <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>.
[Moreover,] if Shimon [merely] gave a <i>ma'amar</i> to his <i>yevamah</i>, Reuven's wife, and died before he consummated his relationship with her, Levi should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with [Shimon's] other wife, but not <i>yibbum</i>. [The rationale is] that a <i>ma'amar</i> does not establish a completely binding relationship with a <i>yevamah</i>, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5, Halachot 2-3.<br>Through the <i>ma'amar</i>, Shimon established a connection with his <i>yevamah</i>. Therefore, our Sages ordained that Levi should not perform <i>yibbum</i> with Shimon's wife. Nevertheless, since Shimon did not establish a marriage that was binding according to Scriptural law with his <i>yevamah</i>, Levi is required to perform <i>chalitzah</i> with Shimon's wife.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (in its gloss on Halachah 10), notes that - as reflected in Halachah 25 - even if Shimon did not give a <i>ma'amar</i> to Reuven's wife, the very fact that she is under obligation to him is sufficient cause for Levi to be prohibited from performing <i>yibbum</i> with her. The Rambam did not mention this concept in this halachah, because: a) he was quoting the Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i>, Chapter 1), and b) he wanted to emphasize that even if Shimon gave Reuven's wife a <i>ma'amar</i>, Levi is still obligated to perform <i>chalitzah</i> with Shimon's wife. The <i>ma'amar</i> does not free her of obligation entirely.</i>
When a woman willingly commits adultery while married to her husband, and [her act is observed by] witnesses [he is required to divorce her].<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:18.</i> If he died [childless] before he divorced her, and she fell before a <i>yavam</i>, she is not obligated to perform <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>. Moreover, [her deceased husband's] other wives are also [not obligated to perform <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>], as if she were forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as an <i>ervah</i>. For just as impurity is mentioned with regard to the <i>arayot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">As Leviticus 18:24 states: "Do not become impure through any of these [forbidden relationships]."</i> so too, that term is mentioned with regard to such a woman, as [Numbers 5:13] states: "And she became impure."<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam regarding this matter and maintains that just as the woman's husband would have to give her a <i>get</i> to terminate their relationship, so too, her <i>yavam</i> must perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 173:11) follows the Rambam's ruling, while the Ramah mentions that of the Ra'avad.</i><br>When, however, the husband of a <i>sotah</i> dies [childless] before he has caused her to her drink the bitter waters,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>sotah</i> is not given the bitter waters to drink after her husband's death, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 2:7.</i> or if the woman must be divorced instead of drinking the bitter waters,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 2:2, there are some women whose fidelity should be tested by the bitter waters.

Similar rules [apply] if two <i>yevamot</i> come from one household and one of them was a <i>sh'niyah</i> to the <i>yavam</i>, [forbidden to him because of] a negative commandment or a positive commandment, or an <i>aylonit</i> - another wife of [her deceased husband] is permitted [to the <i>yavam</i>] and may perform <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>.<br>[Different rules apply, however, when a <i>yavam</i>] performed <i>chalitzah</i> with his <i>yevamah</i>, and then the sister, the mother, or another [close relative] of the woman with whom he performed <i>chalitzah</i> married another one of his brothers, that brother has another wife, and [the brother] dies [childless].<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Although Rashi offers a different interpretation for this concept, the halachic authorities follow the Rambam's view.</i> Just as the close relative of the woman with whom he performed <i>chalitzah</i> is forbidden to him, so too, is the other wife forbidden to him. Their status is like <i>sh'niyot</i>, and they should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum</i>.<br>Why did the Sages forbid [marriage] to a close relative of a woman with whom one performed <i>chalitzah</i>? Because it is difficult to distinguish her from a woman married to the same man as a woman with whom one performed <i>chalitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">If the relatives of a woman who performed <i>chalitzah</i> were permitted, one might think that another woman who was married to the deceased husband of the woman who performed <i>chalitzah</i> would also be permitted.</i>
When two <i>yevamot</i> come from one household and one of them was forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as an <i>ervah</i>, but she was also an <i>aylonit</i>, the other wife of [the deceased husband] is permitted [to the <i>yavam</i>] and may perform <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>. [The rationale is that] since the laws of <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i> do not apply with regard to an <i>aylonit</i>, it is as if she did not exist, and the obligation [of <i>yibbum</i>] falls on the other wife alone.<br>Similarly, if [the deceased] brother divorced the woman forbidden as an <i>ervah</i> or she dissolved their marriage through] <i>mi'un</i> before he died, or she died during the lifetime of the deceased brother, and then he died, his other wife is permitted and should perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>. We do not say that since she was married to the same man as an <i>ervah</i> once, she remains forbidden forever. For a woman married to the same man as an <i>ervah</i> does not become forbidden [to the <i>yavam</i>] unless they were [both married to the same man at the time of his death, when] the obligation of <i>yibbum</i> takes effect.
[In the situation mentioned in Halachah 14,] if there was a doubt regarding the status of the <i>kiddushin</i> of [the woman] who was forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as an <i>ervah</i> or there was a doubt that she was divorced, the other wife [of the deceased brother] should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is possible that the <i>ervah</i> was never married to the deceased, or that her marriage was already terminated, the <i>yavam</i> must perform <i>chalitzah</i> to enable the other wife to remarry. He may not, however, perform <i>yibbum</i>, for it is possible that the marriage of the <i>ervah</i> was effected by the kiddushin or not terminated by the divorce, in which instance, the <i>yavam</i> would be forbidden to have relations with the other wife of his deceased brother, as stated in Halachah 15.</i><br>[The same ruling applies if the woman who was forbidden] was a minor who is fit to absolve her marriage through <i>mi'un</i>, if she did not dissolve her marriage [to the deceased] brother during his lifetime, even though she did dissolve her obligation to] the <i>yavam</i> through <i>mi'un</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The minor nullifies her marriage retroactively through <i>mi'un</i>, and it is as if she had never been married at all. As such, the obligation of <i>yibbum</i> falls on the other wife. Nevertheless, since this halachic concept might not be known to all, our Sages forbade the other wife of the deceased from performing <i>yibbum</i>, lest the impression be created that a woman married to the same man as an <i>ervah</i> is also permitted (<i>Yevamot</i> 13a, 107b).</i> another woman married to her husband must perform <i>chalitzah</i>; she may not perform <i>yibbum</i>.
[In the situation mentioned in Halachah 14,] if the other woman [married to the deceased brother] married another man, and then it was discovered that [the woman forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as] an <i>ervah</i> was an <i>aylonit</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The other wife of the deceased was under the impression that she did not require <i>chalitzah</i> to be released, as stated in Halachah 15. Afterwards, it was discovered that the woman forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as an <i>ervah</i> was an <i>aylonit</i>, in which instance the obligation of <i>yibbum</i> falls solely on the other wife, as stated in Halachah 21. Thus, her second marriage involves a transgression and must be terminated. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 18.) Nevertheless, a child fathered by her second husband is not considered illegitimate, because the negative commandment violated is not punishable by <i>karet</i>.</i> the woman who married must be released by both her [second] husband and her <i>yavam</i>. Her [second] husband must divorce her with a <i>get</i>, while her <i>yavam</i> must perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her. [In this way,] she is permitted to marry another man.
[In the above situation], if the <i>yavam</i> performed <i>yibbum</i> with the other wife of the deceased, because he thought that the woman forbidden to him as an <i>ervah</i> was an <i>aylonit</i>, and it was discovered that she was not an <i>aylonit</i>, the <i>yavam</i> must divorce [the woman with whom he performed <i>yibbum</i>] with a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that ordinarily, when a woman is prohibited as an <i>ervah</i>, a <i>get</i> is not necessary. Nevertheless, an exception is made in this instance, lest people think that the deceased divorced his other wife before his death, and the act of <i>yibbum</i> was binding.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 173) maintains that a <i>get</i> is not required, and indeed suggests that this is also the Rambam's intent, but the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> was flawed by a printer's error.

This prohibition is punishable by <i>karet</i>. Hence, any child born to this couple - whether before or after he discovers that the <i>ervah</i> was an <i>aylonit</i> - is illegitimate.</i>
[In the following situation, <i>chalitzah</i> and not <i>yibbum</i> is required.] There were three brothers. Two were married to two sisters, and one was married to a woman who did not share a family connection. If the brother married to the woman who was not related died [childless], and then one of the brothers married to one of the sisters died [childless], [the remaining brother] should perform <i>chalitzah</i> but not <i>yibbum</i>, with the woman who did not share a family connection<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">His wife's sister, by contrast, need not perform <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>. She is free to marry any man.</i>. [The rationale is that] she was obligated to the second brother, and his other wife was the sister [of the surviving <i>yavam's</i>] wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to <i>yibbum</i>, the obligation to perform <i>yibbum</i> is powerful enough to have the woman considered the wife of a man whose other wife is an <i>ervah</i> to the <i>yavam</i>. Nevertheless, this comparison is not complete. For since the deceased brother never actually married her, she is obligated to perform <i>chalitzah</i>.</i><br>Moreover, even if one of the brothers who married one of the sisters divorced his wife after the brother married to the woman who was not related died [childless], and then he himself dies [childless], [the remaining brother] should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum, with the woman who did not share a family connection</i>. Since there was even one moment when this woman was obligated to the second brother while his other wife was the sister [of the surviving <i>yavam's</i>] wife [this prohibition was enforced].<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and others differ with the Rambam regarding this issue, maintaining that the prohibition is not applied when the second brother divorces his first wife.</i> For if [he] were [allowed to] perform <i>yibbum</i> with her, it is possible that [in such a situation, a brother] might perform <i>yibbum</i> with such a woman even when the second brother who died did not divorce his wife.
Why was this decree not applied when a marriage was involved? For example, if [a brother is married to two women,] one of them is forbidden [to his brother] as an <i>ervah</i> and one is not. If he divorces the wife who is forbidden and then dies childless, [the surviving brother] may perform <i>yibbum</i> with the wife [of the deceased brother], as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 21.</i><br>[The distinction is that] the prohibition against [performing <i>yibbum</i>] with a wife [of one's deceased brother] when one of his wives is forbidden [to the <i>yavam</i>] as <i>ervah</i> is known by all.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">And, as reflected in Halachah 14, it is of Scriptural origin.</i> Thus, if [the deceased brother] did not divorce the woman forbidden [to the <i>yavam</i>], no one would allow him [to perform <i>yibbum</i> with his brother's] other wife. The prohibition against [performing <i>yibbum</i> with] a woman who was obligated to [a man whose] other wife is forbidden [to the <i>yavam</i>] is not known to all, and it is possible that [in such a situation, a brother] might be allowed to [perform <i>yibbum</i> with] such a woman even when [the second brother who died] did not divorce the forbidden woman.
[In the following situation, <i>chalitzah</i> and not <i>yibbum</i> is required.] There were three brothers, all married to women who did not share any family connection. One of the brothers died [childless]. Another gave his <i>yevamah</i> a <i>ma'amar</i>, but died [childless] before he consummated his marriage to her. Thus, this woman and the wife of the second brother fell before the third brother.<br>These women should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum</i>, because the woman who was given the <i>ma'amar</i> has two obligations for <i>yibbum</i> incumbent on her.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since she did not perform <i>yibbum</i> with the brother who gave her the <i>ma'amar</i>, she is still obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i> because of her first husband, and since a <i>ma'amar</i> is considered equivalent to consecration, she is also obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i> because of the second brother who died.</i> As such, it is as if she had been married to two men. Our Sages interpreted the phrase [Deuteronomy 25:5] "the wife of the deceased," as a restriction. [One may perform <i>yibbum</i> with the wife of one deceased man,] but not [the wife of] two deceased men.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the second brother performed <i>yibbum</i> before dying, this restriction does not apply.</i><br>Therefore, whenever a woman has two obligations for <i>yibbum</i> incumbent on her, she should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum</i>. The same applies to the woman married to [the second brother who died]. The prohibition [against performing <i>yibbum</i> with these women] is Rabbinic in origin.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">It was stated above that the prohibition against marrying a woman who is obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i> because of two men is derived from a verse. Nevertheless, as reflected by the fact that <i>chalitzah</i> is required (<i>Yevamot</i> 31b), that verse is only an <i>asmachta</i>, a support. The source of the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin. (Note <i>Tosafot</i>, who differ and maintain that the prohibition is of Scriptural origin.)</i>
Why does [the <i>yavam</i>] not merely perform <i>chalitzah</i> with the woman who was given the <i>ma'amar</i> and is thus obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i> because of two men, and then perform <i>yibbum</i> with the [first] wife of [the deceased brother]? This is a decree instituted so that people will not say that when there are two <i>yevamot</i> coming from one household, one should perform <i>chalitzah</i> and the other <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 12, which states that once a <i>yavam</i> has foregone the privilege of <i>yibbum</i> by performing <i>chalitzah</i>, neither he nor his brothers may perform <i>yibbum</i> with any of the wives of that brother.</i> For this reason, [the Sages] forbade [performing <i>yibbum</i> with the deceased's first] wife.
[In the above instance, if the second brother] gave his <i>yevamah</i> a <i>ma'amar</i> and then gave her a <i>get</i> [to nullify] the <i>ma'amar</i>, [different rules apply] if he dies. [The woman] becomes permitted [to the third brother], for the <i>ma'amar</i> that caused her to be forbidden was nullified. He may perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i> with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">For the only obligation incumbent on her is due to the brother who died first. The third brother must also perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> with the wife of the second brother.</i>
[In the following situation, <i>chalitzah</i> and not <i>yibbum</i> is required. A <i>yavam</i>] who is below the age of majority, [but more than] nine years and one day old, enters into relations with his <i>yevamah</i> and dies before he attains majority. She then becomes obligated for <i>yibbum</i> to the minor's older brother for a second time. She should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum</i>. As we have explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5, Halachah 18.</i> relations in which a minor engages are considered equivalent to a <i>ma'amar</i> given by [a brother] past majority. Hence, the woman has two obligations for <i>yibbum</i> incumbent on her.
[The following rule applies when] a woman who was half [a Canaanite] maid-servant and half a freed woman<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., a Canaanite maid-servant who was owned by two partners, and one partner set her free, but the other did not.</i> was consecrated by Reuven. She was then given her freedom and was consecrated by [Reuven's brother,] Shimon. Afterwards, both [brothers] died. Levi, [a third brother, may] perform <i>yibbum</i> with [this woman]; she is not considered to be "the wife of two deceased men." For if her consecration by Reuven is effective, her consecration by Shimon is of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The consecration of such a woman is discussed in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:16.</i> And if her consecration by Shimon is effective, her consecration by Reuven is of no consequence.

Chapter 7

When two brothers were married to two sisters, [the brothers] both died, and it is impossible to know who died first,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The laws that apply when we do know which brother died first are stated in Halachot 3 and 4.</i> [a third brother who remains alive] may not perform <i>yibbum</i> with both of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to Scriptural law, it is forbidden to marry two sisters. As an extension of this prohibition, when one is obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i> with two sisters according to Rabbinic law, one is not allowed to marry either of them and must perform <i>chalitzah</i> with both.</i> Since they are both obligated to him, they both must perform <i>chalitzah</i> and not <i>yibbum</i>.<br>[The above ruling applies even] when one [of the <i>yevamot</i>] was forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as a <i>sh'niyah</i>, or because of a positive commandment or a negative commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For according to Scriptural law, the obligation of <i>yibbum</i> applies in all these instances, as stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 10.</i> If, however, one [of the <i>yevamot</i>] was forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as an <i>ervah</i> - e.g., she was his wife's mother or daughter - the sister is permitted [to the <i>yavam</i>]; he may perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>, as he desires. For both of the sisters were not obligated to him, since an <i>ervah</i> is not bound by this obligation.
When in the above situation there were four brothers,] and one [of the <i>yevamot</i>] was forbidden to one of the <i>yevamim</i> as an <i>ervah</i>, and the other <i>yevamah</i> was forbidden to the other <i>yavam</i> as an <i>ervah</i>, [the <i>yevamah</i>] who is forbidden to one [<i>yavam</i>] is permitted to his brother, and [the <i>yevamah</i>] who is forbidden to the other [<i>yavam</i>] is permitted to his brother. For [in both instances] only [the <i>yevamah</i>] who is permitted to him is obligated [to each brother]. [Each one] may perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> with [the <i>yevamah</i>] permitted to him, as he desires.
[In the above situation,] if one of the brothers died [and his identity was known], and his wife became obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i>, and then the other brother died, his wife - the sister of the first wife - became obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i>; [as long as] both remain alive, they both must perform <i>chalitzah</i> and not <i>yibbum</i>, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 1.</i>
If [the wife of] the second [brother] dies, the [wife of the] first becomes permitted again. She may perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>.<br>If [the wife of] the first [brother] dies, the [wife of the] second remains forbidden. She must perform <i>chalitzah</i> and may not perform <i>yibbum</i>. [The rationale is that she was not fit to perform <i>yibbum</i> at the time she came before [her <i>yavam</i>].<br>Similarly, if one of the brothers performed <i>chalitzah</i> with the [wife of the] second [brother] first,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (and the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 175:2) explain that this ruling applies only after the fact - i.e., he performed <i>chalitzah</i> with the second <i>yevamah</i> without asking Rabbinical guidance. Had he in fact asked the Rabbis, they would have prohibited it, lest he err and perform <i>chalitzah</i> with the other sister. Once, however, the <i>chalitzah</i> is performed, we do not fear that a mistake will be made by others on a subsequent occasion.</i> the [wife of the] first becomes permitted to the other brothers. For the obligation that caused her to become forbidden was removed by his brother by performing <i>chalitzah</i>.
Similarly, if [the wife of] the first [brother] was forbidden to one of the brothers as an <i>ervah</i>, and he performed <i>yibbum</i> with [the wife of] the second [brother] who was permitted to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since he was never permitted to marry the wife of the first brother who died, the wife of the second never became forbidden to him.</i> the [wife of the] first becomes permitted to the other brothers.

The first <i>yavam</i> who marries a <i>yevamah</i> is forced to separate because he has transgressed a Rabbinic prohibition. Even though he did not transgress in marrying his <i>yevamah</i>, the second <i>yavam</i> is forced to separate from her, because his marriage to her was made possible by a forbidden act, the first <i>yavam's</i> marriage.<br>Significantly, this represents a reversal of the Rambam's opinion from his rulings in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 3:1; <i>Eduyot</i> 5:5), where he rules that the couples may remain married. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 175) subscribes to that view. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 175:3) also mentions it, it appears that the Rambam's ruling in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> is favored.</i>
[Our Sages delivered these rulings in the following situation:] There were three brothers. Two were married to two sisters. One of the brothers married to the sisters died [childless]. The third [brother] gave a <i>ma'amar</i> to his <i>yevamah</i>, and then the husband of the second sister died, and the second sister also became obligated to the third brother. The third brother should divorce with a <i>get</i> [the sister] to whom he gave a <i>ma'amar</i>, and perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This law is fundamentally the same as Halachah 3. The <i>yavam</i> is forbidden to perform <i>yibbum</i> with either of the sisters. There is one added element: the fact that a <i>ma'amar</i> was given.<br>As explained in Chapter 5, Halachot 2-3, a <i>ma'amar</i> does not establish a complete marriage bond. If it established such a bond, the third brother would not be required to divorce his <i>yevamah</i> (and he would not be required to perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her sister). But since it does not, he cannot consummate his relationship with his <i>yevamah</i>. He must, however, divorce her, because of the connection established by the <i>ma'amar</i>.</i> And he should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with the other sister, to enable her to marry another man.
[In the above situation,] if the brother who gave the <i>ma'amar</i> [to the first brother's wife] died [childless], and he had another wife, both she and [the wife of the first brother] fall before [the brother] married to the sister of [the wife of the first brother]. The woman who was given the <i>ma'amar</i> is free from the obligations of <i>chalitzah</i> and <i>yibbum</i>, for she is the sister of [her <i>yavam's</i>] wife. The other woman should perform <i>chalitzah</i> and not <i>yibbum</i>, because the <i>ma'amar</i> does not fully acquire a woman [as a wife]<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected in Chapter 6, Halachah 25, even if the <i>yavam</i> who died had not given a <i>ma'amar</i> to the other <i>yevamah</i>, this woman would not have been able to perform <i>yibbum</i>. The new dimension contributed by this halachah is that the <i>ma'amar</i> does not free her from the obligation of <i>chalitzah</i>.</i> to the extent that another wife would be freed of the obligations [of <i>yibbum</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., had the <i>ma'amar</i> established a full marriage bond, she would not have been obligated at all. Since it does not, she must perform <i>chalitzah</i>.</i>
When a brother consecrates the sister of his <i>yevamah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This law applies if he consecrates her after his brother has died, and the obligation of <i>yibbum</i> is already incumbent upon him.

If all his brothers die,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Or he has no other brothers.</i> he must divorce with a <i>get</i> the woman he has consecrated, and perform <i>chalitzah</i> with his <i>yevamah</i>.<br>If the woman he has consecrated died, regardless of whether she died before the brothers died or after the brothers died, the <i>yevamah</i> becomes permitted. He may perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that he was forbidden to marry her while her sister was alive does not prevent him from marrying her after her sister's death (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 159:13).</i>
[The above laws become even more complicated if the brothers have more than one wife. For example,] there were three brothers. Two were married to two sisters, and each also had another wife. [The brothers] married to the sisters died [childless], and the sisters and the other wives fell before the <i>yavam</i>.<br>If he performs <i>chalitzah</i> with the other wives, the sisters are also freed of their obligation. If, however, he performs <i>chalitzah</i> with the sisters, the other wives are not freed of their obligations until they themselves perform <i>chalitzah</i>. [The rationale is that] the <i>chalitzah</i> performed by the sisters is not "superior,"<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Yevamot</i> 41a, it appears that whenever a <i>yavam</i> cannot perform <i>yibbum</i> with his <i>yevamah</i>, the <i>chalitzah</i> he performs with her is deemed "inferior."</i> and, as we have explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5, Halachah 12.</i> a <i>chalitzah</i> that is not "superior" does not free another wife [of the deceased] from her obligation.
It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This expression is employed by the Rambam in reference to a law that has no direct source in the Rabbinic works of the previous generations. The Rambam's rationale is that just as the Rabbinic prohibition against performing <i>yibbum</i> with the sister of a woman to whom one is obligated is sufficient to cause a <i>chalitzah</i> to be considered "inferior," so too, the prohibitions mentioned in this halachah should have a similar effect.<br>There are several early halachic authorities who rule differently from the Rambam on this issue. The Rambam's decision is, however, accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 174:1).</i> that this law also applies with regard to two <i>yevamot</i> coming from one household, when one is forbidden to her <i>yavam</i> as a <i>sh'niyah</i>, or because of a positive or negative prohibition. If the <i>yavam</i> performs <i>chalitzah</i> with the woman who is prohibited, [the deceased's] other wife is not freed of her obligation. If he performs <i>chalitzah</i> with the other wife, the woman who is prohibited is freed of her obligation.
[There is no need for <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> in the following situation:] There were three brothers. Two were married to two sisters, and the third was married to a woman who did not share a family connection with them. One of the brothers married to the sisters died [childless] and the brother married to the other woman performed <i>yibbum</i> with [the brother's] wife. Afterwards, the wife of the second brother, [i.e., the sister of the <i>yevamah</i>] died, and then the third brother [the one who performed <i>yibbum</i>, died childless]. Thus, his two wives fall before the second brother, who is [now] unmarried.<br>These women are free of the obligation to perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>. One, the sister of [the <i>yavam's</i> deceased] wife [is forbidden], because she was the sister of his wife at the time his brother died. [At that time,] she became forbidden to him forever, as the wife of a brother who was not alive at the time of his [older] brother's [death]. The other woman [is forbidden], because she is the other wife [of her deceased husband].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This represents a reversal of the Rambam's opinion in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 3:7), where he states that the deceased's other wife should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, because there is a doubt whether or not an obligation falls upon her.</i>
Similarly, when two brothers are married to two sisters and one of [the brothers] dies [childless], and then the wife of the other brother dies, [the wife of the first brother] remains forbidden [to the second brother] forever, since she was forbidden to him at the time [the obligation of <i>yibbum</i> first takes effect].<br>When, however, a man divorces his wife, remarries her and then dies [childless], she is permitted to the <i>yavam</i>. Although she was forbidden to him during his brother's lifetime at the time he divorced her, she became permitted [when he remarried her]. And at the time his brother died, she was permitted.
[The following rules apply when] a girl below the age of majority was given in marriage by her father, and her husband divorced her, remarried her and then died [childless] while she was still below the age of majority.<br>She is forbidden to her <i>yavam</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For the prohibition forbidding a woman divorced by her husband to her <i>yavam</i> is of Scriptural origin, while her remarriage is binding according to Rabbinic law alone.<br>The Ra'avad and Rabbenu Asher rule that the minor must perform <i>chalitzah</i> when she attains majority. The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> states this might also be the Rambam's intent (as reflected by the fact that he states that "she is forbidden to her <i>yavam</i>," and in the next halachah he adds that she "should not perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>"). Most commentaries do not, however, accept this interpretation.</i> for the divorce was a fully binding divorce, since she was married off by her father.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording is somewhat imprecise. The <i>kiddushin</i> the husband gives the father are binding according to Scriptural law, because the Torah granted him the right to consecrate her, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:11. If the girl is able to distinguish between a <i>get</i> and another object, she can be divorced according to Scriptural law, as stated in <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 2:19.</i> The remarriage, by contrast, is not fully binding, because the consecration of a minor is not a completely binding consecration, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Until she reaches the age of twelve and manifests signs of physical maturity, she is not able to effect <i>kiddushin</i> that are binding according to Scriptural law. (Moreover, the girl's father also does not have the potential to consecrate her again according to Scriptural law once she has been divorced, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:12.)</i>
The same law applies when a man divorces a woman who is mentally competent, she becomes a deaf-mute, he remarries her and dies [childless] while she is a deaf-mute. She is forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> and should not perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, the divorce is binding according to Scriptural law, while the remarriage is merely a Rabbinic institution.</i><br>Another woman married [to the deceased husband of] the minor or the deaf-mute may perform <i>chalitzah</i>, or <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since the remarriage of the minor or the deaf-mute is only a Rabbinic institution, while the marriage of the deceased's other wife is based on Scriptural law, the remarriage of the minor or the deaf-mute has no effect on the other wife's obligation to her <i>yavam</i>. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 173:23).</i><br>If [the deceased] remarried her while she was a minor or a deaf-mute, but she attained majority or regained her control of her faculties while married to him, and then he died [childless], she is permitted to her <i>yavam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">If her husband engaged in marital relations with her after she attained majority or regained control of her faculties, he acquires her as a wife according to Scriptural law.

When two brothers were married to two sisters, who were both below the age of majority and fit to dissolve their marriages through <i>mi'un</i>, or they were deaf-mutes, and one [of the brothers] dies [childless], his wife is not obligated to perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>, because she is the sister [of the <i>yavam's</i>] wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Since both sisters share the same status, we allow the marriage of the sister whose husband is alive to continue.

At this point, there is nothing preventing her husband from marrying her sister, his <i>yavam</i>. (See Chapter 4, Halachah 30.)</i>
[The following law applies when two brothers who are both deaf-mutes are married to two sisters, and one [of the brothers] dies [childless]. His wife is not obligated to perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>, because she is the sister [of the <i>yavam's</i>] wife.

Why did our Sages decree that a deaf-mute man must divorce his deaf-mute wife [in the above situation]?

See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:27-28.</i><br>Our Sages said: If the [deaf-mute's] wife will remain married to him, her sister will marry another man, [and this will be excused, for people] will say: "She was freed [from the obligations of <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i>] because she was the sister of [the <i>yavam's</i>] wife." [To prevent this impression from arising,] the deaf-mute must divorce his wife with a <i>get</i>, and her sister will be forbidden [to him] forever.
Similarly, when two brothers who are mentally competent are married to two sisters, one mentally competent and one a deaf-mute, and the husband of the deaf-mute dies, [his wife] is free [of the obligation of <i>yibbum</i>], because she is the sister of [the <i>yavam's</i>] wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Since both partners are mentally competent, their marriage is binding according to Scriptural law.</i><br>If the husband of the mentally competent [sister] dies, [his brother] should divorce his wife [the deaf-mute] with a <i>get</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since his marriage to the deaf-mute is only a Rabbinic institution, his obligation to the wife of his deceased brother, a requirement of Scriptural law, takes priority.

The deaf-mute was married to two mentally competent women, one of whom was forbidden to the mentally competent brother as an <i>ervah</i>.<br>If the deaf-mute brother dies [childless], both his wives are free from the obligations [of <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i>, based on the following rationale].<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one might think that although the mitzvot of <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i> do not apply with regard to the woman forbidden as an <i>ervah</i>, they do apply with regard to her deceased husband's other wife.<br>Generally, when a woman is forbidden as an <i>ervah</i>, her husband's other wives are not obligated, as stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 14. Nevertheless, since the deaf-mute's marriage is only a Rabbinic institution, one might think that the marriage to the woman forbidden as an <i>ervah</i> is not powerful enough to negate the obligation of <i>yibbum</i>. The Rambam's explanations that follow above are intended to counter this supposition.</i> If the marriage of the woman forbidden [to the <i>yavam</i>] as an <i>ervah</i> is considered a marriage, the second woman is considered to be the other wife [of her husband] and is also freed of obligation. If the marriage of the woman forbidden [to the <i>yavam</i>] as an <i>ervah</i> is not considered a marriage, the marriage of the other woman is also not considered a marriage.
If a man's daughter or the like<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., any other woman permitted to his brother, but forbidden to him as an <i>ervah</i>.

[The rationale is that] the marriage of the deaf-mute is not a fully binding marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">If it were a fully binding marriage, the deceased's other wife would be freed of the obligation of <i>chalitzah</i> as well, as mentioned in note 40. Nevertheless, because the marriage is effective according to Rabbinic law, <i>yibbum</i> is not permitted.</i>
Whenever we have mentioned "two sisters" in these laws, the intent is also a woman and her daughter, or her granddaughter and the like; i.e., two woman [for whom marriage to one causes] the other to be considered an <i>ervah</i>.<br>Similarly, whenever we have mentioned "the sister of [the <i>yavam's</i>] wife" or "the sister of his <i>yevamah</i>," the intent is also her mother or her daughter - i.e., any close relative who becomes forbidden [to the <i>yavam</i>] because of her [marriage].

Chapter 8

[The following rules apply when a man] consecrates one of two sisters, but does not know which one he has consecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 176:1), which states that this law applies even if the deceased brother never knew which sister he consecrated, and thus it was forbidden for him to consummate the marriage. Nevertheless, <i>chalitzah</i> is required.</i> and then dies [childless]. If he has one brother, [the brother] should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with both of them to enable them to marry other men.<br>If he has two brothers, one of them should first perform <i>chalitzah</i> with one of [the sisters], and the other should perform <i>yibbum</i> with the other one<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This and the laws that follow are based on the Rambam's conception (see Chapter 1, Halachah 2) that when possible, the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> takes precedence over the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah</i>. According to the Ashkenazic authorities, different laws apply.</i> [because of the following rationale]: If this was the woman consecrated by his brother, he performed <i>yibbum</i> with her. If she is not his brother's wife, he has married a woman [permitted to him] like any other woman, and <i>chalitzah</i> has already been performed for her sister, his brother's wife.<br>One should not perform <i>yibbum</i> with one of the women first, for perhaps the other was in fact his brother's wife, and he will have married a relative of the woman who is obligated [to perform <i>yibbum</i> with] him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is a Rabbinic prohibition.</i> If, without asking Rabbinic advice,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>). If a Rabbinical opinion was sought and then ignored, the <i>yevamim</i> are required to divorce their wives.</i> each of the brothers married one of the sisters, they are not forced to dissolve the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Although one of them surely violated a Rabbinic prohibition, since we are unable to determine which of them it was, they are both allowed to remain married. This follows the principle <i>sefeka d'rabbanan l'kula</i>, "When a doubt arises regarding the violation of a Rabbinic prohibition, the more lenient perspective is followed."</i>
[The following rule applies when] two [men who are not related,] each having one brother, consecrate two sisters, neither of the men knows which [sister] he consecrated, and they both die [childless]. Each [brother] should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with each of the sisters.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Even after the brother of one of the deceased performs <i>chalitzah</i> with both women, the brother of the other deceased may not perform <i>yibbum</i> with one of the sisters, because she is the sister of the woman with whom he is obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i> (or with whom he performed <i>chalitzah</i>).</i><br>[In the above situation, if] one of the deceased has one brother, and the other has two brothers, the one brother should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with both women first, and then one of the two brothers should perform <i>chalitzah</i> [with one woman] first, and the second one [should perform <i>yibbum</i> with the other].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This and the clause that follows are restatements of the principles mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> If, [without asking Rabbinic advice, each of the brothers] married [one of the sisters], they are not forced to dissolve the marriage.<br>[The above applies] even if the brothers were priests. [Although] there is a Rabbinic prohibition against a priest marrying a woman who performed <i>chalitzah</i>, the <i>chalitzah</i> performed by this woman was performed because of doubt, and [our Sages] did not enforce a decree with regard to a <i>chalitzah</i> performed because of doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In most instances, if there is a doubt with regard to a Rabbinic prohibition, one may <i>a priori</i> perform the act in question. In this instance, it is only after the fact that <i>yibbum</i> is permitted. The reason for this stringency is that <i>chalitzah</i> is performed in public, and when people see that a woman who performed <i>chalitzah</i> married a priest, they may not appreciate the details of the particular instance and come to the false conclusion that there is no prohibition in doing so (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>
In the above instance,] if both of the deceased had two brothers, one of one pair of brothers should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with one of the sisters, and one of the other pair of brothers should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with the other sister. Afterwards, the other brother from the first pair should perform <i>yibbum</i> with the sister with whom the brother from the other pair performed <i>chalitzah</i>, and the other brother from the second pair should perform <i>yibbum</i> with the sister with whom the brother from the first pair performed <i>chalitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This also is basically a restatement of the principles mentioned in the first halachah.</i><br>If both [brothers from one pair each] performed <i>chalitzah</i> with [one of the sisters] first, the brothers from the other pair should not both perform <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Although the woman may be his <i>yevamah</i>, she may also be the sister of the woman with whom he is obligated to perform <i>yibbum</i>, and whom he is therefore forbidden to marry.</i> Instead, one should perform <i>chalitzah</i> [with one of the sisters] first, and then his brother should perform <i>yibbum</i> with the other. If, without asking Rabbinic advice, each of the brothers married one of the sisters, they are not forced to dissolve the marriage.
[The following situation gives rise to several halachic questions:] A woman had sons, and one of her daughters-in-law also had sons. Both the woman and her daughter-in-law became pregnant and they gave birth in the same hiding place. [There was a disturbance] and the identity of the two children became confused [and it was not known who was the son of the mother, and who, the son of the daughter-in-law].<br>The two sons grew up and married and then died [childless]. How are their wives freed to marry others?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For it is unknown who should perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>, the sons of the mother or the sons of the daughter-in-law.</i><br>First, [one of] the sons of the daughter-in-law should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with [both women]; he should not perform <i>yibbum</i>. [The rationale is that] there is a doubt regarding the identity of each of the women. It is possible that she is the wife of his brother and thus permitted to him, but it is also possible that she is the wife of his father's brother and thus forbidden to him as an <i>ervah</i>.<br>Afterwards,] the sons of the elder woman may perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i>. [With regard to each of the women, the same question applies:] If she is his brother's wife, he is performing <i>yibbum</i>. And if she is the wife of his brother's son, she is permitted to marry him, because she has already performed <i>chalitzah</i>.
[In the above situation, the following procedure should be carried out if] the sons of the elder woman and her daughter-in-law whose identities had been established died [childless], and the two sons whose identities were confused were alive.<br>The sons whose identities were confused should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with the wives of the elder woman's sons; they may not perform <i>yibbum</i>. [The rationale is that] there is a doubt whether [each woman] is the wife of his father's brother and thus forbidden to him as an <i>ervah</i>, or the wife of his brother and thus permitted to her <i>yavam</i>.<br>With regard to the wives of the sons of the daughter-in-law: First, one should perform <i>chalitzah</i> and the other should perform <i>yibbum</i>. The rationale is that if the son of the daughter-in-law was the one who performed <i>chalitzah</i> first, he performed <i>chalitzah</i> with his brother's wife. The second one of those whose identities were confused was the son of the elder woman. He is permitted to marry the wife of his brother's son after her <i>yavam</i> performed <i>chalitzah</i> with her.<br>If it was the son of the elder woman who performed <i>chalitzah</i> first, he performed <i>chalitzah</i> with the wife of his brother's son, and his deed is of no consequence. The second one of those whose identities were confused was the son of the daughter-in-law, and he performed <i>yibbum</i> with his brother's wife.
[The following rules apply with regard to] a woman who did not wait three months after the death of her husband [before] remarrying].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 11:18, which states that a woman should wait three months after her husband's death, so that it will be possible to determine who fathered her child.</i> She remarried and gave birth, and it is not known whether the child she bore was fathered by the first husband and was born after a full term pregnancy, or whether it was fathered by the second husband and was born after a seven-month pregnancy.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For example, the woman remarried two months after her first husband's death and gave birth seven months after her second marriage. Thus, it is unknown whether her child was fathered by her first husband or her second.</i><br>If the woman bore other children to both her first and second husbands, and then this son whose [father's identity] is in doubt dies [childless], both the sons of the first husband and the sons of the second husband should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with [the deceased's] wife, but they should not perform <i>yibbum</i>.<br>[The rationale is that the obligation for] each of them to perform <i>yibbum</i> is doubtful, for perhaps he is not the paternal brother [of the deceased]. And he is definitely a maternal brother [of the deceased], and the wife of a maternal brother is always forbidden as an <i>ervah</i>. For this same [reason], the son whose [father's identity] is in doubt should perform <i>chalitzah</i> with any of the wives of [his other brothers], but should not perform <i>yibbum</i>.
If both this woman's first and second husbands had fathered another son<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The law that follows applies when the woman's husbands have each fathered only one other son with another wife.</i> with another wife, and one of these other sons died [childless], the son whose [father's identity] is in doubt may perform either <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i> with the wife of the deceased. [The rationale is] that if [the deceased] was his paternal brother, then he has performed <i>yibbum</i>. And if he was not his paternal brother, then they have no family connection at all, and he is permitted to marry [the deceased's] wife.
[In the above situation,] if the son whose [father's identity] is in doubt dies [childless], one of the two sons whose [father's identity] is known should first perform <i>chalitzah</i> with his wife, and afterwards the second should perform <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It is, however, forbidden for one of the sons to perform <i>yibbum</i> first, because it is possible that the deceased's wife is obligated to the other brother and must perform <i>chalitzah</i>.</i><br>[The rationale is that if the deceased] was his brother, then he has performed <i>yibbum</i>. And if he is not his brother, but rather the son of the other father, his wife has already performed <i>chalitzah</i> with her husband's brother [and is permitted to remarry].
[The following rules apply when] a woman's husband traveled to another country, his wife heard that he died and [on this basis] married another man, and then her first husband returned. If both husbands die [childless],<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even if only one of the husbands dies childless, his brother still must perform <i>chalitzah</i> and may not perform <i>yibbum</i>.</i> and they both have brothers, one of each husband's brothers should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, but not <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yibbum</i> is prohibited because, as stated in <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 10:5, such a woman is forbidden to both her husbands and must be divorced by both of them.<br>The <i>chalitzah</i> performed by the brother of the first husband is required by Scriptural law, while the <i>chalitzah</i> performed by the brother of the second husband is mandated by Rabbinic decree.</i>
[The following rules apply when there were] five women who each had a son whose identity had been established, and then the five women all gave birth together in a hiding place to five other sons, and the identities of the second group of sons became confused to the extent that it was not known who gave birth to whom. The sons whose identity became confused matured and married, and then these five men died [childless] and their five wives fell before the wives of the sons whose identity was known, but none of these sons knows who is the wife of his brother.<br>What must be done [so that these women can remarry]? Four [of the sons whose identity was known] perform <i>chalitzah</i> for one of the wives first, and the fifth son should marry her after she has performed <i>chalitzah</i> four times.
What is implied? If the woman was his brother's wife, he has performed <i>yibbum</i>. And if she is not his brother's wife, she is the wife of the brother of one of the other four, and they all performed <i>chalitzah</i> with her first.<br>Similarly, the second woman should have four [of the sons whose identity was known] - including the one who married the first [of the widows]<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., each of the sons whose identity is known should marry one of the widows instead of having one marry more than one. When one son marries more than one widow, we are certain that he did not perform <i>yibbum</i> twice. Either - or neither - of the women he married could have been his brother's widow, but there was only one widow, not two. Our Sages preferred having each of the sons marry one woman and thus take the chance that they were all fulfilling <i>yibbum</i>, rather than have one marry more than one. See <i>Yevamot</i> 98b.</i> - perform <i>chalitzah</i> with her, and the fifth one should marry her. [This process should be continued] until the five sons have married the five [widows] after each one performed <i>chalitzah</i> four times earlier.
When dealing with questionable situations of this nature, one should always have these principles at hand: When there is a doubt whether a woman is required to perform <i>chalitzah</i> with a particular man or not, she is not permitted to marry another man until that [first] man performs <i>chalitzah</i> with her.<br>Whenever there is a doubt whether a woman is forbidden to engage in relations with a man - whether because of a Scriptural prohibition or a Rabbinic prohibition - she should not perform <i>yibbum</i> with him.<br>Whenever a woman has performed a "superior <i>chalitzah</i>"<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 10.</i> or "acceptable relations,"<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 9.</i> another woman who was married to the same husband is permitted to marry another man.
Following the above patterns, you will be able to understand and rule with regard to any questionable situations that will arise with regard to <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i>. For we have explained all the fundamental principles on which one should rely. You will know who should perform <i>chalitzah</i>, who should perform <i>yibbum</i>, who is not obligated to perform <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i> and who is fit to perform <i>yibbum</i>.<br>With God's help, this concludes "The Laws of <i>Yibbum</i> and <i>Chalitzah</i>."
