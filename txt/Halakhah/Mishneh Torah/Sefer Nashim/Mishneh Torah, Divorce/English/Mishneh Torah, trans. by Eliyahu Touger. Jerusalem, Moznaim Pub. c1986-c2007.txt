Mishneh Torah, Divorce



Chapter 1

A woman may be divorced only by receiving a bill [of divorce].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. III, Chapter 49), the Rambam explains a rationale for this mitzvah. If it were possible to effect a divorce through speech alone, a woman might commit adultery and then try to free herself of liability by claiming that she had been divorced previously. Requiring a written bill of divorce prevents such a possibility from arising.</i> This bill is called a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>get</i> is Aramaic for legal document, and indeed when accompanied by a modifier is used to refer to other types of legal documents. Nevertheless, the most common use of the word is within the context of divorce, and when the term <i>get</i> appears without a modifier, it generally refers to a bill of divorce. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Gittin</i> 2:5.)</i><br>The Torah establishes ten principles as fundamental [for a divorce to be effective].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 222) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 579) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>The intent is not that it is a mitzvah to divorce one's wife, but rather that if a man does desire to divorce his wife, it is a mitzvah for him to follow the rules prescribed by the Torah. To cite a parallel example: There is not a mitzvah to eat meat. If, however, one does desire to eat meat, it is a mitzvah to have the animal slaughtered according to the rules prescribed by the Torah.</i> They are:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The details of all these principles are described in the halachot and chapters that follow.</i><br>a) That a man must voluntarily initiate the divorce;<br>b) That he must effect the divorce by means of a written document and through no other means;<br>c) That this document must communicate that he is divorcing [his wife] and releasing her from his domain;<br>d) That it should utterly sever the connection between the husband and his wife;<br>e) That [the <i>get</i>] should be written for the sake [of the woman being divorced];<br>f) That once [the <i>get</i>] is written, there should be no action [necessary] except its transfer to the woman;<br>g) That he should actually transfer [the <i>get</i>] to her;<br>h) That he should transfer [the <i>get</i>] to her in the presence of witnesses;<br>i) That he should actually transfer it to her for the sake of divorce;<br>j) That the husband or his agent should be the one who gives it to her.<br>The other requirements of a <i>get</i> - e.g., dating it, having it signed by witnesses and the like - are all Rabbinic institutions.
What are the sources that indicate that these ten requirements stem from Scripture itself? [They are derived from Deuteronomy 24:1, which] states: "And if it comes to pass that she does not find favor in his eyes, and he will write a bill of divorce for her, place it in her hand and send her from his home."<br>"If... she does not find favor in his eyes" - this indicates that he divorces her only on his own initiative. If a woman is divorced against her husband's will, the divorce is invalid. A woman may, however, be divorced either voluntarily or against her will.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is the law as prescribed by Scriptural and Talmudic law. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Gershom, one of the Sages who laid the foundations for Ashkenazi custom and tradition, ordained that, except in several unique instances, a man may not divorce his wife without her consent. This practice is followed universally within the Ashkenazi community (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 119:6) and has been accepted by many Sephardim as well.</i>
"And he will write" - this teaches that a woman can be divorced only by means of a written document.<br>"For her" - that it should be written for her sake.<br>"A bill of divorce" - i.e., a deed that severs the relationship between [the husband and his wife], without leaving him any jurisdiction over her. If [the relationship] between them is not entirely severed, the divorce is not effective, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.</i><br>"He will... place it in her hand" - this teaches that she is not divorced until the bill of divorce is placed in her hand, in the hand of her agent - which is considered to be her hand - or in her domain - which is considered to be her hand - as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 1.</i><br>"And he will... send her" - [the wording of] the <i>get</i> should indicate that he is sending her away and not that he is sending himself away from her.
What is implied? If he writes to her: "Behold you are sent away," "Behold you are divorced," "You are [now] independent," "You are now permitted [to marry] any man," or the like, the divorce is effective. The essence [of the text] of a <i>get</i> is the statement: "You are now permitted to [marry] any man."<br>If, by contrast, he writes to her: "I am no longer your husband," "I am no longer the one who consecrates you," or "I am no longer your man," the divorce is not effective. For "and he will... send her" implies that he should not send himself away from her.<br>Similarly, if a man writes to his wife: "Behold you are free," the divorce is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This wording is used in the deed freeing a slave from servitude and is not appropriate with regard to a woman's divorce.</i>
The Torah's expression, "And he will... send her from his home," does not mean that the divorce does not become effective until she leaves his home. Instead, the divorce becomes effective when the <i>get</i> reaches [a woman's] hand, even though she still is in her husband's home, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 8.</i> "And he will... send her" teaches that if he divorces her, but does not send her away from his home, it is as if he divorced her and then remarried [her]. Therefore, she requires another <i>get</i>, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachah 18.</i>
What is the source that teaches that once [the <i>get</i>] is written, there should be no action [necessary] except its transfer? The [sequence of the verbs] "And he will write..., [and] place," indicating that a <i>get</i> is acceptable only when [the only things] lacking are writing and transfer. This excludes an article that must be detached after it has been written.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 124:3), which states that the scribe should cut the paper or parchment used for the <i>get</i> to the right size before writing it. If he cuts it to size after he writes it, it is not acceptable according to Rabbinic law.</i><br>Therefore, if a man writes a <i>get</i> on the horn of a cow, he must give [his wife] the cow [for the divorce to be effective]. If he cut off the horn after he wrote [the <i>get</i>] on it, it is not effective. Similarly, if he wrote [a <i>get</i>] on a plant that was still attached to its source of nurture, the divorce is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the man gives the woman the entire plant and the land on which it grows, the divorce is void (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 124:4).</i> [This applies] even if the witnesses signed after it was detached.
We may not even write the standard text<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the standard text of the <i>get</i>, leaving blank places for the name of the man, his wife, the date and the line that states: "Behold, you are free to [marry] any man." See Chapter 3, Halachah 7.</i> of [a <i>get</i>] on an article that is attached to its source of nurture.<br>If [a scribe] writes the standard text of [a <i>get</i>] on an article that is attached to its source of nurture, and detaches it and afterwards writes the names of the husband and the wife, the date<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The date of the <i>get</i> is only a Rabbinic requirement. Nevertheless, if it is written while the <i>get</i> is still attached, the <i>get</i> is not acceptable according to Rabbinic law.</i> and the words, "Behold, you are permitted [to marry] any man," and the witnesses signed and it was given to her, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., at the outset, one should not write any portion of the <i>get</i> while it is attached to its source of nurture. After the fact, as long as the fundamental elements of the <i>get</i> were written after it was detached, it is acceptable.</i>
If the husband writes the <i>get</i> on a leaf growing in a flowerpot with a hole at the bottom, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable, even if he gives her the entire flowerpot. [This is] a decree, [lest] one detach [the leaf].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 124:12 and the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 124:12 both emphasize that the term "unacceptable" - <i>pasul</i> in Hebrew - implies that while the <i>get</i> is acceptable according to Scriptural law, it is unacceptable according to Rabbinic decree. Accordingly, they explain that this law applies when there is an interruption between the flowerpot and the earth. If there is no interruption, the <i>get</i> is void according to Scriptural law, because when a flowerpot has a hole at its base, it is considered as though it were attached to the ground.<br>Similarly, according to the <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 124:13, even when a <i>get</i> is written on the leaves of a plant growing in a flowerpot that does not have a hole at its base, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable according to Rabbinic decree.</i> He may, however, write [the <i>get</i>] on the pottery of the flowerpot and give it to her.
What is the source that teaches that [the <i>get</i>] must be given to her for the sake of divorce? It is written: "... a bill of divorce for her, place it in her hand," [implying that] he must place [it in her hand] for the sake of divorce. If, however, he gave it to her as a promissory note or as a <i>mezuzah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">From this and the following halachah, it appears that the Rambam maintains that it is sufficient that the husband state his intent to the witnesses; the woman need not know that she is being divorced. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Gittin</i> 78a, quoted by the Ramah in <i>Even HaEzer</i> 136:5) states that although the woman need not be informed by her husband at the time the <i>get</i> is given, she must be informed by the witnesses afterwards, or in some way have this matter made known to her. The commentaries question whether or not the Rambam differs with this view.</i> or he placed it in her hand while she was sleeping, and she awoke and [discovered] it in her hand, the <i>get</i> is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the latter instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 138:3) states that even if he tells the witnesses: "See the <i>get</i> that I am giving her," the divorce is void.<br>From this clause, it appears that, in addition to the husband's intent, the Rambam requires that the woman take an active part in receiving the <i>get</i>, even if she is not totally aware of what it is.</i> If, however, he told her afterwards, "Behold this is your <i>get</i>, the divorce is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rav David Arameah, this clause applies to all the instances mentioned in the halachah.</i>
[The above principle must be clarified in the context of the following law.] A man tells witnesses, "See the <i>get</i> I am giving her," and then he tells [his wife]: "Take this promissory note," [the <i>get</i>] is effective. For he has told the witnesses that he was giving it to her for the sake of divorce. He told her that it was a promissory note only because he was embarrassed [to face] her.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">We accept this rationale and do not say that he nullified the <i>get</i> with his statements.</i>
At the time he gives the <i>get</i>, [a man who] divorces [his wife] must tell her: "Behold, your <i>get</i>," or "This is your <i>get</i>," or the like. If he places the <i>get</i> in her hand without saying anything, the <i>get</i> is not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned previously, the word <i>pasul</i> generally means "unacceptable according to Rabbinic decree." (See Chapter 2, Halachah 7; Chapter 10, Halachah 2.) In this instance, however, there are authorities who maintain that the Rambam's intent is that the <i>get</i> is utterly void. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 136) and Rabbenu Nissim indeed rule in that manner.<br>The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 136:1, however, explains that the <i>get</i> itself indicates the purpose for which it is given. Hence, in contrast to <i>kiddushin</i> (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:8), even if it is given in silence, it is acceptable according to Scriptural law and disqualified only by the Rabbis.</i><br>When does the above apply? When the husband was not speaking to her about divorce [immediately beforehand]. If, however, he had been speaking to her about divorce [at the time], and he takes the <i>get</i> and places it in her hand without saying anything, the divorce is acceptable.
[The following rules apply when] a <i>get</i> has been placed on the ground, and [the husband] tells [his wife], "Pick your <i>get</i> up from the ground," or it was tied to his hand or to his thigh, and she takes it from him. Even if after it reaches her possession, he tells her, "Behold this is your <i>get</i>," it is void.<br>[The rationale is] that it is written: "And he will... place it in her hand," [implying] that she may not take it on her own accord.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1, where the Rambam states this explicitly.</i> And [in these instances,] neither [the husband] nor his agent gave it to her.<br>If, however, he bends his body toward her,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Gittin</i> 78a, Rabbenu Asher offers a slightly different conception of the activity necessary for a husband to perform so that helping his wife take the <i>get</i> is considered "giving." The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 138:1) quotes both views, but appears to favor that of Rabbenu Asher.</i> or tilts his hand until she takes the <i>get</i> from him and says,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 8:2), it appears that this statement must be made in the process of transferring the <i>get</i>, and not afterwards.</i> "Behold this is your <i>get</i>," the <i>get</i> is [effective].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For he has performed an action making it easier for her to take the <i>get</i>.</i>
What is the source that teaches that [a <i>get</i>] must be given in the presence of witnesses? [Deuteronomy 19:15] states: "According to the words of two witnesses or those of three witnesses will the matter be established."<br>It is impossible that on one day a woman will be considered to be forbidden and sexual relations with her punishable by execution, and on the next day she should be permitted [to any man] unless [the divorce is observed by] witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The transition of a woman from a state where she is forbidden to one in which she is permitted is one of the "matters" referred to in the above verse.</i><br>Therefore, if [a husband] gives [his wife] a <i>get</i> in private, or even if the exchange is observed by one witness, the divorce is utterly void.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that there is a fundamental difference between the function of witnesses in cases involving financial matters and their function with regard to marriage and divorce. With regard to financial matters, the function of witnesses is to clarify the truth (<i>eidei berur</i>). With regard to marriage and divorce, by contrast, the witnesses' function is to notarize the event (<i>eidei kiyyum</i>). For a marriage bond to be established - or broken - even when the husband and wife agree that the event took place, witnesses must observe the proceedings (<i>Tumim</i> 90:14; <i>Tzafenat Paneach; K'lallei HaTorah</i>).</i>
When does the above apply? When the <i>get</i> is written by a scribe.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">And not signed by the scribe. If the scribe also signs the <i>get,</i> the signature of one witness is enough for the <i>get</i> to be acceptable according to the Rambam. (See the notes on Chapter 2, Halachah 2.)</i> When, however, the husband writes the <i>get</i> himself, one witness signs it,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">According to Scriptural law, the <i>get</i> is acceptable, for the husband's writing is equivalent to the testimony of one hundred witnesses. It is unacceptable only because of a Rabbinic decree. Indeed, even if the witness did not sign the <i>get</i>, the exact same laws would apply. The Rambam mentions the signature of the <i>get</i> by a witness only to clarify that, even with such a signature - in contrast to a <i>get</i> signed by a scribe and another witness - the <i>get</i> is still disqualified by the Rabbis (<i>Beit Yosef, Even HaEzer</i> 130).</i> and [the husband] gives it to her, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable [only by Rabbinic decree,]<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In such an instance, if the woman transgresses this Rabbinic prohibition and marries again on the basis of this <i>get</i>, she is allowed to remain married. Other authorities, however, maintain that since the <i>get</i> was given without being observed by witnesses, it is void according to Scriptural law, and the woman must leave her second husband (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 130:31).</i> {and the woman is forbidden to marry a priest}.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Although present in the standard texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, this phrase is lacking in the authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the text. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that it is self-evident from the previous clause, and therefore is most likely a printer's addition. For this reason, we have set it off in braces.</i>
It is an ordinance [enacted] by our Sages that witnesses should sign a <i>get</i>, lest a [husband] give [his wife] a <i>get</i> in the presence of two [witnesses], and they die.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 34b, 36a explains that there is a difference of opinion between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Eliezer maintains, as stated here by the Rambam, that the fundamental requirement for witnesses is with regard to the witnesses who observe the transfer of the <i>get</i>. The signing of the <i>get</i> by witnesses is merely a Rabbinic ordinance. Rabbi Meir, by contrast, maintains that the fundamental requirement is for the witnesses to sign the <i>get</i>. Most authorities follow the perspective of Rabbi Eliezer. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> maintains, however, that <i>a priori</i>, the perspective of Rabbi Meir should also be respected.<br>At present, the custom is that the witnesses who sign the <i>get</i> also observe its transfer (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:1).</i> [In such an instance,] the <i>get</i> she possesses is no more than a shard, for there are no witnesses [to testify to its authenticity]. [To prevent such a situation, our Sages] ordained that the testimony [regarding the authenticity of the <i>get</i> should be contained] within it.<br>Although witnesses [have signed] within, [the husband] must give [the <i>get</i>] to [his wife] in the presence of two [witnesses] - whether the same witnesses who signed it or two others. For in essence, divorce is established by virtue of the witnesses [who observe] the transfer [of the <i>get</i>].
When two witnesses sign [the <i>get</i>], and [the husband] transgresses and gives [the <i>get</i>] to [his wife] in private, or if it is discovered that the witnesses [who observed] the transfer [of the <i>get</i>] were unsuitable,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they were deemed unworthy of serving as witnesses because of family ties to the couple, their violation of Scriptural law or other reasons, as detailed in <i>Hilchot Edut</i>, Chapters 9-16).</i> the divorce is effected.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling indicates that although Rabbi Eliezer places an emphasis on the witnesses who observe the transfer of the <i>get</i>, he does not negate the effect of the signature of the <i>get</i> by witnesses.</i> For the witnesses [who signed the <i>get</i>] are acceptable, and the <i>get</i> exists in the woman's possession. Some of the <i>geonim</i> have ruled that [the <i>get</i>] is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 133:3 notes that <i>Tosafot</i> and Rabbenu Asher maintain that such a <i>get</i> is utterly void. He questions why the Rambam states that this opinion considers it unacceptable merely according to Rabbinic decree. If Rabbi Eliezer does not accept the signature of witnesses as sufficient, seemingly the <i>get</i> would be of no consequence whatsoever, not merely disqualified by the Sages.</i>
If the witnesses [who signed the <i>get</i>] are unsuitable - or even if one was unsuitable and one was acceptable - and [the husband] gave it to her in the presence of two acceptable witnesses, [the <i>get</i>] is unacceptable. It is as if it were a forgery.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 4a explains that even Rabbi Eliezer, who puts the emphasis on the witnesses who observe the transfer of the <i>get</i>, would disqualify such a <i>get</i>. Although - as stated in the following halachah, a <i>get</i> that was not signed by any witnesses is acceptable - when it is signed by unsuitable witnesses, it is not.</i>
If the witnesses signed [the <i>get</i> at a position] more than two lines away from the text [of the <i>get</i>], it is unacceptable.<br>How far may the witnesses sign away from the text? Less than two lines, so that their [names] will be read together with [the text].<br>When does the [disqualification] mentioned above apply? When the <i>get</i> is in the woman's possession, and there are no witnesses [who observed its] transfer. If, however, [the husband] gave [his wife the <i>get</i>] in the presence of witnesses, [the <i>get</i>] is acceptable even if the witnesses'[signatures] are far removed from the text.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that if such a <i>get</i> were given, it would be unacceptable despite the fact that witnesses observed its transfer. Many authorities, however, follow the Rambam's view. (See Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:1.)<br>The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 130:3 questions the Rambam's decision, noting that in <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i> 27:5, the Rambam states that a contract of loan is invalid if the witnesses sign more than two lines away from the text, and he does not mention the option of making it acceptable by giving it in the presence of witnesses. He explains that laws regarding business contracts differ, because they must serve as proof over an extended period of time.<br><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> explains that this explanation is supported by the distinction between the role of witnesses with regard to marriage and divorce, and their role with regard to business agreements mentioned in the notes on Halachah 13. Since the role of witnesses in business agreements is to clarify the terms of the agreement, such a document is not acceptable, because particulars can be added. With regard to marriage and divorce, by contrast, the witnesses' function is merely to notarize the event, and this is accomplished by the witnesses who observe the transfer of the <i>get</i>.</i> [Moreover, this ruling applies] even when there were not any witnesses who signed [the <i>get</i>]. For in essence, divorce is effected by virtue of the witnesses [who observe] the transfer [of the <i>get</i>].
It is required to read the <i>get</i> [aloud] in the presence of the witnesses who observe its transfer.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since the witnesses who observe the transfer of the <i>get</i> are essential for the divorce to be effective, they must know that the document transferred is in fact a <i>get</i> (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 135:1).</i> Afterwards, it should be given to her. If it was given to her in their presence first, it should be taken from her and read [aloud] after it was given to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 135:1) states that it is customary to read the <i>get</i> aloud both before and after it is given.</i><br>[The following rule applies when the witnesses] read [the <i>get</i>] while it is the possession of the husband or his agent, and they return it to him. If he encloses it within his hand, [obscuring it from the witnesses' view] and then gives it to her, they should read it again.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">After quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 135:2) states that if the husband manifests possession of the <i>get</i> after giving a document of unknown contents to the woman, his word is accepted if she has not remarried already. If, however, she has remarried, his word is not accepted.</i>
[In the latter instance,] if they did not read it, and it is taken and thrown into the sea or into a fire, the divorce is effective. Since [the witnesses] read it first, we do not suspect that it was exchanged [for another document]. Moreover, even if the husband said, "It was another document [that I gave her] and not the <i>get</i> that you read," his word is not accepted and the divorce is effective.
[If, however,] they did not read the <i>get</i> beforehand, the husband gives it to [his wife] in their presence, and then it is thrown into a fire or into the sea, the status of the divorce is doubtful.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">A second <i>get</i> is necessary. Even if the woman remarries, she must leave her second husband, as explained in Chapter 10, Halachah 3.</i> [This applies] even if the husband says that it was an acceptable <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to this, <i>Gittin</i> 19b states: "Just as his statements are not acceptable to cause her to be forbidden, they are not acceptable to cause her to be permitted."</i>
If he threw the <i>get</i> into [the woman's] courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Placing the <i>get</i> in a domain belonging to the woman is equivalent to placing it in her hand.</i> among barrels in the presence of witnesses,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This instance also describes a situation in which the witnesses have not read the <i>get</i>. If they have read the <i>get</i>, the woman's status is in doubt, and we suspect that she has been divorced (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 135:5).</i> and when they looked for it they found a <i>mezuzah</i> or another document, we do not suspect that she [has been divorced]. [We assume that] the article that was found was the one that was thrown.<br>If two or three <i>mezuzot</i> or documents were discovered there, and we suspect that perhaps he threw a <i>get</i> and it was dragged away by mice, the status of the woman's divorce is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Since he threw only one document and others were discovered, we cannot say with assurance that the article discovered was the one thrown.</i>
The witnesses who sign the <i>get</i> must know how to read and sign [their names]. If they do not know how to read, we read [the <i>get</i>] in their presence,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The present custom is that both of the witnesses and the Rabbi arranging the divorce read the <i>get</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 154; <i>Seder HaGet</i> 66).</i> and they sign, provided they understand the wording of the <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130), Rav Yosef Karo explains that the Rambam maintains that if the witnesses do not understand the wording of the <i>get</i>, the divorce is not effective. There is no option of translating it for them, for a witness must have first-hand experience of the matter concerning which he testifies. Hearing its translation from another person would be considered second-hand experience. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 130:27, however, quotes other opinions that do not accept this understanding.</i><br>If they do not know how to sign [their names], we write out their signatures for them on the paper with spittle or with other substances that will not leave a permanent mark,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, a permanent mark would be left, it is forbidden, for writing that covers an existing text is inadmissible.</i> and they sign [their names] over these markings.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:16) states that this is not acceptable, and instead stencils for the witnesses' signature should be made.</i><br>This practice is not followed with regard to other legal documents. It is a leniency adopted with regard to bills of divorce, so that Jewish women will not be forced to live without a marriage partner.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">We fear that the woman's husband will leave for a foreign country without giving her a divorce, or that he will die and she will be forced to perform either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> (<i>Gittin</i> 19a).</i> [This leniency is granted] because the signature of witnesses on a bill of divorce is a Rabbinic institution, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 15 above. I.e., if the matter were a point of Scriptural law, there would not be room for such leniency.</i>

Such a <i>get</i> would look acceptable if signed by only two witnesses, but in fact would not be acceptable. To prevent such a circumstance from arising, our Sages required that all the witnesses sign in the presence of each other.</i><br>Similarly, our Sages ordained that the date of a <i>get</i> and the place where it was written be recorded [within it], as is required with regard to other legal documents.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i> 23:6.</i> [This was required] lest one's wife also be one's relative and she commit adultery.

For if we see that the date of the <i>get</i> is incorrect, we would disregard the date and consider the <i>get</i> as if it had no date at all.<br>b) The woman would not receive the rights to her property when due her.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> follows a slightly different perspective.</i><br>[For a <i>get</i> to be acceptable,] it is necessary that it be signed at the time it was written and in the place where it was written.
A <i>get</i> is acceptable if [the husband] cut off [the portion of the <i>get</i> that contained] the date and gave it to her,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam appears to follow Rabbenu Chanan'el's interpretation of <i>Gittin</i> 17b, that our Sages did not suspect that a person would attempt a deception of such a scale to deceive the court.

Therefore, even these less precise dates are also acceptable.<br>The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 127:12 explains that a <i>get</i> that was predated or postdated is unacceptable because the date is false, not merely imprecise.

Similarly, [our Sages] ordained that the year of the ruling kingdom of that time should be mentioned in a <i>get</i> to gain the favor of the ruling authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., dating our legal documents according to the rulers' years indicates the rulers' importance (Rashi, <i>Gittin</i> 80a).</i><br>[The following rules apply if] a person writes a <i>get</i> and dated it according to the years of a kingdom other [than that of his locale] or according to the years beginning from the Temple's construction or destruction. If it is customary for people in that locale to date [their documents] in this manner, it is acceptable. If this is not the local custom, it is unacceptable.<br>It has already become the universal Jewish custom to date <i>gittin</i> from the time of creation,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">This is the present custom.

[The following rules apply when] a person tells two [colleagues]: "Write a <i>get</i> for my wife, sign it and give it to her," and the matter was delayed several days or years, or the <i>get</i> was [discovered to contain an imperfection causing it] to be [considered] void, and it was necessary to write a new <i>get</i> that was acceptable, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 8.</i> In such an instance, the date and the place when and where the <i>get</i> was written are recorded, and not the date and place when and where the husband told them to compose the <i>get</i>.<br>What is implied? If the husband told them [to write the <i>get</i>] in Jerusalem, in [the month of] Tishrei, and [the agents] delayed and did not write it until Nisan, at which time they were located in Lod, the <i>get</i> should be dated in Nisan, and Lod [should be recorded as its place], for this is where the <i>get</i> was written.

Chapter 2

The Torah's statement [Deuteronomy 24:1], "And he will write a bill of divorce for her and place it in her hand," refers both to [a husband] who writes [the <i>get</i>] with his own hand and to one who tells [another person] to write it for him. Similarly, [the husband] may place it in her hand or tell an agent to give it to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In most matters of Torah law, a person is able to charge an agent to act on his behalf. From the Rambam's wording, <i>Terumat HaDeshen</i> (Responsum 228) and the <i>Kovetz</i> deduce that the Rambam requires that not only the person who gives the <i>get</i>, but also the scribe, must be appointed as agents. This decision is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 120:1). Moreover, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> continues, stating that in addition, the scribe must write the <i>get</i> with paper and ink belonging to the husband.<br>There are, however, other opinions, which maintain that the scribe need not be appointed as an agent. (See Chapter 3, Halachah 16 and notes.)</i><br>The verse states, "And he will write," only to teach that divorce is effective only through the medium of a written document. "And [he will] place it" teaches that the woman may not take [the <i>get</i>] herself.
When [a husband] tells two [colleagues]: "Write a <i>get</i>, sign it, and give it to my wife," the two may write it, sign it,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difficulty in this instance, for the scribe must also act as one of the witnesses who sign the <i>get</i>. <i>Tosafot</i> and many other authorities rule that a <i>get</i> signed by a scribe is unacceptable. In the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130), Rav Yosef Karo explains that the Rambam agrees that <i>a priori</i>, the scribe should not act as one of the witnesses who sign the <i>get</i>. When there is no alternative, however, it is acceptable. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)</i> and give it to her. They are [the husband's] agents [for the divorce], and they are the witnesses [to it].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, the act the agent effects does not concern him. Therefore, there is no difficulty in his serving as a witness to it. (See also <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:16.)</i><br>Similarly, if [the husband] tells a scribe: "Write a <i>get</i> for my wife for me," and he tells the witnesses to sign, the <i>get</i> may be written, signed and given to [the husband]. He may use it to divorce his wife whenever he desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There are two points of clarification that must be made with regard to this ruling: First, if the husband enters into privacy with his wife after having the <i>get</i> written, the <i>get</i> is nullified, for we assume that the couple engaged in sexual relations, as reflected in Chapter 3, Halachah 5.<br>Second, there is the problem that the <i>get</i> is predated - i.e., although it was dated on the day it was written, it is the giving of the <i>get</i> and not the writing of the <i>get</i> that effects the divorce. Thus, the date on which the <i>get</i> was given and the date of the divorce are not the same.<br>With regard to that issue, we are forced to say that the Rambam does not consider it to be problematic. Indeed, when discussing the issue of predated <i>gittin</i> (Chapter 1, Halachah 25), the Rambam makes no mention of this matter at all. Other authorities differ, and it is their view that is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 127:5), which states that if a <i>get</i> is not given on the day on which it was written, it is acceptable only when given by an agent. (See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 127:7.)</i>
We may write a <i>get</i> for a man even when he is not accompanied by his wife, provided the witnesses and the scribe who wrote and signed [the <i>get</i>] know the identity of the man and his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i> 24:3-4. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> emphasizes that there are several points to be derived from an analysis of the Rambam's choice of wording in the present halachah and in that source:<br>a) Even if the man is accompanied by a woman he claims to be his wife, the witnesses may not sign a <i>get</i> for her until this fact is established.<br>b) It is not significant whether or not the scribe knows the identity of the man and his wife. When the scribe does not sign the <i>get</i> (see the notes to the previous halachah), it is the witnesses alone who must be aware of the identity of the husband and wife.<br>c) As long as a person's name has been established in a city for thirty days - even if it is only according to his own statements - this is sufficient.<br>d) The witnesses must also know the names of the father of the husband and of the wife.<br>e) The person's father's name can also be established on the basis of his own statements.</i><br>If there are two men in a city whose names are the same and whose wives' names are the same, one may divorce his wife only in the presence of the other. [This safeguard was enacted] lest one [of the men] have a <i>get</i> written and give it to the wife of the other man, causing her to [be considered] to be divorced from [her husband].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Bava Batra</i> 10:3), it appears that the intent is to prevent the woman receiving the <i>get</i> from engineering such an act of deception.<br>Our translation is based on authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The standard printed text states "causing her to be forbidden to him," i.e., she will think that she has been divorced, and on that basis, she will marry another man, and thus become forbidden to her first husband.</i>
In a time of danger,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A time of danger means an instance when the husband is in danger of dying and asks to have a <i>get</i> written for his wife, so that she will not have to undergo the rites of either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i> (<i>Gittin</i> 66a).</i> we may write a <i>get</i> [on behalf of a husband] and give it [to his wife], even though we are not aware of [their identities].<br>It is the woman who always pays the scribe's fee.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Although according to Scriptural law it is the husband who should pay for the writing of the <i>get</i> (for it is his responsibility), <i>Bava Batra</i> 168a explains that our Sages transferred this obligation to the woman, lest the husband lack the financial resources and cause the woman to wait unnecessarily for her <i>get</i>.</i>
The husband himself must tell the scribe to write [the <i>get</i>] and the witnesses to sign [it]. When a court of law<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam mentions a court of law to indicate that in this instance, their authority is no greater than that of an ordinary person.</i> or two [colleagues] ask a man: "Shall we write a <i>get</i> for your wife?" and he tells them to write [it and sign it],<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed addition is made on the basis of the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i> it is acceptable if they themselves write [the <i>get</i>] and sign it.<br>If, however, they tell a scribe [to write] and he does, and they tell witnesses [to sign] and they do, the <i>get</i> is void, because it was written by someone who was not told to write it by the husband himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The husband charged these individuals with the composition and the signing of the <i>get</i>. They do not have the authority to convey this responsibility to someone else.<br>In other instances, an agent can transfer his agency to another person, but here the scribe and the witness were charged with only a verbal command, and a verbal command cannot be transferred to another agent (<i>Gittin</i> 66b).</i> [This ruling applies] even when they give [the <i>get</i>] to the husband, who in turn gives it to his wife in the presence of witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For the difficulty is with the composition of the <i>get</i> itself.</i>
When [a man] tells two or three [colleagues]: "Tell a scribe to write a <i>get</i> for my wife and tell the witnesses to sign," and they convey these instructions, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the previous halachah, in which the <i>get</i> is deemed void, here the Rambam rules that it is unacceptable. This more lenient ruling is given because in this instance, the husband's colleagues carried out his instructions.<br>The Ra'avad and many other authorities also consider this <i>get</i> to be void, for they maintain that the scribe must hear his appointment from the husband directly. The Rambam, however, maintains that the divorce is acceptable according to Scriptural law. As a safeguard, the Rabbis did not accept it, lest a woman hire agents who will tell the scribe and witnesses to compose a <i>get</i> in the husband's name, even though he did not convey such instructions (<i>Gittin</i> 67a).</i> [The same ruling applies if the husband] tells two [colleagues] to tell a scribe to write a <i>get</i> and tells them to sign it.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For the husband did not convey the instructions to the scribe himself.</i><br>This matter should be deliberated upon at length, because the <i>get</i> is close to being considered void.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rav David HaCohen interprets this to mean that this case is judged more severely than other <i>gittin</i> that are unacceptable, and the status of the woman's divorce is in doubt. This is also the ruling of the Ramah. Rav Moshe Alshacar, however, differs and maintains that there is no difference between this instance and others in which the <i>get</i> is deemed unacceptable.</i>
What is the difference between the terms "unacceptable" (<i>pasul</i>) and "void" (<i>bateil</i>)? Whenever this text refers to a <i>get</i> as "void," that means that according to Scriptural law it is void. Whenever the term "unacceptable" is used, it refers to a <i>get</i> deemed unacceptable by Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The practical difference between these two terms is explained in Chapter 10, Halachot 1 and 2. When a <i>get</i> is void, the woman's first marriage is not annulled, and she must leave her second husband if she has remarried. Any children she bears the second husband are considered to be <i>mamzerim</i>. When the <i>get</i> is deemed unacceptable by our Rabbis, by contrast, the woman should not remarry, but if she does remarry she is allowed to remain married to her second husband.</i>
When a husband brings a <i>get</i> that has been signed in his hand and tells [two colleagues]: "Give this <i>get</i> to my wife," they should give it to her [and it is acceptable].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">We do not suspect that the husband had a void or unacceptable <i>get</i> composed and gave it to his wife to cause her difficulties (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>If he tells others to write a <i>get</i>, sign it and give to his wife, and they write it, sign it and give it to her, and then it is discovered that the <i>get</i> is void or unacceptable, they may write another <i>get</i> - or even 100 other <i>gittin</i> - until the woman receives an acceptable <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">We do not say that the agency with which they were entrusted involved only the composition of one <i>get</i>, and that they must receive a new charge from the husband before writing another one.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 122:1) states that if the <i>get</i> is not unacceptable, but does not conform with the standard demanded by the local Rav, the scribe does not have the right to write a second <i>get</i>, for the agency with which he was charged by the husband has already been discharged. Therefore, it is customary for a husband to tell the scribe and the witnesses to write as many <i>gittin</i> as necessary, until one finds favor in the eyes of the Rav arranging the divorce.</i>
If the husband tells [two colleagues]: Write and sign [a <i>get</i>] and give it to an agent to bring to her, and they do as they were charged, but it was discovered that the <i>get</i> was void or unacceptable, they may not write another [<i>get</i>] until they consult the husband.<br>[The rationale is] that [the husband] did not charge them with [effecting the divorce]. Perhaps he wanted merely that they write [the <i>get</i>] and give it to the agent. [If so, their agency was completed,] and nothing remains for them to do, for they have written it and given it [to the agent]. Therefore, they should not write another [<i>get</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">If the husband had in fact given them only such a limited agency, were they to have another <i>get</i> written, they would no longer be acting in the agency of the husband, but rather on their own initiative.<br>Rav Moshe HaCohen differs with the Rambam on this point, maintaining that since they did not write an acceptable <i>get</i>, their agency was not completed. For the husband did not charge them with writing a worthless piece of paper; he wanted them to write a <i>get</i>. Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 122:7, who interprets the disqualifying factor mentioned by the Rambam as referring to a disqualification that occurred after the <i>get</i> was given to the agent. He maintains that if a <i>get</i> that was void or unacceptable was given to the agent, even the Rambam would allow the writing of another <i>get</i>.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 122:2) quotes the ruling of the Rambam, while the Ramah follows the opinion of Rav Moshe HaCohen.</i><br>If they do write another <i>get</i> that is acceptable and give it to the agent - who in turn gives it to the wife - the status of the divorce is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">We are not certain that their agency was limited in scope. Perhaps the husband's intent was that they effect the divorce.</i>
When a person tells two or more [colleagues]: "Write a <i>get</i> and give to my wife," "Divorce her," "Send her away," "Release her,"<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following term are acceptable, because they are Aramaic equivalents of the word "divorce."</i> "Discharge her," or "Write a letter and give it to her," [the colleagues] should write an acceptable <i>get</i> and give it to her.<br>If, however, he tells them: "Dismiss her," "Give her what she needs," "Do as our faith requires to her," "Do as the law requires to her," "Do unto her as she deserves," his statements are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">These expressions do not convey adequately enough the intent that the husband desires to divorce his wife for them to be considered effective in bringing about the appointment of the agents for this purpose.</i> If [these individuals] write a <i>get</i> and give it to the woman, the <i>get</i> is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 141:21, who quotes authorities who maintain that even in such instances the status of the divorce should be considered doubtful.</i>
If he tells them: "Get her out," "Let her go," "Permit her [to remarry]," "Let her be," "Assist her," there is doubt whether or not these terms imply that she should be divorced or whether they have another meaning. Therefore, [these individuals] should not write [a <i>get</i>] for her. If they write a <i>get</i> and give it to her, the status of the divorce is in doubt.
When [a man] says: "Write a <i>get</i> for my wife," [the people he addresses] should write the <i>get</i>, sign it and give it to him. They should not give it to the woman unless he tells them to. If they do give it to the woman, the <i>get</i> is not [effective].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For the husband has not charged them with effecting the divorce.</i><br>When does the above apply? With regard to a healthy man. If, however, a man is dangerously ill - i.e., he suddenly falls sick and his illness rapidly becomes very severe - or if he is being led away in chains,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 6:5), the Rambam interprets this as referring to a person taken from jail in chains to be judged by a gentile magistrate.</i> even for financial matters, or he departs on an ocean journey, or he departs with a caravan [on a desert journey] and he says, "Write a <i>get</i> for my wife," they should write it, sign it and give it to her. For it is clear that his intent was that they should write the <i>get</i> and give it to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that, in all these instances, his intent was to divorce his wife, lest he die and she be required to undergo the rite of either <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>. Alternatively, he knew that he was entering a dangerous situation, and feared that he might die, without there being any witnesses of his death. In order to prevent his wife from being forced to remain unmarried for the rest of her life, he charges witnesses with the composition of a <i>get</i>.<br>He surely wanted to tell the witnesses to give the <i>get</i>, and it was only because of his concern with his personal situation that he forgot to do so (<i>op. cit.</i>). (See <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 8:24, which relates similar concepts with regard to a person's division of his estate.)</i>
[The following rules apply when] a healthy person says: "Compose a <i>get</i> for my wife," and [his listeners] write a <i>get</i>, sign it and give it to her. If he commits suicide immediately thereafter - e.g., he throws himself down from a roof or jumps into the sea - the <i>get</i> is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, we assume that the person intended to say that the <i>get</i> should be given, but failed to mention the point because of his preoccupation with his own concerns.</i><br>If, however, he climbs up onto a [high] roof, and he is buffeted by the wind until he falls and dies, the <i>get</i> is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For his intent is not clear, and it is possible that he wanted to deliberate before having the <i>get</i> given.</i> If there is doubt whether he threw himself down [from the roof] or was buffeted by the wind, the <i>get</i> is valid unless it becomes known with certainty that he was buffeted by the wind.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling is debated by the commentaries, for it is questionable why the <i>get</i> would be considered valid, in light of the doubt that exists. Indeed, there are commentaries that suggest that the text before us is a printing error and that the Rambam considers the status of the divorce to be in doubt.

Despite these questions, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 121:1) quotes the Rambam's wording. On this basis, the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> states that both a husband and a wife should not drink alcoholic beverages on the day of their divorce.</i>

Indeed, in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 121:2), Rav Yosef Karo rules accordingly. Note, however, the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 121:2, who justifies the Rambam's ruling.<br>[The difference between these two opinions revolves around the fundamental conception of an agent's authority. Is he acting independently of the principal (in which case the principal's state is not of concern to us) or is he considered to be an extension of the principal (in which case, if the principal is unable to perform an act, neither is his agent). See <i>Lekach Tov</i>, Section 1.]<br>Based on the above, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 121:4) writes that we should check that a person who is giving a <i>get</i> when terminally ill is sound of mind.</i>

There are other authorities who require two sets of three questions. Also, based on <i>Gittin</i> 70b, the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 121:5) suggests that the person should be asked questions about fruit - e.g., would he desire a summer fruit in winter? His ability to discern with regard to these matters will serve as an indicator of whether or not he is of sound mind.</i> If he answers those [questions] to be answered affirmatively in the affirmative and those to be answered negatively in the negative, they should write [a <i>get</i>] and give it [to her]. His mental state must be checked thoroughly, lest he not be of sound mind.<br>Similarly, if he writes by hand: "Write a <i>get</i> and give it to my wife," they should write it and give it to her, if [it appears] that he is of sound mind.

After <i>nisu'in</i>, the consummation of the marriage, the father no longer has any authority over his daughter even though she is below the age of majority. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:12.)<br>We may conclude that, before <i>nisu'in</i>, the Rambam does not consider the girl as having the authority to receive her own <i>get</i>. This opinion is accepted by most authorities and is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:4).

Instead, this marriage can be dissolved through the rite of <i>mi'un</i>, as described in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:7.</i> when she is a minor and then [the father] dies. If [the girl] can differentiate between a <i>get</i> and another object,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:6) states that this refers to a girl of six or seven, depending on her intellectual capacities.</i> the divorce is effective after the <i>get</i> reaches her possession.

If, however, the gentiles compel him to write [a <i>get</i>] on their own initiative, the <i>get</i> is [merely] unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Mesharshia states that the Rabbis deemed the <i>get</i> unacceptable, lest women become accustomed to hiring gentiles for this purpose (<i>Bava Batra</i> 48a). In the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo notes that <i>Gittin</i> 88b appears to reject Rav Mesharshia's view and states that a <i>get</i> that was forced on a man by gentiles is void entirely. (This indeed is the ruling of Rashi, Rabbenu Nissim and Rabbenu Asher.) In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 134:5), Rav Yosef Karo's wording is not specific when dealing with this issue. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 134:10 states that such a <i>get</i> is void.</i> The rationale is that the law requires him to give a divorce.<br>Why is this <i>get</i> not void? For he is being compelled - either by Jews or by gentiles - [to divorce] against his will [and a <i>get</i> must be given voluntarily].<br>Because the concept of being compelled against one's will applies only when speaking about a person who is being compelled and forced to do something that the Torah does not obligate him to do - e.g., a person who was beaten until he consented to a sale,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 10:1, which states that such a sale is acceptable, after the fact. Nevertheless, if the seller notifies the witnesses that he was compelled to sell against his will, the sale is nullified.</i> or to give a present. If, however, a person's evil inclination presses him to negate [the observance of] a mitzvah or to commit a transgression, and he was beaten until he performed the action he was obligated to perform, or he dissociated himself from the forbidden action, he is not considered to have been forced against his will. On the contrary, it is he himself who is forcing [his own conduct to become debased].<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements have implications far beyond their immediate halachic context. The Rambam is saying that the fundamental desire of every Jew is to affirm his Jewishness and observe the Torah and its mitzvot. Even when a person's conscious mind does not necessarily consent to this inner motivation, it is at work, molding his character without his knowledge. And at times, either because of undesirable circumstances - being compelled against his will as above - or because of desirable ones - an expression of Divine favor - this inner drive will surface.</i><br>With regard to this person who [outwardly] refuses to divorce [his wife] - he wants to be part of the Jewish people, and he wants to perform all the mitzvot and eschew all the transgressions; it is only his evil inclination that presses him. Therefore, when he is beaten until his [evil] inclination has been weakened, and he consents [to the divorce], he is considered to have performed the divorce willfully.<br>[Different laws apply when] the law does not require him to divorce his wife, and a Jewish court or simple people compel him to divorce her. This <i>get</i> is deemed unacceptable. Since, however, it was Jews who compelled him, he [is advised] to complete the divorce [in a proper manner]. If, by contrast, gentiles compel him to divorce when it was not required, the divorce is void. Even though he tells the gentiles that he consented and tells the Jews to write and sign [a <i>get</i>], since the law does not require him to divorce, and he was compelled to do so by gentiles, the <i>get</i> is void.

Chapter 3

A <i>get</i> that is not written for the sake of the man [initiating] the divorce and for the sake of the woman who is being divorced is not valid.<br>What is implied? A scribe wrote a <i>get</i> to learn [scribal arts] or to teach them, and a husband came and discovered that the <i>get</i> was written with his name; the name of the woman was the same as his wife's name; and the name of the city the same as the name of his city. If he took [this <i>get</i>] and used it to divorce [his wife], the divorce is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>get</i> was not written with the intent of being used to effect a divorce (<i>Gittin</i> 24b).</i>
Furthermore, [a <i>get</i> is also void in the following instance:] [A man] had a <i>get</i> written so that he could divorce his wife and changed his mind. An inhabitant of his city discovered it and told him: "My name is the same as yours, and my wife's name is the same as your wife's." Although [the second man] took it and used it to divorce his wife, it is invalid,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>get</i> was not written for the sake of the man [initiating] the divorce and for the sake of the woman who is being divorced (<i>Ibid.</i>).</i> despite the fact that it was written in order to effect a divorce.
Furthermore, [a <i>get</i> is also void in the following instance:] [A man] had two wives with the same name, and he wrote a <i>get</i> with the intent of divorcing the older one, and changed his mind and used it to divorce the younger one. The divorce is invalid. Although it was written for the sake of the man [initiating] the divorce, it was not written for the sake of the woman who is being divorced.
Moreover, [in the above situation,] if he tells the scribe: "Write the <i>get</i>, and I will use it to divorce whichever one I desire," and the scribe wrote the <i>get</i> with that intent, and the husband divorced one of his wives, the status of the divorce is a matter of doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling depends on the concept of <i>b'reirah</i> - i.e., that since ultimately the husband's intent is clarified, it is considered retroactively as if this had been his intent at the outset.<br>This concept of <i>b'reirah</i> is relevant not only in the present context, but also with regard to many other contexts discussed in the Talmud and later Rabbinic works. Generally, the rule that is followed is that with regard to questions involving Scriptural law, the concept of <i>b'reirah</i> is not accepted, but with regard to Rabbinic law it is accepted. On this basis, the commentaries question the Rambam's ruling. In the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo explains that although with regard to following stringencies, we say that the concept of <i>b'reirah</i> does not apply to questions of Scriptural law, it does apply with regard to the acceptance of a leniency. Therefore, although the woman must consider herself divorced, she does not have the prerogative of remarrying. On this basis, Rav Yosef Karo quotes the Rambam's wording in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:4). (See the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 130:4, who also discusses this issue.)</i><br>Whenever a <i>get</i> was not written with the proper intent, it remains void, even if the scribe rewrites the letters with the proper intent.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., tracing over the letters is ineffective, for writing on top of other writing is insignificant (<i>Gittin</i> 20a). A parallel exists with regard to the Sabbath laws. If a person traces over letters on the Sabbath, he is not considered to have violated the forbidden labor of writing (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 11:16).<br>Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:5) appears to favor the Rambam's ruling, it also quotes the opinion of the Rashba, which states that consideration must be made of a <i>get</i> given under such circumstances.</i>
When a man writes a <i>get</i> [with the intent of] divorcing his wife, but he changes his mind and does not divorce her, he may not divorce her with this same <i>get</i> another time should he so desire, if he entered into privacy with her after [the <i>get</i>] was written.<br>If, however, he did divorce her with this old <i>get</i>, the divorce is effective, and she may remarry on this basis without any qualms.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes on Chapter 2, Halachah 2, the Rambam does not consider a <i>get</i> that was written before it was given to be predated. Other commentaries do, however, and it is their view that is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 127:5).<br>According to those authorities, such a <i>get</i> can be acceptable only when it was sent via an agent. This relates to another difference of opinion about this issue. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 148) states that this ruling applies only when the <i>get</i> remained in the husband's possession until after he emerged from privacy with his wife. If he gave it to an agent beforehand, it is void. In the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo states that the Rambam does not accept this distinction, and in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 148:1), although he mentions the <i>Tur's</i> view, he favors his own interpretation of the Rambam's decision.</i> For [the <i>get</i>] was written for her sake and was given to her now in the presence of witnesses, as the law requires.<br>Why at the outset should it not be used for divorce? [This is] a Rabbinic decree, lest [people] say: "Her <i>get</i> preceded [the birth of] her son."
[The following rules apply when a man] tells a scribe, "Write a <i>get</i> for the sake of so and so, and it will remain in my possession. When I marry her, I will divorce her with it." If [the scribe] writes [such a <i>get</i>], and the man marries her and then he divorces her with it, the divorce is void. [The rationale is] that the woman could not be divorced when the <i>get</i> was written. Thus, it is considered not to have been written for the sake of divorce.<br>If, however, [the man] tells [the scribe]: "Write [a <i>get</i>] for the woman who is consecrated to me. After I consummate the marriage, I will divorce her," should he consummate the marriage and divorce her with such [a <i>get</i>], the divorce is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This law applies only after the fact. At the outset, such a <i>get</i> should not be used, as reflected in the previous halachah.<br>When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 132:1) follows the opinion of the <i>Tur</i> and <i>Tosafot</i>, who differ with the Rambam and state that the <i>get</i> is acceptable only when it was post-dated, and the date on which it was given was mentioned. If the date on which the <i>get</i> was written was mentioned, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable. (It is worse than an ordinary "old <i>get</i>," because in that instance, the couple merely entered into privacy together; we are not certain that they had relations. In this instance, by contrast, the marriage bond was consummated.)</i><br>If a man had [a <i>get</i>] written for his <i>yevamah</i>, and he divorced her with it after he performed the rite of <i>yibbum</i>, the status of the divorce is doubtful, for she was not his wife in an absolute sense<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although the <i>yevam</i> does not have to consecrate his <i>yevamah</i>, he also does not have to divorce her.

It appears that the opinion cited by the Rambam above is that of the Sages. Thus, this ruling is worthy of notice, because it represents a change of mind on the Rambam's part, for he writes in his Commentary on the Mishnah that the halachah follows Rabbi Eliezer. (It is also noteworthy that in the Rambam's manuscripts of his Commentary on the Mishnah, the latter statement was rubbed out and written over, implying that the Rambam deliberated back and forth about the matter when composing that text. See the <i>Kovetz</i> and others, who discuss this issue.)<br>See also the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 131:2, who states that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> does not mention this law, because most authorities differ with the Rambam and do not grant a scribe such license.

[The following rule applies if] a scribe wrote a <i>get</i> for the sake of the husband and the wife as required, and the witnesses signed without having that intent.

When it was established that there was another man in that place whose name was the same as the name written in the <i>get</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">And whose wife's name is the same as the woman's name written in the <i>get</i>.</i> if another man passes by the place [the <i>get</i> was lost] - even if he did not tarry there - we suspect that the <i>get</i> that was found belongs to the other person.<br>If the woman is divorced with this <i>get</i>, the status of the divorce is doubtful.

If the witnesses knew of a clearly distinctive sign by means of which they could recognize the <i>get</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A sign is, however, necessary. According to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it is sufficient for the agent who lost the <i>get</i> to say that he recognizes it; witnesses, by contrast, must give signs through which it can be identified (<i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>).</i> - e.g., they said it had a hole next to a particular letter, or they said: "We signed only one <i>get</i> with these names" - we presume that [the <i>get</i> that was discovered was the one that was lost], and [the woman] may be divorced with it.<br>[This ruling applies] even when [the <i>get</i>] was discovered after a long time had passed, [it was lost in] a place frequented by caravans, and it was established that there were two [men] with the same names.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that if there are other individuals who share the same name as the witnesses, the witnesses must also recognize their own signatures.</i>

They then take the <i>gittin</i> from her and give them to the second woman. There is no necessity for the woman to know which <i>get</i> was intended for her originally (<i>Gittin</i> 86b; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer</i> 132:3).</i><br>Therefore, if one of the <i>gittin</i> was lost, the second <i>get</i> is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) explains that if, however, the agent gives the <i>get</i> that remains to one or the other of the women, the status of the divorce[s] is in doubt.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a man has two names and a woman has two names.

Other authorities differ and require that all the names by which a man or a woman is known should be mentioned in the <i>get</i>. This latter view is cited by the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 129:1).<br>This issue is particularly relevant today, when many individuals have Jewish names with which they are called to the Torah, and secular names by which they are known by and large. The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>:16) rules that the Jewish name should be mentioned first, but the secular name should also be mentioned in the <i>get</i>.</i><br>If he writes [the husband's] or [the wife's] nickname,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a derivative of the person's name by which he or she is often called - e.g., Danny, which is a derivative of either Dan or Daniel.

Note the discussion of this issue in the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 129:1. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> also discusses whether the intent is that, after the fact, a woman divorced with such a <i>get</i> may remarry, or whether the intent is that at the outset such a <i>get</i> may be given.</i>

All are fit to write a <i>get</i>, with the exception of five: a gentile, a servant, a deaf-mute, a mentally incompetent person and a minor. A woman may even write her <i>get</i> herself.<br>When a Jew becomes an apostate to false gods,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The standard printed text was changed by the church's censors.<br>The equivalence between the desecration of the Sabbath and the worship of false gods is discussed by the Rambam at the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, based on <i>Horayot</i> 8a.</i> or he desecrates the Sabbath in public, he is regarded like a gentile with respect to all matters [and is not fit to write a <i>get</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, who states that although an apostate is not capable of writing a <i>get</i>, if he is married to a Jewess, he may - and indeed should - divorce her with a <i>get</i>. Just as the <i>kiddushin</i> he gives establish a viable marriage bond (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:15), a <i>get</i> that he gives can dissolve such a bond.</i>
Why are these five individuals [prevented] from writing <i>gittin</i>? Because a <i>get</i> must be written for the sake of the man initiating the divorce and the woman receiving the divorce, and a gentile writes with his own intent.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Even if an observant Jew stands over him, and tells him the intent with which he should write the <i>get</i>, it is void. (See <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 1:11.)<br>The Rambam puts the emphasis on the gentile's lack of proper intent to explain why a <i>get</i> written by an apostate is unacceptable. For the Rambam could have employed the same reason given with regard to a servant - that the laws of marriage and divorce do not apply to him - to exclude a gentile. He chose to give this reason to allude to the law concerning an apostate because an apostate also cannot be relied upon to write with the proper intent (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 123:5).<br>The reasons given by the Rambam are significant in another context. As mentioned in the notes on Chapter 2, Halachah 1, there is a difference of opinion among the authorities regarding whether or not the scribe writing the <i>get</i> must be appointed as an agent. All the individuals mentioned are not capable of serving as agents. Since that rationale is not given, it would appear that the Rambam does not require such an appointment. Nevertheless, other sources lead to the opposite conclusion.</i> A deaf-mute, a mentally incompetent person and a minor are not of [sufficient] mental capacity. And the laws of divorce and marriage do not apply to a servant; therefore, [in this area] he is disqualified; he is like a gentile in all respects.<br>If one of these five individuals writes a <i>get</i>, it is void,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 123) quote other opinions, which maintain that such <i>gittin</i> are disqualified by Rabbinic law only. Hence, because of this difference of opinion, the status of the divorce is in doubt (<i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 123:6).</i> even if it was signed by acceptable witnesses and given in the presence of acceptable witnesses.
When one of these five individuals writes the standard portion of the <i>get</i> and leaves the essential portions - i.e., the place for the man's [name], the woman's [name], the date and the sentence: "Behold, you are permitted [to marry] any man" - unwritten, and these were written by an adult mentally competent Jew with the proper intent, the <i>get</i> is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 123:3) quotes the opinion of the <i>Tur</i>, who maintains that in such an instance the <i>get</i> is deemed unacceptable by Rabbinic law.</i>
At the outset, one may allow a deaf-mute, a mentally incompetent person or a minor to write the standard portions of a <i>get</i>, provided they are supervised by a mentally competent adult.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">If these individuals are supervised, they will write the <i>get</i> with the proper intent. Hence, there is no reason to negate the feasibility of using the standard portions of the <i>get</i> that they wrote, out of fear that they will write the essential portions without the proper intent.</i><br>A gentile or a servant, by contrast, should not be allowed to write the standard portions of a <i>get</i> at the outset, even when supervised by a Jew. For permission to write the standard portions of a <i>get</i> at the outset was granted only as assistance to scribes, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 7 above.</i>
When a man writes a <i>get</i> on the Sabbath or on Yom Kippur, without knowing of the transgression,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">It appears that the Rambam's intent is that the <i>get</i> was written by the husband without his knowing of the transgression and not signed. It was given to his wife in the presence of witnesses. Although the same law would apply if the <i>get</i> were signed in unknowing violation of the holy day, the Rambam does not mention that possibility, because it is highly unlikely that both the man writing the <i>get</i> and the witnesses would not know of the transgression (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and gives it to [his wife], the divorce is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Since the transgression was performed unknowingly, the <i>get</i> is acceptable.

There are other versions that state "If it was written and signed on a holiday...."<br>The difference between the two versions is that the prohibition against forbidden labor is less severe on the holidays than on the Sabbath and Yom Kippur. The holidays are mentioned to emphasize that the <i>get</i> is void even in such an instance.</i> as a willful transgression and given to her, the divorce is not effective. For the witnesses [who signed] are disqualified by Scriptural law.<br>If it was written<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">By the husband and was not signed by witnesses.</i> on a holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Here a holiday is mentioned rather than the Sabbath, because if a <i>get</i> were written as a willful transgression in public on the Sabbath, the writer would be considered to be an apostate, and a <i>get</i> that he wrote would be disqualified by Scriptural law, as mentioned in Halachah 15. Since the desecration of the holidays is not so severe, the person is not considered to be an apostate. The <i>get</i> he wrote is, however, disqualified by Rabbinic decree.</i> as a willful transgression and given to her in the presence of acceptable witnesses on the holiday, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable [by virtue of Rabbinic decree].

Chapter 4

A <i>get</i> may be written only with a substance that leaves a permanent impression - e.g., ink,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 1:4, the Rambam describes the process by which ink is made as follows:<br>One collects the vapor of oils, of tar, of wax or the like, [causes it to condense,] and kneads it together with sap from a tree and a drop of honey. It is moistened extensively, crushed until it is formed into flat cakes, dried and then stored.<br>When one desires to write with it, one soaks [the cakes of ink] in gallnut juice or the like and writes with it. Thus, if one attempts to rub it out, he would be able to.<br></i> <i>sikra, kumus, kankantum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Gittin</i> 2:3, the Rambam mentions three Arabic terms for these words.

Other commentaries offer different interpretations.</i> or the like. If, however, [a <i>get</i>] is written with a substance that does not leave a permanent impression - e.g., beverages, fruit juices or the like - the <i>get</i> is void.<br>If [a <i>get</i>] is written with lead, a stylus or charcoal,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation of these terms is based on the <i>Aruch</i>, as quoted by the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 125:2).</i> it is acceptable. At the outset, however, these substances should not be used.
<i>A priori</i>, we may write with gallnut juice on paper, on a hide or the like. We may not use it to write on parchment that has been treated with gallnut juice, for it will not be distinct. If such a <i>get</i> is written, it is void. The same applies in all similar situations.<br>A <i>get</i> may be written on any substance, even a substance from which one is forbidden to benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 124:1 explains that, <i>a priori</i>, the Rambam allows a <i>get</i> to be written on a substance from which we are forbidden to benefit. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 124:1) differs and follows the opinion of <i>Tosafot</i>, which states that it is only after the fact that such a <i>get</i> is acceptable. The Ramah adds that if we are obligated to destroy the substance on which the <i>get</i> was written, the <i>get</i> is void.</i> We may write [a <i>get</i>] on a substance on which an erasure would not be noticed, provided it is given [to the woman] in the presence of witnesses who observe the transfer.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam rules that a <i>get</i> signed by acceptable witnesses is valid even when it was given without witnesses' observing the transfer (Chapter 1, Halachah 16). In this instance, however, even he maintains that witnesses must observe the transfer, for it is possible that the signatures of the witnesses on the <i>get</i> could be forged (<i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 124:2).</i>
What is implied?

Similarly, changes could be made to a <i>get</i> written on any of the other substances that follow.<br>Another type of legal document written on such parchment would not be acceptable. The laws pertaining to a <i>get</i> are different, for in this instance the purpose of the document is not to serve as proof of the divorce, but instead to effect the dissolution of the marriage bond.

If a <i>get</i> is engraved on a tablet [with a stylus], and it is signed by witnesses, and [the tablet] is in [the woman's] possession, the divorce is effective. [This applies] even when it is known to us that the tablet [had previously] belonged to [the wife].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Although the article on which the husband has the <i>get</i> written must belong to him, there is no difficulty in this instance, as will be explained.</i> For a woman is allowed to write her <i>get</i> herself.

[The following laws apply when] a <i>get</i> is engraved on a board, on a stone or on a metal plate: If the scribe engraved the form of the letters,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he hewed out the lines that would normally be written.</i> it is acceptable. This is considered writing, as [reflected by] the verse, [Jeremiah 17:1]: "Written with a pen of iron" - i.e., hewed out. Similarly, if one engraved the letters from the back of the plate until they projected from the front of the plate [the <i>get</i> is acceptable].<br>If, however, one hewed out the inside of the letter, [and the area around it,] until the form of the letter protruded on both sides, like the protruding writing on golden <i>dinarim</i>, the <i>get</i> is void, because this is not considered writing.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the letter is formed by working around the letter, and not on the form of the letter itself. This law has a corollary that is applicable to contemporary halachah. If ink spills near a letter, the shape of the letter may not be formed by scratching out the ink blotch (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer</i> 125:8).</i>
If one etches out the shape of letters on a hide,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Without writing.</i> or one sketches the form of letters on a hide<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, the writing will not remain permanently, but instead will be rubbed out in a short time. For this reason, the Rambam rules in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 11:16 that sketching on a hide is not considered writing.

Indeed, in one of his responsa, the Rambam writes that his teacher, Rav Yosef Migash, preferred having a <i>get</i> written in Rashi script rather than using the letters used in writing a Torah scroll. The univeral custom at present, however, is to use the Assyrian script with which Torah scrolls are written [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 126:1)].</i> and in any language.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there is no requirement to write it in Hebrew or Aramaic. Nevertheless, for centuries, it has been customary to use the standard Aramaic text quoted by the Rambam later on in this chapter.</i> A <i>get</i> that is written with the letters of one language and whose witnesses sign with the letters of another language is acceptable, provided the witnesses comprehend the language and the letters used.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In Chapter 1, Halachah 23, the Rambam allows a <i>get</i> to be read for the witnesses. Nevertheless, in this instance the Rambam requires the witnesses to read the <i>get</i> themselves. Since signing in another language is already a departure from the norm, no further leniency is granted (<i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>).</i>
If one of the witnesses signed the <i>get</i> with letters [from one language], and the other signed with letters of another language, the <i>get</i> is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 9:7 gives an example of one witness signing in Greek and the other in Hebrew. Even though the two languages use different characters, and even require writing in different directions, the <i>get</i> is acceptable.<br>Each of the witnesses' signatures is a separate and independent statement. Therefore, there is no need for the two signatures to be in the same language. The <i>get</i>, by contrast, is a single unit and must be written in one language (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>If, however, a portion of the <i>get</i> is written in one language, and another portion is written in another language, it is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling is accepted by all authorities. Although the standard text of the <i>get</i> that is universally employed uses both Aramaic and Hebrew, this does not represent a contradiction. Our Sages explain that since both these languages were used at Mount Sinai, they are considered to be a single tongue (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 126:1).</i>
Regardless of the language in which a <i>get</i> is written, the scribe must be careful that the wording of the <i>get</i> does not allow for two meanings. It should not [leave] the reader [in doubt, wondering]: "Perhaps this was his intention" - i.e., something other than divorce - "or perhaps this was his intention" - i.e., divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 13 for examples of wording that could create such doubt.</i> Instead, [whatever] the language [of the <i>get</i>], the wording should unequivocally state one concept: that so and so divorces so and so.
Similarly, regardless of the letters used, the penmanship [of the scribe] must be clear, so that children who know those letters would be able to read it. [The intent is] children who are not overly bright, nor those who are overly slow, but rather those of average intelligence.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 1:19, which states that when a question arises concerning the writing for the parchments of the tefillin, a determination may be made on the basis of the reading of such a child.</i><br>The writing should not be crooked, nor incoherent, lest one letter be confused with another, changing the meaning of the text.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 13 for examples of steps taken to prevent such confusion from arising.</i>
If [the wording of a <i>get</i>] has two implications, or its writing is crooked or incoherent to the extent that it is possible to understand a different concept from it, it is unacceptable. [It is not void,] because it may be read as referring to a divorce and its meaning involves divorce.<br>Although <i>a priori</i> it is permissible to write a <i>get</i> in any language, it has already become universal Jewish practice to write <i>gittin</i> in Aramaic, using the following text.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This basic text was already employed during the Talmudic era.

When a <i>get</i> is written using the above text and wording, [the following rules should be adhered to:] The word ודן should not be written with a <i>yud</i>, so that it might be read as ודין, which might be interpreted as meaning: "There will be a judgment between me and you."<br>The word ואגרת should not be written with a <i>yud</i>, lest it be read as ואי גרת, meaning "If you commit adultery."<br>The word למהך should not be written with a <i>yud</i>, lest it be read as לי מהך - i.e., that it is a joke for me.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Some texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> also include the statement that space should be left between the leg of the <i>heh</i> and its roof. According to that text, לי מהך "for me, from now on."</i><br>The words תהוייין and תצבייין should not be written with only two <i>yuddin</i>, lest a reader get the impression that the man is speaking with two women, and rather than divorce the one, he is divorcing two others.<br>Similarly, he should elongate the [latter] <i>vav</i> in the word וכדו lest it resemble a <i>yud</i>, which would cause the word to be read as <i>uch'dei</i>, in which instance, it would mean that "I am divorcing you on this condition." By the same token, he should elongate the <i>vav</i> in the words תרוכין and שבוקין, lest they resemble <i>yuddin</i>, in which instance it would mean that he is telling her that she is releasing and divorcing him.<br>In a similar fashion, care must be taken in every language and with every form of lettering to make certain that [the wording of the <i>get</i>] does not leave the possibility for two implications.
If [a scribe] wrote [a <i>get</i>] using this text and did not elongate the <i>vavin</i> mentioned, did not write the extra <i>yuddin</i>, or wrote the <i>yuddin</i> that we said should not be written, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that the <i>get</i> is unacceptable only when the husband protests and maintains that he intentionally had the scribe make such a mistake. If he does not issue such a protest, the <i>get</i> is acceptable. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also mentions that there is a difference if the woman subsequently married on the basis of the <i>get</i> or not, and the <i>Tur</i> states that the <i>get</i> may be disqualified on this basis only if the husband writes it himself, or the scribe writes it in response to his explicit instructions.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 126:22) quotes the Rambam's ruling, but also mentions that of the Ra'avad and the <i>Tur</i>. An exception, however, is made with regard to writing the three <i>yuddin</i> in the words תצבייין and תהוייין. If only two <i>yuddin</i> are written, the <i>get</i> is acceptable. (See also the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 126:32.)</i> Similarly, [if a <i>get</i> is written] in another language, and imprecise wording or writing is used, it is unacceptable.
[The following rules apply if] a letter or a word of a <i>get</i> was rubbed out or written between the lines. If it is from the standard portion of the <i>get</i>, it is acceptable. If it is from the portions of the <i>get</i> that are of fundamental importance, the <i>get</i> is void. If, however, at the conclusion of the <i>get</i>, it is stated that the particular letter has been written between the lines or has been rubbed out, the <i>get</i> is acceptable, as other legal documents would be,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i> 27:8.</i> even if [the difficulty] concerns the portions of the <i>get</i> that are of fundamental importance.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 125:19) states that at present it is customary to discard a <i>get</i> with a portion that has been rubbed out, instead of adding this line at the conclusion of the <i>get</i>. If, however, there is no alternative, a <i>get</i> is acceptable with an erasure, even if there is no explanation at the end, for we rely on the witnesses who observe the transfer (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 125:35).</i><br>Similarly, if a <i>get</i> was discovered to be torn [both] horizontally and vertically, as is customary for a court [to tear a legal document], the <i>get</i> is void, as would be other legal documents.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that if the <i>get</i> had been certified by the court, it is acceptable even if it is torn in the above manner. The rationale is that we assume that the <i>get</i> was torn so that the woman would not be able to use it to demand payment of her <i>ketubah</i> a second time. The Rambam's ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 125:20), and the Ra'avad's clarification is mentioned by the <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 125:41.</i> If, however, it is torn in a way other than the manner customary for a court [to tear a legal document], it is acceptable.
If [the <i>get</i>] has faded, rotted or become [filled with holes like] a sieve, it is acceptable. [The following rules apply if] it has been rubbed out or the letters have become blurred, but their form remains. If it can be read, it is acceptable;<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected by the following halachah, this refers to an instance in which the <i>get</i> was given when it was acceptable, and its condition deteriorated afterwards.</i> if not, it is void.
When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the disqualifications mentioned in the previous two halachot.</i> apply? When the woman is in possession of a <i>get</i> that has been signed by witnesses, and there are no witnesses to its transfer. If, however, there are witnesses who testify that the <i>get</i> was transferred in their presence, and at that time it was acceptable, the divorce is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This represents a difference between <i>gittin</i> and other legal documents, as reflected in Halachah 3 and notes (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i><br>[This applies] even if the fundamental portions of the <i>get</i> were written on erased parchment or between the lines, or [the <i>get</i>] was torn [both] horizontally and vertically when it was given to [the woman] in their presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> emphasizes that if the <i>get</i> is faded to the point that it cannot be read at the time it is transferred, the fact that the transfer is observed by witnesses is to no avail, and the divorce is void.<br>He also mentions the opinion of the Rashba, who states that a <i>get</i> that is torn vertically and horizontally before it is given to the woman is not acceptable. He does not, however, accept that decision. His rulings are paralleled by those of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 125:21), which mentions both the Rambam's and the Rashba's views, but appears to favor that of the Rambam.</i>
[The following rules apply when] five men write a single <i>get</i> to divorce their five wives. The <i>get</i> is acceptable if the wording they use is inclusive - i.e., they wrote "On the day of the week, so and so divorced so and so, and so and so divorced so and so..." - every husband making a statement to his wife. Similarly, each of them told his wife: "so that you have the license to...," including the entire standard portion of the <i>get</i>. Two witnesses must sign below.<br>[This <i>get</i>] must be given to each of the women in the presence of witnesses who observe its transfer. If no witnesses observe its transfer at all, the woman who is in possession of the get is considered to be divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The others, by contrast, are not considered to be divorced, for we have no proof that the woman's husband in fact gave her this get. (See <i>Gittin</i> 86b.)</i><br>[Different rules apply if,] by contrast, [the scribe] wrote: "On the day of the week, so and so divorced so and so...," completing the entire text of the <i>get</i> and then began writing a second <i>get</i> directly under it in the same scroll. [He continued] writing: "On the day of the week, so and so divorced so and so...," and so completed the entire text of the second <i>get</i> and similarly completed all the <i>gittin</i> in this manner [on the same scroll], and the witnesses signed below [the final <i>get</i>].<br>If this scroll was given to each of the women in the presence of witnesses who observed the transfer, all their divorces are effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., no attention is paid to the witnesses who signed the get. Each of the women received a <i>get</i> that was written in acceptable manner, and whose transfer was observed by witnesses. This is sufficient for a divorce to be acceptable.</i> [More stringent rules apply] if there are no witnesses who observed the transfer, and the scroll is in the possession of one of the women: If hers was the last <i>get</i> written on the scroll and the signatures of the witnesses are read together with [that statement], her divorce is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For hers is an acceptable <i>get</i>, signed by witnesses. We are not concerned with the fact that the scroll contains other <i>gittin</i> above it.</i> If the scroll is in the possession of one of the women whose <i>gittin</i> precede the last one, the status of her divorce is in doubt.
If [the scribe] writes: "We, so and so and so and so, divorce our wives, so and so and so and so,..." and then completes the <i>get</i>, the <i>get</i> is void, even though it was given to each one of them in the presence of witnesses who observed its transfer. [The rationale:] two women cannot be divorced with the same <i>get</i>, as [we can infer from Deuteronomy 24:1]: "And he shall write for her," [implied is:] for her and not for her and her colleague.<br>If after [writing the text as above], he continued and wrote individual statements for each one within the <i>get</i>, stating, "So and so is divorcing so and so, and so and so is divorcing so and so on this date,"<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>get</i> is acceptable only if the date that is stated in the beginning of the <i>get</i> is restated in the individual statement written for each woman. (See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 130:13.)</i> the divorces are acceptable.
[The following rules apply when a scribe] wrote two <i>gittin</i> in two columns on one scroll side by side. If there are two witnesses [whose signatures] are read [as a continuation of] one <i>get</i>, and two witnesses [whose signatures] are read [as a continuation of] the other <i>get</i>, the <i>get</i> is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>get</i> is given to both women in the presence of witnesses who observe the transfer, both are divorced (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> Whichever woman is in possession of the <i>get</i> is divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Even when there are no witnesses who observe the transfer.</i>
[In the above instance, if the <i>gittin</i>] were signed by only two witnesses, who signed across the width of both <i>gittin</i>, the divorce is valid only when the scroll is in the possession of the woman under whose <i>get</i> the signatures appear.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., under the first column, the witness signed "Ya'akov, the son of," and in the second column he continued "Yitzchak, a witness." The second witness did the same. In this instance, the witnesses have signed under the first <i>get</i>. If the witnesses signed their first names under one column, and signed "the son of so and so" in the second column, both <i>gittin</i> would be acceptable. For "the son of Ya'akov" is an acceptable signature."<br>This interpretation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 9:6). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:8) offers a slightly different interpretation.</i><br>If the <i>scroll</i> is in the possession of the woman under whose <i>get</i> the signatures of the witnesses do not appear, the <i>get</i> is not acceptable unless it is given to her in the presence of witnesses [who observe the transfer].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the fact that the names of the fathers of the witnesses are located under the woman's <i>get</i> does not cause it to be considered a <i>get</i> with false signatures. (See Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:8.)</i>
[The following rules apply if a scribe] writes two <i>gittin</i>, one above the other, and the witnesses sign between the two <i>gittin</i> - their signatures thus being below the first <i>get</i> and above the second <i>get</i>. If the scroll is in the possession of the woman under whose <i>get</i> the signatures appear, her divorce is valid, and the woman above whose <i>get</i> the signatures appear is not divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">These laws apply even when there are no witnesses who observed the transfer of the scroll. If there are witnesses who observed the transfer of the scroll to the second woman, even the second <i>get</i> is acceptable.<br>If the scroll is in the possession of the woman above whose <i>get</i> the witnesses sign, both the <i>gittin</i> are unacceptable unless there are witnesses who observed their transfer.</i><br>If the witnesses signed at the top of a <i>get</i>, at its side or on its overside, it is not a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:4) states that the <i>get</i> is <i>pasul</i>, unacceptable.

If two <i>gittin</i> [were written in an arc,] with the beginning of one <i>get</i> facing the beginning of the other <i>get</i>, and the signature of the witnesses is located between the tops of both <i>gittin</i>, both are void. If they are transferred in the presence of witnesses, both are acceptable.
[The following rules apply if the scribe did not complete the text of the <i>get</i> in one column,] left a portion unwritten and wrote it at the top of a second column. If the witnesses signed below, at the end of the second column, it is acceptable, provided it is obvious that the scroll was not cut off, and it was the scribe's intent to complete the <i>get</i> in the second column.<br>If, however, this is not apparent, the status of the divorce is in doubt, even if the <i>get</i> was given in the presence of witnesses. [The rationale is that] perhaps there were two <i>gittin</i>, and the portion below the <i>get</i> in the first column and a portion above the <i>get</i> in the second column were cut off.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">And thus a portion of the <i>get</i> that the woman receives would not have been written for her sake. For this reason, even if the get was given in the presence of witnesses who observed the transfer, it is not acceptable unless the witnesses testify that the <i>get</i> was originally written in two columns (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>
If, after writing the <i>get</i> and completing it, [the scribe] wrote: "Give regards to so and so," "Greetings to you, so and so, my friend," or the like, and afterwards the witnesses signed beneath the greeting, the status of the divorce is doubtful,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:3) uses the term <i>pasul</i>, "unacceptable," meaning that the <i>get</i> was disqualified by Rabbinic decree alone.

[The rationale is] perhaps the witnesses signed only for the greeting [without paying attention to the <i>get</i>].<br>If, however, the scribe wrote: "And give regards to so and so," "And greetings to you, so and so, my friend," or the like, the <i>get</i> is acceptable.

Chapter 5

The Torah's expression, [Deuteronomy  24:1]: "He will... place it in her hand," need not be interpreted only [according to its strict literal meaning], that the <i>get</i> must be placed in her hand. Regardless of whether the <i>get</i> is placed in her hand, her bosom or her courtyard, or is given to her agent whom she charged that his hand would be as her hand, the same law applies.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 21:26, which uses the word <i>miyado</i> - literally, "from his hand" - as meaning "from his possession." A similar usage is frequent within the Torah and within Talmudic sources.<br>It must, however, be emphasized that the accepted practice is to place the <i>get</i> in the woman's hand and not to remain content with depositing it in her courtyard. (See Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 139:14.)</i><br>The same laws apply to a courtyard that she acquired, one that she rented or one that is lent to her. They are all considered to be her property, and once the <i>get</i> reaches her property, the divorce is effective.
[The following laws apply when a man] throws a <i>get</i> for his wife into her courtyard. If she is standing next to her courtyard, the divorce is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to a courtyard, a point of clarification is necessary. In general, the benefit from a woman's property belongs to her husband, and whatever is acquired by her property belongs to him. In this instance, however, we say that the acquisition of the bill of the divorce and the right to acquire the articles placed in her property become hers simultaneously.</i> If she is not standing next to her courtyard, the divorce is not effective until she stands next to her courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording implies, however, that when the woman returns to her courtyard, the divorce is effective. Rav Meir HaLevi, as quoted by the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 139) differs and maintains that the woman must be present at the time the <i>get</i> is placed in her courtyard. If she is not present at that time, Rav Meir HaLevi maintains that the divorce is not effective unless the husband waits and tells the woman: "This is your <i>get</i>," when she picks it up, or the husband must pick it up and give it to her again.<br>The Rashba submits a third opinion. He maintains that the status of the divorce is doubtful, for perhaps the woman desired the divorce. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 139:2-3 and commentaries.)</i><br>[These principles apply] even when the <i>get</i> will be guarded in the courtyard in which [it is placed]. [The rationale is that] divorce is considered to be a liability [and not an advantage] for [a woman]. And a liability may not be invoked against [a person] outside his [or her] presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When considering something which is to a person's advantage - e.g., the acquisition of an ownerless object - a person may perform this act on behalf of a colleague without his knowledge, for our Sages postulated: "one may act to a person's advantage outside his presence." The rationale is that the person would probably desire to acquire the object. When, however, a liability is considered, this principle does not apply. Nevertheless, if a woman explicitly states that a <i>get</i> should be placed in her courtyard, the divorce is effective even when she is not standing next to it (<i>Beit Yosef, Even HaEzer</i> 139).</i>
[These rules apply when a <i>get</i> is given in the following situation. A woman] is standing on her roof, and [her husband] is standing in his courtyard that is located below it. He throws a <i>get</i> upwards to her.<br>Once the <i>get</i> reaches the space of the guardrail [to her roof] or comes within three handbreadths<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In many different halachic contexts, three handbreadths of empty space is considered to be a continuation of the nearest significant halachic entity. This principle is referred to by the name <i>l'vud</i>.</i> of the roof [when her roof does not have a guardrail], the divorce is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since it will ultimately come to rest within her property, it is considered as though it has already come to rest.<br>Accordingly, from this time onward, even if the husband changes his mind and desires to nullify the divorce before the <i>get</i> reaches the ground, he no longer has that option. The divorce is effective and the marriage bond has been broken. If a second man consecrates her at this time, she is considered to be his wife (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> [This applies provided the <i>get</i> ultimately] comes to rest on her roof.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Most other authorities differ with the Rambam on this point and maintain that as soon as the <i>get</i> enters the woman's possession, the divorce is effective, even though afterwards it is consumed by fire or its writing is wiped away by water, provided the fire or the water was not there before the husband threw the <i>get</i>. [Significantly, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 8:3), the Rambam does not mention the provision that ultimately the <i>get</i> must come to rest.] Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 139:4-5) mentions the Rambam's view, it is the approach of the other authorities that is favored.</i><br>If, however, [the writing of the <i>get</i>] is erased or [the <i>get</i>] is consumed by fire before it reaches her, the divorce is not effective. [This applies] even if the <i>get</i> is erased or consumed by fire after it passes the barriers of the woman's property or after it reaches within three handbreadths of her roof. [The rationale is that] since the <i>get</i> will never come to rest [in a complete state], it is void.
[Different rules apply when] the roof belongs to the husband and he stands on it, while his wife stands below in a courtyard that belongs to her, and he throws her a <i>get</i>. Once the <i>get</i> passes the boundaries of his property and enters the boundaries of her property, where she is standing, the divorce is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., immediately, even if the <i>get</i> does not reach the woman's property. The rationale is that as long as the conditions mentioned in the following halachah are met, it may be assumed that the laws of gravity will prevail, and the <i>get</i> will come to rest in the woman's property. Therefore, even if it is destroyed by a fluke occurrence beforehand, the divorce is effective (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer</i> 139:6).</i>
If, however, he throws a get into a fire located on the woman's property and it is consumed by the flames, or into water and it is erased or lost, the <i>get</i> is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since he initially threw the <i>get</i> into the fire, it is considered as though it will never come to rest and will never enter the woman's possession in a complete state.</i> If, however, it enters her property (and comes to rest),<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase set off by parentheses is found in the standard printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, but is lacking in many authentic manuscripts and early printings. Eliminating the phrase would imply that there is a difference between the situation described in Halachah 4 and that described in Halachah 3.<br>This indeed is the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> contention. As he explains, in Halachah 3 the husband is throwing the <i>get</i> against the natural gravitational pattern that prevails within the world, while in Halachah 4 the <i>get</i> is being thrown in a manner that conforms with the pattern of gravity. Therefore, as long as the <i>get</i> was not thrown into fire or water, the divorce is binding as soon as the <i>get</i> enters the woman's domain.</i> and afterwards fire comes and consumes it, the divorce is effective.
When the husband tosses the <i>get</i> on top of a reed or a spear implanted in her domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries on <i>Gittin</i> 79a explain that this refers to an instance where the top of the reed or the spear is higher than the walls of the courtyard.</i> the divorce is not effective until [the <i>get</i>] comes to rest in a place that is protected by her.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For the wind may blow it outside the courtyard.</i><br>[The following rule applies when] there are two courtyards, the inner courtyard belongs to the woman, the outer courtyard belongs to the man, and the walls of the outer courtyard are taller than those of the inner courtyard. If [the husband] throws the <i>get</i> into the space [of the inner courtyard, above its walls, but lower than the walls] of the outer courtyard, the divorce is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>get</i> will be protected by the walls of the outer courtyard even within the inner courtyard, if it is thrown toward the inner courtyard the divorce is effective after it enters the space of the outer courtyard (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 139:9).</i> [The rationale is] the inner [courtyard] is protected by the walls of the outer [courtyard]. This concept does not apply with regard to containers.
What is implied?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">There are two differences between courtyards and containers located in the husband's domain: a) With regard to the courtyard, it is sufficient for the <i>get</i> to enter the space of the husband's courtyard. With regard to a container, by contrast, this is not sufficient.<br>b) Even when a <i>get</i> comes to rest within a container, the divorce is not effective, except in the specific instance mentioned by the Rambam.<br>The rationale for both these differences is that the walls of a courtyard are made primarily for protecting the articles contained within, and in the above instance the walls of the outer courtyard also protect the articles within the inner courtyard. In contrast, the function of the wall of a container is to hold the object it contains (Rashi, <i>Gittin</i> 79b).</i> There are two containers, located one inside the other [and both are located in the husband's domain].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed addition is made on the basis of the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>. There are other commentaries that maintain that the containers are located in the woman's domain or in a neutral domain. (See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 139:13 and the gloss of Rabbi Akiva Eiger on those comments.)</i> The inner container belongs to her and the outer container belongs to him. If [the husband] throws the <i>get</i> to [his wife] toward the containers, the divorce is not effective<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The fundamental principle involved here is that a person cannot acquire an object by virtue of its being placed in a container belonging to him, if that container is located in a domain belonging to the giver, unless the giver is not concerned with the presence of the recipient's container. (See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 4:1.)<br>It must be emphasized that this concept is not accepted by Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Tur</i>. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 200:3 and commentaries.)</i> - even when the <i>get</i> reaches the space of the inner container - until it comes to rest on the side of the inner container.<br>[Moreover,] the above applies only when [the woman's container] is lying on its side and does not have a bottom.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">When a container is lying on its side and it does not have a bottom, it will not serve a functional purpose. Therefore, the husband will not be concerned that it is placed in his property. As such, if the <i>get</i> comes to rest on it, the divorce is effective.</i> If it has a bottom, even if [the <i>get</i>] comes to rest on that bottom, the divorce is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, the woman's container will serve a functional purpose. Therefore, it is likely that the husband will object to its presence on his property.<br>It must be emphasized that <i>Tosafot,</i> the Ra'avad, Rabbenu Nissim and others interpret the passage in <i>Gittin, loc. cit.,</i> differently from the Rambam. It is, however, the Rambam's view that is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 139:9).</i> For when a container belonging to a woman is located in the domain of the husband, the woman may not acquire a <i>get</i> by means of it unless the husband is not concerned about the place it occupies.
When [a husband] throws a <i>get</i> to his wife while she is located in his house or in his courtyard, the divorce is not effective until the <i>get</i> reaches the woman's hand or a container that belongs to her, to whose presence within his domain the husband does not object - e.g., a small bottle or basket or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Gittin</i> 77a) explains that a man must assume that a woman will bring such articles with her when she enters a domain.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's rulings, interpreting his approach as implying that if the place where the <i>get</i> comes to rest is within four cubits of the woman, it would appear that the divorce should be effective even if any of these factors applies. And if the place is further removed, the divorce is never effective. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 139:11) rules according to other authorities, who interpret this passage according to the interpretation offered by Rabbenu Nissim. The interpretation of the Rambam's words offered by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> is mentioned as a minority opinion.</i> [the following rules apply]. If the place where [the <i>get</i>] fell is not four cubits by four cubits, nor is it ten [handbreadths] high, nor does it have a separate name of its own, it is not considered to be a distinct entity, and it is as if [the <i>get</i>] and [the woman] were in the same place. [Therefore, the divorce is effective.]<br>If the place is characterized by any of these three factors, it is considered to be a distinct entity. [Since] the husband lent the woman one place, but not two places, the divorce is not effective until the <i>get</i> reaches her hand.
If [the husband] throws the <i>get</i> to her [while she is in her domain], and [the <i>get</i>] passes through the domain and falls outside her domain [the divorce is not effective].

Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 139:12) mentions the Rambam's view, it favors the other interpretation.</i> If the woman can stretch out her hand and take it, the divorce is effective.<br>[The rationale is that] although the domains are divided above as they are divided below, [and thus the <i>get</i> is located on a domain that does not belong to the woman, this is not significant,] for people are not concerned with [a neighbor's making use of] their property in such a manner.
[The following rules apply if a woman holds] her hand at an incline, [her husband] throws a <i>get</i> to her hand, and it falls to the earth. If it falls within four cubits of where she is standing and comes to rest there, the divorce is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In certain circumstances, our Sages ordained although a person is standing in property that does not belong to him, the four cubits around him [or her] are considered to be his courtyard. And placing an article within that space is considered to be placing it in his domain. (See <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 4:9.) Therefore, just as if the <i>get</i> in a woman's courtyard had come to rest in the woman's courtyard, the divorce would be effective, so too it is effective if it comes to rest within four cubits of her.<br>If the <i>get</i> does not come to rest within four cubits of the woman, one might say that the outcome is dependent on the difference of opinion between the Rambam and the <i>Tur</i> mentioned in the notes on Halachah 10. In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 139:15) follows the opinion of the <i>Tur</i> and rules that the status of the divorce is doubtful.</i><br>When, [however, the <i>get</i>] falls into the sea or into a fire, the divorce is not effective, if she is standing next to the water or the fire [when the <i>get</i> is thrown to her].

[The following rules apply when a husband] throws a <i>get</i> to [his wife] in the public domain or in a domain that does not belong to either of them. If [the <i>get</i>] is "close to him," the divorce is not effective. If [the <i>get</i>] is partially "close to him," and partially "close to her," the status of the divorce is in doubt unless it is definitely close to her.

What is meant by "close to him"? That he could protect the <i>get</i> while she could not.

The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 139:22 states that most other authorities would differ and would agree that according to Scriptural law, the divorce is effective in such an instance; it is disqualified only by virtue of Rabbinic decree.</i>
[If a husband] comes to a place first and stands there, and then [his wife] comes and stands opposite him, the divorce is not effective if he throws her [a <i>get</i>] and [it falls] within his four cubits,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Whenever an area becomes considered to be the "four cubits" belonging to one individual, another person may not acquire an article in that area until the first person departs (<i>Gittin</i> 78a).</i> even if she can bend down and pick it up.<br>If she comes to the place first and stands, and then he comes and stands opposite her and throws it to her, even when [the <i>get</i>] is partially "close to him" and partially "close to her," the <i>get</i> is [merely] deemed unacceptable [by virtue of Rabbinic decree] because it is within her four cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to Scriptural law the divorce is effective, because the four cubits in which the woman is standing become her exclusive property.</i> [Only when] the <i>get</i> reaches her hand [is the divorce effective <i>a priori</i>].

If it is tied loosely, the divorce is effective. If, however, it is the woman who prevents the husband from drawing back the <i>get</i> by clasping it within her hand, the divorce is not effective.

[The following rules apply when a husband] gives [a woman's] <i>get</i> to a servant belonging to her. If he is awake, he is bound and she is guarding him, the divorce is effective.

[The following rules apply if a husband] writes a <i>get</i>, places it in the hand of a servant belonging to him and writes a deed for the woman, giving her the servant as a present. If the servant is bound, the divorce is effective, for when she acquires the servant she also acquires the <i>get</i>. If the servant is unbound and awake, [the woman] acquires the servant; the divorce, however, is not effective until the <i>get</i> reaches her hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording implies that once the servant gives her the <i>get</i>, however, the divorce is effective. It is not necessary for the husband to take the <i>get</i> from the servant and give it to her. As mentioned by the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 139:29, this point is not accepted by all authorities.</i><br>Similarly, if [a man] placed a <i>get</i> in a courtyard belonging to him and sold or gave the courtyard to [his wife], the divorce is effective once she acquires the courtyard by virtue of the transfer of a deed or money, or by manifesting her ownership over it.

Chapter 6

An agent who is appointed by a woman to receive her <i>get</i> from her husband is called a receiving agent (<i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>). When the <i>get</i> reaches this agent's hand, the divorce is completed,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">And from that time onward, the husband cannot recant.</i> as if it has reached the hands of the woman herself.<br>[The agent] must be appointed in the presence of two witnesses, and two witnesses must be present when the <i>get</i> is conveyed to the agent. Even if the second pair of witnesses is the same as the first pair, or one of them is from the first pair, they are acceptable as witnesses.
When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">That is, when does the requirement for witnesses apply?</i> apply? When the <i>get</i> is lost or torn. If, however, the <i>get</i> is in the possession of the <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>, there is no need for witnesses. This applies whether the <i>get</i> was given by the husband in private, or it was given in the presence of witnesses. The presence of the <i>get</i> in the possession of the agent is equivalent to its presence in the possession of the woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 16.</i> Nevertheless, <i>a priori</i>, the <i>get</i> should be given only in the presence of witnesses who observe its transfer, as is the case with regard to [a <i>get</i> given to] the woman herself.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 15.</i>
A husband may not appoint an agent to receive a <i>get</i> for his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A divorce is considered to be undesirable and detrimental for a woman. Therefore, an agent cannot be appointed for her without her consent. For an activity that is detrimental to a person cannot be performed on his or her behalf without his will (<i>Gittin</i> 62b).</i> He may, however, appoint an agent to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife. Such an agent is referred to as a delivery agent (<i>sh'liach holachah</i>).
Similarly, a woman may appoint an agent to fetch her <i>get</i> for her from her husband. Such an agent is referred to as an agent who fetches (<i>sh'liach hava'ah</i>). Neither a <i>sh'liach holachah</i> nor a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i> need [be appointed in the presence of] witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:15, where the Rambam states: "For the only purpose witnesses would serve with regard to the agency... is to make known the truth of the matter."<br>According to the Rambam, the distinction between these agents and a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> appointed by the woman is that through the acceptance of the <i>get</i> the marriage bonds are annulled, and "no matters involving forbidden sexual relations [are established if] fewer than two witnesses are present (<i>Yevamot</i> 88a)." Since the <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> is concerned only with receiving the <i>get</i>, his agency involves nothing else but the actual divorce. Hence, witnesses must be present to acknowledge the appointment of this agent. In contrast, the agency of a <i>sh'liach holachah</i> and a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i> also involves transporting the <i>get</i>, an activity that is merely a preparatory step for the divorce. Hence, witnesses are not required for his appointment.<br>It must be emphasized that the Ra'avad and others offer a far more straightforward rationale clarifying the distinction between these agents. A <i>sh'liach holachah</i> and a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i> each carry the <i>get</i> with them. Hence, they need no further proof of their agency. A <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>, by contrast, does not have possession of the <i>get</i> before the divorce. Hence, his position must be strengthened by having his appointment observed by witnesses.<br>In practice, it has already become customary for the appointment of a <i>sh'liach holachah</i> to be certified by a written document. There are opinions that differ and require that the appointment of a <i>sh'liach holachah</i> also be observed by witnesses. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:11, 30, 40.)</i>
A woman is not divorced through the medium of a <i>get</i> sent by her husband or brought by a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i> [whom she appointed] until the <i>get</i> reaches her hand.<br>Whenever the term agent is used with regard to a <i>get</i> without any further explanation, the intent is a <i>sh'liach holachah</i> or a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i>.
Anyone is acceptable to act as an agent with regard to a divorce, whether as a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>, a <i>sh'liach holachah</i> or a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are intended to negate the opinion of his teacher, Rabbi Yosef Migash, who maintains that a servant may serve as a <i>sh'liach holachah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:31) quotes both views, but appears to favor the Rambam's view.</i> with the exception of five individuals: a gentile, a servant, a deaf mute, a mentally incompetent individual and a minor.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 15, and <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:17.</i> If one of these individuals brings or receives [a <i>get</i>], the divorce is not effective.
Even women, relatives<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:33) states that <i>a priori</i>, it is proper that the agent not share any family ties with the husband, his wife, or the judges executing the divorce.</i> and individuals who are disqualified [from serving as witnesses] because of the violation of Rabbinic law are acceptable to serve as agents for a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It would appear that even if the signatures of the witnesses have not been verified, and the acceptability of a <i>get</i> depends on the agents' statements, these individuals may serve as agents.</i> Individuals who are disqualified because of the violation of Scriptural law, by contrast, are not acceptable [to serve as agents] to deliver a <i>get</i>. If they bring it, the divorce is unacceptable.<br>When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That the divorce is unacceptable, but not void.</i> apply? When the signatures on the <i>get</i> have been verified.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As can be seen in the various manuscript copies of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 2:6), the Rambam changed his opinion regarding the acceptance of these individuals as agents when the veracity of the signature on a <i>get</i> has been established. The standard text of the Commentary on the Mishnah states that if the witnesses' signatures have been verified, the <i>get</i> is acceptable unless the person worships false gods or violates the Sabbath in public. This is also the view of other authorities and is the ruling favored by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:33).</i> If, however, we must rely only on the words of an individual who is disqualified because of the violation of Scriptural law, the divorce is void entirely.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See also Chapter 12, Halachah 17. Based on the objections of the Ra'avad, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> modifies the Rambam's ruling slightly, explaining that the intent is that the woman may not remarry, and not that the <i>get</i> is void. If, however, she does remarry, her second husband is also required to divorce her.<br>The <i>get</i> she received from her first husband is not void, because it is possible that witnesses will come and verify the signatures on the <i>get</i>. In such an event, the divorce will be effective retroactively. Nevertheless, since those signatures have not been verified as of yet, her second husband must divorce her.<br>Rav David Arameah explains that the Rambam's intent is that the <i>get</i> is still viable, but it should be given to another agent to effect the divorce. Note the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and others, who question the source for the Rambam's ruling.</i>
If the agent was a minor when he was given the <i>get</i>, and he attained majority when he brought it [to the woman], [or he was a] deaf mute and gained the ability to hear and speak, [or he was] mentally incompetent and gained competence, [or he was] a gentile and converted, or a servant and was freed, the divorce is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In all these instances, since the agent was not fit to serve in that capacity at the time the agency was delegated to him, it is as if the agency had never been conveyed upon him.</i><br>If, however, the husband gives [an agent] a <i>get</i> while [the agent] is able to hear and speak, [or the agent then] becomes a deaf mute and afterwards regains his ability to hear and speak, or [the agent] was mentally competent, he lost his competence and then regained it when he brought it to the woman, the <i>get</i> is acceptable, for at the outset and at the conclusion, [the agent] was of sound mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that, in the interim, he was unfit to serve as an agent is of no significance. Note the <i>Or Sameach</i>, who on this basis questions what the law would be if the husband negates the agency and then desires to reestablish it. Must he reappoint the agent or not?</i>
When a woman appoints an agent in the presence of witnesses and tells him: "Take my <i>get</i> and keep it for me in your possession," the person is a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>. It is as if she told him: "Receive my <i>get</i> for me."<br>A woman may appoint a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> to receive her <i>get</i> for her from an agent appointed by her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 63b states that our Sages entertained a hypothesis that this involves a disregard for the honor of the husband, and therefore the divorce should be void, but they did not accept this theory.</i><br>A girl below the age of majority may not appoint a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>. Although she may acquire property by virtue of her courtyard in the same manner as an adult woman<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">And thus, if a <i>get</i> were placed in her courtyard, the divorce would be acceptable. Moreover, the effectiveness of a courtyard in the acceptance of a <i>get</i> is associated with the concept of agency. (See <i>Bava Metzia</i> 10b and the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> on Chapter 5, Halachah 2.)</i> [she does not have the privilege of appointing an agent]. The rationale is that [the appointment of] a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> requires witnesses, and witnesses may not testify with regard to a minor, because she is not of complete mental competence.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and maintains that the rationale is that a minor is never empowered to appoint an agent. And thus, a woman below majority may not appoint a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i> either. It must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Sh'luchin V'Shutafin</i> 2:2, the Rambam indeed states that in no instance may a minor appoint an agent. See the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> and Rav Kapach, who emphasize that a special law applies with regard to an agent to receive a <i>get</i>, for he is considered to be the extension of the woman's hand. Note the Rambam's wording in Chapter 1, Halachah 1.</i>
[The following laws apply] when a woman has appointed a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> and her husband told him: "I do not want you to receive the <i>get</i> for her. Instead, here is her <i>get</i>. Bring it to her." The husband has this prerogative, and the person becomes a <i>sh'liach holachah</i>, rather than a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, the divorce does not become final when the agent receives the <i>get</i>. It is only when the <i>get</i> reaches the woman's hand that the divorce takes effect.</i><br>If, however, the husband tells [the woman's agent]: "Receive the <i>get</i> for her," "Here it is," or "Acquire it for her," he has not revoked the agency [with which] the <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> [was charged]. But if [the husband] tells [the agent]: "Bring it to her," he has revoked the agency [with which] the <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> [was charged] and has made him the agent of the husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the husband's statements imply that he is unwilling to give the agent the <i>get</i> in his original capacity, but that he is willing to charge him with a different agency - bringing the woman the <i>get</i> as agent of the husband.<br>This ruling is not accepted by all authorities. The Rashba and Rabbenu Nissim differ, maintaining that in such an instance, the status of the divorce is in doubt. The Rambam's opinion is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 140:6), while the other views are cited by the Ramah.</i> Similarly, if the husband said: "Bring it and give it to her," he has revoked the agency [with which] the <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> [was charged].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Although with regard to the transfer of a present the Rambam maintains that the expression "Give it to him" is equivalent to saying "Acquire it on his behalf" (<i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 4:4), because the husband said "Bring it to her" it is clear that he desired the agent to serve in the capacity of a <i>sh'liach holachah</i>.</i>
[In the following situation, although the <i>get</i> reaches the woman's hand, the divorce is not effective because of the confusion in the delegation of agency.] An agent appointed by a woman came to receive her <i>get</i> from her husband. The agent told the husband: "I am a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>."<br>The husband responded: "Bring the <i>get</i> [in the capacity] in which she appointed you"<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 140:8) explains that the phrase "in the capacity in which she appointed you" is of primary significance here. If the husband does not add that phrase and says merely: "Bring the <i>get</i> to her," he is appointing the agent to be a <i>sh'liach holachah</i>, and by taking the <i>get</i> the agent is accepting this appointment. Therefore, if the agent delivers the <i>get</i> to the woman, the divorce is effective.</i> - i.e., he did not revoke his agency. Instead, it is as if he had said: "Whether she appointed you to be a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> or a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i>, you remain in that capacity."<br>The agent brought [the woman] the <i>get</i>, but she told him: "I did not appoint you to be a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>, but rather to be a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i>." Even if the agent gives her the <i>get</i>, the divorce is not effective, for in speaking to the husband, the agent revoked the agency that he was granted. It is as if he had told him: "I was never appointed a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i> on her behalf."
[A different ruling applies in the following instance.] The agent told the husband, "I am a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i>," and the husband told him, "Bring [the <i>get</i> in the capacity] in which she appointed you."<br>The agent brought [the woman] the <i>get</i>, but she told him: "I appointed you to be a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>." When the <i>get</i> is delivered to the woman, the divorce is effective, for he did not revoke the agency that he was granted. He merely reduced [her dependence on him]. For she appointed him [as an agent] to receive [the <i>get</i>], and he said: "I will merely bring it."<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">By serving as a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i>, the agent accepts far more responsibility and difficulty than by serving as a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>. If he served as a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>, the divorce would be completed after he received the <i>get</i>. As a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i>, the agent must trouble himself to bring the <i>get</i> to the woman. As such, we assume that since the woman was willing to accept the agent as a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>, she is certainly willing to accept him as a <i>sh'liach hava'ah</i>.<br>Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> and Rabbenu Nissim, who explain that it is possible that the husband relied on the words of the agent, or it is possible that he was concerned with the words of his wife. Indeed, with regard to questions of commercial law, there is an unresolved question in <i>Bava Metzia</i> 76a regarding this matter. Following this rationale, even if the <i>get</i> never reached the woman, as long as it reached the agent the status of the divorce is in doubt. This ruling is also cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 140:9).</i>
[The following rules apply when] a husband sends a <i>get</i> to his wife, and when the agent attempts to give it to her, she refuses to take it and tells him in the presence of witnesses, "Hold the <i>get</i> in safekeeping,"<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">With this expression, the woman's intent is that the agent should begin acting as her agent and hold the <i>get</i> for her. For keeping the <i>get</i> as an entrusted article violates the instructions that her husband gave him (Rabbenu Nissim).</i> or "You are an agent to receive it for me." Until the <i>get</i> is given to the woman, the status of the divorce is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The doubt is whether an agent can begin acting in the capacity of the woman's agent before he has completed executing the agency with which he was charged by the husband (<i>Gittin</i> 63b).</i> Once it reaches her possession, the divorce is definitely binding.
When an agent brings a <i>get</i>, he must give it to the woman in the presence of two [witnesses].<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 16.</i> These two [witnesses] must read [the <i>get</i>] and then have it given in their presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 19.</i> For the laws applying to the exchange between the agent and the woman are the same as those applying to her exchange with her husband, for the agent is taking his place.<br>Accordingly, if the agent gave [the <i>get</i>] to her without having it read by the witnesses who observed its transfer, and the woman took it and threw it into the ocean, the status of the divorce is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 21.</i>
When an agent transgresses and gives [a woman her] <i>get</i> in private, he should take it back from her and give it to her in the presence of two [witnesses].<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam rules that after the fact, a <i>get</i> given in private is acceptable. There are, however, <i>geonim</i> who hold that such a <i>get</i> is unacceptable (Chapter 1, Halachah 16). Since the status of an agent is weaker than that of the husband himself, a second transfer of the <i>get</i> is required in this instance <i>a priori</i> (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> If he dies [and thus this is no longer possible], and the signatures of the witnesses on the <i>get</i> that the woman possesses have been verified, the divorce is acceptable.
Even when a <i>get</i> is delivered to the woman [for whom it is intended], it can be nullified [in the following instances]: The agent took the <i>get</i>, but the husband changed his mind before it reached the woman and told him or her: "The <i>get</i> that I sent you is void," he sent another agent to nullify [the <i>get</i>], or he told others, "The <i>get</i> that I sent to my wife is void."<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 26. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:59) rules that at the outset, a husband should not nullify a <i>get</i> unless either the agent he appointed or his wife is present. Otherwise, it is possible that the woman may receive the <i>get</i> - and marry another man - before receiving notice that her <i>get</i> was nullified.</i><br>When [a husband] nullifies the <i>get</i> in the presence of other people,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., people other than the agent. If he nullifies the <i>get</i> in the presence of the agent, no one else need be present.</i> there must be at least two people present.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:59), who cites an opinion that allows the husband to nullify the <i>get</i> by speaking to two people, one outside the presence of the other.</i> If the <i>get</i> has already been delivered to the woman or to a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i>, the husband can no longer nullify it.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For the divorce has already taken effect.</i> [This applies] even if he nullifies the <i>get</i> within a very brief time<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In this context, the words "a very brief time" are a loose translation. The Hebrew term <i>toch k'dei dibbur</i> has a very specific meaning: the amount of time necessary to say "<i>Shalom alecha, rabbi umori</i>."</i> [after appointing the agent];<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that divorcing a wife is a very serious matter, and a man would not make such a decision unless he were resolute. Therefore, his change of mind is not considered to be a clarification of his original position (as in certain other instances - e.g., a retraction of a business commitment), but rather an entirely new decision. (Note the parallels to <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 7:22, <i>Hilchot Avodah Zarah</i> 2:9 and <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:17.)</i> since [the <i>get</i>] was nullified after being delivered to the woman, to [her] <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> or to her courtyard, it is not void, and the divorce is effective.
Although [a husband] was seeking to appoint an agent to nullify [a <i>get</i>], or he was seeking two individuals so that he could nullify [the <i>get</i>] in their presence, and during the time he was searching for these individuals the <i>get</i> reached the woman's hand, and afterwards he nullified it, it is not void.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The fundamental principle involved is that Torah law depends on a person's acts and statements, not his feelings. Although it is obvious that the husband desired to nullify the <i>get</i>, since he was not able to take binding action the divorce is valid. (See also Halachah 25.)</i> Despite the fact that he was trying to nullify it before it reached her hand [the divorce is effective].
If [the husband] told ten men: "Write a <i>get</i> and give it to my wife,"<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 27.</i> he may nullify [the <i>get</i>] in the presence of one of the ten, although the others are not present. And he may nullify it in the presence of two other people [who were not involved originally].<br>If he sent the <i>get</i> via two [agents], he may negate one of the agents although the other is not present. Even when there are ten agents, when he negates [the agency] in the presence of one of them, the <i>get</i> is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with Rambam and maintains that although a person may nullify the agency of one of the two (or ten), doing so does not nullify the agency of the other(s), and if they give the woman the <i>get</i>, the divorce is effective. Although the Rambam's opinion is also mentioned, it is that of the Ra'avad that is favored by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 149:61).</i>
Similarly, when a person tells two [witnesses],<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 134:1) states that even when the husband makes statements to two witnesses individually, the objection is binding.</i> "The <i>get</i> that I [am intending to] write for my wife is nullified," although he has a <i>get</i> written afterwards and gives it to her in the presence of two other [witnesses], the divorce is void. This is referred to as lodging an objection with regard to a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i>, Chapter 6, the Rambam explains the details of lodging an objection with regard to a sale. There he explains that when a person is compelled to make a sale against his will, he can nullify the transaction by issuing an objection stating that he was compelled to make this sale. With regard to an objection to a <i>get</i>, other authorities (see <i>Tur</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i>, Chapter 134) also mention the concept of compulsion. The Rambam, however, omits mention of the subject entirely.<br>As reflected in Halachah 27, our Sages considered lodging an objection to a <i>get</i> in a very negative light.</i><br>Similarly, if [the husband] were to tell two [witnesses]: "Any <i>get</i> that so and so will write for me is nullified," "Any <i>get</i> that I will have written in the court of so and so is nullified," or "Any <i>get</i> that I will have written in the next twenty years is nullified," the <i>get</i> is nullified.<br>Similarly, if he told two [witnesses]: "Any <i>get</i> that I write for so and so, my wife, is nullified. And any statements that I make to nullify this objection are nullified," the <i>get</i> is void, although he had it written and given to her, despite the fact that he nullified his objection before having the <i>get</i> written.
How can the latter situation be corrected?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The situation mentioned by the Rambam in the previous halachah is not merely a theoretical question. In many instances, a husband who was compelled to divorce his wife would seek to have the <i>get</i> nullified so that their marriage could continue. Similarly, apostates and men whose feelings toward their wives have soured have sought to nullify their divorces in order to cause their wives difficulties.</i> The witnesses should tell [the husband] before the composition of the <i>get</i>: "Affirm in our presence that any statements that you have made that when verified would cause [this] <i>get</i> to be nullified, are themselves nullified."<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Many of the other commentaries differ with the Rambam concerning this point. Some - e.g., the Rashba - are more stringent, for they maintain that the husband can word his objection to nullify even such a statement. They explain that to insure that the <i>get</i> is not nullified, the husband must also disqualify the testimony of any witness who heard his objections.<br>Others - e.g., Rabbenu Asher - are more lenient and maintain that all that is necessary is for the husband to say that all objections to the <i>get</i> are nullified. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 134:3) rules according to the Rashba. The Ramah maintains that Rabbenu Asher's ruling is halachically acceptable; however, he counsels following the Rashba's ruling to eliminate all doubts.</i> [The husband] must answer "Yes."<br>Afterwards, he should instruct them to write the <i>get</i>, sign it and give it to his wife. We do not let [the husband] leave until the <i>get</i> is delivered [to his wife], lest he go out and nullify [the <i>get</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the statements that he had made previously, if the husband nullified the <i>get</i> afterwards, his statements would be effective and the divorce void (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i><br>Neither a person who lodges an objection [to a <i>get</i>], nor one who seeks to nullify such an objection needs [to have his statements affirmed by] an act of contract.
When a person has sent a <i>get</i> via an agent and [later] nullifies [the giving of] the <i>get</i>, he may divorce the woman with [this <i>get</i>] whenever he desires. He did not nullify the <i>get</i> as a <i>get</i>; he merely nullified the agency.<br>Therefore, if the <i>get</i> was in the possession of the husband and he nullified it - e.g., he said: "This <i>get</i> is nullified" - he may never use it for a divorce. It is like a broken shard, and if it is used for a divorce, the divorce is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">There are authorities who differ with the Rambam on this point, based on their version of <i>Gittin</i> 32b. According to these authorities, since the <i>get</i> was written according to law, it is always able to be used for a divorce and can never be nullified by the husband. In consideration of the opinion of these authorities, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:66), when quoting this law, rules that the status of the divorce is in doubt.</i><br>Similarly, if the <i>get</i> was entrusted to the agent, but the husband made an explicit statement, saying: "The <i>get</i> that I sent is nullified [and may not] serve as a <i>get</i>," he may never use it to effect a divorce.
Which wording can be used to nullify a <i>get</i>? [The husband] says: "It is nullified," "I cannot abide by it," "May this <i>get</i> not be effective," "[May it] not permit [her]," "[May it] not release [her], "[May it] not send [her] forth," "[May it] not divorce [her]," "May it be a shard," "May it be like a shard," or "Behold it is like a shard" - If he used any of these expressions or a similar one, he has negated it.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that these expressions all indicate that the husband no longer desires to use this <i>get</i> to divorce his wife.</i>
If, however, [the husband] says: "This <i>get</i> is not a <i>get</i>," "It is unacceptable," "It is not effective," "It does not permit [her]," "It does not release [her], "It does not send [her] forth," "It does not divorce [her]," "It is a shard," his statements are not effective. This wording does not [indicate his desire to] nullify [the <i>get</i>]. Instead, they are statements of fact, and in this instance, statements of incorrect fact.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For all the statements quoted above are false. The <i>get</i> is effective; it is the husband who no longer desires to use it.</i> It is as if someone said that a forbidden entity were permitted or that an impure object were pure.
If he says, "This <i>get</i> is nullified," [it is possible that] the implication is the use of the past tense, as in the phrase [Song of Songs 5:6]: "He turned away and was gone." Thus, there is a question concerning the matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam implies that the question is whether the word לטב implies a future tense - i.e., that his intent is to nullify the <i>get</i> - in which instance the divorce would not be effective. Or whether it implies the past tense, in which case, as in the previous halachah, the husband would be giving us incorrect information.<br>Rashi offers a slightly different interpretation of the passage in <i>Gittin</i> 32b that serves as the source for this halachah. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:63) quotes both opinions.</i> Therefore, if [a woman] has been divorced with this <i>get</i> [after such statements were made], the status of the divorce is in doubt.
[As reflected in the following instance, an explicit statement must be made to nullify the <i>get</i>: A man] sent a <i>get</i> to his wife [via an agent]. The agent returned to him and said: "I could not find her," or "She did not want to receive it." Although the husband answered: "Blessed be He who is good and does good," or made other statements that imply that he no longer wants to divorce her, and that he is happy that the <i>get</i> was not delivered, the <i>get</i> is not nullified. Instead, he may give it to her and the divorce will be effective. [For the <i>get</i> to be nullified,] he must explicitly say "Do not give it to her," or he should explicitly nullify it [using one of the above expressions].
A person who sent a <i>get</i> to his wife [via an agent] and then nullified [the <i>get</i>] in the presence of two other people,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the man nullifies the <i>get</i> in the presence of the agent or in the presence of his wife, there is no difficulty.</i> and similarly, a person who issued an objection [nullifying] a <i>get</i>, should be given stripes for rebelliousness, because he makes it possible for illegitimate children to be conceived.<br>Since a <i>get</i> reached [the woman], [it is possible that] she will marry on this basis. [Only] afterwards, when the witnesses in whose presence the husband nullified the <i>get</i> or issued an objection before the <i>get</i> was written appear [will she realize the difficulty]. Thus, a child [conceived in her second marriage] will be illegitimate.
When an agent brings a <i>get</i> and gives it to a woman, we do not suspect that the husband nullified it. Instead, he should give it to the woman under the presumption that it is acceptable, and the woman may marry on this basis. If it is discovered afterwards that [the husband] negated it, [the woman] must leave [her second husband], and any children conceived are illegitimate.<br>Similarly, when [a husband] has a <i>get</i> written and gives it to his wife, we do not suspect that perhaps he lodged an objection regarding this <i>get</i>. Instead, we operate under the conception that the <i>get</i> is acceptable, and the woman is allowed to marry on this basis.
Similarly, when an agent brings a <i>get</i> [that was sent by] a man who was sick or elderly, he may give it to the woman under the presumption that the husband is still alive. If, however, the husband was in his death throes when [the agent left], even when he gives the <i>get</i> to the woman the status of the divorce is in doubt. For the majority of those in their death throes will die, and a <i>get</i> given after death is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The primary reason for giving such a <i>get</i> - for the marriage is terminated with the husband's death regardless - is to free a childless woman from the obligations of <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i>. If the <i>get</i> was given before the husband's death, these rites are not necessary. Otherwise, they are. With the current advances in record keeping and communication, it is usually possible to eliminate the doubt mentioned in this halachah.</i><br>Similarly, when a city is surrounded by an army<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:69) states that this law applies only when a city is surrounded by the army of the ruling authority. If it is surrounded by an army from another country, we no longer operate under the presumption that the husband is alive.</i> and held under siege, a ship is in distress at sea,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 3:4), the Rambam defines a ship in distress as follows: "One that faces a tempest-torn sea that threatens to sink it. The sailors are unable to control its path as they desire.... Nevertheless, all the oars and the other instruments remain intact."</i> or a person is taken out to be judged [with regard to a capital case],<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This applies regardless of whether the person is being tried by a Jewish court or a gentile court.</i> we presume that any person in such a situation is alive. If a person in such a situation has sent a <i>get</i> [to his wife] via an agent, he may give it to her, and the presumption will be that the divorce is effective.
When, by contrast, a city has been conquered by an attacking army and [its wall] broken, a ship is lost at sea,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam defines this as referring to a ship whose oars, steering mechanism and other navigational tools have been broken, and it is totally at the mercy of the waters.<br>The laws that apply when a ship has sunk are described in Chapter 13, Halachah 16.</i> a person is being taken out to be executed by a gentile court,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that if the person was sentenced to death by a Jewish court, we presume that the sentence was carried out. (See <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 9:2.) In contrast, there is a possibility that a gentile court will accept a bribe.</i> or he is being dragged by a beast of prey, swept away by a river or an avalanche has fallen upon him, the stringencies applying to both the living and the dead, are followed.<br>If [a person in one of these situations gave] a <i>get</i> to an agent, the agent should not give it to the husband's wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Lest the husband have died already.</i> If, however, he gives it to her, the status of the divorce is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For we do not know which came first, the husband's death or the giving of the <i>get</i>.</i> If it is known that the husband died before the <i>get</i> reached his wife, the divorce is void.
When a husband sends his wife a <i>get</i>, he is obligated to provide her with support and fulfill the other stipulations of the marriage contract, until the <i>get</i> reaches [his wife] or a <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> she has appointed.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Although the husband desires to divorce her, she remains his wife until the <i>get</i> reaches her. Therefore, the husband remains obligated by the marriage contract.</i>

Chapter 7

[The following rules apply when] an agent brings a <i>get</i> from one place to another in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is singled out because Jewish courts frequently held sessions there, and it was feasible to verify the signatures of the witnesses to the <i>get</i>. In contrast, the courts in the diaspora held sessions less frequently, and verifying the signature of witnesses was a far more formidable task. Therefore, different laws apply, as stated in Halachah 5. In the present age, the laws applying to sending <i>gittin</i> in the diaspora are also followed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:1.)</i> Although [the agent] did not witness the writing of the <i>get</i> and does not know who the witnesses are, but rather the <i>get</i> was given to him by the husband, who instructed him to give it to his wife, [the agent] may give [the woman the <i>get</i>] in the presence of witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">More particularly, according to the Rambam, only one witness is necessary, because the agent himself may serve as the second witness.</i> Although the identity of the witnesses [who signed the <i>get</i>] is unknown to us, [the woman] is considered divorced, and she may remarry on this basis.
If the husband came and protested, saying: "I never divorced her. The <i>get</i> she was given is a forgery," the signatures [of the witnesses] should be verified.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If the signatures of the witnesses can be verified, the husband's protests are ignored. Once the witnesses sign the <i>get</i>, it is considered as if they have testified in court, and the husband's statements are of no avail.</i> If this is impossible, and the witnesses are not known at all, she must leave [her second husband], and [any children born to them] are considered illegitimate,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 142:5, which quotes a difference of opinion among the commentaries whether or not the Rambam maintains that the husband's protest causes the <i>get</i> to be considered void. The consequence of this difference of opinion is the status of the children born out of a second marriage. Are they definitely considered to be illegitimate, or is this a point of doubt?</i> for [we assume that] she has not been divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam considers the <i>get</i> to be unacceptable because the fact that the husband protests the authenticity of the <i>get</i> and the woman is unable to verify the signatures causes us to question the matter. Since the woman was regarded as married, her status cannot be changed until she receives a <i>get</i> that is not open to doubt.<br>The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141) explains that although we assume that the woman has not been divorced, we do not know this with absolutely certainty. Hence, if she is consecrated by another man after receiving this <i>get</i>, she must be divorced by this second husband. Similarly, there are other authorities who maintain that the status of the divorce is doubtful.</i> If the <i>get</i> has been lost, the status of the divorce is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance there is no way to verify the signature of the witnesses.</i><br>For this reason, women who we presume hate each other are not trusted to bring a <i>get</i> to one another in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. [We suspect that] it might be a forgery, because one desires that the other remarry and be forbidden to her husband[s].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the woman remarries, she will be committing adultery, and hence, she will be forbidden to remain married to her first husband. Nor will she be permitted to remain married to her second husband. Since they were involved in an adulterous relationship, they are forbidden to marry.</i>
These are the women who we presume hate each other:<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., just as a mother-in-law may not bring a <i>get</i> for her daughter-in-law, a daughter-in-law may not bring a <i>get</i> for her mother-in-law.</i> A mother-in-law, the daughter of a mother-in-law, another woman married to the same man - this applies even if this woman has since remarried<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that this woman has been divorced and remarried, we assume that she still harbors bad feelings towards the woman with whom she shared her previous husband and might desire to create difficulties for her.</i> - her <i>yevamah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a woman who is married to her husband's brother. If the woman's husband died without children, her husband's brother would be obligated to marry her to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i>. Thus, the two women could ultimately become married to the same man.</i> - this applies even if she was her sister<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Although in this instance the mitzvah of <i>yibbum</i> would not apply because the two sisters are forbidden to marry the same man, our Sages did not differentiate when imposing this restriction.</i> - and her husband's daughter [from another marriage]. All other women are acceptable [to act in this capacity].
When a man brings a <i>get</i> from one place to another place in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and becomes sick or is prevented from fulfilling his agency because of factors beyond his control, he may send the <i>get</i> via a second agent.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, there is nothing preventing the agent from carrying out his agency, he may not appoint another agent. For we assume that a husband would object to the substitution (<i>Gittin</i> 29a).</i> Similarly, if the second agent becomes sick, he may send it via another agent. Indeed, even 100 agents [may be appointed in this manner].<br>There is no need for the agent to appoint the second agent in the presence of witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes on Chapter 6, Halachah 4, there are opinions that differ and require the appointment of an agent to be observed by witnesses. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:11) favors the Rambam's view with regard to the appointment of the agent himself, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:40) follows the other opinions with regard to the agent's appointment of a second agent. In practice, the present custom is to have the appointment witnessed.</i> The final agent to whom the <i>get</i> is given should give it to the woman in the presence of two witnesses, and the divorce is effective. [This applies] even when the first agent dies [before the divorce takes effect].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For the husband, and not the previous agent, is the source of empowerment for the final agent.</i>
[The following rules apply when] an agent brings a <i>get</i> from one place to another in the diaspora, from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to the diaspora or from the diaspora to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. If the agent was present at the time of the composition and signature of the <i>get</i>, he should say, in the presence of two witnesses, "It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, the verification of the signature of witnesses on a legal document requires two witnesses. In this instance, however, an exception was made, and the statements of one individual are accepted.<br>The rationale for this exception can be explained as follows: According to Scriptural law, there is no need for the signatures of the witnesses to a legal document to be verified. This requirement was instituted by our Sages. And in order to prevent a woman from having difficulties in obtaining a divorce, they relaxed that requirement and accepted the statements of the agent (<i>Gittin</i> 3a).<br>The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:7) quotes opinions that rule that the phrase "It was written and signed in my presence" must be recited in its Hebrew original, <i>B'fanai nichtav uv'fanai nechtam</i>; a translation is not sufficient.</i><br>Afterwards, it should be given in her presence, and the divorce takes effect, even though the identity of the witnesses is not known to us. Even if the witnesses' names resemble the names of gentiles, we do not suspect [that there is any difficulty].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not suspect that the witnesses were gentiles and that the <i>get</i> is void. For it has been customary for Jews living in the diaspora to adopt gentile names (<i>Tosafot, Gittin</i> 11b).<br>If, however, the probability is small that a Jew would use such a name, e.g., Nickolas or Patrick, there are authorities who are more stringent. See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 130:30.</i>
If [afterwards,] the husband came and protested [that the <i>get</i> is a forgery], his words are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Once the statements of the agent are accepted by the court, they are given the same weight as if they had been made by two witnesses. Therefore, the protest of the husband is of no consequence (<i>Gittin</i> 9a). If, however, the husband brings two witnesses who testify that the <i>get</i> is a forgery, their word - and not that of the agent - is accepted (Halachah 9).</i> Therefore, even women who we presume hate each other are relied upon to bring a <i>get</i> in such a situation and state that it was written and signed in their presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Our suspicion is that these women would forge a <i>get</i> to cause the wife to be forbidden to remained married to both husbands, and that the forgery will be easily discovered, because her first husband will protest the legitimacy of the <i>get</i>. When the agent herself must say "The get was written and signed in my presence," the first husband's protest will not be accepted, and the woman will be allowed to remain married to her second husband.

Similarly, when an agent who brings a <i>get</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> says: "It was written and signed in my presence," although he is not required to do so, if the husband comes and protests [that the <i>get</i> was forged], [the husband's] words are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages accepted the statements of the agent as equivalent to those of two witnesses even when he was not required to have made them (<i>Gittin</i> 6b).

According to the general principles mentioned by the Rambam (Chapter 10, Halachah 2), if the woman remarries in such an instance, she is not obligated to leave her second husband. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 142) quotes opinions that differ and require her to leave her second husband, even if her first husband does not protest.

Why did [our Sages] require [the agent] to say: "It was written and signed in my presence" in the diaspora? So that the woman would not have to have [the signatures] verified if the husband comes and protests. [Our Sages did not desire that she be faced with such a predicament,] because witnesses are often not available to verify signatures [on a document that has been taken] from one place to another in the diaspora.
When a husband brought explicit proof<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., two witnesses who testify that the <i>get</i> is a forgery.</i> that a <i>get</i> concerning which [an agent] said: "It was written and signed in my presence" is a forgery, [the <i>get</i>] is void. For [our Sages] accepted the statements of one person only in the face of a protest raised by a husband that was not accompanied by substantial proof. When, however, this person's statements are contradicted by witnesses, [his statements] are not accepted.

On the difference of opinion between Rabbah and Ravva regarding the reason for the agent having to say: "It was written and signed in my presence," the Rambam follows the opinion of Ravva, who states that the problem is not <i>lishmah</i>, but rather the verification of the signatures of the witnesses.</i> provided it was the initial portion - even one line<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Gittin</i> 15a, interprets this as referring to the line that contains the man's name, the woman's name and the date. <i>Tosafot</i> interprets it as referring to the first line of the <i>get</i>.

Similarly, even if the scribe went out to the marketplace and then returned and completed the <i>get</i>, [the agent] does not fear that another [man] found [the scribe] and told him [to write a <i>get</i> for him], and he [completed] writing the <i>get</i> for another person.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">If that were the case, the <i>get</i> would not be written <i>lishmah</i>.</i> Instead, [the agent] may say: "It was written and signed in my presence."

When two agents bring a <i>get</i> from the diaspora, they may give it to [the woman], causing the divorce to be effective, even though it was not written and signed in their presence. Since the husband gave it to them to give to his wife, his protests regarding this <i>get</i> are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 142) differs with this ruling. He agrees that in contrast to a <i>get</i> brought by one agent, a <i>get</i> brought by two agents may be given to the woman without their saying, "It was written and signed in our presence." Nevertheless, the <i>Tur</i> maintains that if the husband protests the authenticity of the <i>get</i>, the signatures of the witnesses must be verified.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:18) follows the Rambam's ruling, while the Ramah quotes that of the <i>Tur</i>.</i> Although [the signatures of the witnesses] have not been verified, the agents he [appointed] serve as witnesses [to its authenticity].<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This law applies only when the agents are able to serve as witnesses in court.

When does the above apply? When the <i>get</i> is in the possession of both of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Gittin</i> 16b) appears to imply that both agents must be physically holding the <i>get</i> together. The Rashba differs [and this opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:18)] and states all that is necessary is for the agents to state that they were both appointed by the husband and given the <i>get</i>. The Rashba extends this leniency and states that even if only one agent was appointed by the husband, if another person witnessed his appointment and traveled with him, it is not necessary for the agent to say "It was written and signed in my presence."</i> If, however, the <i>get</i> is not in the possession of both of them, they must say: "It was written and signed in our presence."<br>Accordingly, if one agent says, "It was written in my presence," and the second<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, according to the interpretation accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, we are not speaking about a second agent, but another person who accompanied the agent.</i> says, "It was signed in my presence," or they both say, "It was written in our presence," and one<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This is referring to a third individual, and not one of the agents.</i> says: "It was signed in my presence," since it is not in the possession of both of them, it should not be given to the woman unless the authenticity of the signatures has been verified.
If one person said: "It was written in my presence,"<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that the statement, "It was written in my presence," is unnecessary. Since two witnesses testify that they observed the signing of the <i>get</i>, they have verified the signatures of the witnesses. The Rambam mentions this instance, only because he is quoting the wording of the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 2:1). And the Mishnah mentions this only as a literary device, so that the wording in its different clauses are parallel.</i> and two people say: "It was signed in our presence," [the <i>get</i>] is acceptable.

[The following rules apply when] an agent brings a <i>get</i> in the diaspora and gives it to the woman in private, or gives it to her in the presence of two witnesses, but does not tell her: "It was written and signed in my presence." Even if she has married, he should take the <i>get</i> back from her and then give it to her in the presence of two witnesses and say: "It was written and signed in my presence." If he does not take it back from her, the divorce is unacceptable<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This wording implies that if the woman remarried after this divorce, she may remain married to her second husband.

If [the agent] gave a woman a <i>get</i> and did not suffice to say: "It was written and signed in my presence," before he lost the power of speech, the signatures [of the witnesses] should be verified.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's wording, it appears that it is not sufficient for the witness to write these words out. Although a person who cannot speak and who witnessed the death of a woman's husband is allowed to write out his testimony (Chapter 13, Halachah 28), there is no alternative in that situation. In these circumstances, there is an alternative: to have the signatures of the witnesses verified (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Afterwards, he may give it to her.
A blind person may not bring a <i>get</i> from the diaspora, because he is unable to say: "It was written and signed in my presence." Accordingly, if [the <i>get</i>] was written and signed in his presence while he possessed the power of sight, and he became blind afterwards, he may say in the presence of three [men]: "It was written and signed in my presence," and give [the <i>get</i>] to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 23a states that when an agent is blind, he must be able to recognize the woman by the sound of her voice. It is not sufficient for others to identify her for him. When an agent can see, however, he need not know the woman's identity and may rely on the statements of others (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:11).</i><br>Similarly, when a woman brings a <i>get</i> from the diaspora, she must say: "It was written and signed in my presence," in the presence of three [men]. The provision to make these statements in the presence of two men applies only when the agent is acceptable to serve as a witness.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Edut</i> 9:12 states that a blind person may not serve as a witness, and <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 2:9 states that such a person may not serve as a judge. <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 9:2 states that a woman may not serve in these capacities. Similarly, if the agent is related to the man or the woman, he is incapable of serving as a judge and three witnesses are necessary (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:4).</i> In such an instance, he joins the other two and serves as one of the three who verify the <i>get</i>, based on his statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 5 and 7 and notes.</i> For a witness may serve as a judge in matters of Rabbinic law.

If the second agent becomes ill or is prevented from carrying out his agency by forces beyond his control, he should appoint another agent in the presence of the court. [Indeed,] even 100 [agents can be appointed in this manner].<br>[Before transferring the <i>get</i>,] the final agent says: "I am an agent of the court." He should then give the woman [the <i>get</i>]. [The <i>get</i> can be given] even if the first agent died.<br>Why must [the appointment be made] in court? Because [the first agent] must say: "It was written and signed in my presence."<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The reason the appointment of the latter agents must be made in a court is that the signatures of the witnesses have not been verified. By stating that his appointment was made in a court of law, every agent assures the court that the correct process has been followed regarding this <i>get</i>.</i> If, however, the signatures [of the witnesses] were verified, although one agent gives it to another in private - even if 100 agents are appointed in this way - the <i>get</i> is acceptable when it reaches the woman.<br>Although the husband did not explicitly tell the agent: "Send [the <i>get</i>] via another person if you are hindered by forces beyond your control," the agent may [appoint another agent] if he becomes ill or is hindered by forces beyond his control.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, there are no factors preventing the agent from discharging his agency, he may not appoint another agent unless the husband explicitly gave him the authority to do so (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>
Whenever a person appoints an agent, the agent does not have to be present in court with him. Even if the agent is not present, he may tell [the court]: "So and so is my agent."<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The Rivash (Responsum 53) differs with this ruling and maintains that if the second agent does not hear the first agent say: "It was written and signed in my presence," he must be given a writ of appointment. Otherwise, he may not serve in this capacity. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:10) quotes the Rambam's ruling - and indeed expands upon it, allowing the agent to give the court the authority to appoint any agent they desire. The Ramah quotes the ruling of the Rivash.</i> Similarly, an agent may appoint an agent when the latter is not present. [Indeed,] even 100 [agents can be appointed in this manner].
A husband [may appoint] his wife [as an agent to transport her <i>get</i> to another place]. After having it written and signed in her presence, he gives her the <i>get</i> and tells her: "You are an agent to bring it to the court of so and so. They will appoint an agent, who will give you this <i>get</i> and thus effect the divorce."<br>Should the woman say: "It was written and signed in my presence," [when delivering the <i>get</i> to the court], her statements are accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">She must, however, make these statements for the divorce to be effective. Our Sages made this requirement in order not to differentiate between one agency and another (Rashba, commenting on <i>Gittin</i> 24a).</i> [The court] should take the <i>get</i> from her and give it to the agent so that he can give it to her as the husband instructed.
When does the above apply? When the husband [explicitly] made this stipulation. But if this stipulation is not made, but instead the husband [merely] gave her the <i>get</i> and it is in her possession, she is not required to make any statements [to the court]. We assume that she is divorced, for she is in possession of a <i>get</i> that is written according to law and that is signed by witnesses.<br>Although we do not recognize the signatures of the witnesses, and [their authenticity] has not been verified, we do not suspect that [the woman] forged them, for she would not cause her own ruin.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">It is likely that a forgery would ultimately be discovered, and she would then be forbidden to remain married to her second husband, nor would she be permitted to return to her first husband.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> draws a connection between this halachah and Chapter 12, Halachah 2, which states that the statements of a woman who produces a <i>get</i> are accepted, even though the authenticity of the signatures of the witnesses to the <i>get</i> has not been verified. The Ra'avad in his gloss on <i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 6:7 differs (see also his gloss to Chapter 12, Halachah 2). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:13-14) quotes the opinions of both the Rambam and the Ra'avad. See the Rivash (Responsum 385).</i><br>Moreover, it is considered as if the witnesses who signed the <i>get</i> had testified in court, until a protest is raised. Therefore, we assume that the <i>get</i> was written according to law and [grant the woman permission to] marry, as we assume that a <i>get</i> brought by an agent [in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>] is acceptable until the husband raises a protest or until he brings proof that it is a forgery or that it is void.<br>For if we had suspicions concerning these matters and the like, we would have to suspect that perhaps when a husband gave a <i>get</i> in our presence, he nullified it before he gave it; perhaps the witnesses who sign it are unacceptable, causing it to be regarded as a forgery; or perhaps it was not written for the sake [of the man or the woman being divorced]. Just as we do not entertain suspicions concerning these factors and assume that the <i>get</i> [is acceptable] until it is discovered that it is void, so too, we do not entertain suspicions concerning an agent or a woman when a <i>get</i> is in their possession. [The rationale is] that the laws governing prohibitions differ from those governing financial transactions.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to financial transactions, a person's statements are not accepted if he has an interest in the matter, unless he substantiates them with proof. Therefore, if a person gives a servant a deed of release that states that he has been freed and has been granted his master's possessions, his word is accepted with regard to his freedom. With regard to the possessions, however, he is required to substantiate his statements by verifying the authenticity of the witnesses to the deed (<i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 7:2).</i>

Chapter 8

When [a man] divorces [his wife] according to a conditional arrangement, and the condition is fulfilled, the divorce is effective. If the condition is not fulfilled, the divorce is not effective. All the laws governing conditional agreements have been explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 6.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 2 of that chapter, which explains that there are four rules that govern all conditional agreements:<br>a) the stipulation must be twofold [with both a positive and negative statement];<br>b) the positive aspect must be stated before the negative aspect;<br>c) the stipulation should be mentioned before the completion of the action that one desires to make conditional;<br>d) the stipulation must be something with which it is possible to comply.<br>If one of these rules was not kept when a conditional agreement was made, the stipulation is nullified; it is as if there were no condition at all. Note the details and explanations of these rules there.</i><br>There it is explained that when [a man] divorces [his wife] according to a conditional arrangement, and the condition is fulfilled, the divorce is effective from the time the condition is fulfilled, and not from the time the <i>get</i> is given to her.<br>As such, a husband may nullify a <i>get</i>, add to his conditions or add a further condition, until the original condition is fulfilled although [the woman] has already been given the <i>get</i>.<br>If the husband dies [before the condition is fulfilled],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is relevant if the couple is childless, and the woman is obligated to fulfill either the rite of <i>yibbum</i> or of <i>chalitzah</i>.</i> or the <i>get</i> is lost or consumed by fire before the condition is fulfilled, the divorce is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the first clause, a <i>get</i> can be effective only when the husband granting the divorce is still alive. If he dies, the marriage bonds are already rent by his death. With regard to the latter clause, since the <i>get</i> takes effect only when the condition is fulfilled, the <i>get</i> itself must be intact at that time. If it is not, there is no medium through which the divorce takes effect (see <i>Gittin</i> 74a).</i> <i>A priori</i>, [the woman] should not remarry until the condition is fulfilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Lest the husband die or the <i>get</i> be destroyed, and thus the divorce be nullified.</i> If, however, she has already married, she need not leave [her second husband],<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling is clarified by his statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, in which he states that a conditional divorce begins when the <i>get</i> is given and is not concluded until the condition is fulfilled. This conception has aroused objections among the commentators, who maintain that until the condition is fulfilled, the woman is like any other married woman. She cannot be consecrated, and marital relations with her are considered adulterous. Although in his <i>Beit Yosef</i>, Rav Yosef Karo supports the more stringent views, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143:2), he appears to follow the Rambam's opinion (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 143:2).</i> unless she is no longer able to fulfill [the condition].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., her husband made a condition that she give an article to his father, and his father dies.</i> [For since] the condition is nullified [the divorce is void.]<br>There it is explained that if [the husband] tells [his wife]: "You are divorced from the present time - or from today - on the following condition," or "You are divorced on the condition<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the husband uses this expression rather than saying: "If you do such and such, the divorce is effective.

How should a man divorce [his wife] conditionally? He should not say: "Write a <i>get</i> for my wife on this condition," or "Write a <i>get</i> and give it to her on this condition." Needless to say, he should not write in the <i>get</i>: "So and so divorces so and so on the [following] condition."<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is unacceptable, as explained in the following halachah.</i><br>What procedure should instead be followed? He should instruct the scribe to write [a <i>get</i>] and the witnesses to sign. They should write an acceptable <i>get</i> that does not mention any condition at all. Afterwards, he should give her the <i>get</i> and tell her: "This is your <i>get</i>..." or "Behold you are divorced on the following condition." Or he should tell [the witnesses] or his agent: "Give her this <i>get</i> on the following condition."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 147:1, which states that in a situation of difficulty in which the husband cannot wait until the <i>get</i> is written, we rely on more lenient views that differ with the Rambam. According to these views, the husband may instruct the scribe and the witnesses to write a <i>get</i> in the usual manner and to give it to the agent and before it is written, instruct the agent to give it to the woman conditionally.</i>
If [a husband] had a condition<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a condition that is acceptable (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 147:2).</i> written in the <i>get</i> after the essential portion of the <i>get</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the man's name, the woman's name, the date and the sentence: "Behold, you are permitted [to marry] any man," as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 17.</i> was written, the <i>get</i> is acceptable, regardless of whether [the condition] was written before the signature of the witnesses or after their signature.<br>If, however, [the condition] was written before the essential portion of the <i>get</i> - even if he used the wording, "on the following condition"<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., using acceptable wording, as opposed to the wording described in the following halachah.</i> - the status of the divorce is doubtful, for the husband retains rights in the essential matter of the <i>get</i>. Similarly, if he verbally stated a condition before the essential portion of the <i>get</i> was written, the status of the divorce is doubtful.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling is questioned by the commentaries. <i>Gittin</i> 84b states that such a <i>get</i> is <i>pasul</i>, "unacceptable." Unlike the Rambam, for whom this term has an explicit meaning (see Chapter 10, Halachah 20), in the Talmud the interpretation of the term is somewhat ambiguous. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that since - as mentioned in the previous halachah - the difficulty concerns a point of Torah law, and yet the Talmud did not rule the <i>get</i> to be void, he maintains that the status of the divorce is in doubt.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam interprets the ruling as dependent on the principle of <i>bererah</i>, that retroactively, when the condition is fulfilled, it becomes apparent that the <i>get</i> did sever the connection between the husband and the wife. Since our Sages did not determine whether or not the principle of <i>bererah</i> applies with regard to questions of Torah law, the status of the divorce is in doubt.<br>Other authorities differ and maintain that if the condition was stated properly before the essential portion of the <i>get</i> was written and fulfilled, the <i>get</i> is acceptable. If the condition was written in the <i>get</i> itself, <i>Tosafot</i>, the Ramban and the Ra'avad maintain that the <i>get</i> is acceptable, while Rabbenu Nissim states that such a <i>get</i> is deemed unacceptable by Rabbinic decree.<br>At the outset, all the authorities maintain that the rules stated by the Rambam should be followed. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 147:2) also quotes the Rambam's ruling that the status of the divorce is in doubt. In a case of hardship, however, the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 147:2 states that the more lenient views can be relied upon.</i>
[These rules apply when a man] divorces his wife and [makes the following conditions] whether verbally or in writing, after the essential portion [of the <i>get</i>] has been written,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, according to the Rambam, when any of the following conditions is binding, it invalidates the <i>get</i> if it was made or stated before the essential portion of the <i>get</i> was written. The difference between these conditions and those stated in the previous halachah is that those conditions can be fulfilled through a specific activity, and once they are fulfilled the marriage bond is severed entirely. The conditions mentioned in this halachah, by contrast, remain binding throughout the woman's life. Thus, her connection to her husband is never severed entirely.<br>The authorities which differ with the Rambam in the previous halachah, also differ in this instance, and maintain that if this condition is written in the <i>get</i> itself, the <i>get</i> is acceptable according to Scriptural law, but disqualified by Rabbinic decree. See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 137:3.</i>. If he tells her: "Behold, you are permitted [to marry] any man aside from so and so," or "...with the exception of so and so," [the ruling would depend on the identity of the individual specified].<br>If that individual is a gentile, a servant or a person with whom the woman is forbidden to engage in marital relations - e.g., her father, her brother, his father or his brother - the <i>get</i> is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the prohibitions involved, there is no possibility of the woman's establishing a marriage bond with these individuals (see <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:14-15), and therefore, her husband's statements are of no consequence.</i> If, however, the individual is one who could consecrate her [as a wife], the <i>get</i> is void,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Note, however, Chapter 10, Halachah 1. Rabbenu Nissim and other authorities rule more leniently and maintain that such a <i>get</i> is acceptable according to Scriptural law and was deemed unacceptable only by virtue of Rabbinic decree.</i> even if there is a negative prohibition [that is not punishable by death - neither at the hand of God nor the court - involved in such relations]<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In such instances, even though marital relations violate a prohibition, a marriage bond can be established (<i>Hilchot Ishut, loc. cit.</i>).</i> or that individual is a minor.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For ultimately, the minor will attain majority. Rabbenu Chanan'el differs and states that with regard to a minor, the status of the divorce is doubtful. The difference of opinion is dependent on the text of <i>Gittin</i> 85b, of which two versions exist.</i> [The rationale is that by making such a condition,] the husband retained certain rights with regard to the divorce, and [the bond between the couple] is not [entirely] severed.<br>If [the individual mentioned] is the husband of the wife's sister, the status of the divorce is in doubt. For although at present relations between the wife and that man are forbidden, if her sister dies, she will become permitted to marry him.
The status of the divorce is in doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In all the cases to follow, the divorce does not totally sever the relationship between the husband and the wife. Nevertheless, our Sages were not certain that the rights retained by the husband were sufficient to render the divorce void (<i>Gittin</i> 85a, <i>Perishah, Even HaEzer</i> 137).</i> when [a husband divorces his wife and] tells her: "Behold, you are permitted [to marry] any man, aside from a man who will be born in the future, who does not exist at present," "...aside from promiscuous relationships" - i.e., it is as if he said: "Behold, you are permitted to marry any man, but with regard to promiscuous relations, it is as if you remain forbidden like a married woman."<br>[This ruling also applies if he tells her:] "You are permitted to any man who will engage in relations with you in the ordinary manner, but with regard to anal intercourse, you remain prohibited," "You are permitted [to marry] any man, aside from one who consecrates you with a legal document" - i.e, the woman may be consecrated by [a gift of] money or via sexual relations, but if one consecrates her with a legal document, she is forbidden like a married woman - or "You are permitted [to marry] any man, with the exception of [the right to] nullify your vows" - i.e., [I] retain none of the rights of the marriage relationship except [the right to] nullify your vows; in that regard, it is as if you remained my wife.<br>[Similarly, if the husband desires that the woman be considered as if she were married with regard to her right] to partake of <i>terumah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the husband is a priest, and while married his wife may partake of <i>terumah</i>, although she is the daughter of an Israelite.</i> or with regard to his right to inherit her property if she dies [in his lifetime, the status of the divorce is in doubt].
[If a husband] tells [his wife]: "You are permitted [to marry] any man aside from Reuven and Shimon," and then tells her: "You are permitted [to marry] Reuven or Shimon," the divorce is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this refers to an instance where the husband takes the <i>get</i> back from the woman and gives it to her again, making the latter statement. This conception is also reflected in the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 137:1).<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 137) differs with the Rambam and maintains that in this instance the status of the divorce is in doubt. We suspect that perhaps the intent of his latter statement was to permit her to Reuven and Shimon, but to forbid her to everyone else. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 137:4) accepts the <i>Tur's</i> ruling. All authorities agree that if the husband says: "You are also permitted [to marry] Reuven or Shimon," the <i>get</i> is acceptable.</i> For he has nullified his condition, permitting his wife [to marry] the men [concerning whom] the condition was made.
[If, after telling his wife that she is permitted to marry any man aside from Reuven and Shimon, the husband] tells her: "You are permitted [to marry] Reuven," the divorce is void, because he has not nullified the condition [preventing her from marrying] Shimon.<br>If he tells her: "You are permitted to [marry] Shimon," or "You are even permitted to [marry] Shimon," the status of the divorce is in doubt. We suspect that perhaps he permitted her only to Shimon, and she is still forbidden to Reuven. By saying "even to Shimon," he meant "to everyone, even to Shimon." [Nevertheless, the divorce is not void, for] perhaps he permitted her to everyone, and by saying "even to Shimon," he meant "to Shimon and also to Reuven." [This is plausible,] for Shimon was mentioned after Reuven in his condition.
If [a husband] makes a condition, saying; "Today you are not my wife, but tomorrow you will be my wife," the divorce is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher and the Rashba differ and maintain that in such an instance, the divorce is effective. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 137:5) follows the view of Rabbenu Nissim, who maintains that the status of the divorce is in doubt.</i> Although the connection between the couple is severed on the day [of the <i>get</i>, it is renewed afterwards]. For this reason, in the wording of the <i>get</i>, is written the phrase: "from the present day onward."
[If a husband tells his wife:] "This is your <i>get</i> on the condition that you never drink wine for the rest of your life," the divorce is not effective, for [the relationship between them] has not been severed.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">There is a factor, the prohibition against drinking wine, that always maintains the connection between them.</i><br>If the condition states "for as long as I live" or "for as long as so and so lives," the divorce is effective, for the relationship between the couple is severed. When that person dies, [the woman] will no longer have any connection with [her previous husband].
[If a husband tells his wife:] "This is your <i>get</i> on the condition that you do not go to your father's house for 30 days, the divorce is effective. "...That you never go to your father's house," the divorce is not effective, for [the relationship between them] has not been severed.<br>[Similarly, if a husband] tells [his wife:] "This is your <i>get</i> on the condition that you never eat meat," or "...that you never drink wine," the divorce is not effective, for [the relationship between them] has not been severed. "...[that you not eat meat or drink wine] for 30 days, the divorce is effective.
[If a husband tells his wife:] "This is your <i>get</i> on the condition that you never marry so and so," the divorce is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Rashba differs with this ruling, explaining that since the other person may die, this can be compared to an instance where the husband makes a condition that his wife not drink wine during the duration of another person's life. Just as that condition is considered to be having a limit, so too, should this condition be considered to be limited.<br>In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo defends the Rambam's ruling, explaining that in the instance at hand, the woman will never be able to marry the man specified in the condition. As such, the condition is not considered limited. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143:22), he quotes both opinions and states that the stringencies required by both views should be observed.</i> To what can this be compared? to his telling her: "This is your <i>get</i> on the condition that you never drink wine," "...that you never go to your father's home," or "[that you not go to your father's home] for the rest of your life."<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the condition is one that binds a woman to her husband for her entire life.</i><br>If, however, he tells her: "[This is your <i>get</i>] on the condition that you do not marry so and so for fifty years,"<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes a responsum of the Rashbatz that states that the intent is that the marriage will be forbidden for a period longer than the woman is expected to live.

There are, however, other opinions that state that she is not allowed to remarry until the person specified dies. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143:16) quotes both opinions without appearing to favor either one.</i> If she marries him, the divorce is nullified retroactively.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is considered as if the original marriage bond had never been severed. Any children born to her between the divorce and its nullification are deemed illegitimate.</i><br>If [the woman] engages in promiscuous sexual relations with the man specified, any child born to her is legitimate, and the divorce remains acceptable. For [the husband's] condition mentioned only marriage.
[If a husband tells his wife:] "This is your <i>get</i> on the condition that you marry so and so," if she marries him [the divorce is effective], as it would be if other conditions were involved. Nevertheless, our Sages said that she should not marry either the man specified or any other man.<br>She should not marry the man specified, lest the people say: "They are giving their wives as presents to each other."<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This would compromise the entire image of Jewish divorce. (See Rashi, <i>Gittin</i> 84a.)</i> Nor should she marry anyone else, for the <i>get</i> is effective only when the condition is fulfilled.<br>If she transgresses and marries the man specified, she need not be divorced. If she marries another person before she marries the man specified, the <i>get</i> is nullified, and she must leave her second husband. Any child she bears [the second husband] is illegitimate. He must, however, divorce her with a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The requirement for the woman's second husband to divorce her is a Rabbinic decree, instituted lest people see a woman who appears married leave her husband without a <i>get</i>. According to Scriptural law, a <i>get</i> is not necessary (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ra'avad and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143) suggest that she can have the legitimacy of the children of her second husband restored retroactively by marrying the person specified in the first <i>get</i> after being divorced by her second husband. In this way, the condition will have been kept.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that the husband's intent was that the woman should marry the man specified before marrying anyone else. (The commentaries cite a parallel to this ruling in <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 11:10.) The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143:15) quotes the Rambam's view, while the Ramah follows that of the Ra'avad and the <i>Tur</i>.</i>
[If a husband tells his wife:] "Behold, this is your <i>get</i>, but the paper belongs to me," the divorce is not effective, for [the relationship between them] has not been severed.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since the husband maintains possession of the paper on which the <i>get</i> is written, the couple's marriage relationship has not been totally severed.

Afterwards, she willingly gives it back. This follows the principle that a present given on condition that it be returned is considered to be a present (Rashi, <i>Gittin</i> 20b).</i>
If he engraved a <i>get</i> on a plate of gold and gave it to her, telling her: "This is [both] your <i>get</i> and [the money due you by virtue of] your <i>ketubah</i>, [the divorce is] acceptable and she is considered to have received the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 20b explains that the fact that the same article serves two purposes - effecting the divorce and providing remuneration for the woman's marriage contract - does not prevent it from being effective.</i> provided the plate is worth the value of her <i>ketubah</i>.

[The following rules apply when a man] divorces [his wife] conditionally, including a stipulation that causes the divorce to be considered void - e.g., that she never eat meat or drink wine for the rest of her life, or that she be free to marry any man with the exception of a particular individual, or that he mentioned other conditions before the essential portion of the <i>get</i> was written: If the condition was written in the <i>get</i>, and he rubbed it out and gave it to her, the status of the divorce is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>get</i> was written in an unacceptable manner, there is reason to maintain that the <i>get</i> can never be acceptable. This applies when the unacceptable condition was written before the essential portion of the <i>get</i>.<br>The wording used by the Rambam is, however, questionable. The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 9:1) and the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> on this halachah use the word <i>pasul</i> "unacceptable," rather than "the status of the divorce is in doubt" to describe such a <i>get</i>. Perhaps here, the Rambam uses the term "the status of the divorce is in doubt," because, as cited above from the Rambam's responsa, according to the Rambam, the question in these situations is whether the <i>get</i> is written for the sake of severing the marriage bond. And this is a question of Scriptural law (Rav Kapach).</i> If the condition was stated verbally,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that this refers to a condition stated after the essential portion of the <i>get</i> was written. If such a condition was stated before the essential portion was written, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable, because it was not written with the intent of severing the marriage relationship. See Halachah 4 and notes.</i> he should take the <i>get</i> from her and give it to her again without mentioning a condition, or mention a condition that is acceptable.
What is implied? [A man] gave a <i>get</i> to his wife and told her, "Behold, you are divorced with this [<i>get</i>] and are free [to marry] any man aside from so and so."<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages decreed that unless the <i>get</i> is returned, it not effective, even if the condition was nullified. Since the original giving of such a <i>get</i> has a permanent effect - the woman is forbidden to marry a priest (or to remain married to her husband, if he is a priest), as stated in Chapter 10, Halachah 1 - the only way such a condition can be nullified is by returning the <i>get</i> to the husband, and having him give it again without any condition.<br>The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 147:6 states that this law applies only with regard to a condition that prevents her from marrying a particular man that was stated after the essential portion of the <i>get</i> was written. When a condition that nullifies the <i>get</i> was written before the essential portion of the <i>get</i> was written, the <i>get</i> is void and cannot be rectified. When a stipulation such as "on the condition that you do not drink wine for the rest of your life" was made after the essential portion of the <i>get</i> was written, there is no need to take the <i>get</i> back from the woman. It is sufficient to nullify the stipulation.</i> If he took [the <i>get</i>] from her and gave it to her and said: "Behold you are free [to marry] any man," or "This is your <i>get</i>," the divorce is effective. The same applies in other similar situations.
When [a man] gives a <i>get</i> to his wife on the condition that she give him two hundred <i>zuz</i>, and afterwards establishes a second condition in the presence of witnesses that she serve his father for two years, his latter statement did not nullify his original one.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that this refers to an instance where the condition was stated in a twofold statement: "If you do such and such, the <i>get</i> is effective, but if you do not do such and such, the <i>get</i> is not effective." In such instances, since the divorce is not effective until the condition is fulfilled, the husband may alter the condition. When, however, a <i>get</i> is given "on condition that... ," the divorce is retroactively effective from the time the <i>get</i> was given. Hence, the condition cannot be changed.<br>Rashi (<i>Gittin</i> 76a) offers a different interpretation of this passage. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143:10) follows the Rambam's interpretation, while the Ramah follows that of Rashi.</i> Instead, it is as if he told her: "Fulfill one of the two conditions." If she desires, she may serve his father, or if she desires, she may give [him the money]. One of the witnesses to the first condition cannot join with one of the witnesses to the second condition [to testify that the <i>get</i> was given on a conditional basis].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For each of the conditions is considered to be a separate matter.</i><br>If, however, [the husband] made a condition that the woman must give him 200 <i>zuz</i>, and afterwards made a condition in the presence of two [witnesses] that she must give him 300 <i>zuz</i>, the condition of 200 has been nullified, and she must give [him] 300 <i>zuz</i>. The same principle applies in all similar situations.
If [a husband] makes a condition that his wife must perform a specific activity without stating a duration of time, it is considered as if he stated that she should perform this activity for one day. For he did not specify any amount of time.<br>What is implied? If he told her: "This is your <i>get</i> on condition that you perform work for me," "...on condition that you serve my father," or "...on condition that you nurse my son," if she performs work for him or serves his father for one day or nurses his son for one day during the time when a child [usually] nurses - i.e., within his first 24 months [of life] - the <i>get</i> is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling reflects an interesting halachic judgment on the Rambam's part. <i>Gittin</i> 75b explains that the ruling cited by the Rambam was authored by Rav Ashi. Although the Gemara poses questions on Rav Ashi's view that are left unresolved, since his position was not refuted, according to the Rambam, the halachah follows his view.<br>The <i>Tur</i> follows a different view and maintains that the woman must serve her husband's father for the duration of the father's life and nurse the son for the entire two-year period. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143:8) follows the Rambam's view, while the Ramah cites that of the <i>Tur</i>.</i>If the son or the father dies before she nurses him or serves him, the <i>get</i> is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For the condition has not been fulfilled.</i>
If [the husband] tells her: "[This is your <i>get</i>] on condition that you nurse my son..." or "...serve my father for two years," [for the divorce to be effective] she must complete the time specified. If the son or the father dies within this period, or the father says: "I don't want you to serve me," the <i>get</i> is not effective, for the condition has not been fulfilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143) differs and states that since the woman did not prevent the condition from being fulfilled, the <i>get</i> is effective. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143:8) does not accept this view. The Ramah states that the more stringent view should be followed.</i> The same principles apply in all similar situations.
[The following rules apply when a husband] tells [his wife]: "[This is your <i>get</i>] on condition that you give me 200 <i>zuz</i> within 30 days." If she gives him [the money] within 30 days with his consent, the divorce is effective. If she gives [it] after 30 days, the divorce is not effective. If she gives it to him against his will, and he refuses to accept it, the divorce is unacceptable until he willingly accepts it.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion among our Sages regarding whether a person who forces a colleague to accept something is considered to have given it to him or not. Although the view that he is considered to have given the object is favored, the Rabbis deemed the divorce unacceptable in consideration of the other view (<i>Gittin</i> 74a, 75a).<br>More specifically, it appears that the Rambam maintains that according to Scriptural law, the <i>get</i> is effective, and it is disqualified merely by virtue of Rabbinic decree, while Rabbenu Asher and the Rashba maintain that, according to Scriptural law, there is a doubt regarding the issue (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 143:7).</i><br>If he tells her within the 30 days, "I am willing to forego [the money on your behalf," the divorce is not effective, because the condition was not fulfilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected in Halachah 23, a husband can nullify a condition that he makes to a <i>get</i>. In this instance, however, he is not nullifying the condition, but rather trying to have it satisfied in a way other than that which he originally intended. This is not acceptable. Originally, he made the condition to annoy the woman, and since she did not suffer this worrying, the divorce is not effective unless he nullifies the condition entirely (<i>Gittin</i> 74b; <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> If he dies within the 30 days, since the 30 days are completed without her giving [him the money], the divorce is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, if the husband dies without children, she is required to perform either the rites of <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>.</i>
If he tells her, "[This is your <i>get</i>] on condition that you give me 200 <i>zuz</i>," without specifying a time period, and he dies before she gives [him the money], she cannot give [the sum] to his heirs; the condition was that it be given to him.

In this instance, however, since a specific time is not mentioned, the Rambam maintains that the divorce is never nullified.<br>Rav Kapach explains that the Rambam's approach is based on his conception (see Halachah 1 of this chapter, and Chapter 9, Halachot 1 and 5) that when a <i>get</i> is given on a conditional basis, the <i>get</i> takes effect immediately, but it is not completed until the condition is fulfilled. Therefore, in this instance, since the condition can never be fulfilled, the divorce is not completed, and <i>chalitzah</i> is necessary if the husband dies childless. Nevertheless, <i>yibbum</i> cannot be performed, for the divorce has already begun.<br>Other commentaries offer different interpretations of the Rambam's views. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143) rejects the Rambam's ruling and maintains that the woman may also perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143:3) follows the Rambam's view.</i> Therefore, even if the <i>get</i> was lost or ripped before he died, [the woman] should not marry another man until she performs the rite of <i>chalitzah</i>.
[If the husband tells her:] "This is your <i>get</i> on condition that you give me this particular utensil," or "...this particular garment," and that utensil or garment is lost or stolen, even if she gives him 1000 <i>zuz</i> in compensation for [the desired object],<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 143) differs and explains that the husband has the option of accepting the money in lieu of the object originally mentioned.

Chapter 9

[When a man] divorces his wife and [asserts that the divorce] will not take effect until a specific time passes, the divorce takes effect when that time arrives. Thus, this resembles [a <i>get</i> given on] a conditional basis, and yet it is not a conditional <i>get</i>.<br>It resembles [a <i>get</i> given on] a conditional basis because the divorce takes effect when the specified time arrives [as in the case of a conditional <i>get</i>, which is completed when the condition is fulfilled]. Nevertheless, it is not considered a conditional <i>get</i> because a person who divorces [his wife] conditionally has already performed the divorce, and in this instance, the man has not divorced her until the time arrives.<br>For this reason, a person who gives a conditional <i>get</i> must restate the condition [in both a positive and negative form], while this person does not have to restate his words. Nor must he comply with the other requirements of conditional agreements that we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the notes on Chapter 8, Halachah 1.</i>.
What is implied? [When a husband] tells his wife: "This is your <i>get</i>, but the divorce does not take effect until 30 days pass," she is not divorced until after the passage of 30 days. If her husband dies, or the <i>get</i> is lost or consumed by fire in the interim, she is not divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If the husband dies she is not divorced, because a divorce must take effect before death. If the <i>get</i> is destroyed, she is not divorced because it is the <i>get</i> that serves as the medium of divorce, and at the time when the <i>get</i> must take effect, it no longer exists.</i>
[When the woman] went and placed [the <i>get</i>] in [a place] at the side of the public domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The public domain was a marketplace with pillars on either side. At the side of the pillars, there was space that though ownerless, could be used to acquire property, because it was not common for people to walk in that space. (See <i>Hilchot Gezelah Va'Avedah</i> 17:9.)</i> and after 30 days passed it was stolen or lost, the divorce is effective. Since the <i>get</i> existed on the day when it took effect, and it was set aside in a designated place that is not public domain [it can serve as the medium for the divorce].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others contrast the Rambam's ruling here, that the divorce is not retroactively effective from the time the husband gave the <i>get</i>, to his ruling in <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 2:9. That source states that a sale can be effective when made with the stipulation that it take effect after 30 days, only when the stipulation is that it take effect retroactively. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> differentiates between the two instances, explaining that a sale requires an act of contract to effect a transfer, and that act took place when the sale was originally made, not 30 days afterwards. In contrast, with regard to a <i>get</i>, the fundamental aspect of the divorce is effected by the writing of the <i>get</i>.</i> [The governing principle is that the area at] the sides of the public domain is not the same as the public domain itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Had the <i>get</i> been placed by the woman in the public domain itself, it would not be effective even if it existed when the time specified by the husband arrived. Since it left the woman's domain entirely, the giving of the <i>get</i> originally performed by the husband is no longer considered significant. And, as stated at the beginning of these laws, one of the requirements of a divorce is that the <i>get</i> be given to the woman by her husband.</i>
Similarly, if the husband makes the divorce dependent on an action,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in this instance as well, there is a resemblance to the laws of a conditional divorce. Nevertheless, since different wording is used, the laws vary.</i> the same rules that govern a <i>get</i> that takes effect after a specific time apply. For example, [a husband] said to [his] wife: "This is your <i>get</i>, but the divorce does not take effect until you give me 200 <i>zuz</i>." After [the woman] gives [the money], the divorce takes effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Moreover, the action specified by the husband may be something that does not require anything to be done by his wife. For example, he may tell her that the divorce will take effect after the first rainfall (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 3:3).</i><br>In this instance [as well], there is no need to restate the condition [in both a positive and negative form], nor to comply with the other requirements of conditional agreements that we have explained. For this person has not divorced [his wife] conditionally - he has not yet divorced her at all. Instead, he made the divorce dependent on a specific action, and after [that action is completed], the divorce will take effect.
What is the difference between a conditional divorce and a divorce that will take effect only after a fixed time, or a divorce dependent on an action? With regard to a conditional divorce, the divorce is a fact; it is, however, not completed until the condition is fulfilled. Therefore, when the condition is fulfilled, the divorce takes effect as long as the <i>get</i> exists, even if it is not in the woman's possession. When the condition is fulfilled, there is no need for [the woman] to pick up [the <i>get</i>] or take possession, for it was given to her for the purpose of divorce. If she married before the condition was fulfilled, she need not leave [her second husband], as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 8, Halachah 1. See the notes on that halachah.</i><br>With regard to a divorce that will take effect only after a fixed time or a divorce dependent on an action, by contrast, she was not given the <i>get</i> for the [immediate] purpose of divorce. Instead, it is considered to be an entrusted object until the specified time arrives or she performs the action. Therefore, it is necessary that the <i>get</i> be in her possession at that time, that she take [possession of it], or that it be in a place that she designated for it even though it is not in her domain, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 3. If the <i>get</i> is not in the woman's possession at this time, the divorce is not effective according to the Rambam. Nevertheless, other authorities have a different conception of these laws, and according to them, the status of the divorce would be doubtful (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Beit Shmuel</i> 146:3).</i> Only then, is she divorced by virtue [of this <i>get</i>].<br>If she marries before the specified time arrives, or before she performs the action on which the divorce is dependent, she must leave her second husband,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For their relations are considered adulterous.</i> and any child [born of their union] is considered illegitimate. For she is a married woman, and the divorce is not [yet] effective.
When [a man] gives his wife a <i>get</i> and tells her: "If you do not give me 200 <i>zuz</i>, this <i>get</i> is not effective," or "...you are not divorced," he is not considered to have performed a divorce at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For he did not preface his statements by saying: "This is your <i>get</i>," or "You are divorced...." Hence, he is not considered to have given the <i>get</i> for the sake of divorce. Although such an intent could be deduced from his words, since his statements were not explicit, they are of no consequence. Indeed, making such a statement is less effective than not saying anything at all (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Kiryat Melech Rav</i>).</i> For the <i>get</i> was not given on a conditional basis, nor was it made dependent on an action. The same [ruling applies] in all similar situations.
When a person would like to give a conditional divorce, with the condition being that the divorce not take effect until a particular time, he should express the concept in a conditional statement, making the condition dependent on his departure or return at a specific time.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he desires that the <i>get</i> not take effect until a specific time, but does not want the restrictions mentioned in the previous halachah to apply. This is not merely a theoretical situation. Such <i>gittin</i> were given frequently in previous generations when a man undertook an overseas journey and wished to spare his wife from having to remain unmarried if he was killed, kidnapped by pirates or in other ways prevented from returning against his will.</i><br>What is implied? He tells her: "If I do not return between the present time and 30 days, this <i>get</i> is effective. If I do return within 30 days, this <i>get</i> is not effective." He [then] gives her the <i>get</i>. Alternatively, he should tell her: "This is your <i>get</i> on condition that I do not return to this country within 30 days." The same [ruling applies] in all similar situations.
When a person divorces [his wife] on the condition that he not return to this country within 30 days, and he set out to return within 30 days, but became ill or was prevented [from returning by a flooding] river and did not return until after 30 days, the <i>get</i> is effective. Even if he protests, "I am being held back by forces beyond my control" [the <i>get</i> is effective].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 30a cites an example of a man who divorced his wife on condition that he not return within 30 days. A river washed away the bridge leading to his city. Although he stood on the river banks and called to his townsmen: "See, I have returned," our Sages ruled that he is not considered to have returned, and they considered the divorce binding.</i><br>[The rationale is that the claim,] "I was prevented by forces beyond my control," is not accepted with regard to <i>gittin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to Scriptural law, a person who is prevented from fulfilling a condition by forces beyond his control is not considered as having failed to fulfill it. Nevertheless, our Sages ruled that the laws of divorce are an exception to this principle, because modest women might presume that their husbands were prevented from fulfilling their condition by forces beyond their control and never remarry (<i>Ketubot</i> 2b).<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quotes the opinion of <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 2b) and others, who state that this principle applies only with regard to events beyond mortal control that one could possibly foresee - e.g., illness or flood. It does not apply with regard to events beyond a person's control that are totally unlikely - e.g., earthquakes. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> cites statements by the Rambam in <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i>, Chapter 19, which indicate that he would also accept this restriction.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> premise is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 144:1). It appears that the determination of what is an event beyond a person's control that is totally unlikely is dependent on the sociological conditions of the age. For example, the Ramah rules that being held as a captive is not a totally unlikely occurrence.</i> even if the husband makes it evident that he does not desire that the divorce take effect.
[The following rules apply when a man gives a] divorce on the condition<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained, this law applies when the husband stated "on condition that..." when giving the <i>get</i>.</i> that it become effective if 30 days pass without [his seeing his wife's] face. If he repeatedly came [and appeared before her], but never entered into privacy with her, and then 30 days [passed without his seeing her], the <i>get</i> is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since ultimately the condition was fulfilled.</i> Although he came [and appeared before her] within 30 days [after the <i>get</i> was given], since he did not enter into privacy with her,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If he entered into privacy with her, the <i>get</i> would be nullified. See Chapter 3, Halachah 5, Chapter 8, Halachah 2.</i> [once the condition was fulfilled,] the <i>get</i> is effective.<br>When does the above apply? When he made the condition and said: "I accept her word with regard to [whether or] not I appeased her."<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In such an instance, if the woman were to say that she never agreed to her husband's spending more than 30 days away from her, the <i>get</i> would be effective after the condition is fulfilled.</i> If, however, he did not accept her word, we suspect that perhaps he placated her when he came and visited her, she was willing to forego [her desire to be with him], and he nullified the <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The husband gave his wife the <i>get</i> because he was going away on a journey and knew that she would not desire to be alone. If he was able to appease her and she was willing to remain alone for 30 days, he is able to nullify the <i>get</i>. Usually, once a <i>get</i> is given "on condition that...," it cannot be nullified once it has been given. Nevertheless, in this instance, since the condition was made for the sake of the woman, if she is willing to forego seeing her husband, the husband may nullify the <i>get</i> (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> For this reason, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable [even] after 30 days [pass without the husband seeing her].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to Scriptural law, since the condition was fulfilled, and there is no evidence that the couple resolved their differences, the <i>get</i> is binding. Our Sages, nevertheless, disqualified the <i>get</i> for the reasons stated above.</i><br>Similarly, when a man tells a woman: "This is your <i>get</i> and [it becomes effective] after twelve months pass," if he lives in the same city as she does, we suspect that he appeased her, unless he said: "I accept her word that I did not appease her."
A similar [principle applies with regard to] all conditions that are dependent on her will, and the <i>get</i> would be nullified if she was willing to forego these conditions in favor of her husband. We suspect that perhaps he appeased her,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, the divorce is unacceptable.</i> unless he said: "I accept her word...."<br>When does the above apply? When the woman is divorced after <i>nisu'in</i>, for he is familiar with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">And we assume that because of their familiarity, he knows how to appease her, and she is more willing to accept his overtures.</i> When, however, [a husband] divorces [his wife] after [merely] consecrating her, we do not suspect that he appeased her.
[When a man gives his wife a <i>get</i> and tells her:] "This is your <i>get</i> [and it is effective] from the present time onward if I do not return within twelve months," we do not suspect that perhaps he returned in secrecy, for people do not generally come in secrecy. [Therefore,] if the time period he specified passes without his coming, the divorce is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's decision is based on his interpretation of <i>Gittin</i> 76b. The Ra'avad interprets that passage more stringently and requires the husband to have accepted his wife's statements as to whether or not he came as binding. Otherwise, we suspect that he came in secrecy. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 144:7) follows the Rambam's view, but states that <i>a priori</i>, it is customary to include the condition mentioned by the Ra'avad.</i><br>If he dies within the twelve months, although the divorce [will become] effective, for there is no way that he can come, if she would have been obligated to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>, she should not marry until the twelve months pass and the condition is fulfilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If she desires to marry within the twelve months, she must undergo the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> first.</i>
When a healthy person [divorces his wife] on the condition that the <i>get</i> take effect if he dies, and when a sick person [divorces his wife] on the condition that the <i>get</i> take effect if he dies from the illness afflicting him,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 145:8) quotes the Rashba, who states that even if a sick person does not specify that he die from the illness afflicting him, we assume that this is his intent.</i> their statements are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the advantage of such a <i>get</i> would be to free his wife of the obligation of <i>yibbum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>. Similarly, the subsequent halachot refer to <i>gittin</i> given for this purpose.</i> The expression "if I die" implies [that it takes effect] after his death. [Alternatively,] the intent is that [it take effect] retroactively [if he dies]. [Because of the doubt involved,] if [a man] uses the expression "If I die...," it is considered as if he said "after my death." [The <i>get</i> is therefore void, because] there is no concept of divorce after a person's death.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling. He maintains that the date of the <i>get</i> indicates that the husband desires that the <i>get</i> take effect retroactively. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 145:1) quotes the Rambam's view, but mentions a minority opinion that takes the Ra'avad's view into consideration.</i>
If, [however, the husband] tells her: "This is your <i>get</i>. If I die, [it is effective retroactively] from the present time," or "...If I die, [it is effective retroactively] from the present day,"<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quote Rabbenu Tam as stating that it is preferable for the person to say: "from the present time," rather than "from the present day," lest he die before the conclusion of the day. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 145:2) quotes this suggestion.</i> the <i>get</i> is valid. When he dies, [his wife] is divorced.
[If a husband] says: "This is your <i>get</i>. If I die, [it is effective retroactively] from the present time - or from the present day - after my death," when [the husband] dies, the status of his wife's divorce is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, if childless, she must perform the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> before marrying, and may not perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>. As stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 18:25, such a woman is not entitled to receive support from her husband's estate after his death.</i> [We suspect that] perhaps, after saying "from the present time," he changed his mind and [did not desire that the <i>get</i> become effective] from the present time, and instead take effect after his death. And there is no concept of divorce after a person's death.
[If a husband] says: "This is your <i>get</i>. [It becomes effective] when the sun emerges from its shield," it is not effective if he dies that night.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>get</i> does not become effective until the morning. Since he died beforehand, a <i>get</i> cannot be effective after death.</i> [If he gave the <i>get</i>] on the condition that the sun shine and he dies that night, the <i>get</i> is effective, for when the sun shines [on the following day], the condition that he established becomes fulfilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For a <i>get</i> given "on the condition that" becomes effective retroactively from the time it was originally given, once the condition is fulfilled.</i><br>If [the husband gives a <i>get</i> and] establishes a condition: "If the sun shines, the <i>get</i> is effective. But if it does not shine, it is not effective," [the <i>get</i>] is not effective if he dies at night. For the condition was not fulfilled until after he died,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>get</i> given according to the rules of conditional agreements is not effective until the condition is fulfilled.</i> and there is no concept of divorce after a person's death.
When a person who is mortally ill has a <i>get</i> written for his wife and divorces her and then recovers, he cannot retract the divorce. A divorce [performed by a person in such a state] is not [governed by] the same laws as a present he gives.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 8:14, when a person who is mortally ill gives away all of his property as a present and then recovers, the present is automatically retracted, for we assume that his intent was solely to distribute his property after his death.</i> [The rationale for this distinction is] that if he were given the prerogative of retracting, the divorce would appear to take effect after death, in the same way that a present he gives is not legally transferred until after death.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the two laws are in direct contradiction. A present given by a dying man does not take effect until after he dies, and a divorce that he grants cannot take effect after he dies.</i>
[If a husband says:] "This is your <i>get</i>. [It is effective retroactively] from the present day if I die from this illness," and his house collapses upon him, he is bit by a snake, devoured by a lion or dies because of other similar causes, the divorce is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For the condition that he stated was not fulfilled (<i>Gittin</i> 73a).</i>
[If, by contrast,] he tells her: "...if I do not arise from this sickness," and his house collapses upon him, he is bit by a snake or devoured by a lion, the status of the divorce is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">On the one hand, he did not arise from his sickbed. On the other hand, there is reason to assume that his intent was that he is giving the <i>get</i> on the condition that he die from the illness afflicting him, and this was not the case (<i>Gittin</i> 73a).</i><br>[The following rules apply when a husband tells his wife:] "Here is your <i>get</i>. [It is effective retroactively] from the present day if I die from this illness," and then rises [from his sickbed], walks in the marketplace,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if he walks in the marketplace without any support. Since he did not regain his health entirely, it is necessary to determine whether or not he died from the first illness. Note the contrast to <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 8:26.</i> and afterwards falls ill and dies. We make an assessment. If he died from the first illness, the divorce is effective. If not, it is not effective. If he progresses from one illness to another illness,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 145:14, who states that, according to the Rambam, for the divorce to be effective the man must still be afflicted with the first illness when he dies. Note the contrast to <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 8:27.</i> and does not arise [and walk] in the marketplace, the divorce is effective. There is no need to make an assessment.
With regard to all the conditions [mentioned above], during the days between the giving of the <i>get</i> and his death [with its consequent] fulfillment of the condition, she is considered to be a divorced woman with regard to all matters,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he has none of the privileges of a husband - e.g., he is not entitled to her earnings, he may not nullify her vows, and if he is a priest, he may not become impure because of her in the event of her death. With regard to paying for the woman's support, most authorities maintain that the husband is liable. There is no explicit statement from the Rambam regarding this issue.</i> provided he does not enter into privacy with her, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In such an instance, we suspect that the couple may have engaged in marital relations, and that the husband nullified the <i>get</i> beforehand.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a sick person desires to divorce his wife conditionally, so that if he dies she will not be obligated to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>, but if he recovers, the divorce will not be effective; he does not desire that the <i>get</i> take effect [retroactively] from the time he gives it, lest the matter be overly disturbing for him.<br>He should write the following in the <i>get</i> after writing the essential portion; alternatively, he should make these statements when he gives [his wife] the <i>get</i>: "If I do not die, this <i>get</i> will not be effective. If I die, this <i>get</i> will be effective. If I do not die, this <i>get</i> will not be effective." In this manner, the conditional factor is repeated. The positive factor is stated before the negative factor,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the requirement is not that the positive factor be stated first, but that it be stated before the negative factor. This is accomplished by restating the condition that would negate the <i>get</i>.</i> and the person's opening remarks do not speak of misfortune.<br>[If a <i>get</i> is given with such a condition,] the divorce will take effect when [the husband] dies,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's ruling, noting that from his previous decisions, it appears that unless the man says that the <i>get</i> will take effect retroactively <i>me'achshav</i>, "from this time onward," the <i>get</i> is not effective, because it does not take effect until after the man's death. Apparently, the Rambam maintains that the restatement of the condition resolves that difficulty, but this concept is not accepted by many other authorities. When stating this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 145:5) quotes the Rambam's wording, but adds the word <i>me'achshav</i>.</i> provided that the <i>get</i> reaches the woman before his death.
When a husband tells a colleague:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the colleague was not appointed by the wife to serve as an agent to receive the <i>get</i>. The husband appointed him as her agent, because he felt that she would not desire to marry her <i>yavam</i>. According to Torah law, one may perform an action on a person's behalf without his knowledge if it is to his advantage - e.g., one may take possession of an ownerless object on behalf of a colleague without asking him. Hence, it is possible to assume that the agent can act on behalf of the woman without her knowledge (<i>Yevamot</i> 118b).</i> "Acquire this <i>get</i> on behalf of my wife, so that she will not be required to fulfill the rite of <i>yibbum</i>," and gives him the <i>get</i>, but the husband dies before the <i>get</i> reaches [the woman], the status of the divorce is in doubt. [Although there are times when a woman would be willing to marry the <i>yavam</i>,] it is to the advantage of most women not to be required to fulfill the rite of <i>yibbum</i>. Therefore, even though the <i>get</i> did not reach the woman, since another person acquired it on her behalf, the status of the divorce is in doubt.
When [a man] tells witnesses: "Write a <i>get</i> for my wife after twelve months," or "Write a <i>get</i> for my wife and give it to her after twelve months," they should write [the <i>get</i>] and give it to her after the time he specified. If they write it within the time he specified,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Because by writing it within this time, they deviated from the instructions with which they were charged (<i>Gittin</i> 76b).</i> it is void, even if they do not give it to the woman until afterwards.<br>If they write it after the time he specified, but [the husband] dies before they give it to her, it is void. If it is not known whether he died before the <i>get</i> was given, or the <i>get</i> was given before he died, the status of the divorce is in doubt.
[If a husband] instructs [agents]: "Write a <i>get</i> for my wife and give it to her after the Sabbatical cycle," they must write it within the first year after the conclusion of the Sabbatical cycle.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although the wording of the Hebrew original could possibly be interpreted otherwise, the commentaries agree that the Rambam's intent is that the <i>get</i> may be written immediately after the time specified and should not be written after a prolonged period has elapsed from that time.</i> If he told them: "...after a year," they must write it during the first month of the coming year.<br>If he told them: "...after a month," they must write it during the first week of the coming month. If he told them: "...after the Sabbath," they must write it before the end of Tuesday. If he told them: "...before the Sabbath," they must write it between Wednesday and the end of Friday.
If they delayed and did not write and give the <i>get</i> at the time he specified - e.g., he told them "after a month," and they wrote the <i>get</i> and gave it to her after two weeks had passed in the second month, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>get</i> is unacceptable because the husband's words also imply a restriction, that the <i>get</i> should be written directly afterwards and not after a prolonged period. Indeed, for this reason, Rabbenu Nissim [and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 144:6)] rule that in such a situation, the status of the divorce is in doubt. In defense of the Rambam's ruling, the commentaries explain that even though the husband's intent may have been that the <i>get</i> be given immediately, since the wording he used could be interpreted to mean after a prolonged period, the <i>get</i> is acceptable according to Scriptural law.</i>
If [the husband] entered into privacy with [his wife] after he told [agents] to write [a <i>get</i>], sign it and give it to her, they should not write it. One can make an [obvious] inference. If a <i>get</i> that he gave her is disqualified<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to his statements in Chapter 8, Halachah 2. There, however, he uses the expression, "the status of the <i>get</i> is in doubt."</i> when he enters into privacy with her, lest they have engaged in marital relations, how much more so should a <i>get</i> that was not yet written [be left unwritten]. If [the agents] wrote the <i>get</i> and gave it to her after he entered into privacy with her, the <i>get</i> is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question the Rambam's decision, explaining that although there is a possibility that the couple engaged in marital relations and the husband consecrated her at that time (see Chapter 10, Halachah 18), it is also possible that this did not take place. Indeed, in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, with reference to a <i>get</i> given by a husband after he entered into privacy with his wife, the Rambam rules that after the fact, the <i>get</i> is acceptable.<br>[It is possible to differentiate between the two instances, because in that halachah, the husband himself gave the woman the <i>get</i>. This is a greater indication that he did not nullify it (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). Even after that explanation, however, the Rambam's ruling in this halachah raises questions.]<br>When referring to this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 149:7) accepts the ruling that at the outset, the witnesses should not have such a <i>get</i> written, but follows the ruling of the Ramban and the Rashba, who maintain that if they had the <i>get</i> written and gave it to the woman, the status of the divorce is in doubt.</i>
[If a man] tells ten people: "Write a <i>get</i> for my wife," one of them should write it on behalf of all of them. [If he tells them:] "All of you, write it," one should write it in the presence of all of them.<br>[If he tells them:] "Bring this <i>get</i> to my wife," one of them should bring it to her on behalf of all of them. [If he tells them:] "All of you, bring this <i>get</i> to my wife," one should bring it [to her] in the presence of all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This is the ruling according to Scriptural law. See, however, Halachah 28.</i>
[If a man] tells ten people: "Write a <i>get</i>, sign it and give it to my wife," one of them should write it, two should sign it, and one should give it to her. It is acceptable even if one person writes it, he serves as one of the two witnesses who signs it, and he serves as the agent who gives it to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">There are many authorities who object to this ruling, maintaining that the scribe cannot sign as a witness to the <i>get</i>. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo states that even the Rambam agrees that at the outset, a scribe should not sign as a witness. After the fact, however, the Rambam maintains that his signature does not disqualify the <i>get</i>. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:18), Rav Yosef Karo writes: "One should be careful not to have the scribe sign as a witness, because there are authorities who disqualify this."</i><br>If [the husband] tells them: "All of you sign it," they must all sign it. If the husband counted the people - whether he counted all of them or merely some of them<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., speaking to the people, he said: "One, two, three, four, write a <i>get</i>..." (<i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 120:18).</i> - and told them to sign it, it is considered as if he told all of them to sign it. The two who sign it at the outset act as witnesses,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, it appears that not only must the signatures of the acceptable witnesses be first chronologically, but they must also appear first on the <i>get</i>. Other authorities do not make this requirement and maintain that it is only chronological precedence that is significant (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 120:14).</i> while the others [should sign it to complete] the stipulation [the husband] made.<br>Accordingly, if the remaining witnesses were unacceptable, or one signed it on the day the <i>get</i> was written and the others on subsequent days<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The two witnesses whose signatures are required must sign the <i>get</i> on the day that it was written (Chapter 1, Halachah 25).</i> - even several days after [the <i>get</i> was written],<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 120:9) states that they may sign the <i>get</i> to fulfill the condition even after it was given to the woman.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 120:10) mentions both views, but appears to favor that of the Rambam. The Ramah follows <i>Tosafot's</i> ruling.</i><br>If one of them died before signing it, the <i>get</i> is void.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Because the instructions that the husband gave concerning the <i>get</i> were not fulfilled.</i> If one of the first witnesses who signed it was unacceptable, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable, lest it be said that an unacceptable witness may sign other legal documents when many witnesses sign.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 5:6-7, which states that if persons who are unacceptable as witnesses signed a legal document with the intent of serving as witnesses, the document is disqualified, even if two acceptable witnesses signed it first. If, however, the persons who were unacceptable did not sign the document with the intent of serving as witnesses, the document is acceptable, even if the signature of the unacceptable person appears first.</i> The only reason [our Sages] accepted [such signatures] with regard to a <i>get</i> signed by many witnesses is that the witnesses who observe the transfer are of fundamental importance.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 15. With regard to other legal documents, the witnesses who sign the contract are of paramount importance, and they must all therefore be acceptable. The witnesses who observe its transfer are less significant. But with regard to <i>gittin</i>, it is the witnesses who observe the transfer who are of primary importance. Therefore, if the initial two signatures to the <i>get</i> are acceptable, we are not concerned with those who sign subsequently (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Kessef Mishneh, Hilchot Edut</i>).</i>
Our Sages established the [following] rules with regard to a person who tells many people to write, sign, or bring a <i>get</i> for his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">These rules were instituted lest the the husband tell a group of people that they all should write, sign or bring a <i>get</i>, and they not appreciate that they were all charged with this responsibility. Lest some of them fail to discharge this responsibility and thus cause the <i>get</i> to be void, our Sages required that whenever many people are instructed to be involved in a <i>get</i>, they all must take full participatory roles.</i> With regard to writing, he should tell them: "Any one of you may write a <i>get</i> for my wife." Similarly, with regard to bringing [the <i>get</i>], [he should say]: "Any one of you may bring...." With regard to signing, he should tell them: "Any pair of you should sign this <i>get</i> and give it to my wife."
Why did our Sages state that the witnesses to a <i>get</i> should sign only in each other's presence?<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 24, based on <i>Gittin</i> 10b. If the witnesses do not sign in each other's presence, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:13).</i> [This is] a decree, [instituted] lest a person tell many others: "All of you sign [as witnesses]." If it were possible for witnesses to sign outside the presence of the other witnesses, two witnesses might sign the <i>get</i>, and the woman might take it and think that it does not require any more witnesses, [when in fact] the condition that [the husband made] was not fulfilled.
If [a man] tells three people, including a father and a son, "Two of you should write a <i>get</i> for my wife, sign it and give it to her," the <i>get</i> is acceptable whether the son signs with the other person or the father signs with the other person.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The father and the son may not both sign as witnesses, because witnesses may not be related to each other.</i> [The son may serve in this capacity] because a person may appoint a son as an agent instead of his father.
When [a man] tells two [colleagues]: "Write [a <i>get</i>], sign it and give it to so and so to bring to my wife," or "...give it to [my] agent to bring to her," one of them should write it, and they should both sign it and give it to the agent. If they bring it to the woman themselves, the divorce is not effective, for they were not appointed as agents to effect the divorce.<br>What should they do [if in error they gave it to the woman]? They should take it back from her and give it to the agent, who should in turn give it back to the woman in their presence or in the presence of other [witnesses].<br>My teachers issued a ruling with regard to such a <i>get</i> that does not appear to be appropriate, because of a flaw that existed in the versions [of the Talmud] that they possessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's interpretation of <i>Gittin</i> 63b. Significantly, the standard published texts of the Talmud available to us follow Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's version. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:36) follows Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's conception and rules that the status of the divorce is in doubt. (See the notes of the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 141:99, which explain the Rambam's interpretation.)</i>
[Our Sages ruled that] the status of a divorce is in doubt [in the following situation: A husband] tells a scribe: "Write me a <i>get</i> for my wife." [The scribe] wrote it and gave it to the husband, without this being observed by witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">And thus the <i>get</i> is not signed by witnesses.</i> The husband took it, gave it to an agent,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam (Chapter 6, Halachah 4), the appointment of such an agent need not be observed by witnesses.</i> and told him: "Give this <i>get</i> to my wife in the presence of witnesses." The agent [carried out the instructions] and gave it to [the woman] in the presence of witnesses.<br>[The rationale is] that since he is only a single witness, an agent's statements would not be accepted [as grounds] to permit a woman who was [previously] forbidden to marry, except for the fact [that his statements are supported by] the written statements of the witnesses who signed the <i>get</i>. [For the witnesses' statements] are considered as if they were testimony given in court until [the husband] lodges a protest, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 24. Note the question of the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 141:17, who asks why the Rambam distinguishes between this instance and an agent charged with consecrating a woman, whose word is accepted, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:15. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> explains that the fact that the <i>get</i> is not signed detracts from the agent's credibility. For although a <i>get</i> is acceptable when it has not been signed, this is not desirable. Hence, we are more suspicious of the possibility of forgery.</i> If there are two witnesses who observed the husband giving the <i>get</i> to the agent and instructing him to use it for the divorce, the divorce is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">As long as there are witnesses who observe the transfer of the <i>get</i>, the agent's actions are considered to be equivalent to those of the husband himself. Hence, just as a <i>get</i> given by the husband is acceptable after the fact if its transfer was observed by witnesses, even if the <i>get</i> was not signed, this same ruling applies when his agent gives the <i>get</i>.</i>
[When a husband] tells an agent: "Give this <i>get</i> to my wife in this and this place," the divorce is not effective if he gives it to her in another place.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">For the wording the husband used implies that he is stipulating that the <i>get</i> must be given in that place.</i> "...She is in this and this place," and the agent gave it to her in another place, [the <i>get</i>] is binding; he is merely pointing out the place.<br>Similarly, if he tells [the agent]: "Do not give it to her [anywhere] except in the house," and he gives it to her in the loft; "Do not give it to her except with your right hand," and he gives it to her with his left; "Give it to her on this and this day," and he gives it to her before that date; <sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">From the contrast with the following clause, the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 141:63 and others rule that, in this instance, the <i>get</i> is binding if it is given after that date. Note, however, the <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> who differs and rules that the divorce is disqualified by the Sages.</i> the divorce is not effective. "Do not give it to her except on this and this day," the divorce is not effective if he gives it to the woman before or afterwards, for he indicated that he wanted the <i>get</i> to be given on that date. Similar rulings apply in all analogous situations.
Similarly, when a woman tells her agent: "Receive my <i>get</i> for me in this and this place," and he receives it for her in another place, the divorce is not effective. [When she tells him:] "Bring me my <i>get</i> in this and this place," the <i>get</i> is acceptable if he brings it to her in another place.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">By accepting the <i>get</i> from the agent in the place she receives it, the woman shows that she is not particular about where she receives it (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i> in his gloss on Chapter 6, Halachah 4). The Rambam's ruling indicates a slight textual difference from the popular version of <i>Gittin</i> 6:3, the source for this halachah. There is, however, no difference in principle between them.</i>
When [a man] tells an agent: "Bring this <i>get</i> to my wife," the agent may send the <i>get</i> with another person if he becomes ill or is otherwise prevented [from bringing it to her] by forces beyond his control.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the agent is not prevented from discharging his agency, he should not charge another person with that responsibility. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 4 and notes.)</i> [This applies] regardless of whether he told him: "Bring it [to her]," or "You bring it [to her]."<br>If, however, [the husband] told [the agent]: "Take the following article from her and give her this <i>get</i>," the agent should not send the <i>get</i> via another individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">For it is likely that the principal would not desire that anyone other than the person he designated be given his article to guard. Rashi (<i>Gittin</i> 29a) offers a different interpretation. (See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 141:65.)</i> If [the agent] did send [the <i>get</i>] via another individual, and the woman came out to greet the agent and she gave him the article, and afterwards he gave her the <i>get</i>, the divorce is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Since the second agent did not deviate from the husband's instructions, the <i>get</i> is acceptable, despite the fact that a person other than the one appointed by the husband gave the <i>get</i> to the woman.<br>Rabbenu Asher rules that even if the second agent takes the article before giving the woman the <i>get</i>, the divorce is not effective. Although Rabbenu Asher's ruling is also mentioned, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:51) appears to follow the Rambam's decision.</i>
If the agent - i.e., [either] the first [or the second] agent - gave the woman the <i>get</i> first and then she gave him the article, the divorce is not effective. [The rationale is] that [the agent] violated the husband's instructions with regard to a matter which, in general, would cause people to object.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the husband was in effect saying, "Make sure you get the article before you give her the <i>get</i>." Since the agent did not fulfill these instructions, the divorce is not valid. See the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 141:66, who quotes opinions that state that if the husband's wording does not indicate that he definitely wants the agent to secure possession of the article before giving the <i>get</i>, the divorce is binding.</i> For the husband told him: "Take the article first and then give her the <i>get</i>," and he gave [the <i>get</i>] first and then took [the article].
[If the husband] told the agent: "Give her the <i>get</i> and take this and this article from her," [the agent] should not send the <i>get</i> via another person, for [the principal] would not desire that his article be entrusted to a person [other than the one he appointed].<br>If, however, the agent sent it with another person, the divorce is binding. [This applies] regardless of whether she gave the article before [receiving the <i>get</i>] or afterwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance, there is no obvious advantage to the principal in having the agent give the <i>get</i> first.<br>As mentioned in the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, the Ramban differs and maintains that for the divorce to be binding the woman must give the agent the article first.</i>
[If the husband] gives an agent a <i>get</i> and tells him: "No one other than you should give it to her," the divorce is not effective, if the agent gives [the <i>get</i>] to another person who gives it to the woman.<br>Similarly, [if the husband] told the agent: "Do not give it to her yourself. Give it to so and so, and he will give it to her," the divorce is not effective if the first agent gives it to the woman. For he was not appointed as an agent to effect the divorce.
[A husband] gave [an agent] a <i>get</i> and told him: "Bring this <i>get</i> to my wife."<br>The agent told him: "I do not know who she is."<br>The husband replied: "Give it to so and so. He knows who she is."<br>The [first] agent has not been appointed as an agent to effect the divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, if the first agent gives the woman the <i>get</i>, the divorce is not effective. As mentioned in the notes on Halachah 31, other opinions differ and maintain that in this instance, the status of the divorce is in doubt.</i> All he can do is give the <i>get</i> to the person whom the husband designated. That person is the agent appointed to effect the divorce. He must bring [the <i>get</i> to the woman] or send it via another agent if he becomes ill or is prevented from doing so by forces beyond his control.
When [a husband] gives an agent a <i>get</i> and tells him: "Do not give this <i>get</i> to my wife until after 30 days," [the agent] may send it to her via a second agent [whom he appoints] within the 30 days, if he becomes ill or is prevented from giving it to her by forces beyond his control.<br>[The rationale is that] even though at the time [he appoints the second agent] he is not charged with effecting the divorce, since he will function in that capacity after 30 days pass, he has the authority to appoint a second agent within the 30 days.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, the second agent should not give the woman the <i>get</i> until the original 30 days have passed.<br>Rav Meir HaLevi states that we suspect that the first agent will not convey these instructions clearly to the second agent. Therefore, the first agent should entrust the <i>get</i> to the court, which will appoint a second agent after the 30 days have passed. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:37) mentions this view, it appears that the Rambam's view is favored.</i>
When does the above apply? When the husband was not in the same city as his wife, or he was divorcing her after consecration,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 10 and 11.</i>[but before the marriage bond has been consummated].<br>If, however, the marriage bond has been consummated, we suspect that perhaps the husband appeased her. Therefore, the agent should not appoint another agent within the 30 days unless the husband said: "I accept the word of my wife if she says that I did not appease her." After 30 days pass, [the agent] should give her the <i>get</i>. However, we suspect [that perhaps it was nullified], as explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 9.</i> unless [the husband] said, "I accept the word of my wife if she says that I did not appease her."

Chapter 10

Whenever in this text<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In the Talmud, by contrast, the terms <i>bateil</i> and <i>pasul</i> do not have these specific meanings. There are times when <i>pasul</i> is used to connote a <i>get</i> that is unacceptable according to Scriptural law, and <i>bateil</i> to refer to a <i>get</i> that is unacceptable according to Rabbinic law (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). (See also the responsum of the Rambam quoted by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> in his gloss on Chapter 8, Halachah 4.)</i> we have used the terms "the <i>get</i> is void," or "the divorce is not effective," the intent is that the <i>get</i> is void according to Scriptural law. The woman is married in the full sense of the term. If she remarries, she must leave [her second husband]; any child she bears him is illegitimate.<br>If the husband [of a woman who receives such a <i>get</i>] is a priest, she is not forbidden to him as a divorced woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the priest should be forbidden to remain married to a woman he divorced with such a <i>get</i>, lest the impression be created that the prohibition against a priest's marrying a divorcee can be waived. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 150:3), however, accepts the Rambam's ruling.</i> with one exception: a person who divorces his wife and tells her: "You are divorced from me, but you are not permitted to marry anyone else."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 5.</i> Although such a divorce is not binding, according to Rabbinic law<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam considers the proof-text that he quotes as an <i>asmachta</i> - i.e., a support from the Torah invented by the Rabbis to uphold their decree. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> himself differs, noting that <i>Gittin</i> 82a appears to indicate that the prohibition is of Scriptural origin.<br><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> explains that the Rambam's conception can be resolved based on his statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 2), that any law that is not explicitly stated in the Torah, but rather derived through the Thirteen Principles of Biblical exegesis, is considered to be Rabbinic in origin (<i>midivrei soferim</i>). This classification does not, however, in any way diminish the status of this practice, and it is as though it were explicitly stated in the Torah. (See the commentaries on <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:2.) Similarly, in this instance the prohibition is not explicit in the Torah, but rather derived through exegesis. Thus, it has the status of Scriptural law, but is considered to be Rabbinic in origin.<br>It must be emphasized that just as the woman is prohibited from remarrying a priest if divorced, she is also prohibited from remaining married to her husband, if he is a priest [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 150:3)].</i> such a woman is forbidden to marry a priest, as [implied by Leviticus 21:7]: "[They may not take] a woman divorced from her husband." Our Sages interpreted this to mean: "Even if she is divorced only from her husband and not permitted to marry any one else, she is forbidden to the priesthood. This is the "wisp of a <i>get</i>" that disqualifies [a woman] from [marrying a member of] the priesthood by Rabbinic decree.
Whenever, in this text, we have used the term "the <i>get</i> is unacceptable," the intent is that the <i>get</i> is unacceptable merely according to Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to Scriptural law, the divorce is binding. Our Sages, however, disqualified the divorce and forbade the woman from remarrying until a <i>get</i> is given that presents no halachic difficulties.</i> Thus, according to Scriptural law, the woman is forbidden to the priesthood.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, if her first husband is a priest, he may no longer become impure while caring for her burial (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 2:13).</i><br><i>A priori</i>, she should not remarry. If, however, she has remarried, she need not leave [her second husband].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since her divorce is effective according to Scriptural law, our Sages did not abrogate her second marriage.</i> Children born [from her second marriage] are legitimate. A second <i>get</i> that is acceptable should be given to her, while she remains married to her [second] husband.<br>Should it be impossible to have a second [<i>get</i>] composed, if her second husband is scrupulous and voluntarily divorces her this is praiseworthy, provided she has not borne [him] children. If, however, she has borne him children, he should not divorce her because of [our Sages'] disqualification of her <i>get</i>, lest this cause his sons' reputation to be sullied.
Whenever, in this text, we have used the term "the status of the divorce is in doubt," the woman should not remarry. If she has remarried, she must leave her second husband, and there is a doubt regarding the legimitacy of any children that she bears [her second husband], for her own status is in doubt, and she may be forbidden to engage in marital relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in these instances, our Sages were unsure whether or not the <i>get</i> is valid according to Scriptural law.

Our Sages ordained that whenever [a woman] who was given a <i>get</i> that is void remarries, she must be divorced by her second husband, lest people say: "A married woman has been allowed to remarry without [receiving] a <i>get</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Although her second marriage is void, and thus, according to Scriptural law there is no need for a <i>get</i>, our Sages established such a requirement because of the impression that might be created.</i> And she must receive a [second] <i>get</i> from her first husband, so that she be permitted to marry anyone else.<br>She is forbidden to remarry both her first and second husband forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When a woman commits adultery, she is forbidden to engage in marital relations both with her husband and with the adulterer (even after being divorced from her husband).

If one of the two transgressed and remarried her, he should be compelled to send her away.
A similar law applies when a woman remarries [after] witnesses testified that her [first] husband died, and later her first husband returns.

Nevertheless, our Sages ordained that if a deaf-mute man or woman enters into a marriage relationship, that relationship is binding according to Rabbinic law, regardless of whether the mate is also a deaf-mute or is fully mentally competent.<br>Since a deaf-mute's marriage is not effective according to Torah law, there is room to suppose that the woman should be allowed to remarry her first husband, for the difference between a deaf-mute's marriage and an ordinary marriage is obvious. And conversely, one might assume that since a deaf-mute is not held responsible for his actions, if a woman's second husband were a deaf-mute, they would be allowed to remain married. For these reasons, it is necessary to state that the stringencies apply in these instances as well.</i> She must be divorced by both of them; both must give her a <i>get</i>, and she is forbidden to engage in marital relations with either of them again.
If [after witnesses testified that a woman's husband died or that she was given a <i>get</i>], she was consecrated [but the marriage bond was not yet consummated],<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since the woman did not enter into forbidden marital relations, there is no reason to penalize her (<i>Yevamot</i> 89a).</i> and then her first husband returned, or it was discovered that the <i>get</i> was void, she is permitted to her first husband. Nor must she be divorced by the second husband, for a marriage bond cannot be established with a woman who is forbidden because of a severe prohibition.<br>[In this instance, we do not require a divorce out of fear that] someone say: "A married woman is being released without a <i>get</i>." Since the marriage was not consummated, the person will rationalize: "The consecration was made on condition, and that condition was not fulfilled."
[The following laws apply when] a woman married, and afterwards it was discovered that her <i>get</i> was void, or [it had been reported that her first husband died,] and he returned. Neither her first nor her second husband is entitled to an ownerless object that she discovers<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The second husband is not entitled to the article, because he is not truly her husband. The first husband is not entitled to it because our Sages granted a husband rights to ownerless articles his wife discovers to prevent friction from arising in the home, and in this instance, since he is required to divorce her, there is no need to prevent friction (<i>Yevamot</i> 90b).</i> nor to the profits from her work.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A husband is granted the profits from his wife's work in return for providing for her sustenance. Since neither of the husbands is required to provide for her, neither is entitled to this benefit (<i>Ibid.</i>).</i> Neither can he annul her vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah granted a husband the right to annul his wife's vows so that she will remain attractive to him. In this instance, the husband should not be attracted to the wife (<i>Ibid.</i>).</i> None of the benefits that either of them received after she married [her second husband] should be expropriated from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages explained that the woman should have been entitled to be recompensed for these benefits. Nevertheless, they were withheld from her as a penalty for her actions. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:56) does rule that the benefits that her second husband received after her first husband returned (or after the <i>get</i> was discovered void) should be returned to her.</i> Neither of them is obligated to pay her the money due her by virtue of her marriage contract,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages instituted the requirement of a marriage contract so that a husband would be deterred by the financial burden he would have to bear, and would not consider divorce a light matter.

Similar laws apply when one of two brothers consecrated a woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected in the following halachot, based on <i>Yevamot</i> 94b, it appears that only when the woman has been merely consecrated is a <i>get</i> required from the second husband. For it is possible for an onlooker to think that perhaps the first <i>kiddushin</i> were given conditionally, and the marriage to the second brother is binding. Lest a misconception arise and one think that a married woman can be released without a <i>get</i>, the second husband is required to give a <i>get</i>.<br>If she was married to - not merely consecrated by - her first husband, a <i>get</i> is not required from the second husband, because when his brother returns, everyone will realize that his marriage to his brother's wife is not binding. Rabbenu Asher makes a further distinction and states that when the woman was married to - not merely consecrated by - the first brother, she and her first husband may continue living together as man and wife, despite the fact that she erred and performed the rite of <i>yibbum</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 159:4) follows the Rambam's ruling, while the Ramah follows that of Rabbenu Asher.</i> The brother who consecrated the woman departed, and afterwards it was reported that he died. The other brother performed the rite of <i>yibbum</i>, marrying his brother's wife, and then the brother returned.<br>The woman must be divorced by both husbands, receiving a <i>get</i> from both of them, and all the stringencies mentioned above apply to her. Similarly, if a man consecrated a woman, she journeyed to another country, the husband heard that she died and married her sister,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to marry two sisters in each other's lifetime. Once a man's wife dies, however, he may marry her sister. (See also <i>Hilchot Yibbum</i> 3:11.)</i> and afterwards it was discovered that she had not died: he must divorce both women, and all the stringencies mentioned above apply to both of them.
[Different rules apply, however, if a man] married a woman who journeyed to another country, he heard that she died, he married her sister, and then it was discovered that his [first] wife was alive. The sister does not require a <i>get</i>, and his [first] wife is permitted to him.<br>Similar laws apply with regard to other women forbidden by severe prohibitions<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The intent is the Hebrew term <i>arayot</i>, a word with a specific meaning. As explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:5, this refers to a woman with whom sexual relations are forbidden and punishable by <i>karet</i>.</i> who were married under the assumption that the marriage was permitted,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., one was unaware of the family connection.</i> and it is discovered that the prohibition still applied. They do not require a divorce, for a marriage bond cannot be established with a woman forbidden by such a severe prohibition.
Why did they require that the sister of the woman whom the man consecrated be given a <i>get</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For, as mentioned, a marriage bond cannot be established with one of the <i>arayot</i>.<br>If the man married the first sister, then there is no possibility of such a misconception arising. A man will never marry a woman conditionally, for if the condition is not fulfilled, their marital relations are considered to be sinful. We assume that a person will not take that risk (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 15:27). (Note, however, <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 2:10 and the gloss of the Ra'avad.)</i> Lest people say that the [first] <i>kiddushin</i> were given conditionally, [the condition was not fulfilled,] and thus the law would allow marriage to her sister. Since the [first] woman's sister was divorced with a <i>get</i>, she - i.e., the man's first <i>arusah</i> - is forbidden [to him], lest people think that he married his divorcee's sister.
A scribe composed [a <i>get</i>], but erred and gave the <i>get</i> to the husband and the receipt [for the woman's marriage contract] to the woman, or the man and wife erred, and the husband took the <i>get</i> and the wife the receipt, and thus they thought they were divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The wording used by the Rambam here is somewhat confusing. For the scribe should give the <i>get</i> to the husband, who should give it to his wife. The intent appears to be, as in the source for this halachah, <i>Gittin</i> 80a, that the scribe gave the man the receipt and the woman the <i>get</i>, and they exchanged them. Thus, the woman was never given the <i>get</i> by her husband.</i><br>[The following rules apply] if afterwards the <i>get</i> is discovered in the possession of the man. If the woman has not remarried, she is considered as if she has not been divorced; it [appears to] have been revealed that the divorce did not ever take place. The husband should give her the <i>get</i> in the presence [of witnesses], and the divorce takes effect from the time the <i>get</i> is given.<br>If, however, she had [already] remarried, and afterwards the husband produces the <i>get</i>, claiming that she has not been divorced, for he is in possession of the <i>get</i> and it never reached her, we do not accept his claim. She is not forbidden to her [second] husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, we do not even require that, as a safeguard, the first husband give her the <i>get</i> while she is married to her second husband (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 151:2).<br>The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> also states that this law applies even if the woman was merely consecrated by the second husband, but their marriage had not been consummated.</i> Instead, we operate under the presumption that she has been divorced, the <i>get</i> fell from her hand and was found by [her first husband], who desires to cause her to be forbidden to her second husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 8:7), the Rambam explains that the husband is acting out of spite, seeking to prevent his divorcee from remarrying. Rashi (<i>Gittin</i> 80a) offers a different rationale.</i>
When a person divorces his wife because of unsavory reports,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:16.</i> or because she is indiscriminate with regard to vows, he is told: "Inform her that you are divorcing her to chastise her, and know that you will never be able to remarry her."<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Gittin</i> 45b, 46b. Other halachic authorities view this situation slightly differently. The various views are listed in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 10:3).</i><br>Why is [a man forbidden] to remarry such a woman? This is a decree, [instituted] lest she marry another man, repent and live chastely with him. Her first [husband] may then say: "If I had known that this would be the case, I would not have divorced her." Thus, it resembles a divorce given on a condition that was not fulfilled,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is as if he gave her the <i>get</i> on the condition that she remain unchaste, and, because of her repentance, that condition was not fulfilled. Most authorities maintain that since this condition was not actually stated, such a complaint would not be heeded by the court. Nevertheless, since the matter might become a subject for gossip, her first husband is bound by these restrictions (<i>Tosafot, Gittin</i> 46a). From one of the Rambam's responsa, however, it appears that he maintains that the <i>get</i> would actually be void in such an instance.</i> in which case, retroactively, the <i>get</i> would be void. Therefore, we tell him: "Make a firm resolve to divorce her, knowing that you will never remarry her."<br>If, however, he transgresses and remarries her before she is consecrated to another man,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, she was consecrated by another man, even if she was divorced before their marriage was consummated, she may not remarry her first husband and must be divorced by him if they do remarry, as stated in Chapter 11, Halachah 12.</i> he need not divorce her.
Similarly, if [a man] divorces his wife because she is an <i>aylonit</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">A woman who suffers from physical disorders and lacks female physical characteristics. She is unable to bear children. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:6, 15:7, 24:1.)</i> or because she always experiences menstrual bleeding in the midst of sexual relations,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 25:8-9.</i> he should never remarry her.<br>[This is a decree, instituted] lest she marry another man and have children if she was an <i>aylonit</i>, or her condition be healed if she suffered from menstrual bleeding. [Her first husband] may then say: "If I had known that this would be the case, I would not have divorced her." Thus, [it would appear] that her <i>get</i> is void and her children illegitimate. If, however, he transgresses and remarries her [before she is consecrated to another man], he need not divorce her.
When an agent brings a <i>get</i> from the diaspora and says, "It was written and signed in my presence" [to validate the signatures to the <i>get</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 5. If, however, a person brings a <i>get</i> from one place in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to another, the permission granted to the woman to remarry does not depend on his statements. Therefore, he is permitted to marry her (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 12:1).</i> he should not marry her. We fear that perhaps he was attracted to her and therefore testified on her behalf.<br>[For this same reason,] when one witness testifies that a woman's husband died,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12, Halachah 15.</i> and she [is given license to] marry on the basis of his testimony, he should not marry her. Similarly, a sage who ruled that a woman is forbidden to her husband because of a vow<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a woman took a vow that caused her to be forbidden to derive benefit from her husband, in which case he is required to divorce her. She asked a sage to annul the vow, but he could not find a halachic basis to do so (<i>Yevamot</i> 25b).</i> should not marry her.<br>Similarly, when a man is reputed to have had relations with a maid-servant, and afterwards she was granted her freedom, or when [a man is reputed to have had relations] with a gentile woman, and afterwards she converted, he should not marry her.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For this would substantiate the initial rumor and make the couple a subject of gossip (<i>Yevamot</i> 24b). On this basis, there are authorities who rule that if the rumor is substantiated - e.g., a couple are openly living together, or were married in a secular court - the woman should be encouraged to convert, and they should be married according to Jewish law.<br>Indeed, we find a responsum of the Rambam himself regarding a man who had an attractive female servant, and it was rumored that they had spent time together in private. The Rambam advises that the man be compelled to free the servant and either marry her or send her away. He acknowledges that doing so would violate the Rabbinic decree mentioned in this halachah, but states that because of the permissive state of morals prevalent in his society, there is no alternative.</i> Similarly, if a gentile or a servant had relations with a Jewish woman, and afterwards the gentile converted or the servant was freed, he should not marry this woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Yevamot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it would appear that the reason for this restriction is that people should not say that the man converted in order to marry. This is undesirable. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:14.) With regard to this prohibition as well, it has become customary in the present time to show leniency.</i> In all these instances, if a couple transgress and marry,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">There are opinions that state that if the woman has merely been consecrated, but the marriage bond has not been consummated, the couple should be forced to separate. (See <i>Maggid Mishneh; Beit Shmuel</i> 12:2). There are other opinions, however, that maintain that the consecration is equivalent to the consummation of the marriage. Rav David Arameah cites <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:31 as an indication that the Rambam follows the latter view.</i> they should not be forced to separate<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quotes the Rashba as maintaining that a witness who brought a <i>get</i> and said "It was written and signed in my presence," should be forced to divorce the woman if he marries her. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 12:1) quotes the Rambam's ruling. See <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 12:1.</i>.
In all the above instances, if these men had wives and their wives died, or they divorced their wives at their wives' initiative,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 12:4) writes that if the man's wife was sick at the time that the woman became eligible for marriage, the prohibition remains in effect.

All these women are permitted to marry [any relatives of the men involved]. [A woman may marry] the son of the witness who testified on her behalf, the son of the sage who declared that she was forbidden to her husband, the son of the man with whom she was reputed to have had relations, or any other relative of theirs. [The rationale for this leniency is that] a person will not commit a sin so that another person will benefit.<br>A woman is permitted to marry one of [the two witnesses] to her divorce or to her <i>mi'un</i>, or to marry one of the judges in whose presence she performed the rite of <i>chalitzah</i>. Our suspicions are aroused only when [the woman's license to marry depends on] the testimony of one witness.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">It is unlikely that two individuals will sin so that one may benefit (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Yevamot</i> 2:12). The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>, nevertheless, state that "a master of his soul" should avoid such a marriage.</i><br>A person should always shy away from serving as a witness to <i>mi'un</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Lest the woman later regret her decision (<i>Yevamot</i> 109b).</i> and make himself available [as a witness to enable] the rite of <i>chalitzah</i> [to be performed].
When a man divorces his wife and then engages in relations with her in the the presence of witnesses before she marries another man,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">If the woman has remarried and divorced, however, the presumption stated does not apply, for it is forbidden for her first husband to remarry her (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 149:2).</i> we assume that since she was [originally] his wife, he remarried her and engaged in relations with the intent of consecrating her, and not as a licentious act.<br>[The above rule applies] regardless of whether they were divorced after marriage, or only after consecration. And this applies even if we saw that he paid her money.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Although this would make it appear more likely that the man was relating to her as a prostitute and not as a wife, it is not sufficient cause for us to negate our presumption (<i>Gittin</i> 73b).</i> For it is an accepted presumption that a person will not enter into sexual relations with his wife with a licentious intent, when he has the possibility of having these relations considered to be a mitzvah.<br>For this reason, this woman is definitely considered to be consecrated,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 149:3 interprets this to mean that if another person consecrates her afterwards, we consider it as if he had consecrated a married woman, and he is not required to divorce her.</i> and requires a second divorce [in order to marry another man].
[There is an extension to the above principle.] If a man entered into privacy with his divorcee in the presence of witnesses, the two witnesses observed [their conduct] simultaneously,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">It is not sufficient for one to have observed them in private at one time, and the other at a different time, for the two witnesses who observe the consecration of a woman must be together at that time.</i> and [the couple] had been married previously, we suspect that they engaged in sexual relations.<br>The witnesses to their entrance into privacy are thus considered to be witnesses to sexual relations. For a person who consecrates his wife via sexual relations need not engage in relations in the presence of witnesses. [All that] is necessary that [the couple] enter into privacy in the presence of witnesses and engage in relations in privacy, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:5; see also <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 14:16, which states that it is forbidden to engage in sexual relations in the presence of others.</i><br>Since [it is possible that the couple engaged in relations], the status of the woman is in doubt, because we suspect that she has been consecrated. Because of this suspicion, she requires a [second] <i>get</i>. If, however, the woman had merely been consecrated and was divorced [before she was married], we do not suspect [that they engaged in sexual relations], because they did not share such familiarity.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The previous halachah dealt with an instance in which relations were observed; hence, no distinction was made whether the couple was divorced before or after their first marriage was consummated. In this instance, they merely entered into privacy together. If, however, we know for a fact that a couple shared familiarity before the marriage bond was completed, a second <i>get</i> is required (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 149:2).</i>
Several of the <i>geonim</i> have ruled that any woman with whom a man engaged in sexual relations in the presence of witnesses requires a <i>get</i>, [the rationale for their ruling being that] a person will not carry out sexual relations with a licentious intent.<br>[Moreover,] they extended [the application of] this principle, until they decided to rule that when a man's maidservant bore him a son, we take the matter into account, and the man's wife is not [allowed to perform] the rite of <i>yibbum</i> [if he dies without children],<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">A son borne by a maidservant is not considered to have any connection to his father.

If they are prepared to violate the prohibition of <i>niddah</i>, we assume that they will have no hesitation to conduct relations outside marriage. [Some modern authorities consider taking this concept even further. Although a man and a woman claim that their intent is "marriage," if they violate the laws of <i>niddah</i>, their conception of marriage is not <i>kedat Moshe viYisrael</i>, "according to the faith of Moses and Israel," and Torah law does not require a divorce. See the responsum of the Rivash cited below.]</i><br>With regard to other women, however, [we do not follow this assumption]. Instead, whenever [a man enters into relations with] a wanton woman, we assume that he had a licentious intent,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam on this matter and maintains that if a man is in general known to be moral and observant, we assume that he will not enter into sexual relations with a licentious intent.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 149:5) follows the Rambam's view.<br>In the law that follows, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> explains that if a Jewish man and woman marry according to gentile law, we do not consider them to be man and wife according to Torah law. This ruling is based on a ruling of the Rivash (Responsum 6), which explains that a Jewish marriage must be "according to the faith of Moses and Israel," and a couple who marry according to gentile law, regardless of their desire to live together, are not establishing their union on this foundation.</i> unless he explicitly states that he intends to consecrate her. Needless to say, this applies with regard to a maidservant<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 4:6.</i> or to a gentile woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, the Ra'avad accepts the Rambam's ruling, for it is impossible for a man to compel a woman to convert.</i> for our marriage laws do not apply with regard to them at all, and we have no suspicions [with regard to marriage] at all. A son born by them is assumed to be a gentile or a servant until it is definitively substantiated that his mother was freed or converted.
When it has been assumed that a woman is either married or consecrated, and a rumor is spread in [her] city that she has been divorced, [the rumor] is not given credence, and we continue to operate under the assumption [that there was no change in her status].<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, if her husband was a priest (who may not marry a divorced woman), he may remain married to her.

(See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 17:20.)</i> [This applies] even if the majority, or even the entire city spread this rumor.<br>[Different rules apply, however, in the following instance.] A rumor was spread through the city that a woman was consecrated, and that rumor was reported in court, in which case we suspect that the woman was consecrated, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 9:22.</i> Afterwards, a rumor was spread that she was divorced from those <i>kiddushin</i>; we consider her to be divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and interprets <i>Gittin</i> 88b, the source for this halachah, as referring to an instance where there is one rumor that says that the woman was consecrated and then divorced. Although Rashi and others interpret the passage as the Rambam does, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 46:7) appears to merge both views into a single understanding.</i> [Since] she was forbidden on the basis of a rumor, she is permitted on the basis of a rumor.
[A man] should not marry a woman if he intends to divorce her.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">If the man informs a woman that he intends to divorce her, he may marry her for a brief amount of time (<i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:28; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 119:1).</i> Nor should he maintain her as a wife<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">He did not intend to divorce her originally, made this decision after they married, but lives together with her as husband and wife with the thought of divorcing her in the future.</i> and live with her, if he intends to divorce her.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Children conceived during this time will have severely tainted personalities, as stated in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:12.</i><br>A man should not divorce his first wife unless he discovers an incident of sexual misconduct,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">There is somewhat of a difficulty with the Rambam's ruling. The opinion he cites is that of the School of Shammai, as mentioned at the conclusion of the tractate of <i>Gittin</i>. The School of Hillel differs and maintains that if a woman wrongs her husband, even with regard to as insignificant a matter as burning his meal, he may divorce her. Rabbi Akiva goes even further and maintains that even if a person finds a more attractive woman, he may divorce his wife.<br>Most authorities agree that in this, as in most other instances, the halachah follows the School of Hillel. Why then does the Rambam (and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> [<i>Even HaEzer</i> 119:3]) follow the opinion of the School of Shammai?<br>Among the resolutions offered is that the difference of opinion between the Schools of Shammai and Hillel applies only with regard to a second marriage. With regard to a first marriage, by contrast, even the School of Hillel accepts the School of Shammai's stringency (<i>Beit Yosef, Even HaEzer</i> 119).<br>Note also the statements of the Ramah, who rules that the prohibition applied only during the Talmudic era, when a woman could be divorced against her will. In the present era, when a woman must willingly accept a divorce, this prohibition does not apply.</i>, as [Deuteronomy 24:1] states: "When he finds evidence of sexual misconduct...." One should not hurry to divorce one's first wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Gittin</i> 90b, which states that whenever a man divorces his first wife, the altar itself cries.<br>On the surface, the wording used by the Rambam is problematic. First he says that it is forbidden to divorce one's first wife, and then he states that one should not hurry, implying that one may, but that it is ethical not to be impulsive about the matter. The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:2 offers two resolutions: a) The prohibition exists only when, as was possible in the Talmudic era, the husband is divorcing his first wife against her will. If she is willing to accept the divorce, there is no prohibition; one should, however, proceed without haste. b) Even when one hears about improper sexual conduct, one should not be hasty about the matter. Instead, the incident should be investigated carefully to determine if in fact any wrongdoing occurred.</i> With regard to a second wife, by contrast, if one hates her, one may send her away.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Although divorce is undesirable, an unhealthy marriage is even more undesirable, and a marriage should be terminated if there are severe ill feelings between a couple.</i>
It is a mitzvah to divorce a woman who possesses unsavory character traits and does not conduct herself modestly<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is both that she is continually contending with her husband and that she is immodest. In such an instance, it is a mitzvah to divorce her, even if she is a man's first bride (<i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:4).</i>, as is the practice of proper daughters of Israel, as [implied by Proverbs 22:10]: "Drive away the scoffer, and contention will depart."<br>When a woman has been divorced for loose moral conduct,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:12.</i> it is not fitting for a proper man to marry her, lest people say: "This one sent away this wicked woman, and this one brought her home."
When a man's wife becomes a deaf-mute,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a situation in which a woman married while fully capable and became a deaf-mute while married. Since a deaf-mute is considered to be mentally incapable, such a person is unable to establish a marriage bond that is binding according to Scriptural law. Our Rabbis made certain provisions for the marriage of such individuals, as explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:9. In this instance, however, since the woman was not a deaf-mute at the time of marriage, the marriage is binding according to Scriptural law.<br>The law teaches us that since according to Scriptural and Talmudic law, a woman can be divorced against her will, the fact that the woman is mentally incapable does not prevent her husband from divorcing her. Since a woman who is a deaf-mute is not totally incapable of caring for herself, our Sages did not make provisions for her, as they did for a woman who becomes mentally unsound.</i> he may divorce her, [by giving her] a <i>get</i>, and the divorce is effective. If, however, [his wife] loses control of her mental or emotional faculties,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">This also refers to a situation in which the woman lost control of her faculties after marriage. If, however, she was mentally unstable at the outset, any marriage that she enters into is not binding at all (<i>Hilchot Ishut, loc. cit.</i>).</i> he may not divorce her until she regains stability.<br>This is a prescript ordained by our Sages so that she will not [be divorced and left] unattended, [and be violated] by immoral people, for she is unable to care for herself. Therefore, [her husband] should provide a place for her, provide her with food and drink from her own resources,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">He must, however, put at the woman's disposal the money due her by virtue of her marriage contract and the money due from her dowry (<i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:9).</i> and marry another woman. He is not obligated to provide her with her sustenance, garments and conjugal rights.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling does not apply in the Ashkenazic community, nor in other places where the custom is to follow the ban of Rabbenu Gershom not to divorce one's wife against her will. In these communities, the husband is required to provide for his wife's sustenance and garments from his own resources. The rationale is that since he is not able to divorce her - for she is not capable of consenting to the divorce - he remains liable to bear the financial burden of supporting her (<i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:9).<br>The husband is not, however, obligated to give her conjugal rights. The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 119) and the <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:12 state that in such a situation, the husband may be granted license to marry a second wife by 100 rabbis.</i> [For although our Sages compelled the husband to remain married to such a woman, they did not compel him to live with her as man and wife,] because a mentally sound individual cannot endure living with a mentally incapable person in one dwelling.<br>[The husband] is not obligated to provide her with medical treatment,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Even according to the law in Talmudic times, many differ with the Rambam's thesis and maintain that the husband is obligated for his wife's medical expenses.<br>The Ra'avad protests that in many instances, a person with mental disorders can be rehabilitated, and he maintains that the husband should be required to pay for such treatment. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 119:11 states that even the Rambam would agree to such an obligation.<br>In the Ashkenazic community today, just as a husband is required to supply his wife with her sustenance in such a situation, he is also held liable for all her medical expenses (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 119:6, <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:12).</i> nor to redeem her if she is taken captive. If he divorces her, the divorce is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">As the Ra'avad mentions, in an instance when a woman has lost mental competence to the extent that she cannot safeguard the <i>get</i> she was given, all authorities agree that the divorce is not binding. Even when she has that degree of mental competence, there are many authorities that maintain that the divorce is not effective. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 119:6) quotes the Rambam's view, as interpreted by the Ra'avad. The Ramah follows the more stringent views.</i> He should remove her from his home, and he is not obligated to care for her.

Chapter 11

One should not marry a girl below the age of majority.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even though a father has the right to consecrate his daughter before she reaches majority and arrange for her marriage, "it is not proper for him to act in this manner." Instead, our Sages enjoined that a person should not consecrate his daughter while she is a minor until she matures and says, "I would like [to marry] so and so" (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:19). Similarly, from the husband's point of view, he should not marry a girl until she is mature, lest she change her mind afterwards (<i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 41a).</i> When a man marries an orphan girl below the age of majority, and [before she attains majority] she [decides that] she does not desire [to remain married to] this husband, she rejects [the marriage] and departs; a <i>get</i> is not required, because a consecration effected by a minor does not establish a marriage bond in the full sense, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages ordained that an orphan girl below the age of majority could be married, so that someone would care for her and protect her. With regard to such a marriage, the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:8: "The consecration is not absolutely binding according to Scriptural law; it is merely a Rabbinic institution. [According to Scriptural law, the outcome] is tentative. If she continues living with her husband until she reaches the age of majority, the <i>kiddushin</i> are finalized, and she becomes a married woman in the complete sense of the term. There is no need for [her husband] to consecrate her again after she attains majority. If she does not want [to continue] living with him, she must perform <i>mi'un</i>; she then leaves [the relationship] without a divorce."</i> [The annulment of a marriage in this manner is referred to as <i>mi'un</i>.]<br>Similarly, when a girl below majority was married at her father's initiative,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the marriage is binding according to Scriptural law and cannot be annulled through <i>mi'un</i>.</i> but was then widowed or divorced while still a minor, she is considered to be an orphan, although her father is alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Once a girl is married, her father no longer has any authority over her, even though he is alive (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:12).</i> If she marries again while she is below the age of majority, she may annul her marriage through <i>mi'un</i>.
Although the marriage of a woman who is a deaf-mute is a Rabbinic institution like that of a minor, our Sages did not give her the right to annul it through <i>mi'un</i>, so that men would not refrain from marrying her.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In the instance of a minor, her right to annul the marriage lasts only until she reaches majority. With regard to a deaf-mute, by contrast, there would be no limit to this privilege. This would be regarded unfavorably by a husband (<i>Yevamot</i> 113a).</i>
A minor can annul her marriage via <i>mi'un</i> whether she has been merely consecrated or [even if] the marriage has been consummated. [She can exercise this privilege] in her husband's presence, or outside his presence. Just as she can annul her marriage to her husband, she can annul her relationship to a <i>yavam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if her husband dies without children and she does not desire to marry the <i>yavam</i>, she can dissolve the marriage by <i>mi'un</i>.</i><br>Just as she can annul one marriage through <i>mi'un</i>, so too, she can annul a second marriage or a third marriage. Indeed, [she can exercise this privilege] any number of times.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although a girl has the right to marry and dissolve her marriage as often as she desires, our Rabbis did not approve of such conduct and counselled that the Jewish court should arrange a marriage of a minor only when it does not appear likely that she will seek to dissolve the marriage (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).</i><br>As long as she is a minor, she has the right to annul her marriage through <i>mi'un</i>. When a minor does not exercise the right of <i>mi'un</i> and becomes consecrated to another man despite the fact that she was married, [the consecration is binding]. Becoming consecrated is [obviously] a rejection [- and thus an annulment - of her previous marriage].
Until when may a girl annul her marriage through <i>mi'un</i>? Throughout the entire time she is a minor, until she becomes a <i>na'arah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when she becomes twelve years old and manifests physical signs of maturity, as explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:3.</i> or until it is known that she becomes classified as an <i>aylonit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A woman who does not manifest any female physical characteristics. If she shows clear signs of such a condition, she is placed in this category at age 20. If she does not show such signs, but also does not manifest signs of female physical maturity, she is not placed into this category until age 35 (<i>Ibid.</i>:4).</i><br>When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">That a girl can annul her marriage despite the fact that she has passed the age of twelve, when she has not manifested female physical characteristics.</i> apply? When her husband did not engage in marital relations with her after she became twelve years and one day old. If, however, the couple engaged in relations after she reached this age, since these relations consecrate her according to Scriptural law, as explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:2.</i> she no longer has the right to annul her marriage through <i>mi'un</i>.<br>Similarly, [when the woman reaches this age, we assume that she has lost her right to annul her marriage through <i>mi'un</i>]. She need not be checked for signs of physical maturity, for it is assumed that she has manifested them.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., our ordinary assumption is that a woman has manifested signs of maturity. Therefore, if a woman wants to annul the marriage after she reaches the age of twelve, she must undergo a physical inspection to show that she has not manifested signs of physical maturity. If no signs are discovered, and she has not engaged in relations with her husband after reaching the age of twelve, she may exercise the right of <i>mi'un</i>.</i>
If she has undergone a physical inspection, and no signs of maturity were discovered, but she engaged in marital relations after the age when she could have manifested signs of maturity, we suspect that pubic hairs had grown and later fell off. Because of the doubt, the marriage must be dissolved with a <i>get</i>.<br>If a woman [who engaged in marital relations with her husband after reaching the age of twelve attempts to] annul her marriage through <i>mi'un</i> after undergoing a physical examination,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In which no signs of physical maturity were discovered.</i> and then is consecrated by another person, [her second husband also] must dissolve their relationship with a <i>get</i>, because of the doubt involved.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since no signs of physical maturity were discovered, it is possible that the girl is still a minor and that the annulment of her first marriage - and thus her subsequent consecration - is acceptable. But it is also possible that, as mentioned in the previous halachah, pubic hairs grew and fell off, and that through engaging in marital relations she had been consecrated by her first husband. Because of the doubt involved, she must be divorced by both men.</i> If she married [the second husband], she must be divorced by both husbands and there is a doubt concerning the legitimacy of a child born to either of them [after her consecration to her second husband].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is possible that her first marriage is binding, the legitimacy of a child fathered by her second husband is in doubt. And conversely, since it is possible that the marriage to her second husband is binding, there are also doubts concerning the legitimacy of a child fathered afterwards by the first husband.</i>
When a minor does not exercise her right to <i>mi'un</i> and attains majority, she no longer has this privilege. [This applies] even when she did not engage in marital relations with her husband after reaching the age of twelve years and one day. Since she has attained majority, it is a Rabbinic decree that a divorce is required [if the marriage must be dissolved].<br>[The rationale for this ruling is as follows:] The couple did not engage in marital relations after she reached the age of <i>na'arut</i>, in which instance it would be necessary to suspect that she manifested signs of physical maturity, and accordinly, there would be a doubt whether or not a marriage bond had been established. Nor did they engage in relations after she attained majority, in which instance she would become a married woman in all regards. Accordingly, the only reason she requires a <i>get</i> is the fact of her marriage as a minor, which is a Rabbinic institution.<br>Based on the above, if another man consecrated her after she attained majority, [when she had not engaged in marital relations with her first husband from the age of twelve onward,] the second man's consecration is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if she had not yet been divorced by her first husband. Since the second man's consecration has the power of Scriptural law, it takes priority.</i> As such, if her first husband divorces her, her second husband may consummate the marriage. If, however, her second husband divorces her, her first husband may not continue his marriage with her. [This is a decree, instituted] lest people say: "He remarried his divorcee after she was consecrated."<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Which is forbidden, as stated in Halachah 12.</i><br>If her second husband engaged in marital relations with her before her first husband divorced her, she must be divorced by both men. [This is a decree instituted] because [the situation] resembles an instance in which a woman heard that her husband died, she married, and then her first husband returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The resemblance is that the woman married a second husband before her marriage with the first was severed.</i> [The laws governing the two situations are not entirely analogous. In this instance,] a child fathered by the second husband is not illegitimate.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Because her marriage to her first husband is not binding according to Scriptural law.</i> But if her first husband engages in relations with her before her second husband divorces her, any child born is illegitimate.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For her second marriage is binding according to Scriptural law.</i>
In which instances must a minor perform the rite of <i>mi'un</i> [to nullify her marriage]? [Our Sages established the following guidelines.] If she was between six and ten [when she was consecrated], we investigate the extent of her sagacity.<br>If she knows to guard [the money given to her to effect] the <i>kiddushin,</i> appreciates that it was given for that purpose and will guard it differently from the way in which she would guard a nut, a date or the like, she must perform the rite of <i>mi'un</i> [to nullify her marriage].<br>If she does not know to guard [the money given to her to effect] the <i>kiddushin</i>, she need not perform the rite of <i>mi'un</i> [to nullify her marriage]. Instead, she returns to her mother's home as if she had never been consecrated. If she is less than six, even if she knows [how to guard the money given her,] she need not perform the rite of <i>mi'un</i>. If she is more than ten, even if she is very inept, she must perform the rite of <i>mi'un</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 155:2) quotes opinions that maintain that the above applies only when the girl's marriage was arranged by her brother or her mother. If she arranged the marriage herself, it is not binding, even according to Rabbinic law. The Ra'avad mentions a third opinion, which states that for a girl between the ages of six and ten, the marriage must be arranged by her family to be binding. After the age of ten, it is binding even if she arranged it herself.</i><br>Whenever a girl's brother, mother or relatives arranged for her marriage without telling her of the identity of the groom, she need not perform the rite of <i>mi'un</i> [to nullify her marriage].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yevamot</i> 13:2), which explains that this refers to an instance in which a girl's family members prepared her for marriage without informing her who her groom would be.</i>
What does the rite of <i>mi'un</i> entail? She tells two witnesses:<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Chanan'el and other authorities maintain that, <i>a priori</i>, three individuals should be present. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 155:4) mentions this opinion, the Rambam's view appears to be favored.</i> "I no longer desire my husband so and so," "I no longer desire to be consecrated [to the man] to whom my mother - or my brother - consecrated me," or the like.<br>[The above applies] even if the two individuals are guests dining in her husband's home and she is serving them. If she tells them, "I no longer desire my husband so and so," she has performed <i>mi'un</i>.
The two individuals in whose presence the minor performs the rite of <i>mi'un</i> should write the following for her: "On this and this day, _______________the daughter of _____________ rejected her husband." They sign the document and give it to her. This is the essential portion of a deed of <i>mi'un</i>.<br>A deed of <i>mi'un</i> does not resemble a bill of divorce, in which the giving of the bill effects the divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a deed of <i>mi'un</i> is merely a legal record. The act of <i>mi'un</i> - i.e., the girl's statement that she no longer desires to live with her husband - is what nullifies their marriage. In contrast, it is the transfer of the <i>get</i>, the bill of divorce, that causes the divorce to take effect.</i> It need not be written with the proper intent, nor must it be transferred, nor do any of the laws required for a bill of divorce apply with regard to it. The wording used for a <i>get</i> is not used for it, lest it appear to be a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 107b-108a relates that originally, the Sages would have a legal record of <i>mi'un</i> written using wording that somewhat resembled a bill of divorce. They saw, however, that this created the impression that the husband was forbidden to marry the girl's close relatives. Since this is not the case, as mentioned in Halachah 16, they altered the wording used for the legal record.</i> It is merely a legal record.
The two individuals before whom a girl makes a statement of <i>mi'un</i> must know the identity of the girl and her husband. Therefore, whoever sees [a girl] make a statement of <i>mi'un</i> [in the presence of two other people] and hears that statement, is entitled to write a legal record of this statement, even though he was not aware of [the girl's] identity beforehand.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Our additions are made on the basis of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 155:8). We assume that the other witnesses were aware of the law and would have objected to the girl's making such statements if they did not know her identity and that of her husband. (See a parallel in <i>Hilchot Yibbum VaChalitzah</i> 4:29. Note, however, the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 155:11 who differs.)</i><br>It has become customary for the Jewish people to write a legal record of a statement of <i>mi'un</i>, employing the following text.
A legal record of a statement of <i>mi'un</i>:<br>On this day of the week, and on this day of the month, in this year according to the following reckoning,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from the creation or from the beginning of Alexander the Great's rule, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 27.</i> so and so, the daughter of so and so (her father's name) issued a protest in our presence, saying: "My mother or my brother misled me and had me married - or consecrated - to so and so, the son of so and so (his father's name) while I was a minor. I am now making a statement in your presence that I do not desire him, nor can I live with him."

When a man divorces his wife, and she becomes consecrated to another man, she is forbidden to her first [husband], even though she has not engaged in marital relations [with her second husband].

That would be adultery, a sin punishable by execution. Rather, this applies even if the first husband remarries his wife after she is divorced by her second husband.<br>The husband is punished by lashes only if he both remarries her and engages in sexual relations with her. Neither act alone incurs that punishment (<i>Kiddushin</i> 78a).</i> he [transgresses a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 356) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 580) count this as one of the Torah's 613 commandments.</i> and] is punished by lashes. He is forced to divorce her, as [implied by Deuteronomy 24:4]: "Her first husband, who sent her away, may not [return and remarry her]."
If she engaged in promiscuous relations with another man while she was divorced, she is permitted to remarry her husband, for it is written [Deuteronomy 24:2]: "And she departed from his home and went and became another man's [wife]." It is "becom[ing] another man's [wife]" - i.e., being consecrated - which causes her to become forbidden to remarry her [first] husband.
Included in this prohibition is that every woman who engaged in adulterous relations becomes forbidden to her husband. He is punished by lashes [for engaging in marital relations with her],<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, which cites an apparent contradiction between the Rambam's statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 1:22 and <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i>, Chapter 19, from which it would appear that a man is not punished by lashes for engaging in relations with his wife in such a situation.</i>as [implied by the inclusion of the phrase] "after she has become tainted" in [Deuteronomy 24:4]: "And [an adulterous woman] has been tainted." There is one exception: the wife of an Israelite<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">But not a priest.

Nevertheless, since it has not been definitely established that his wife committed adultery, he is not punished by lashes (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> If after divorcing his wife [for such reasons], the husband transgresses and remarries her, he must divorce her.
A deaf-mute may divorce his wife with signals, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachah 17.

A girl who leaves her husband by virtue of the rite of <i>mi'un</i> is not considered to be divorced by him.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Divorce nullifies a marriage from the time of divorce onward. <i>Mi'un</i>, by contrast, voids the marriage entirely, causing it to be considered as if it had never taken place.</i> The laws applying to her relations with her husband whom she rejected are the same as those applying to a man who has never consecrated her. She is permitted to marry his relatives. He is permitted to marry her relatives. Nor is she disqualified from marrying into the priesthood.<br>If she married another man and was divorced or widowed, or she nullified her relationship with him through <i>mi'un</i>, she is permitted to remarry him. Moreover, even if her first husband divorced her [while she was still a minor], remarried her, she then nullified their relationship via <i>mi'un</i> and married another man and was divorced by him, she may remarry her first husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>mi'un</i> that terminated the second marriage reveals that the first marriage was not binding according to Scriptural law, and that a <i>get</i> was not actually required. (See Rashi, <i>Yevamot</i> 108a.)</i><br>[The rationale is that] whenever a girl leaves a marriage via the rite of <i>mi'un</i>, it is considered as if she had never been divorced via a <i>get</i>, and she may remarry her first husband. [This applies] even if she was once divorced [by this man] before <i>mi'un</i>.<br>When, by contrast, a man divorces his wife - who is a minor - with a <i>get</i>, she marries another man and then nullifies the marriage through <i>mi'un</i>, she may not remarry her first husband, because although her final marriage was terminated by <i>mi'un</i>, her marriage [to her first husband] was terminated by a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 108b explains that she is not permitted to remarry her first husband because we are afraid that he will change his mind and influence her to nullify her marriage to her second husband via <i>mi'un</i>. We suspect that she will be able to be influenced by him, because she still is attracted to him - for it was he who divorced her, not she who nullified the marriage through <i>mi'un</i>. In the first instance, we do not harbor such suspicions, for it was she who rejected her first husband, nullifying the marriage through <i>mi'un</i>.</i> Needless to say, this applies if the second husband divorced her or he died.<br>Similarly, she is forbidden to the father of her first husband, his son and his brothers, as are other divorced women. [This applies despite the fact that] she terminates her marriage to her second husband via <i>mi'un</i>.
When a girl nullifies her connection to a <i>yavam</i> through <i>mi'un</i>, she remains forbidden to his father, for she appears to be his daughter-in-law, since [that was her status] when his son died. She is, however, permitted to marry [her late husband's] other relatives.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Rashba and the Ramban differ, and maintain that the woman is forbidden to the other relatives of the deceased, with the exception of his brothers. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 155:11) mentions both opinions, but favors that of the Rambam.</i> Thus, although she rejected a potential <i>yavam</i> with <i>mi'un</i>, she is permitted to marry his brother.
Whenever a woman is divorced or widowed, she should neither marry nor be consecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">She may, however, become engaged to be married during this time, provided she does not enter into privacy with her fiance (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 13:1).</i> until 90 days pass between the day she was divorced or her husband died and the day on which she became consecrated. [This interval was required] to see whether or not she is pregnant, and thus to differentiate between the seed of the first husband and the seed of the second husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The laws governing forbidden marital relationships revolve around paternal relationships, as do the laws of <i>yibbum</i>. For these reasons, it is very important to determine who in fact is the father of a child.</i>
We count [these 90 days] from the day the <i>get</i> is written; [this applies] even when it was written on a conditional basis, or it did not reach the woman until years afterwards. [The rationale is] that from the time [a <i>get</i>] is written, [a woman's husband] no longer enters into privacy with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">And thus it is impossible that he be the father of the woman's child. (See Chapter 3, Halachah 5; Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)<br>The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 13:1) differs and quotes Rabbenu Asher, who maintains that the counting should begin from the day the <i>get</i> reached the woman for whom it was intended.</i>
[Included] in this decree of our Sages is that even a woman who is not fit to give birth, and even one who was divorced or widowed after merely being consecrated, must wait 90 days. I.e., even a minor, an elderly woman, a barren woman or an <i>aylonit</i>, even a woman whose husband was overseas, sick or imprisoned, and indeed, even a woman who is a virgin despite being consecrated, must wait 90 days.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 42b explains that this decree was applied universally lest people begin to search for loopholes.</i>
A maidservant who was freed and a non-Jewish woman who was converted are required to wait 90 days [before they marry].<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 13:5) interpret this to be referring to a woman who was married as a non-Jew, and not one who was unmarried. Note the Radbaz (Vol. I, Responsa 196), who differs and maintains that this applies even to an unmarried gentile woman.</i> Even a gentile and his wife who convert together are required to separate for 90 days to differentiate between seed that was conceived in holiness and seed that was not conceived in holiness.<br>Similarly, although the Torah prescribed only [an interim of] 30 days for her own sake, a <i>yefat to'ar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">A female captive who is taken as a wife by her captor, as described in Deuteronomy 21:11 and <i>Hilchot Melachim</i>, Chapter 8.</i> must wait 90 days [to marry her captor] for the sake of the definition of her child's [status].<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the second time the captor has relations with her. It is possible for a child to be conceived during their first sexual encounter, in which instance the child also has the status of a convert.</i> The 30 [days mentioned by the Torah] are included in the 90-day interim.
A girl who annuls her marriage through <i>mi'un</i> need not wait [before remarrying]; our Sages' decree applied only to a divorcee. Similarly, a woman who has promiscuous relations need not wait, for she guards herself against becoming pregnant. Similarly, a woman who was raped or seduced need not wait.
[The following rule applies when] a girl below the age of majority who is not fit to give birth was married under a mistaken conception, discovered that she is forbidden to remain married to her husband and was forced to separate by the court. She need not wait, for this is an unlikely occurrence, and our Sages did not apply their decrees to situations that are out of the ordinary.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the woman was old enough to conceive a child while married to the man with whom relations are forbidden, she is required to wait. For it is necessary to discern if a child was conceived in the forbidden relationship or not.</i>
When, within this 90-day period, [a man] consecrates [a woman who is required to wait], he is placed under a ban of ostracism.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that the intent of the ban of ostracism should be to compel the man to divorce his wife. (See the Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 13:10, who quotes this opinion.)</i> If he consecrates the woman and then temporarily flees [to a distant country], he is not placed under a ban of ostracism.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that he is advised to flee.</i> If he consummates the marriage within the 90-day period, the couple are forced to separate until the conclusion of the interval, at which time they are allowed to live together as man and wife.
Similarly, our Sages decreed that a man should not marry a woman who is pregnant with a child conceived by another man, or a woman who is nursing a child conceived by another man, even though the parentage of the fetus is known.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 13:11) mentions that leniency is often shown in instances where a pregnant woman would be likely to engage in sexual relations with the father of the child, or with other men during this interim period, with the hope that marriage will prevent her from unchaste conduct.</i><br>[The restriction concerning] a pregnant woman [was instituted,] lest [the other man] harm the fetus during sexual relations, for he is not concerned about his colleague's child. [And the decree concerning] a nursing mother [was instituted], lest the woman's milk spoil and her second husband fail to show concern for restoring her ability to nurse, by providing her with a diet that will remedy her difficulty.
For how long is the woman considered to be a nursing mother? For twenty-four months.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 13:11) states that in a leap year, the extra month should be counted as one of the 24. The Ramah, however, states that, <i>a priori</i>, in such a situation, an additional month should be added to the restriction. (Note <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 13:22.)</i> This does not include the day the child was born, nor the day the woman becomes consecrated.
Just as it is forbidden to marry such a woman, it is forbidden to consecrate her until this time period passes. Even if [a woman] gives her child to a nursemaid or weans him during these 24 months, she should not marry.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 60b) states that the restriction is upheld lest women be encouraged to take these options rather than continue nursing their children.<br>If, however, the woman gave her child to a nursemaid in her first husband's lifetime or is physically incapable of nursing, there are no restrictions against her remarrying (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 13:11).</i> If her son dies, she is permitted to marry. We do not fear that perhaps she will kill [her son for this reason].
If a man transgresses and marries a pregnant or nursing woman during this period, he should divorce her,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that he is placed under a ban of ostracism until he divorces her. This ruling is cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 13:12).</i> even if he is a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Who may not remarry his divorcee.</i> If the man is an Israelite, he may remarry her after the 24 months of nursing pass.<br>If [a man] marries [such a woman] and then flees and returns after [the prescribed] period and lives together with his wife, there is no difficulty.<br>[A man who] consecrates a pregnant or nursing woman is not forced to divorce her.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 13:12) is more stringent and equates consecration with marriage.</i> He may not, however, consummate the marriage until the nursing period passes or until the child dies.

Chapter 12

When a woman comes and says, "I was married, and now I am divorced," her word is accepted, because the source for the statements [on which basis the woman was] forbidden [states that she is] permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">She is not contradicting her original statements, but rather adding information, and that information serves as the basis for changing her status. This ruling applies even if she makes her second statement after a significant time has passed since she made her first statement (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). Rav Moshe HaCohen objects, maintaining that her second statement must be made directly after her first statement. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 152:6) quotes both opinions, it appears that the Rambam's opinion is favored.</i><br>If the prevailing assumption is that a woman was married,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not know for certain that she has been married, but she and her husband have lived together as man and wife. See <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, which notes that the Rambam's wording deviates from his source (<i>Ketubot</i> 2:5), which mentions that witnesses say that the woman was married.</i> and she comes and says, "My husband divorced me," her word is not accepted [as a basis] for her to be allowed to be remarried.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, she is considered to be married to her husband until she brings proof to the contrary. If she remarries, she is forced to leave her second husband (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 152:7). There is a difference of opinion among the authorities regarding whether her second husband is required to give her a formal divorce. (See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 152:12.)</i> She has, however, disqualified herself [from marrying into] the priesthood forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., should her present husband die, she would not be allowed to marry a priest. (See Halachah 3.)</i> If her husband dies [childless], we suspect that there might have been truth to her words, and she performs the rite of <i>chalitzah</i>, rather than the rite of <i>yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not accept her statements entirely, and therefore require her to undergo <i>chalitzah</i>. Nevertheless, because there is a possibility that her statements are true, we do not allow her to undergo <i>yibbum</i>, for if she had in fact been divorced, relations with her late husband's brother would be forbidden.</i>
When a woman has two witnesses who state that she has been divorced, she is permitted to marry <i>a priori</i>, although she does not possess her <i>get</i>. If she produces a <i>get</i> that was in her possession and says: "My husband divorced me with this," her word is accepted, and she is permitted to marry, even though [the signatures of the witnesses to the <i>get</i>] have not been verified as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 7, Halachah 24. As mentioned in the notes on that halachah, the Ra'avad differs with the Rambam concerning this issue. Both opinions are quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:13-14), but later (<i>loc. cit.</i> 152:9), the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> mentions only the Rambam's view.</i>
[The following laws apply] when the husband comes and protests. If he states, "I never gave it to her. It fell from me and she found it," his statements are not accepted, because he admits that he wrote it for her sake, and it is now in her possession. If, however, the husband says: "[The <i>get</i>] was given conditionally," "It was entrusted to her for safekeeping," or "I never wrote such [a document]; it is a forgery,"<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., these two phrases are part of a single claim. This translation is based on manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah that state ומזוייף, "And it is a forgery." The standard printed version omits the first vav</i> leading to the conclusion that the Rambam is speaking about two claims. This conception is also reflected in the statement of the law in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 152:10).</i> [the woman] must have the signatures of the witnesses verified or have the witnesses to its transfer testify, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 2.</i><br>If the signatures of the witnesses are not verified, she is not considered to be divorced with regard to the right to marry others. She has, however, disqualified herself [from marrying into] the priesthood, as stated.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 1.</i> For she has disqualified herself by virtue of her own statements and caused herself to be considered as a forbidden object.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although we do not accept her statements, we require her to abide by all the stringencies they imply.</i>
If she comes together with her husband and says, "My husband divorced me, but I lost my <i>get</i>," and the husband says, "I did not divorce her," her word is accepted, even though it has been assumed that she is his wife. [The rationale is:] it can be assumed that a woman would not make such brazen statements in the presence of her husband [if they were not true].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">There are several qualifications to this principle: First, the woman must make this statement in the presence of her husband. If he is not present, we fear that she will speak brazenly (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:13). And, as implied by Halachot 6 and 14 of this chapter, if there is one witness who supports the woman's statements, her word is not accepted. We fear that the support the witness gives her will encourage her to lie. Similarly, as reflected in the following halachah, if her husband supports her, her word is not accepted.<br>In <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Ra'avad states that the woman's word should be accepted only insofar as to require her to receive a <i>get</i> if she remarries. She is not given license to remarry, nor may she collect the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i> from her first husband unless she proves that she has been divorced. The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:2) quotes both views. He states, however, that in the present age, since brazen behavior is more common, the presumption upon which the Rambam's ruling rests is no longer a viable support.</i>
If a husband says: "I divorced my wife," his word is not accepted. Nevertheless, we suspect that it might be true, and therefore, the woman is considered to be one whose divorce is of doubtful status.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachah 3.</i> Even when the woman also admits that she was divorced, his word is not accepted.<br>We fear that he is seeking to create difficulties for her,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., that she will remarry and then he will prove that her second marriage is adulterous, in which case she will be bound by all the stringencies stated in Chapter 10, Halachot 4 and 7.</i> or that he divorced her with a <i>get</i> that was void, and she is not aware of the fact, or perhaps she will brazenly [state that she has been divorced, although that is not the case,] because he accepts her word, or because she is not aware of the seriousness of the prohibition. Therefore, we tell the husband: "If it is true [that you divorced her,] you are both here, divorce her again in our presence."
When two [individuals] say [that a woman] was divorced, and two others say<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected by Halachah 8, in this instance the testimony of the witnesses must be to the effect that the divorce was not carried out in an adequate manner.</i> [that] she was not divorced, she is still presumed to be married. [This ruling applies] even if her husband is present, and she tells him, "You divorced me." Since the witnesses support her, it is possible that she will speak brazenly [to her husband]. Therefore, if she remarries [in such a situation], she is compelled to leave [her second husband], and a child [born to them] is considered illegitimate.
When does the above apply? When the witnesses say: "She was divorced in the immediate past." For in such a situation, we tell her, "If it is true that you were divorced, produce your <i>get</i>."<br>If, however, the witnesses say: "She was divorced several days ago," there is the possibility that the <i>get</i> was lost. [Therefore, different laws apply.] Since she claims that she was definitely divorced, and two witnesses support her claim, although there are two witnesses who deny it, if she marries one of the witnesses, she is not compelled to leave [her second husband]. [The rationale is] that she and her husband, [the witness,] certainly know whether she is permitted [or not], and we assume that they would not create difficulties for themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This assumption has sufficient legal power to counterbalance the prevailing assumption that the woman is still married. (See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 152:5.)</i><br>Accordingly, [different rules apply] if she marries another person. Since he cannot be certain concerning the matter - and similarly, if she herself is uncertain about the matter, even if she marries one of her witnesses - she should be compelled to leave [her second husband]. The legitimacy of a child born to them is a matter of question.
[The following rules apply when] two [individuals] say, "We saw that she was divorced," and two others say, "We did not see this." If they all lived in a single courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">If they do not all live in such proximity, there is no question, and <i>a priori,</i> she is given permission to remarry (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 152:6).</i> she should not marry.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that if in fact she had been divorced, the matter would have attracted the attention of all those dwelling in the courtyard.</i> If, however, she marries, she need not leave [her second husband], and we do not doubt the legitimacy of a child born to them. [The rationale is that] people often divorce in privacy.
[The following rule applies when] we there is no existing presumption that a woman was married, one witness comes and says, "She was married, but divorced," and another witness states, "She was not divorced." Since they both are testifying that she was married, and [only] one witness says she was divorced, she should not marry [a second man]. [The rationale is that] the statements of one [witness] are of no consequence [when they must counteract a definition of status established] on the basis of the testimony of two [witnesses].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., both the witnesses say that she was married, and only one says that she was divorced. Note the contrast to the parallel situation with regard to <i>kiddushin</i> as mentioned in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 9:31.</i> If she remarries, she should be compelled to leave [her second husband].
[The following ruling is rendered when] a woman and two men come from another country. One [of the men] says: "This is my wife, and this is my servant," the other says: "This is my wife, and this is my servant," and the woman says: "They are both my servants." The woman is free to marry anyone. For although two witnesses testified to her being married, since each one of them gave testimony that concerns himself, their statements are not accepted.
When an agent charged by the woman with receiving her <i>get</i> takes out a <i>get</i> that was in his possession, and the husband states that the <i>get</i> is a forgery, the authenticity of the <i>get</i> should be verified via the signatures of the witnesses, or via the witnesses who observed the transfer, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 3. In this respect, there is no difference between the woman's agent and herself.</i><br>If the husband says: "I gave him [the <i>get</i>] for safekeeping," and the agent says, "He gave it to me for the sake of divorce," the agent's word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling applies even when the husband, the wife and the agent are all in the same city. Even though one might think that in such an instance, if the husband's intent was to divorce his wife, he would have given the <i>get</i> to her directly and not to an agent, the agent's word is accepted.<br>There is another opinion in <i>Gittin</i> 64a, which maintains that in the same city, the agent's word is not accepted, and several <i>Rishonim</i> follow this view. Both opinions are mentioned by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:55), but the Rambam's opinion appears to be favored. The Ramah states that the agent's word is accepted only while he is in possession of the <i>get</i>.</i> A similar rule applies if the woman is in possession of the <i>get</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) appears to favor an opinion that accepts the woman's corroboration of the agent's statement, even when she is not in possession of the <i>get</i>.</i> and she says, "This agent gave it to me," the agent corroborates her statements and says that it was given to him by the husband for the purpose of divorce. The agent's word is accepted,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even though the agent is no longer in possession of the <i>get</i>, his word is accepted. Since the woman has the potential to return it to him, it is considered as if it is still in his possession (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 141:83).</i> even if the husband protests that he gave it to him for safekeeping, and the woman is considered to be divorced.
When the <i>get</i> is lost,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:56) states that it applies when there are no witnesses who saw the <i>get</i> in the woman's possession.</i> [more stringent rules apply]. Even if the husband says that he gave it to an agent<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is speaking about an agent who acts on behalf of the husband, giving the <i>get</i> to his wife.</i> for the sake of divorce, and the agent says that he gave it to the woman, the status of the divorce is a matter of question.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">On one hand, there is a legal principle: "One can assume that an agent has carried out his mission," and yet our Sages maintain that this construct should be accepted only with regard to the stringencies it implies (<i>Gittin</i> 64b). As such, with regard to marrying into the priesthood and the like, the woman is considered as if she has been divorced. Nevertheless, she is not given permission to remarry unless she has the signatures of the witnesses to the <i>get</i> verified, or if the witnesses to its transfer testify to that effect.</i> For our prevailing assumption is that the woman is married, and it is only [the statements of] one witness<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 32 and the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> on that halachah.</i> and her husband [who are contradicting that].<br>Even if the woman herself says, "In my presence, [my husband] gave the <i>get</i> to the agent for the purpose of divorce, and he divorced me," [the ruling remains unchanged]. Since her husband and the agent support her, it is possible that she will speak brazenly<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 4 and 6.</i> and in fact, she was not divorced.
[The following rule applies when] an agent appointed by the woman to receive her <i>get</i> receives it from [her husband] and sends it to her, [giving it to an agent to give to her] in the presence of two witnesses. Although the woman does not know whether [the <i>get</i>] was sent to her by her husband, her agent or her husband's agent, she is divorced, as has been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Halachah 11. There is a slight difference in this instance, because the original agent is not necessarily making these statements to the court himself. Nevertheless, as long as witnesses saw the <i>get</i> in the possession of the original agent, the statements of the agent who gave the <i>get</i> to the woman are accepted.</i>
[In the above situation,] if the husband comes and protests that he did not write [the <i>get</i>], or that the <i>get</i> is void, the signatures [of the witnesses] should be verified. [This is sufficient to counter the husband's protest, the rationale being that] there are witnesses that [the <i>get</i>] was in the possession of the agent of the woman, and his aegis is considered to be equivalent to her own.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes on Halachah 11, there are opinions that maintain that this applies only when the husband, the agent and the woman are located in different cities. If all three are located in the same city, these opinions maintain that the husband's word should be accepted if he states that he gave the agent the <i>get</i> for safekeeping. In this instance, as well, although both views are mentioned by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 141:57), the Rambam's view is favored.<br>Moreover, as mentioned in those notes, the Ramah maintains that if the <i>get</i> is no longer in possession of the agent, his word is not accepted.</i> Although she did not know [the purpose for which the <i>get</i> was given to the original agent], the witnesses knew.<br>If, however, the signatures [of the witnesses] cannot be verified, the divorce is not effective.
[The following rules apply when] the prevailing presumption is that a woman is married, and she and her husband travel overseas at a time when their relationship is peaceful, and peace abides in the world at large.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained, different rules apply if the couple is known to quarrel (Chapter 13, Halachah 1), or war prevails throughout the world (Chapter 13, Halachah 2).</i> If she comes and says, "My husband died," her word is accepted and she is granted permission to marry or to perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i> on this basis.<br>[The rationale is that] we assume that a woman will not bring difficulties upon herself, causing herself to be forbidden to both her first and her second husbands, causing herself to lose the right to collect the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i> from both husbands and causing her children to be deemed illegitimate when the matter is likely to become openly revealed, and when she will not be able to deny the matter or offer any argument in her defense. For if her husband is alive, he will ultimately return, or [at least,] it will become known that he is alive.<br>Similarly, if one witness comes and testifies that the woman's husband died, she is granted permission to marry by virtue of his testimony, because [the truth of] the matter will ultimately be revealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected by the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of Chapter 13, it appears that according to Scriptural law, the testimony of one witness is accepted in instances of this nature.</i> Similarly, the testimony of a servant, a woman, a maid-servant or a witness testifying on the basis of statements he heard from others is accepted regarding a person's death.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The testimony of such individuals is never accepted according to Scriptural law. The acceptance of such testimony in this instance is a leniency adopted by the Sages so that Jewish women will be able to remarry. (See the conclusion of Chapter 13.)<br>This halachah begins the discussion of the subject of <i>agunot</i>, women whose husbands are missing and presumed to have died. In previous generations, this was a recurrent difficulty, for business journeys were replete with danger, and moreover, pogroms and persecution were constant threats. Often, men disappeared and were presumed to have died or to have been killed, and yet there was no conclusive proof to that effect. Indeed, a significant amount of the Rabbinic literature of previous generations was devoted to questions of this nature.<br>In the present age, with the communications revolution and the advent of more highly developed means of identification, these problems have been minimized. But they still arise. After each of Israel's wars, lengthy investigations were necessary before permission to remarry was granted to the wives of the casualties. And when, heaven forbid, there are Jews killed in plane crashes and the like, Rabbis must make careful inquiries based on the principles reflected in the halachot that follow.</i> On the basis of such testimony, the man's wife is granted permission to remarry or perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>.
Any person who offers testimony is believed with regard to matters of this nature, with the exception of five women, who are presumed to hate each other. Their testimony is not [accepted] with regard to the death of the other's husband,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 24, which states that the testimony of these women is not considered at all, regardless of whether they say that the woman's husband is alive or that he has died.</i> lest they intend to cause her to be forbidden to him, although he is still alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we fear that out of hatred, these women will testify that a woman's husband has died so that she will marry another person, and when her first husband returns she will be forced to leave both relationships.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the phrase "although he is still alive" is meant to exclude an instance in which a woman's husband died and she remarried. The five women who share these close family ties with her first husband are not disqualified from giving testimony with regard to the death of her second husband. The implication is that these women's hatred has a specific objective: to cause the woman to be divorced from her husband. Once she is no longer married to him, they no longer harbor such feelings.<br>The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 17:13 and Rabbi Akiva Eiger question this ruling on the basis of the Rambam's wording in Chapter 7, Halachah 3, which states: "These are the women who we presume hate each other . . . another woman married to the same man - this applies even if this woman has since remarried." Nevertheless, this halachah can be interpreted to mean that although the other woman has remarried, she wants the woman who was married to her first husband also to be forbidden to him.</i>They are the woman's mother-in-law, the daughter of her mother-in-law,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Who we assume would identify with her mother. Moreover, the daughter of the mother-in-law may have a personal grudge, because the other woman will enjoy the inheritance of her parents' estate.</i>[her husband's] other wife, her <i>yevamah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the woman married to her husband's brother, whom her husband would have to marry if his brother died without children.

For example, if the husband of the daughter of a woman's husband is missing, the woman may not testify about the matter, although she has no natural reason to hate the other woman.</i><br>[Indeed, with regard to such testimony,] a gentile's statements delivered in the course of conversation are accepted and can serve as the basis for a woman to remarry, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13, Halachah 11, which explains that when the gentile makes statements casually, relating events that took place, his word is accepted.</i> If the gentile makes his statements with the intent that they serve as testimony, his word is not accepted.
Similar laws apply to a person who is disqualified [from serving as a witness] by Scriptural law, because of the commission of a sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to two categories of individuals: a) one who transgresses a prohibition punishable by lashes, and b) one who violates a prohibition of the Torah that involves taking money unjustly. (See <i>Hilchot Edut</i>, Chapter 10.)</i> If he comes to give testimony on behalf of a woman, [saying] that her husband died, his word is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">We fear that he is able to be bribed to give false testimony.</i> If he makes these statements in the course of conversation, his word is accepted, for he is not regarded as less than a gentile.<br>A person who is disqualified [from serving as a witness] by Rabbinic law,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., a person who takes interest forbidden by Rabbinic law, or a gambler (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 10:3).

[The following rules apply if] one witness came and testified that a woman's husband has died, and she was granted permission to remarry on the basis of his testimony, and afterwards another witness came and contradicted the testimony of the first, saying that he did not die. The woman's status is not changed, and she is still permitted to remarry.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:37) follows the ruling of Rabbenu Asher, who maintains that the woman should not remarry because of the gossip that might ensue.</i><br>[The rationale is that] the testimony of one witness is accepted with regard to [the death of] a woman's [husband] in the same way as is the testimony of two witnesses with regard to other matters. [This testimony is being challenged by the testimony of one witness,] and the words of one witness are not considered when there is [testimony from] two [witnesses].<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Or, as in the case at hand, the testimony of one witness that is considered to be equivalent to that of two.</i>
If two [witnesses] come at the same time,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">When the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:37) quotes this law, it states that the witness who says that the husband did not die came before the woman was granted license to remarry.

And if she marries, she should leave her second husband,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous instance, a ruling was already delivered, and the testimony of one witness is not sufficient to detract from that ruling.

Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 22b) states that it means: "I know that if he were alive, he would have returned by now," but this interpretation is not accepted by the later authorities.</i> she need not leave her second husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this decision is stated above in Halachah 7. At the outset, however, she should not remarry, not even to this witness (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 17:113). There are, moreover, significant halachic authorities who rule that she must leave her second husband. Their opinion is also mentioned in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), but the Rambam's opinion appears to be favored.</i> If two witnesses come and say that her first husband did not die, [a more stringent ruling is delivered]. Even though she married, she must leave her second husband.
When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the stringency mentioned at the conclusion of the previous halachah.</i> apply? When the one witness upon whose testimony [the woman was granted permission to] marry was equivalent to the two witnesses who contradicted his testimony. For example, she married based on the testimony of one man, and two men came and said that her husband did not die. Or she married based on the testimony of one woman or on the basis of her own testimony, and two women or two men who were disqualified from serving as witnesses by Rabbinic law testified that her husband did not die.<br>If, however, one acceptable witness says that her husband died, and many<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the number is not significant. The same law applies whether two or 200 come.</i> women or men who were disqualified from serving as witnesses by Rabbinic law testify that her husband did not die, the situation is considered to be equally balanced.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, she may not marry at all (and if she marries, may not remain married to her second husband unless she marries the witness, as the Rambam continues in Halachah 19). The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:37) emphasize that this applies only when the women or the witnesses who are usually disqualified come before the woman is granted permission to marry. If, however, she is granted permission to marry on the basis of the testimony of an acceptable witness, the testimony of these individuals does not cause that license to be rescinded.</i> Thus, if she marries one of the witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The wording used by the Rambam is slightly confusing, for we are speaking about an instance when only one acceptable witness testifies on her behalf. (See <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 17:118.)</i> who testified on her behalf, and she herself says, "I am certain that he died," she need not leave her second husband.
When one woman testifies that [her husband] died, or she herself says that [her husband] died, and afterwards,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, this applies even if the woman was granted license to remarry before the other witness came. This opinion is reflected in the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:38). If, however, two women testify that a woman's husband has died, and permission is granted for the woman to remarry, the testimony of a single acceptable witness is not sufficient for that license to be revoked (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:38).</i> one acceptable witness comes and says that he did not die, [the woman] should not remarry; and if she remarried, she should leave her second husband.
When one woman says that [a man] did not die, and two women say that he did die, [his wife] may remarry. Similarly, if ten women say that [a man] did not die, and eleven women say that he did die, [his wife] may remarry. For we say, "two [witnesses] are considered as 100," only with regard to acceptable witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the same situation occurred with regard to acceptable witnesses, the laws stated in the following halachah would apply. With regard to acceptable witnesses, as long as two witnesses dissent, it makes no difference how many witnesses support the other opinion.</i> With regard to witnesses whose testimony would ordinarily be disqualified, by contrast, [the law is that we] follow the majority, whether this leads to a more lenient ruling or a more stringent ruling.
When two [witnesses] say that [a man] died, and two other witnesses say that he did not die, [his wife] may not remarry. If she has remarried, she should leave [her second husband],<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even when the woman married after receiving license from a Rabbinic court. If two witnesses come afterwards and testify that her first husband is still alive, we give credence to their statements (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 17:128).</i> because the matter is one of doubt.<br>If she marries one of the witnesses who testified on her behalf, and she herself says, "I am certain that he died," she need not leave her second husband.
[The following laws apply when] a person has two wives and one of them comes and says, "My husband died." She may marry on the basis of her own testimony, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 15.</i> Her husband's other wife is forbidden to marry, for one of a man's wives may not testify on behalf of the other.<br>Even if the woman [who said that her husband died] married first, [the other wife is still forbidden to marry]. We do not say that if her husband had not actually died, she would not cause herself to be forbidden to him. [Instead, we suspect that] perhaps her hatred for the other wife is so great that she desires for them both to become forbidden to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., she is marrying with the intent that the other wife will follow suit and also marry. Then her first husband will return, and they will both become forbidden to him. In describing this sequence, <i>Yevamot</i> 120a recalls Samson's prayer (Judges 16:30 : "May I die together with the Philistines" - i.e., she will harm herself in order to harm her rival.</i><br>If one says, "My husband died," and her husband's other wife denies this, saying that he did not die, [the wife who testifies that he has died] may remarry. Just as the other wife's testimony does not cause her to be permitted, it does not cause her to be forbidden.<br>If one says, "[My husband] died," and the other says, "He was killed," they both are granted permission to remarry, for they both are testifying that he is no longer alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that their testimonies contradict each other is not significant.</i>

Chapter 13

[The following rules apply with regard to] a woman who told her husband:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Note the ruling of the <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 17:93, who explains that the Rambam's decision applies only in an instance where the woman has already made false statements in the presence of a court. The fact that a couple constantly quarrel is not considered serious enough to warrant the stringencies mentioned in this halachah.</i> "You divorced me in the presence of so and so and so and so," and those witnesses came and denied her statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">And so, the couple were forced to remain married. Chapter 12, Halachah 15 describes a situation when a man disappears "when their relationship is peaceful, and peace prevails in the world at large." All the laws that follow in that chapter deal with such situations. This chapter describes situations where these conditions do not prevail, and hence more stringent laws apply.</i> If afterwards, she and her husband departed [for a far-removed country] while peace prevails in the world at large,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the stringencies apply even where peace prevails in the world at large, because of the strife that exists between the couple.</i> and then she returns and says, "My husband died," her word is not accepted.<br>[The rationale is] that she is considered to be a liar, who desires to free herself from her ties to her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 116a records a difference of opinion between the Sages regarding the rationale for this ruling. Rav Chananiah states that the reason is that we suspect that the woman is lying. Rav Simi bar Ashi states that we suspect that in an instance where her husband appears to be dying, the woman will not be careful and will conclude that he died, even though he remained alive.<br>The Rambam's citation of the first opinion in this halachah represents a reversal of his thinking. For in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 15:1), he mentions the latter view.<br>According to the Rambam's opinion stated here, even if the woman says that she buried her husband, her word is not accepted (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot;</i> Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:48).</i> If one witness comes and testifies on her behalf that her husband died, she should not [be granted permission to] marry; we fear that perhaps she hired him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that this issue is left unresolved by <i>Yevamot</i> 116b, and therefore, the Rambam chooses the more stringent view. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions why the Rambam ignores the rationale given by the Talmud - that in most cases, a woman who is granted permission on the basis of the testimony of one witness is careful and thoroughly investigates the matter before she marries, but in this instance, because of her hatred of her husband, she will not make such an investigation - and offers another rationale that is not mentioned there.<br>Rav Eliyahu Mizrachi (in a responsum quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>) offers a resolution to this matter, explaining that the Rambam accepts the testimony of a single witness in such instances without question, because we assume that a person will not lie in an instance where the truth will shortly be revealed. (See the notes at the conclusion of this chapter.) Nevertheless, since the question is left unresolved by our Sages, and a very severe matter is involved, the Rambam does not desire to offer a leniency that was not accepted by our Sages. Therefore, he offers a different rationale, even though it was not mentioned in the Talmud.<br>On the basis of this explanation, Rav Eliyahu Mizrachi explains that if a witness comes to the court on his own initiative, the woman is granted license to remarry even when differences existed between her and her husband previously. The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 17:95, however, states that this leniency is not accepted by the latter authorities.</i> If, however, she marries, nevertheless, she need not leave [her second husband], for there is a witness who supports her.
Similarly, when there is a state of war in the world at large, if [a woman] comes and says, "My husband died in the war,"<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the woman says that her husband died near the battlefront, but not in battle, her word is accepted (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:48).</i> her word is not accepted, even where the couple's relationship is peaceful.<br>[The rationale is that we fear that] she will rely on a situation in which the likelihood is that he will die - e.g., the people in the front and at the rear were killed, and her husband is in the center. She might think, "Since these were killed, and those were killed, he was killed surely together with them."<br>For this reason, her word is not accepted, even if she says, "He died in the war, and I buried him."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's ruling, because the rationale that the Rambam mentioned previously - that she suspects that her husband died, and because of the high likelihood is willing to make such statements even though she has no definite knowledge - seemingly does not apply when the woman says: "I buried him." For if a person is buried, he is definitely dead.<br>[For this reason, the Rashba - and his opinion is quoted as a minority view by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:48) - rules that if the woman says that she buried her husband, her word is accepted.]<br>In the responsum of Rav Eliyahu Mizrachi quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, it is explained that the woman will be afraid to tarry on a battlefield and bury her husband. Nevertheless, since she is certain that he died, she will exaggerate and say that she buried him, although she did not. Alternatively, the <i>Levush</i> states that we suspect that the fear and confusion of wartime is so great that she may have in fact buried a man, but she might have mistaken another man for her husband.</i> If, however, she says that he died in bed, her word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although war was raging nearby, her husband was not involved in the war and died at home. Her word is accepted, because we do not suspect that she will intentionally lie. And at home, away from the battlefront, she will know for certain whether or not her husband died.</i>
If we are not aware of a war raging in the world, and a woman comes and says: "There was a war in a particular county and [my husband] died in that war," <i>a priori</i>, she should not marry. If, however, she marries, she need not leave [her second husband].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">On the one hand, if the woman desired to lie, she could have offered a better lie and not mentioned the war at all (<i>miggo</i>). Nevertheless, when a woman says that her husband died in a war, our suspicion is that she erred and thought her husband died, even when he did not. Therefore, at the outset, she should not be granted permission to marry. If, however, she does marry, since there are grounds to believe her statement, we do not force her to leave her second husband.<br>The Rambam's ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:49). The Ramah, however, follows the ruling of Rabbenu Asher, who maintains that if the woman marries, she should be forced to leave her second husband.</i>
Similarly, if a woman says, "My husband died in a landslide," her word is not accepted. In the same vein, if an area was overrun by swarms of snakes and scorpions, and she says, "He was bitten by a snake - or a scorpion - and died," her word is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the woman says that her husband died in bed at those times, her word is accepted. If she says that he died in a landslide or was bitten by a swarming mass of snakes, and she buried him, according to the Rambam her word is not accepted. According to the Rashba, her word is accepted if she says that she buried him [<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:51)].</i> [The rationale is] that she might rely on the fact that most men die because they were bitten in this manner, [and make a statement without knowing for certain whether or not her husband died].
If [a woman] says, "They filled the house - or the cave - [in which we were hiding] with smoke; he died, but I was saved," her word is not accepted. [It is possible that] just as she [was saved] by a miracle, he could have been [saved by a miracle].<br>If it is a year of famine, and she says: "My husband died," her word is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This law applies even if she says that he died on his bed (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:53). We fear that she left her husband sick, without any source of nurture, and assumed that he died without knowing for certain (<i>Yevamot</i> 114b).</i> [If she says,] "He died and I buried him," her word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous instance, we do not fear that she is lying, but rather merely exaggerating and relying on the likelihood that he died. We do not, however, fear that she would exaggerate and say that she buried him if it were not true.<br>The woman's word is accepted with regard to a famine, while it is not with regard to war, because of the obvious difference between the two instances. In wartime, there is an immediate danger and everyone is worried about saving his own life (<i>Ibid.</i>).</i>
If [a woman] says, "Gentiles - or thieves - attacked us. He was slain, and I was saved," her word is accepted, because it is not common for attackers to kill women.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Yevamot</i> 115a, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 25b) states that the attackers will keep the woman alive in order to rape her. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 25b) explains that a woman is not considered likely to fight back, and her physical weakness arouses mercy. Therefore, she is left alive.</i> Thus, [it is not fitting] to say: Just as she was saved, he was saved.
If an epidemic was raging throughout the world, and [a woman] says, "My husband died," her word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher rules that the woman's word is not accepted. Rabbenu Nissim, moreover, maintains that that is the proper reading in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. Our translation follows the standard printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and the authoritative manuscripts most widely available.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:55) states that the woman's word is accepted, while the Ramah quotes Rabbenu Asher's view.</i> For [there is no widely accepted likelihood] with regard to a plague; everyone knows that in a time of plague some die and some live. And it is possible that strong young men will die from the plague, and elderly infirm people will be saved. And therefore, we do not suspect that she relied on the likelihood that most people died.
It has already been stated<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 12, Halachah 15.</i> that a witness who [did not see evidence of the person's death himself, but who] testifies after hearing the statements of another person is acceptable with regard to [the verification of the death of] a woman's [husband].<br>When does this apply? When the person heard a mentally competent adult - even a servant or a maid -servant - say that so and so died. If, however, a person heard from a mentally incompetent person or from a minor<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">On the basis of <i>Hilchot Yibbum</i> 4:31, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17) and others explain that here the Rambam is talking about a minor who is not intellectually mature. The testimony of a minor who is intellectually mature is accepted (see the following halachah). In the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:13), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the Rambam's wording exactly. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 17:9 and the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 17:33, however, make the above distinction.</i> that an individual died, he may not testify [to that effect], nor do we rely on their statements.
[There is an exception to the above principle.] If a person heard children saying: "We just came from so and so's funeral. These and these many people recited eulogies. The sage so and so and these and these others followed the bier. And this and this is what happened to the bier,"<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 121b explains that all these details are necessary, because it is possible that the children are play-acting and buried an insect that they called by the person's name. If, however, their statements reflect sufficient details to indicate that the funeral actually took place, they may serve as the basis for license to be granted a woman to remarry.</i> the person may offer this as testimony [regarding a man's death], and on this basis permission is granted for [the deceased's] wife to remarry.
When a Jew says, "I killed so and so," [the man's wife] is allowed to remarry on the basis of his testimony. [The rationale is] a person's own testimony cannot be used to incriminate him. [Therefore, he is not disqualified, and] he did testify that [the husband] died.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This is one of the classic examples of the principle <i>palginin diburo,</i> "we divide his statement." I.e., we accept his word with regard to the fact that so and so died. We discard the portion of his statement in which he said that he himself killed him.<br>If we accepted that aspect of the statement as well, he would no longer be acceptable as a witness. For his deed would cause him to be disqualified on the basis of Scriptural law. (See also <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 12:2.)</i>
It has already been stated<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 12, Halachah 16.</i> that statements made by a gentile in the course of conversation can be used as a basis to grant [a woman] permission to remarry.<br>What is implied? If a gentile exclaimed: "How terrible is it that so and so died! He was so nice! He did so much for me!" Or if the gentile was talking and said, "We were traveling on our way, and to our amazement, so and so who was traveling with us fell down and died. We all were amazed that he died so suddenly."

If, however, he makes statements casually, in the course of conversation, we do not suspect that a gentile will desire to cause problems for a Jew (<i>Beit Shmuel</i> 17:38).<br>As reflected in the halachot that follow, we do fear that a gentile may lie, if doing so will enhance his position, and we fear that he will rush to the conclusion that a man died when he is in fact alive.</i> his word is accepted.
When a Jew hears a gentile [say] in the course of conversation [that a man died], he may testify that he heard these statements, and the man's wife may be granted permission to remarry on this basis.<br>When does the above apply? When there is no rationale to explain [why the gentile would make these statements if they were not true]. If, however, there could be a reason for the gentile's statements, and he is making them with another intent in mind [his word is not accepted].<br>For example, [a gentile] told a Jew, "Do such and such for me, or else I will kill you, as I killed so and so,"<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, a gentile says: "I killed so and so," without any apparent intent to cast fear upon his listeners, the deceased's wife is allowed to remarry (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:7).</i> he is not making these statements in the course of conversation, for his intent is to cast fear upon his listener.
Similarly, if a person heard the gentile legal authorities say, "We executed so and so," their word is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, other gentiles relate in the course of conversation that a Jew was killed by gentile legal authorities, their word is accepted (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:14). As indicated by the Ramah, there is a difference of opinion whether it is acceptable if gentile legal authorities report that a person was executed, but do not say that they performed the execution.<br>If gentile government authorities report that a person has died or been killed (but not executed by a court of law), their statements are accepted by many halachic authorities. A distinction should be made between the government authorities in democratic countries where freedom of speech prevails, and totalitarian governments that act arbitrarily without consideration of the populace.</i> For they will use falsehood to reinforce their position and to cast fear [among the populace]. The same applies in all similar instances.
When, at first, a gentile made statements in the course of conversation,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 17:29 states that this law applies even in instances where the gentile's original statements were not sufficient to serve as a basis for remarriage.</i> and afterwards was asked questions [by Jews] until all the details [of the person's death] were disclosed,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the gentile was asked direct questions first, and then in the course of conversation said that a man died, his word is not accepted (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:15).</i> his statements are accepted, and the woman is granted permission to remarry on this basis.

What is implied?

Therefore, even when such a limb is discovered, the woman is required to wait twelve months before remarrying. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) incorporates these concepts into its restatement of the law.</i>
If [a man] fell into a lair of lions, leopards or the like, testimony that he died may not be offered,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, however, the Rambam states that the likelihood that the man died is so great that his heirs may take possession of his inheritance (<i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 7:3).</i> for it is possible that they will not eat him.

Testimony may be offered that he [died].
If we see a man hanging<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word צלוב is translated both as crucified (the method of execution often used by the Romans in the Talmudic period) and as hung. We have chosen the latter term to emphasize the rulings of the later halachic authorities. The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17) rules that if a person is seen hanging, testimony concerning his death may be offered. The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 17:58 and the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 17:94 dispute this and cite instances in which a person who had been hanged was subsequently rescued.</i> and a vulture eating from his body, testimony may not be offered that he died.

[The following laws apply when] one witness testifies, "I saw that he died in a war or in a landslide, or that he drowned in the ocean<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this refers to an instance where the person remained there and watched for an amount of time sufficient for a person to die without seeing the person emerge from the water.

If the witness does not observe the sea, watching for the person to emerge for that length of time, more stringent rules apply.</i> and died," or mentioned other causes that would probably lead to death. If he says, "I buried him," his statements are accepted,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">By saying he buried the deceased, the witness erases any questions of doubt that might exist regarding whether or not the person actually died. Alternatively, because he buried him, he will have seen his features closely and will not mistakenly identify him.<br>As stated in Halachah 3, the testimony of a woman who says that her husband died at war is not accepted, even if she says that she buried him. The commentaries, however, differentiate between the two instances, explaining that since the woman's husband is involved, she will be more emotionally upset and less objective. Hence, it is more likely that she would mistake the deceased's identity.<br>Alternatively, she desires to remarry, and thus she will stretch the truth slightly to be granted that license, while an outsider will not take such liberties.<br>With regard to the concept of burial in relation to a person who drowned, there are three opinions mentioned by the Rabbis:<br>a) The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that if the witness sees that the person did not emerge after waiting the length of time in which one would ordinarily drown, he did not have to bury the deceased in order to testify. (<i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes that this interpretation makes the following halachah appear slightly redundant.)<br>b) The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 17:62 states that the intent was that we saw the corpse after it was taken out from the water.<br>c) The <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> (Volume I, <i>Even HaEzer</i>, Responsum 28) states that the intent is that the drowned man was actually buried. For there are times when a person is taken out of the sea and presumed dead, and then is revived afterwards.</i> and she may be granted permission to remarry. If he did not say, "I buried him," she should not be granted permission to remarry. If, however, she remarries, she need not leave [her second husband].<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 115a states that the question in this instance is whether the testimony of one witness is accepted, because the matter will surely be revealed in the near future - in which case the woman would be permitted to remarry - or because we rely on the fact that the woman will carefully investigate the matter before she remarries, and in this instance, since it is highly likely that her husband died, she will rely on the likelihood and not make a thorough investigation. Therefore, she should not be granted permission to remarry. Since the question is left unresolved, the ruling given by the Rambam applies.<br>In the responsum quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi explains that - as reflected by the concluding halachah of this chapter - the Rambam maintains that the testimony of one witness is accepted, because the matter will surely be revealed in the near future. Nevertheless, he still maintains that, at the outset, the woman should not be granted permission to remarry, because in these situations it is possible for a person to think that a man has died, even though he is actually alive.</i>
Similarly, if one witness<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> emphasizes that the same ruling is given even if two or more witnesses offer the same testimony.

Note also the Rambam's comments in <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 7:3:<br>When a man drowned in water that does not have a defined periphery, witnesses [testify] that they saw him drown, and all traces of him have disappeared, his heirs may take possession of his estate, despite the fact that <i>a priori</i>, his wife is not granted permission to remarry.<br>The reason stringency was taken in these matters is [the severity of] a prohibition punishable by <i>karet</i>.

Even if a gentile said in the course of conversation, "So and so drowned at sea," and on this basis [the man's wife] remarried, she need not be forced to leave her second husband.

Signs that are definitive are effective with regard to the identification of lost objects and other questions of monetary law, as stated in <i>Hilchot Gezelah Va'Avedah</i> 13:3-5. They are not, as stated in this halachah, effective with regard to the laws of marriage and divorce. (See also <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 7:3.) Signs that are extremely definitive - e.g., a <i>get</i> has a hole next to a particular letter, as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 11 - may be relied upon with regard to the laws of marriage and divorce.<br>Similarly, if there is an extremely definitive sign on a corpse, it may be used as evidence to identify the body.

We have chosen to follow the standard printed text in our translation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the proper version should be "if the corpse lies on dry land for hours" - i.e., it need not be identified immediately, but it cannot wait any significant period. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:26) states that the body must be identified immediately after it emerges onto dry land.

[The following rule applies when] we see a person at a distance and he says that he is so and so, the son of so and so, or so and so from a particular place,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17) states that the person must mention both these factors: his father's name and his city. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 17:66 states that, although in general one of these means of identification would have been sufficient, both are necessary because the person's facial features have changed. The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 17:40, however, states that when it is obvious that the person knows the place from which the person came, the ruling of the Rambam and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:23) may be followed, and only one factor need be mentioned. This is also borne out by the following halachah and its source in <i>Yevamot</i> 115b.</i> and that he has been bitten by a snake and is dying. Even if we go [to the place where he was standing], find [the corpse and discover] that its features have changed to the extent that it is no longer distinguishable, we may, nevertheless, [grant license for] his wife [to] remarry.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not assume that the person was lying, but instead suppose that the poison caused his features to change (<i>Meiri</i>).<br><i>Yevamot</i> 122a, the source for this halachah, mentions that perhaps the statements were made by a demon. The Rambam, however, does not mention this possibility, in keeping with his conception (see <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>, Vol. III, Chapter 46), that demons are not a relevant halachic phenomenon.</i>
[A person's testimony is effective in the following instance.] A person came and said: "A court - or people - told me, when you arrive at this and this place,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he was informing the Rabbinical court of that city that one of the Jewish inhabitants had died (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> tell them that Yitzchak, the son of Michael, died." When this person came to that place and delivered the message - although he is not aware of the identity [of the deceased] - since [the people at that place] do know his identity, [the deceased's] wife [may be granted] permission [to remarry]. We do not presume that perhaps it was another person named Yitzchak, the son of Michael, who died.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mention that this principle applies only when we do not know of another person in the city with that name, or we know that this other person is still alive. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:18) incorporates these additions into its statement of this law.</i>
When a Jew and a gentile left from our [location] for a different destination, and the gentile came and said in the course of conversation: "The man who left [this city] with me died," [the deceased's] wife [may be granted license to] remarry. [This applies] even when the gentile does not know the identity of the man, provided he says: "I buried him."<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's ruling is that when a gentile knows the name of a Jew, it is unnecessary for him to say that he buried him, when relating that he died. If, however, the gentile did not know the identity of the Jew, it is necessary for him to say that he buried him.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17) and other authorities do not agree with the Rambam with regard to this point and maintain that the gentile's statements are accepted even when he does not say that he buried the Jew. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:17) mentions both opinions, but appears to favor the latter view.</i>

The Rambam appears to have fused the two stories together, adopting the requirements mentioned by both and thus being more stringent than his source.<br>The <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> reconciles this difficulty by referring to the statement of these incidents in Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's <i>Halachot</i>, which follows a different version from our text of <i>Yevamot</i>.

For our Sages did not speak about establishing stringencies regarding such matters. [Indeed, their approach was characterized by] leniency in order to permit a woman without a husband [to remarry].<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Moreover, even if slight contradictions arise regarding minor points of the testimony of two witnesses, the testimony is nevertheless accepted (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:21).<br>In one of his responsa (quoted by the Ramah, <i>op. cit.</i>), the Rambam writes: "Whoever is stringent and interrogates witnesses exactingly is not conducting himself properly, and his approach does not find favor in the eyes of our Sages." The Ramah, however, continues that if testimony appears contrived to the court, they must thoroughly investigate the matter.</i>
Do not wonder at the fact that our Sages discharged<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., these are leniencies that our Sages instituted. The acceptance of the testimony of one witness, by contrast, is a leniency implied by Scriptural law.<br>This follows the interpretation of the Rambam's statements here by the <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i>, Volume I, Responsa 27 and 33). There is, however, an apparent contradiction based on the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 5:2.</i> the prohibition [against a married woman], which is considered a very severe matter, on the basis of the testimony of a woman, a servant or a maidservant, statements made by a gentile in the course of conversation, a written statement or [testimony] that was not investigated by the ordinary process of interrogation, as we have explained.<br>[These leniencies were instituted] because the Torah requires only testimony of two witnesses, and all the other details of the laws of witnesses with regard to matters that cannot be verified definitively except via witnesses and their testimony - e.g., that one person killed another, or that one person lent money to another. When, by contrast, the matter may be verified definitively without the testimony of a witness, and the witness cannot justify [his statements] if they are not true - e.g, when one testifies that a person died,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the man presumed dead returns, it will be obvious that the witness lied.</i> the Torah did not necessitate [that the requirements of formal testimony be met in these instances]. For it is unlikely that a witness will testify falsely.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">See similar statements in <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 3:14 and <i>Hilchot Yibbum VaChalitzah</i> 4:31.<br>The Ra'avad and others note that our Sages (<i>Yevamot</i> 93b, 115a) mention two rationales why a woman should be permitted to remarry, the one cited by the Rambam and also because of the severe consequences that she will bring upon herself if her husband is found alive (see Chapter 10, Halachah 7), a woman will investigate the matter thoroughly and will not remarry unless she is certain that he has actually died. The Talmud appears to imply that these rationales are contradictory and cites cases in which one would apply, but not the other.<br>The <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) explains that the Rambam sees the two rationales as complementary. Ordinarily, when a matter can easily be verified - e.g., a question of whether or not <i>chalitzah</i> was performed - the statement of one witness is acceptable without question. In this instance, however, it is not always easy to verify whether in fact the man died, and therefore the rationale that the woman must investigate the matter is necessary. For this reason, in all the instances where the Talmud implies that one rationale would conflict with another, the Rambam reaches a conclusion that takes both rationales into consideration.</i><br>For this reason, our Sages [extended] the leniency with regard to this matter and accepted the testimony of a single witness that is based on the testimony of a maidservant, [testimony] from a written document, and [testimony] that was not investigated by the ordinary process of interrogation. [These leniencies were accepted] so that the daughters of Israel will not be forced to remain unmarried.<br>Blessed be the Merciful One, who grants assistance.
