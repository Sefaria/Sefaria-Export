Mishneh Torah, Divorce



Chapter 1
















[When] two [witnesses] sign [the <i>get</i>] and [the husband] transgresses an gives [it] to [his wife] in private or it is found that the witnesses [who saw] the transfer were unsuitable [to be witnesses], the [divorce is still] legally effective, since the witnesses were acceptable and the <i>get</i> has been transferred to her [the wife]. There are some among the Geonim who teach that [the <i>get</i>] is ineffective.

Chapter 10



















Some of the Geonim have taught that any woman with whom [a man] has had sex before witnesses requires a <i>get</i>, [because of] the presumption that a person will not have licentious sex. They extended this principle until it occurred to them to teach that when a person has a child with his maidservant, we take it into consideration and his wife cannot perform <i>yibbum</i> [should the man die childless], lest he had freed the maidservant and after that had sex with her. There are those who teach that [we can assume that] he certainly freed her, because a person will not have licentious sex. All of these rulings stray, in my opinion, from the paths of Torah and it is not appropriate to rely on them. The Sages only used this presumption with regard to [a man's] wife whom he had divorced or [a man] who married a woman conditionally and then had sex with her unconditionally. For indeed she is his wife [in these situations] and with regard to a man's wife we assume that he will not have licentious sex with her unless he explicitly states [that he intends to engage in] licentious sex or if he has sex with a condition. But for other women, [we do not rely on this presumption]. If [a man has sex with] a prostitute, [there is] a presumption that he had sex in the name of licentiousness until such a time as he makes explicit his intention to marry her. Needless to say [this applies with regard to] a maidservant or a non-Jewish woman, because she cannot be married [according to Jewish law] and we do not suspect at all [that he intends to marry her]. The son [that results] from [having sex with these women] is presumed to be a non-Jew or a slave until it is definitively known that his mother was freed or converted.
