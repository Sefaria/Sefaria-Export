Mishneh Torah, Marriage



Chapter 1

Before the giving of the Torah, it would be that if a man happened upon a woman in the marketplace and they wanted to marry each other, he would bring her into his house and consummate the marriage between them privately, and she would be his wife. Once the Torah was given, Israel was commanded that if a man wanted to marry a woman, he would acquire her first through witnesses, and afterwards she would be his wife, as it says, "When a man takes a woman and comes to (sleeps with) her..." (Deuteronomy 22:13).
And taking a wife as such is a positive commandment of the Torah. And a woman is acquired through three means: money, a contract, or through intercourse. Marriage through intercourse and by contract is from the Torah, and by money is Rabbinical [lit. "the words of the Scribes"]. And this acquisition is what is called "Kiddushin" or "Eirusin" in several places. And a woman who is acquired through one of these three means is called a "Mekudeshet" or "Meureset".
And since the woman had been acquired and had been made set apart, even though there was no consummation and she did not enter her husbands house, she is a married woman! And anyone who has intercourse with her, other than her husband, shall be liable for execution by the Jewish court. And if a divorce is sought-after, a bill of divorce is required.
Before the giving of the Torah, a man would meet a woman at the market and, if both of them wanted to, he would give her her wages and have intercourse with her and thereafter be on his way. Such a woman is called a cult-prostitude. Since the giving of the Torah, the cult-prostitude has become forbidden, for it says "There shall be no cult-prostitude among the daughters of Israel". Therefore, if one has intercourse after the manner of prostitution, without a legal and legitimate marriage, he shall receive Torah lashes because he had had intercourse with a prostitute.
All for whom intercourse is forbidden according to the Torah and is punished upon such intercourse with <i>karet</i>, and these are stated in the Torah portion <i>Acharei Mot</i> (Leviticus 16:1), are called <i>Arayot</i> and each one of them is called an <i>Erva</i>. For example, one's mother, sister, daughter, and similar.
There are other women that are forbidden by the received tradition and are forbidden according to Rabbinic law. These are called "seconds" since they are second to the [primary] <i>Arayot</i>. Each one of them is called a "second". There are twenty such women and they are: 1) One's mother's mother, and this has no interruption and even one's mother's mother's mother's mother, upward forever, is forbidden. 2) Ones father's mother’s mother only. 3) One's father's mother, and this has no interruption and even one's father's mother's mother's mother, upward forever, is forbidden. 4) One’s father's father’s mother only. 5) One's father's father’s wife, and this has no interruption and the wife of Jacob our father is forbidden to any one of us. 6) One's father's mother’s wife only. 7) One's father's maternal brother’s wife. 8) One's mother's maternal or paternal brother’s wife. 9) One's son's daughter-in-law, and this has no interruption and even  the daughter-in-law of one’s son’s son’s son’s son, forever, is forbidden; even the wife of any one of us is [forbidden as] a second to Jacob our father. 10) One’s daughter’s daughter-in-law only. 11) One’s son’s daughter’s daughter only. 12) One’s son’s son’s daughter. 13) One’s daughter’s daughter’s daughter only. 14) One’s daughter’s son’s daughter only. 15) One’s wife’s son’s son’s daughter only. 16) One’s wife’s daughter’s daughter’s daughter only. 17) One’s wife’s father’s mother’s mother only. 18) One’s wife’s mother’s father’s mother only. 19) One’s wife’s mother’s mother’s mother only. 20) One’s wife’s father’s father’s mother only. Thus, there are four seconds for which there is no interruption: one’s mother’s mother and upward, one’s father’s mother and upward, one’s father’s father’s wife and upward, and one’s son’s son’s wife and downward.
Intercourse prohibitions according to the Torah for which there is no punishment of <i>karet</i> are called “negative prohibitions”. They are also called “holy prohibitions”. There are nine [such prohibitions] and they are: a widow to a high priest, a divorced woman or <i>zona</i> or <i>ḥalala</i> to a high priest or to an ordinary priest, a <i>mamzeret</i> to an Israelite man, an Israelite woman to a <i>mamzer</i>, an Israelite woman to an Ammonite or Moabite man, an Israelite woman to one with crushed [genitals], or severed [genitals], one’s ex-wife after she has remarried, one’s <i>yevama</i> who married a stranger while still under the <i>yavam</i>’s control. A <i>ḥalutza</i> is like a divorced woman and is forbidden to a priest according to Rabbinic law. The Gibeonites are like <i>mamzerim</i>, whether male or female, and they are prohibited according to Rabbinic law. The Gibeonites will be explained in the Laws of Forbidden Intercourse.
There are some intercourse prohibitions [that are inferred] from a positive commandment and are not among the negative prohibitions. There are three of them: a first or second generation male or female Egyptian or Edomite, and a non-virgin to a high priest. Since it is not written regarding these that “one may not come” or “one may not take”, but rather [concerning an Egyptian or Edomite] “they may join the congregation of God in the third generation” (Deuteronomy 23:9), you may infer that first and second generation [Egyptians and Edomites] are forbidden to join [the congregation of God]; and since it is stated [concerning a high priest] “he must marry a virgin” (Leviticus 21:13) you may infer that [a high priest] may not marry a non-virgin. And a negative prohibition that is inferred from a positive commandment has the status of a positive commandment.

Chapter 2

A girl from the day of her birth until twelve complete years of age is called a minor and is [also] called a child. And even if she has grown several hairs within this time, they are merely like a mole. But if she has grown two hairs below on her body in places known for hair growth, and she is [at least] twelve years and one day old or more, she is called a young woman.
The growth of two hairs during this time is called the “lower sign”. After the appearance of the lower sign, she is called a young woman for the next six complete months. And from the day beginning the conclusion of [these] six months and afterwards, she is called a woman of age. The length of time between becoming a young woman and a woman of age is only six months.
Once she reaches twelve years and one day old and has not grown two hairs, even though signs of barrenness have appeared in her, she is still considered a minor until she is twenty years old. And from the time she grows two hairs, even during the twentieth year, she is called a young woman for the next six months. Afterwards, she is called a woman of age.
If she was twenty years old less thirty days and has not grown two hairs, and there has appeared in her (all) the signs of a barrenness, she is considered a barren woman. But if there has not appeared in her (all) the signs of barrenness, she is still considered a minor until she grows two hairs or until she is thirty-five years and one day old.
If she has reached this age [of thirty-five] and has not grown two hairs, she is called a barren woman, even though there has not appeared in her a sign of barrenness. You may thus infer that a barren woman does not have any days of young-womanhood but rather, passes immediately from the status of a minor to that of a woman of age.
These are the signs of barrenness: if she does not have breasts, or feels pain during intercourse, or does not have a sloped abdomen as women do, or who has a deep voice that cannot be distinguished between a man or woman. A young woman, woman of age, and barren woman are each considered an adult.
A girl may have certain signs in the upper [parts of her body] and these are called the “upper signs”. And they are: when she can stretch her hand behind her and a fold forms (near the breasts), or when the nipple darkens, or when one presses a hand on the nipple and it sinks and delays returning, or when the protrusion of the breast splits off and forms a small ball, whereas my Rabbis explained when the protrusion itself splits off, or when the breasts tilt away, or when the breasts [are large enough] to be shaken, or when the crown is formed, which is the fatty tissue above the genitals near the abdomen, or when this tissue softens and is no longer hard.
These [upper] signs are thus eight in number. If in a girl appeared one of these [upper] signs or all of them and she is twelve years old or less, we ignore them and she is [still] considered a minor. When she turns twelve years and one day old and there appeared in her a lower sign, then we ignore any of these [upper signs]. If there has not appeared in her a lower [sign] but there has appeared in her one of these [upper signs], then there is a doubt as to whether she is a considered a young woman or a minor and we judge her in a stringent manner. And if there has appeared in her all of these [upper signs] but no lower sign, then she is considered a definite adult, since it is impossible that all of the [upper signs] would appear unless the lower sign already appeared but fell off.
A girl that gave birth after twelve years of age, even though she has not brought forth any signs whether lower or upper, is considered as an adult. Childbirth is considered like signs.
A boy from birth until thirteen years of age is called a minor and is [also] called a child, and even if he has brought forth several hairs during this time, it is not a sign but a mole. Once he brings forth two hairs below in the places known for hair growth, and he is thirteen and one day old or more, then he is called an a adult and is [also] called a man.
If he has reached this age [thirteen and one day] but has not brought forth two hairs, even though there has appeared within him signs of impotence, he is considered a minor until twenty years less thirty days in age. When he has reached this time but has not brought forth two pubic hairs, nor has he brought forth two hairs in the beard, if there appears within him one of the signs of impotence, then he is considered an impotent man and has the status of an adult for all matters. But if there has not appeared within him signs of impotence, then he is still considered a minor until he brings forth two hairs below in the proper place or until he is thirty-five years and one day old.
If he has reached this age [thirty-five and one day] but has not brought forth [two pubic hairs], he is considered an impotent man even though there has not appeared within him one of the signs of impotence. If he reaches twenty years less thirty days in age but has not brought brought forth two pubic hairs but has brought forth two hairs in the beard, then even if there has formed within him one of the signs of impotence, he is not considered an impotent man. Rather he is still considered a minor until there appears within him all the signs of impotence or if he reaches thirty-five and one day in age.
These are the signs of impotence: any man who does not have a beard, or his hair is defective, or his skin is smooth, or his urine does not release foam, or when he urinates he does not make an arch, or his semen has a thin consistency, or his urine does not ferment, or when he washes in the rainy season his skin does not release steam, or his voice is defective and cannot be distinguished between a man or woman.
This type of impotent man is called “impotent by the sun” in all places. But a boy whose member or testicles were severed or crushed, as is done by the idolaters, is called “impotent by man”. And when he turns thirteen years and one day old, he is considered an adult since he will never bring forth a sign.
A thirteen year and one day old boy that has not brought forth a lower sign but there has appeared within him all the upper signs is in doubt between an adult and a minor. If he has not been checked for lower [signs], then once there appears within him upper signs of adulthood, he is considered an adult.

Chapter 3

How is a woman sanctified (for engagement)? If one choses to do so with money (or its equivalent), it can not have less than the value of a "Peruta". He says to her, "Behold, you are sanctified to me", "Behold, you are engaged to me", "Behold, with this, you are to be my wife", and he gives her the object in front of witnesses. The man must be the one to say words that have the meaning of an acquisition, and it must be he that is giving her the money. 
If she gives the money and says, "I am sanctified to you", "I am engaged to you", "I am a wife to you" or any other acquisition term, she is not sanctified. So too if she gives the money and he speaks, she is not sanctified. If he gives and she speaks, this is a questionable sanctification.
If he sanctified with a document, he writes it on  paper or clay or of earth, or on anything he desires. "Behold, you are sanctified to me", "Behold, you are engaged to me" and so on (other terms), and gives her the document in front of witnesses.

Chapter 10

An engaged woman (arusa) is forbidden to her husband by rabbinic law so long as she is in her father's house. He [the husband] who sleeps with his fiancee in his father-in-law's house is lashed for rebellion (against rabbinic decrees). Even if he engaged her (kiddushin) through sexual intercourse, he is nevertheless forbidden from sleeping with her in her father's house until he brings her into his house and is alone with her and separates her for himself. This seclusion is the stage of "chuppa" and it is "nisuin" for all intents and purposes. One who sleeps with his finacee for the sake of nisuin after kiddushin is married to her in all regards after the initial stage of intercourse (penetration).

Chapter 11













There are Geonim who teach that for the <i>bogeret</i>, she cannot claim [that she did not have hymenal] bleeding but she can claim that [her vaginal] channel was opened. This ruling does not appear to go along with the Gemara. There were mistakes in their version of the text. I have already examined many texts, including early [texts], and I found that the matter is [correctly read] as we have explained, that the only claim a <i>bogeret</i> [can make is that she did not have hymenal] bleeding.

Chapter 12


















There are Geonim who teach that we should not apportion maintenance to a woman whose husband went overseas or died until she produces a <i>ketubah</i> document. If she does not produce a <i>ketubah</i> document, she does not receive maintenance, lest she [already] received her <i>ketubah</i> from her husband or waived her <i>ketubah</i> to him, so that she should not received maintenance, as will be explained. There are others who teach that we determine her maintenance on the presumption that she did not receive [payment from her husband] or waive [payment]. [Therefore,] she needn't bring [forth] her <i>ketubah</i>. I incline toward [the latter] with regard [to a woman] whose husband left, since her [claim to] maintenance [comes from] the Torah [itself]. But if her husband died, she is not [entitled to] maintance until she brings her <i>ketubah</i>, because she receives maintenance due to an enactment of the rabbis. Additionally, [her maintenance] is pained from the property of [the husband's] heirs, and [a court] always [privileges] claims of heirs.

Chapter 13



Chapter 14














[There are] Geonim who say that they have in Babylonia different customs regarding the <i>moredet</i>. These customs have not spread through the majority of [the people] Israel and rabbis and great [thinkers] differ in many places. Thus, it is appropriate to follow and rule according to the law [as stated in] the Gemara.

Chapter 15


Men are obligated in procreation (periyya u-reviyya), but not women.  When is a man obligated in this mitzva?  From the age of seventeen.  Once he reaches [the age of] twenty years and has not married, he has transgressed and neglected a positive commandment.  However, if he is involved in Torah and engrossed in it, and he fears that if he marries, he will have to busy himself with supporting a wife and thereby come to neglect Torah study, then it is permissible for him to delay [marriage]; for one who is involved in a mitzva is exempt from another mitzva – all the more so regarding Torah study.
One who is in love with Torah and studies it and cleaves into it always, as Ben Azzai did, commits no sin thereby. That is, providing his sexual desire does not get the better of him. If it does, he is required to marry even if he already has children, in order that he not come to thoughts of sin.















Thus the Sages commanded: A man should honor his wife more than himself and love her as himself.  If his money abounds, according to what he can afford.  He should not inspire excess fear in her, and he should speak gently with her, and be neither depressed nor hot-tempered.
Thus the Sages commanded: A woman should honor her husband too much, and have awe of him, do all of her actions according to his word.  He should seem to her like a minister or king, walking in the desires of his heart, and distancing herself from what he hates.  This is how holy and pure Jews behave in their marriages.  These paths should be their pleasant and praiseworthy lifestyle.

Chapter 22






The Geonim taught that the woman who becomes ill and requests that her husband divorce her and that she will go without her ketubah, in order that he shouldn't inherit from her, we do not listen to her. Even if she says, "I hate him, and I no longer want to be with him," we do not listen to her, and she is not judged according to the law of the <i>moredet</i>. This is an appropriate ruling.

Chapter 24



Chapter 25



Some of the Geonim taught that what the Sages said indicating that [a husband] may check [concerning his wife] with his relatives does not [mean] only his relatives alone but even to [other] people he knows. Even if he was living in a city without a relative, if there is [in that city] a bathhouse, he cannot bring a legal claim, because it is impossible that he has no friends [there] and he ask one of his friends to have his wife or sister check [the appearance] of such-and-such [woman that he wants to marry]. Therefore, the presumption is that he has heard [of any blemish] and accepted [it]. It does not appear to me that such a ruling [is correct], as no man will reveal all that is in his heart in these matters to [people who are] not his relatives. And furthermore, he will rely only on the words of his relatives.
