Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars



Chapter 1

Three precepts Israel, were enjoined to fulfill after having entered the land of Canaan, viz :— 1. To appoint a king; for it is said: <i>Thou shalt set in any wise a king over thee</i>, (Deut. 17. 15). 2. To exterminate the offspring of Amalek, for it is said: <i>Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek</i>, etc., (Deut. 25. 19). 3. To erect the temple, for it is said : <i>Unto His habitation shall you seek, and thither thou shalt come</i>, (Deut. 12. 5). 
The election of a king preceded the war with Amalek; for it is Said: <i>The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king</i>, (I Sam. 15. 1). <i>Go and smite Amalek</i>, etc., (I Sam. 15. 3). The destruction of the offspring of Amalek preceded the erection of the temple; for it is said: <i>And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies, that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, I dwell in a house of Cedar</i>, etc., (II Sam. 7. 1). Such being the case, the appointment of a king being a divine institution, why was the Lord displeased when they desired a king? because their desire was only a mere subterfuge. They did not wish for a king with the intention of accomplishing the Lord’s command; but because they disliked the just government of Samuel, for it is said: <i>For they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me</i>, (I Sam. 8. 7). 
No king can be elected except by a tribunal of seventy elders, in conjunction with a prophet; as Joshua, whom Moses and his conclave had appointed; and Saul and David whom Samuel the Ramathi and his conclave had installed. 


We do not deem eligible to royalty or to the high priest office, either a butcher or a barber, or the keeper of a bath or a tanner, not that they are morally incapacitated to such dignities, but owing to their being engaged in vulgar trades, the people would always treat them with contempt, though they had been in the specified trades only one day, they are considered disqualified to the stated dignities. 
 When a king is installed, he is anointed with the anointing oil; for it is said: <i>Samuel took a vial with oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him,</i> (I Samuel 10. 1) When a king was anointed, he and his family had a permanent claim to the kingdom; because royalty is inheritable; for it is said: <i>To the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children in the midst of Israel,</i> (Deut. 17. 20). If on his demise he leaves a son who is a minor, then we guard the kingdom for him until he is grown up; as <i>Jehojuda acted in regard to Yoash,</i> (Kings 11). Whoever is entitled to the precedence in common inheritances has the same privilege in reference to the inheritance of the kingdom; the senior son has the preference to the junior. This law of inheritance is not only in force with regard to royalty, but also in respect of all other dignities and appointments in Israel; the said offices always descend permanently to the son and grandson in succession, provided the son be competent to fill his fathers’ place in respect to both capacity and moral worth. If he be equal to his parent in moral worth but not in wisdom, then we admit him to the dignity of the father, and instruct him afterwards. But he who is impious though he possesses a great amount of wisdom, still we do not grant him admission to any office in Israel. When David was anointed he had attained to the crown of royalty, and the kingdom belonged to him and to his male offspring for ever; for it is said: <i>Thy throne shall be established for ever,</i> (II Sam. 7.16). But royalty was only promised to his pious descendants; for it is said: <i>If thy children keep my covenant,</i> (Psalm 132. 12). Though the kingdom was originally only promised to David’s pious offspring, still the Lord assured him that it will never be entirely withdrawn from his family; for it is said: <i>If his children forsake my laws and walk not in my judgment, then will I visit their transgressions with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes; nevertheless my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him,</i> (Psalm 89. 31).
If a prophet had raised a king from any of the other tribes of Israel, and that king walked in the path traced out by the law, and fought the wars of the Lord, then he was established as king and was entitled to all the privileges of royalty: even the kingdom might descend to his offspring, although that of David was entitled to the chief kingdom. For when Achiah invested Yerobeom with royalty, the prophet addressed him: <i>And it shall be thou wilt hearken, that I will build thee a sure house, as built for David,</i> (I Kings 11. 38). Ahayah further said: <i>To his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem.</i>
The kings of the house of David will permanently exist; for it is said: <i>Thy throne shall be established for ever,</i> (2 Sam. 7. 16). But if a king should arise from another tribe of Israel, his kingdom would not continue in his family for ever, for it was said to Jerabean <i>but not for ever,</i> (I Kings 11. 39). 
Kings of the other tribes of Israel (besides Juda) are not anointed with the anointing oil, but with Aparsemon oil; (and this only when there is a dispute about the succession), neither can a king be appointed over Jerusalem, except the same is a descendant from David; neither is any one else anointed for royalty, but the offspring of David.
The ceremony of anointing the king of the house of David has to take place near a well. 
We do not anoint a king if he be the son of a king, except there is a contest or a war about the succession, then we anoint him to silence all opposition. For that very reason was Solomon anointed because his brother Adonyiah was a pretender; likewise Joash was anointed on account of Athaliah's opposition, and Jehoachaz on account of his brother Jeyohakin aspiring to the same dignity.

Chapter 2

The greatest homage is due to a king; and we are even bound to impress every one with this fear and reverence; for it is said: <i>Thou shalt set in any wise a king over thee,</i> (Deut. 17. 15); which means his fear shall be upon thee. One must not ride upon his horse, neither sit on his throne, nor handle his scepter, nor use his crown, nor any of his furniture. On his demise all his furniture and personal ornaments are to be burnt, and his riding horse is to be lamed; neither can any of his slaves or servants be used by any one else, except by another king.
But the consort of the king could never be married to any one else; even a king could not marry the widow or the divorced wife of another king. 
 The king when naked must not be seen by any one, nor when bathing, or when being clipped; neither can he perform the ceremony of chaliza, because it is said: (ibid) <i>She shall spit out before him,</i> (Deut. 25. 2); which would be an affront to him, even if he be willing to go through that ceremony, we do not allow it; because a king who wishes to forego his dignity is not at liberty to do so; and since he cannot perform the ceremony of chaliza, he also is disqualified from the Yeboom (marrying the childless widow of a deceased brother); likewise since the childless dowager queen cannot be married by the king’s brother, she cannot perform the chalizah; but she has to abide continually in her widowed condition. 
If any one of his family die, he must not quit his palace to follow the funeral. At the funeral meal all the people sit on the ground, but he sits on a sofa: when a king had entered the court of the temple, if he be a descendant of David he could sit down; there was none else allowed to sit in that sacred place but the kings of David’s family; for it is said: <i>Then went David in and sat before the Lord,</i> (II Samuel 7. 18). 
The king is obliged to have daily his beard clipped or trimmed; also to be always dressed becoming his royal state; for it is said: <i>Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty,</i> (Isaiah 33. 17). He had to sit in his palace on his throne and wear a crown. The people were obliged to appear before him whenever he summoned them. On appearing before him they had to stand and bow to the ground and do obeisances, even a prophet had to observe the same decorum; for it is said: <i>And they told the king saying, behold Nathan the prophet! and when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground,</i> (I Kings 1. 23). But the high-priest need not appear before the king, except it were his own wish to do so; neither need he stand before the king, on the contrary the king has to stand before the high-priest; for it is said: <i>And he (Joshua) shall stand before Eleasar the priest,</i> (Numbers 27. 21). Nevertheless it is proper for the high-priest to respect the king, and cause him to be seated, and to stand when he appears before him. The king is only enjoined to stand before the high-priest on the occasion of his enquiring through the high-priest of the oracle of the Urim and Thumim. The king is likewise enjoined to honor students of the law, and when the Sanhedrin or other scholars of Israel come before him, he ought to rise before them and cause them to be seated next to him. Thus Josaphet king of Judah acted, he used to rise from his throne before any scholar and kiss him and styled him <i>My Lord and instructor.</i> But such condescension is only allowed whilst the king is in his palace and among his servants; but publicly in the presence of the people he must not evince such courtesy, he must not rise before any one, nor speak gently to an individual, nor denominate any one otherwise than by his name, so that his fear be impressed upon every one. 
In the same measure as scripture has accorded to the king such a great latitude of deference and immunities, and bound every one to evince their homage and loyalty to him, even so it enjoins him to be in his heart humble, meek and feeble, for it is said: <i>My heart is wounded within me,</i> (Psalm 109. 22), and not manifest an overbearing spirit against Israel more than is needed, for it is said: <i>That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren,</i> (Deut. 17. 20). He shall be gracious and merciful to both little and great; he shall take an interest in their affairs and endeavour to promote their prosperity; he shall always be mindful of the respect due even to the most humble. When he addresses himself to the public, then he shall speak in a gentle way; for it is said: <i>“Hear me my brethren and my people,</i> (I Chronicles 28. 2); and further: <i>“If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day,”</i> (I Kings 12. 7). He shall always conduct himself with the utmost humility; there is none superior to our teacher Moses, and he expressed himself on the occasion when Israel were murmuring against him about their provisions beginning to fail, in a humble manner, saying: <i>And what are we, your murmurings, they are not against us but against the Lord,</i> (Exodus 16. 8). He bore patiently their troubles, burthens, murmurings and provocations like a nurse bears with a suckling. Scripture denominates the king shepherd; for it is said: <i>To feed Jacob his people,</i> (Psalm 78. 71). The task of a shepherd is delineated in Scripture, for it is said: <i>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: He shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom,”</i> (Isaiah 40. 11).  

Chapter 3

At the time when the king is established in his kingdom, he is bound to write a scroll of the law for himself, besides that which his forfathers have left him. This copy is to be corrected by the scroll in the court of the temple, under the superintendence of the great tribunal consisting of seventy-one members. In case his parents left not any copy of the law, then he is obliged to write two copies; the one he puts in his treasury, which copy he is enjoined to possess as well as any other individual of Israel; but the second copy must never be removed from him, except he enters a place which is not fit for reading therein, as a bath, etc. etc. If he go forth to war it must accompany him, when he comes back it must be with him; when he sits in judgment he must have it near him; when he sits down it must be in his front, for it is said: <i>It shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life, </i>(Deut. 17. 19).  
 He must not multiply wives; by inference they have learned that he is permitted to marry altogether eighteen wives and concubines. If he married one more and had conjugal intercourse with her, he incurred the penalty of the thirty-nine stripes and is compelled to divorce her.  
 He must not multiply horses, only sufficient for his chariots, even one single horse not wanted and only for the purpose to run before him, as was the fashion with other kings was interdicted; and if he purchased one superfluous horse he is liable to the chastisement stated above.  
He must not accumulate silver and gold for the purpose of hoarding it up in his treasury, for mere display, or even for his own enjoyment; only so much he is permitted to procure as is required for maintaining his troops and remunerating his servants. All wealth he does lay up in the treasuries of the temple, to be devoted to public wants, and to defray the expenses of war is considered a God-pleasing act: he is only prohibited from storing up superfluous riches for his personal comfort and aggrandisement; any contravention of that prohibition would render him amenable to the above-mentioned infliction, etc., etc.; for it is said: <i>He shall not multiply silver and gold,</i> (Deut. 17. 17).   
 A king is prohibited from drinking wine to excess, that might cause intoxication; for it is said: <i>It is not for kings to drink wine, </i>(Prov. 31. 4); but his time both day and night ought to be devoted to study the law, and to promoting the public well being; for it is said:<i> It (the law) shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life, </i>(Deut. 17. 19).  
 He shall not be addicted to women even if he had only one wife, he should not be uxorious like other dotards; for it is said: <i>Do not give thy strength to women,</i> (Prov. 31. 3). The law is particularly anxious about his heart not being led astray; for it is said: <i>That his heart turn not away,</i> (Deut. 17. 17). His heart is comparatively considered the heart of the whole nation, therefore the law desires him to be constantly attached to the study of the law, more than any other individual of Israel; for it is said: <i>all his lifetime,</i> (Deut. 17. 19).
 We have already stated that the kings of the house of David are summoned to judgment, and evidence may be given against them; but not so the kings from other tribes of Israel, owing to their heart being inflated with pride we apprehend that they might not submit to judgment, which might lead to mischief and eventually be prejudicial to our law, therefore our sages decreed that kings of Israel cannot be summoned before justice, nor can they sit in judgment; neither would we receive any evidence against them, nor would we ever accept their evidence.  
Whosoever is found rebelling against the king has forfeited his life, and the king has the power to sentence him to death at once. Even if the king should command an individual to proceed to a certain place, and he did not do so, or he was prohibited from leaving his house, and acted against it, he is guilty of death; and if the king wishes he can sign the death warrant at once; for it is said: <i>Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thee, shall be put to death,</i> (Joshua 1. 18). Likewise, whosoever despiseth or affronts him, he is empowered to doom to death at once; as the instance of Simei, the son of Gera, (I Kings 2. 8). But he cannot sentence to any other death but to being beheaded with the sword. He is also empowered to send any refractory person to prison and condemn him to flogging; but he cannot dispossess any one of his property, by declaring it free property; and if he should do so, it is considered depredation. 
He who contravenes the mandate of a king, owing to, having been engaged in performing a Divine precept, even a slight one, is exempt from penalty, because the obedience to the Divine precept supersedes the mandate of the king. Much more, if the king should command to break a Divine precept, that we must not obey him.  
Whoever has committed murder, but there is no clear evidence to prove it, or he, the perpetrator, was not warned, or only one witness testifies to the crime, or one slew a person unwittingly, but he was an enemy of the murdered person, in all such cases the king has the power to sentence to death, for the maintenance of the public welfare, according as the time requires it. He may doom to death a multitude of people and order them to be hung, and leave even their carcasses upon the gibbet in order to strike terror into the hearts of the evildoers, and to break the power of the malicious. 

Chapter 4

The King is empowered to levy taxes upon the people for the purpose of defraying his own expenses, or expenses incurred by war; and it is forbidden eluding the taxes. He can even enact that whoever steals or embezzles the taxes, his property shall be confiscated, or be sentenced to death, for it is said: <i>And you shall be his servants,</i> (I Samuel 8. 17) and it is also said: <i>They shall be tributary to thee, and shall serve thee,</i> (Deut. 20. 11) from which we infer (by the rule of similar terms) that the king may impose taxes; and all the laws he enacts regarding such matters are all valid; whatever is stated in the section referring to the denomination of a king, he can claim it as his privilege.  
 He has the power to send out in all the coasts of Israel, a press-gang to force all the mighty and valiant men into his service, both of his body guard and of his horsemen; also to pick out some of them to attend on him, and to run before his chariots, for it is said: <i>He will appoint them for his chariots, and to be his horsemen, and some shall run before his chariots,</i> (I Sam. 8. 11). He may also select the most handsome of them and appoint them as his own servants; for it is said: <i>And your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.</i>  
 He may also press every artificer to work for him provided he remunerates him for his work; likewise he can seize the animals and servants of his subjects to use them for his work, but he has to pay for them; for it is said: <i>And will set them to ear his ground, to reap his harvests, and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots; and he will take your men servants and maid servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses and put them to his work,</i> (I Sam. 8. 12). 
He likewise can choose from among his subjects, any female he pleases to be his wife or his concubine; wives are married by drawing up a marriage contract, and solemnizing the marriage ceremony; but concubines need not the mentioned formalities; they can, by means of conjugal intercourse, be acquired; but this way of acquiring concubines is only permitted to him.  
 He can likewise compel those who are able, to become captains in his army, and to appoint them captains over thousands and captains over fifty; for it is said: <i>And he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifty,</i> (I Sam. 8. 12).  
 He may also take the fields and oliveyards and vineyards for the use of his servants when they go forth to war, viz.: when they go about foraging, etc., and can obtain nothing else, they may seize the produce belonging to the Israelitish subjects, but the king has to restitute the damage; for it is said: <i>He will take your fields, vineyards and oliveyards, even the best, and give them to his servants,</i> (I Sam. 8. 14).  
 He can equally claim the tithes of all lands, trees and cattle; for it is said: <i>He will take the tenth of your seed of your vineyards, and also the tenth of your sheep,</i> (I Sam. 8. 15). 
 The king who is anointed takes the thirteenth part of all the countries which the Israelites conquer, this privilege is permanent to him and his offspring.  
 All those who were condemned to death by the sentence of the king, their property reverts to him. All the kingdoms he conquers, the royal treasury found there belongs to him, and all the other spoil must also be handed over to him; of which he is entitled to the half, and the other half is equally shared out among the warriors and the people who were left during the battle in the camp to take charge of all materials left there; for it is said: <i>But as his part is who goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff they shall part alike, </i>(I Sam. 30. 24).  
All the country which he conquers is his, and he is at liberty to bestow upon his servants and upon the warriors what he pleases, and can keep to himself what he wishes. All the laws he enacts concerning such affairs are valid. But in all such matters his proceedings should be calculated to please the Lord; his chief aim ought to be to promote the law of truth and propagate righteousness in the world, to break the powers of the wicked and fight the battles of the Lord; because a king was originally elected for the sole purpose of doing justice and waging war; for it is said: <i>That our king may judge us, and fight our battles, </i>(I Sam. 8. 20).

Chapter 5

A king was originally not allowed to engage in any aggressive, war except it was enjoined; as the war against the seven nations dwelling in Canaan, that against Amalek, or to defend Israel against an enemy who molests them; but subsequently he may also wage voluntary war for the purpose of enlarging the coasts of Israel; also for his own aggrandizement and repute.  
 For waging an enjoined war the king needs not ask the great council (called Beth Din) for permission; and whenever he wishes, he can coerce the people to follow him to the war, but in a voluntary war he cannot lead forth the people to battle, except he was previously authorised by the great council (consisting of seventy one members).  
 He has the power to pull down everything which blocks up the way over which he wishes to lead his soldiers to war, and none has a right to oppose him. The road which a king can require has no limit, as much space as he wants he may take. He need not walk on a crooked path, or a round about way, owing to the vineyards or the fields of any one; but he can cut short and form a straight thoroughfare when he leads his warriors forth to battle. 
 It is an affirmative precept to exterminate the seven nations mentioned in the Pentateuch, and whoever spared any one of them trespasses a negative command; for it is said: <i>Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth;</i> but every trace of those nations has long ago disappeared.  

 All the countries the Israelites have subdued under a king with the authority of the great council are considered a public conquest, and like the land of Israel conquered by Joshua, in every respect; provided they were conquered subsequent to the entire subduing of the land of Israel mentioned in the Pentateuch.  
 

An Israelite is prohibited from quitting the land of Canaan except for the purpose of studying the law, or marrying, or for taking proceedings by law against a gentile who lives out of the Holy Land; but after having achieved his purpose he is bound to return; also for the sake of business he may quit it; but not for settling entirely in any other country. However, if there should be a famine in the Holy Land, so much so that provisions rise at the rate of one to two, then he may settle in another country. When is the stated restriction in force? In the case that the scarcity is only prevailing in the provisions, but there is no lack in pecuniary means; but if the reverse, though provisions are cheap there is still penury prevailing owing to a stagnation in business, then he may quit the country at once and settle wherever he can procure a livelihood. However, though under the stated circumstances it is permitted to quit the Holy Land, it is not the way of piety to do so; because Machlon and Kilian were eminent men of their age, and quitted the Holy Land only through great distress, and still they were doomed by the Lord to extermination. 
 Great sages used actually to kiss the frontiers of the Holy Land, and literally embraced its dust; for it is said: <i>Thy servants take pleasure in its stones and favor the dust thereof.</i>  
The sages have taught, whoever dwells in the Land of Israel, his sins are pardoned; for it is said: <i>And the inhabitant shall not say I am sick, the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity,</i> (Isaiah 33. 24). Even if he had only walked therein so much as four cubits he will attain to future life, likewise he who is buried therein has atonement of his sins; just as if the ground were an altar for atonement; for it is said: <i>his land will make an atonement for his people,</i> (Deut. 32. 43). But when Scripture speaks of punishments it said, “upon a defiled land shalt thou die.” It is more beneficial if one enters the country alive, than when conveyed there after death. Nevertheless the sages used to convey their dead to the Holy Land, as for instance, our ancestors Jacob and Joseph the pious.  
Man ought rather always to live in the Holy Land, though it were in a town chiefly inhabited by gentiles, than to live out of the land though in a city mostly inhabited by Jews. Whoever quits the Holy Land to settle in another country is comparatively considered as if he were worshiping idols; for it is said: <i>For they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying go serve other Gods;</i> (I Sam. 26. 19). As a punishment it is said: <i>neither shall they enter into the land of Israel;</i> (Ezekiel 13. 9). As well as it is prohibited quitting the Holy Land for another country; even so is it prohibited quitting Babylon for another country, for it is said: <i>They shall be carried to Babylon and there shall they be, saith the Lord.</i> (Jeremiah 27.  22). 

Chapter 6

We must not wage war with any person except we had previously offered peace. It matters not whether it be a voluntary or an enjoined war; for it is said: <i>When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it, </i>(Deut. 20. 10). If they peacefully reply we do not slay a soul, but they must be tributary; for it is said: <i>They shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee;</i> (Deut. 20. 11). If they accept the condition of being tributary, but not of servitude, or <i>vice versa,</i> we do not entertain their treaty except they accept both. The servitude consists in being always submissive and subordinate to Israel, and never attempting to make head against them. The tribute consists in always serving the king, both with their body and their means; as in building walls, in erecting fortresses, also in building the king’s palace; for it is said: <i>This is the reason of the levy which King Solomon raised, for to build the house of the Lord and his own house and méllo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and all the cities of store that Solomon had. All the people that were left of the Amarites, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day, </i>(I Kings 9. 15).  

 When they have accepted the stated conditions, it is prohibited to deal treacherously with them.  
In the event that they should not be willing to make peace but prove hostile, then we are allowed to make war with them and put to the sword the men, and spoil their money and little ones; but women and children must not be slain; for it is said: <i>Women and little ones, </i>(Deut. 20. 14); this term “little ones” alludes to the males. To which wars refer these laws? To a voluntary war with other nations; but regarding the seven nations and Amalek who have not applied to us for peace, we dare not spare a soul, for it is said: <i>But of the cities thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth,</i> (Deut. 20. 16); likewise it is said of Amalek: <i>Thou shalt blot out Amalek, </i>(Deut. 25. 19). Whence can we infer that scripture speaks only of such who had not negotiated for peace? For it is said: <i>there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hevites the inhabitants of Gibeon, all the other they took in battle. For it was of the Lord, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly,</i> (Joshua 11. 19), from which is to be inferred that the Israelites offered peace to them.  
 Three missives Joshua sent to the inhabitants of Canaan previous to his invading their land. In the first he apprised them that whoever wishes to leave the country is at liberty to do so; in the second he invited them to make peace; in the third he declared war. Such being the case why needed the inhabitants of Gibeah use a stratagem for obtaining peace since they might have done so in a straightforward way? Because the offer of peace was made to the country at large, which apparently had no desire for it; therefore the inhabitants of Gibeah thought, that they had also forfeited this advantage, since the country at large did not embrace it; but they were mistaken in the laws of Israel; according to which the Israelite would have granted peace to a single town as well. The reason that the rulers of the Israelites were so provoked against these Gebeonites, that they were inclined to put them all to the sword, if it had not been for their oath, was because they entered with them into a treaty; this was against the law, that enjoins, <i>thou shalt not make a covenant with them.</i> They would have been subject to being tributary and to servitude as stated above, and since the Gibeonites misled the rulers and extorted the oath from them by fraud, the former had incurred the penalty of death; had it not been that the latter would not give the least appearance of trespassing an oath though sworn in error, which might still amount to profanation of the holy name.  
 The nations Amon and Moab we do not invite to peaceful negotiation, for it is said: <i>Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever, </i>(Deut. 23. 7). On which our sages observed, because it is written: <i>Thou shalt proclaim peace unto it,</i> (Deut. 20. 10.); we might have presumed that Amon and Moab come under the same category; therefore scripture enjoins thou shalt not seek them, etc. However, though we are enjoined not to make any peaceful offer to them, still, if they should come forward and ask for peace of their own accord, we are bound to grant it.  
 When we besiege a town we must not invest it from its four sides; but we must leave one side free so that the inhabitants may escape if they should choose, for it is said: <i>and they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses, </i>(Numbers 31. 7); from which the sages learned by tradition that they were enjoined the mentioned precept. 
 We must not cut down fruit trees which grow out of the country, where the war takes place. Nor may we withhold from them a well, so that the trees should decay; for it is said: <i>Thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof, </i>(Deut. 20. 19). Whoever cuts down trees incurs the penalty of thirty-nine stripes. It is not only prohibited in a siege, but wheresoever a person should cut down trees with the intention of causing damage, he incurs the stated penalty. But we may cut them down when they injure other trees, or other fields, or the value of the wood is very great; the law only prohibits it if it is done in the way of destruction.  
 All wild trees are allowed to be cut down, though we do not want them; likewise, fruit trees which fell into decay and produce only a small quantity of fruit, so that it is not worth the trouble, may be cut down. What quantity must the olive tree produce when it must not be cut down? The fourth of a kab. And a date tree which produces a kab of dates must also not be cut down.  
 Not only trees are interdicted to be destroyed; but whoever breaks vessels and rends garments; demolishes buildings; stops fountains; spoils victuals with a destructive intention transgresses the negative command “not to destroy.”  
We may lay siege to towns of Gentiles three days previous to Sabbath; and we may make war with them (Gentiles) every day, even on a Sabbath; for it is said: <i>until it be subdued,</i> (Deut. 20. 20), even on a Sabbath. It matters not whether it is an enjoined or a voluntary war.  
 We may encamp anywhere, and whoever is slain in a battle wheresoever he falls, on the same spot he is to be buried, and must not be removed.  
The people in a camp are exempt from four matters; they may eat <i>dmai,</i> (provision which is subject to the doubt whether it has paid tithe to the Levi or not), and are exempt from washing their hands before meals; they may fetch wood anywhere, even if they found cut and dry wood they need not mind that while in the camp; and are exempt from the ceremony (the Eruby Chazeroth) combining of courts. But they may convey from one tent to the other and from one booth to the other, provided the camp is surrounded by a rampart of ten feet high, which constitutes the camp as a private quarter, as is explained in the laws of Sabbath. 

Chapter 7

We appoint a priest who has to address the people during the war; it matters not whether it be an enjoined or a voluntary war. This priest is anointed with the anointing oil, and he is denominated the anointed for war.  
The anointed priest addresses the people twice, once when they come to the frontiers to go forth to war, and previous to their being ranged in battle array; then he addresses them saying: <i>And what man is he that has planted a vineyard and hath not eaten of it;</i> so that those who hear his words may be able to return; but the second time he addresses those who are ranged in battle array saying, <i>fear not and tremble not, etc.</i>  
At the time when they range the armies for battle, then the priest anointed for war stands on an elevated place whence he can survey all the host, and addresses them in Hebrew, saying: <i>Hear, Israel, you approach this day unto battle against your enemies, let not your hearts faint, fear not and do not tremble, neither be you terrified because of them. For the Lord your God is He that goeth with you, to fight against your enemies, to save you,</i> (Deut. 20. 3). So far speaks the anointed priest; then another priest, inferior to the former, promulgates in a loud voice this address to all the people. Then the anointed priest continues: “What man is there that has built a new house, etc., etc.; what man is there that has planted a vineyard, etc., etc.; what man is there that has betrothed.” So far the anointed priest speaks, and the officers proclaim it among the people, and then the officer continues, “What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted, etc., etc.,” and another officer promulgates the same among the people.  
 After those mentioned had left the army, then the ranks are properly placed; all officers assigned to their respective posts; also at the rear of each row are stationed certain powerful officers armed with strong hatchets, for the purpose of preventing all deserters; these officers could inflict exemplary punishment by hewing off the thighs of those who attempted to flee, because the least attempt at fleeing might lead to a defeat. This law of allowing the various persons mentioned above to leave the ranks is applicable to a voluntary war, but in enjoined wars none are exempt.  
 It matters not whether one had built a dwelling place, or a stable, or a timber yard, or store-house, or a house for keeping straw, they all come under the same category, since they can easily be used for dwellings. It matters neither whether he built, or purchased, or received as a present, or inherited, under all these circumstances the owner is exempt from military service; but he who builds a gate or summer-house, is not exempt from service.  
 As regard the planting of a vineyard, it matters not whether one actually had planted a vineyard, or only five fruit trees, even of five different fruits, or engrafted on trees which are subject to the law of being considered for three years uncircumcised, and their fruit must not be used nor purchased, nor inherited, nor received as a present; the various plantings mentioned all come under the category of planting a vineyard; but if he had only planted four fruit trees, or five wild trees, or obtained the vineyards by unlawful means, he is not exempt from the army.  
Likewise with betrothing, whether he had betrothed a virgin, or a widow, or he were bound to marry his brother’s childless widow; even if there were five brothers and one of whom died childless, all the four brothers are exempt from entering the active army, though only one of them can marry the widow.  
 He who remarried his divorced wife, or betrothed a woman forbidden to him to marry; as a widow to the High Priest, a woman divorced or having undergone the ceremony of Chalizah, (Deut. 25. 5), to a common priest, or a female bastard to an Israelite, is not exempt. 
All those mentioned above to be allowed to quit the army after having heard the anointed war priest address the people to that effect are only released from fighting; but they will be bound to supply the warriors with provision and mend the roads.  
 But the following are entirely exempt from military service. When the people are summoned to enlist, they need not comply therewith, nor have they to trouble themselves with any indirect service, as stated in the preceding paragraph concerning those who are permitted to quit the army. He who had built a house and recently dedicated it, or who had recently married his affianced wife or the childless widow of his brother, or had kept the vintage of the newly planted vineyard, they need not quit them for any military service, either direct or indirect; for it is said:<i> When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business, but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he has taken,</i> (Deut. 24. 5). Our sages learned by tradition, that whether he had purchased a house, or married, or held the first vintage, he is entitled to the privilege of being exempt from any military service.  
 All the year he need not supply the army with provisions, neither mend the road, nor mount guard on the wall, nor be subject to any contributions; for it is said: <i>He shall not go out to war, neither be charged to anything;</i> whosoever should exact any taxes from him would transgress two negative precepts. He need not contribute to the town nor to the war. 
 If one had built a house and let it to others, and the rent were paid in advance, that is considered dedicated; but if the owner receive the rent at the expiration of a twelvemonth then it is not considered dedicated.  
If he had built a house and put some goods therein and shut up the house; if he had sometimes to stay there for the purpose of guarding the goods, then it is considered as if he had dedicated it and already lived therein; but if he need not stay there, then it is not considered as dedicated.  
 Whoever builds a house or plants a vineyard out of the Holy Land, is not allowed to leave the army.   
<i>What man being fearful and fainthearted,</i> is understood as the literal meaning, he being not strong-hearted enough to bear the brunt or fury of the fight; because he ought in such fierce battle to trust in the hope of Israel and his deliverer in time of disaster. He must also be impressed with the idea that he fights for the sake of the unity of His Holy name. He is bound to risk his life without feeling any fear or anguish. He must not think either of his wife or children; they must be entirely obliterated from his mind, and he must give himself up heart and soul to war. Should he ever allow his heart to be invaded by pusillanimity, he trespasses the negative precept; <i>Fear not and do not tremble, neither be you terrified because of them;</i> moreover, he would be responsible for the slaughter of his co-religionists; if he should not endeavour to fight with heart and soul he would be guilty of having slain his fellow warriors; for it is said: <i>Lest his brethren’s heart faint as well as his heart,</i> (Deut. 20. 8). It is further distinctly mentioned in scripture, <i>Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood, </i>(Jeremiah 48. 10). But he who fights with all his heart without being subdued by any fear, and his sole intention is to sanctity His Holy name, may be sure that no disaster will befall him, and no evil will affect him; and he will inherit eternal felicity; for it is said: <i>For the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house, because my Lord fighteth the battles of the Lord, and evil has not found in thee all thy days,</i> (I Samuel 25. 28). 

Chapter 8

An army that had invaded the coast of the gentiles and conquered it, are allowed to eat forbidden food, when there is no other meat to be procured; they may also drink the gentiles wine, though consecrated to idolatry.  
 The warrior is also allowed to marry a gentile female whom he took prisoner, if he cannot resist his inclinations; but he is not allowed constantly to cohabit with her in an unmarried state.   

 A gentile woman is only allowed to be married to an Israelite layman, but not to a priest. 
A warrior wishing to marry a gentile female prisoner has to observe the following laws: If she be willing to be admitted within the pale of Judaism, she can at once undergo the necessary immersion in water for becoming converted to Judaism. But if she be not willing to do so, she has to abide in his house for the space of thirty days; for it is said: <i>And bewail her father and her mother a full month,</i> (Deut. 21. 13). She may also bewail her religion which she is desired to abjure, during which time she has to suffer her nails to grow, and her hair to be cut off in order that she should displease him. She shall abide in his house in order that he should constantly, during the specified time, see her when stripped of her ornaments and charms perhaps she would no more fascinate him, and he would abstain from marrying her. He has thus to wait the stated space of time in order that she might consent to become converted to our faith. If she wish to do so and he be yet desirous of marrying her, then she has to undergo the ceremony prescribed for admitting proselytes to our religion; she has to be immersed in water for the purpose of being converted to Judaism.  
 She has to wait then three months, including the month for mourning; on the expiration of this time he has to marry her, by drawing up a marriage contract and solemnizing the marriage ceremony. In case he should no more feel an inclination towards her he is bound to liberate her. If he should sell her he trespasses a negative precept; for it is said: <i>But thou shalt not sell her at all for money,</i> (Deut. 21. 14). If he had sold her the sale is not valid, and he is obliged to return the money realized by selling her; likewise he cannot force her to be his servant (if he had once cohabited with her); for it is said: <i>Thou shalt not make merchandize of her because thou hast humbled her, </i>(Ibid). 
 If on the expiration of one month the captive female should still persist in not becoming a Jewess, the owner shall wait a twelve month, and if then she still evinces no desire to be converted to Judaism, she has to take upon herself to perform the seven precepts incumbent upon every Noachide, and afterwards she is to be liberated and treated like a Noachide who took upon himself to observe the seven precepts.  But she cannot be married to any Jew except she had completely been admitted within the pale of Judaism.  



 A Noachide who takes upon himself the performance of the seven precepts and observes them conscientiously belongs to the pious of other nations and inherits eternal felicity. 

Chapter 9

Adam was enjoined seven precepts,viz.: not to worship idols; not to blaspheme; not to commit bloodshed; not to be licentious; not to steal; to observe laws; not to eat a limb or any part cut off from a live animal: these laws must be performed by all the descendants of Adam or of Noah. So it rested until Abraham; who was moreover, besides the stated commandments, enjoined circumcision and he instituted the morning prayer; Isaac gave tithes from all his produce and instituted the afternoon prayer; to Jacob was moreover imparted the precept of not eating the sinew that shrank, and he instituted the evening prayer; thus it remained until Moses was born. Through him the law has been completed. 

Chapter 10







 Circumcision was only enjoined to Abraham and his descendants; for it is said: <i>Thou and thy seed after thee,</i> (Gen. 17. 9).

Chapter 11

The King Messiah (the anointed) will restore the kingdom of David to its former position and splendour. He will cause the temple to be built and the dispersed Israelites to be assembled; all our laws will in his age come in force again as they used to be; sacrifices will again be offered; the year of release and the jubilee will be again observed, with all precepts relating thereto. He who does not believe in, or hopes not for, the advent of the Messiah, denies not only the prophets, but even the laws of Moses; because it distinctly mentions the restoration of our people; for it is said: <i>That then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, and any of thine be driven out to the utmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee,</i> (Deut. 30. 3). This subject which is so clearly pointed out in the Pentateuch comprises all the prophecies of the subsequent prophets; even in the section containing the blessings of Balaam it is indicated, and there he prophesied of two Messiahs, the first Messiah alluding to David, who saved Israel from their adversaries; and of the last Messiah descending from David’s offspring, who will deliver Israel from the sons of Esau; for it is said: <i>I shall see him but not now,</i> (Numbers 24. 17); alluding to David, <i>I shall behold him but not nigh!</i> (Numbers 24. 17), indicating the King Messiah. <i>There shall come a star out of Jacob,</i> (Numbers 24. 17), meaning David; <i>and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel,</i> (Numbers 24. 17), forshadowing the Messiah; <i>and shall smite the corners of Moab,</i> (Numbers 24. 17), intimating David; for it is said: <i>and he smote Moab and measured them with a line, </i>(II Samuel 8. 2). <i>And destroy all the children of Seth,</i> (Numbers 24. 17), points to the King Messiah; for it is said: <i>And his dominion shall he even from sea to sea,</i> (Zachariah 9. 10). <i>And Edom shall be a possession,</i> (Numbers 24. 18), refers to David; for it is said: <i>And all they of Edom became David’s servants,</i> (II Samuel 8. 14); Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies, (Numbers 24. 17) relates to Messiah; for it is said: <i>And Saviours shall come up on Mount Zion to judge the Mount of Esau.</i>  

But we must not suppose that the Messiah need perform miracles and wonders, (or exhibit any novelty in the world, or cause the resurrection of the dead, as some silly people imagine), which is not the case. For rabbi Akiba was renowned as an eminent scholar among the scholars of the Mishna, and he was the arm bearer of Ben Cusiba or Bar Cochba, and asserted that this warrior was the Messiah, and all other contemporaneous sages were of the same opinion, until he (Ben Cusiba) was unfortunately slain in the war.  Our sages never required from him any sign to confirm his mission. But the principle of this matter is, that the law with all its statutes and judgments are permanent, nothing must be added thereto or diminished therefrom, (whoever acts the reverse, or gives a gloss to any passage by which he distorts and perverts the literal meaning of any precept), is surely a wicked and heretical innovator.  
 If there should arise a king from the house of David who would study the law, perform the precepts as his progenitor David, quite in unison with both the written and oral law, and would enforce Israel to observe it and strengthen every breach, and fight the battles of the Lord, then he can claim the title of Messiah, provided he prospers and rebuilds the temple on its spot and causes the dispersed Israelites to be gathered.  
But in the event of his not succeeding to the extent mentioned, or he being slain, then we may be confident that he was not the Messiah whom the Lord promised; but he is considered like all other pious and upright kings of that family, and the Lord only raised him to tempt the multitude; for it is said: <i>And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end, because it [is yet for a time appointed,</i> (Daniel 11. 35).  
Even he who pretended to be the Messiah. Daniel has already prophesied of him, for it is said: <i>The forward of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision, but they shall fall,</i> (Dan. 11. 14). Has there been a greater fall than that stated above? For all prophets coincide that the Messiah will prove the deliverer of Israel and their Saviour, who will gather the dispersed and confirm the precepts; but the one mentioned was quite the reverse: he caused Israel to be massacred, scattered and degraded. 
 But no human being has the capacity to comprehend the designs of the Creator; for their ways are not His ways, and His thoughts are not their thoughts. All these events even those of him who succeeded the one stated, will ultimately pave the way for the King Messiah; it will eventually reform mankind to worship the true and only God; for it is said: <i>For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent,</i> (Zephaniah 3. 9). 
 How will this be effected? The world has been already made acquainted with the coming of Messiah, and with the records of the law and its precepts. These subjects have been already propagated to the utmost isles, among various gentiles of uncircumcised heart and flesh. They discuss those matters which apparently contradict the law. Some advance those precepts were true. but they had been already abrogated and are no more in force; but others assert the precepts had some mysterious signification, and the expected king already had risen and had revealed the mystery.  
But when the true Messiah will rise and prosper, exalted and elevated, then they will all acknowledge that their assertion is not correct. 

Chapter 12

Let none suppose that in the time of the Messiah any alteration will take place in the system of the present state of the world, or any novelty in nature will be exhibited, but the world’s state will continue in its present system. And the poetical description of Isaiah, <i>The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid</i> (Isaiah 11. 6), is a metaphor signifying that Israel will dwell in safety among the malicious of other nations, which are likened to wolves and leopards, for it is said: <i>A wolf of the evening shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities,</i> (Jeremiah 5. 6). They will all be converted to the true law, and will no more depredate and spoil, but will live by honest and permissible means like Israel; for it is said: <i>And the lion shall eat straw like the ox,</i> (Isaiah 11. 7). In fact, all these kinds of prophetical terms alluding to Messiah are all metaphorical expressions. In the age of the Messiah it will be patent to every one what these allusions were signifying.  
 The sages taught that there is no difference between the present time and that of the Messiah, but the existence of despotism. From the plain words of our prophets it would appear that the war of Gog and Magog would form the inception of the era of Messiah; and previous to this war, a prophet would arise to reform Israel, and prepare their hearts for the coming event; for it is said:<i> I shall send you Elijah,</i> (Malachi 3. 23). The mission of this prophet will not be to pronounce defiled that which is pure; neither the reverse; neither to declare illegitimate those that are legitimate, or <i>vice versa</i>, but his sole mission will be to make peace in the world; for it is said: <i>Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the heart of the father to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, </i>(Malachi 3. 24). Some of the sages state that Elijah will appear previous to the advent of Messiah, but all these matters can not be determined by human intelligence, how and when they will take place. They were even a mystery to our prophets, and the sages had no tradition thereon. Their sole guide was the tenor and construction of some verses; and this is the source of the various opinions prevailing on these subjects. However, the definition of the matter in question forms no article of faith. Man ought not to study much the words of the <i>Agadoth,</i> neither dilate on the exposition regarding the Messianic advent, as they do not lead to any fear or love of the Lord; neither should man compute the end of Israel’s dispersion. The sages said: <i>Death should overtake those who attempt to compute the end;</i> but we ought confidently and faithfully believe in the restoration of Israel as explained.  
In the time of Messiah, when his kingdom will have been established and the Israelites gathered, then he will point out their genealogy; the holy spirit he is inspired with; for it is said: <i>And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier,</i> (Malachi 3. 3). The Levites he will purify at first by singling out those who are entitled to the priesthood from those who are to remain Levites. But those who have no title to the Levitical genealogy, he will reject and turn them over to the Israelites; for it is said: <i>And Tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things, until there stood up a priest with Urim and Thumim,</i> (Nehemiah 7. 65), from which we can deduce that the genealogy of the priest will be notified by means of the holy spirit; as to the Israelites, Messiah will only point out the respective tribe of each one, but he will strike not with illegitimacy, any one who is considered legitimate, because there is a law that when once a family is intermixed with illegitimate members we leave it so, and do not expose those branded with that stigma, being a doubtful case. 
The sages and prophets who were desirous of the advent of the Messiah, were not prompted by any ambition of having a dominion over the world, or being exalted above other nations, or by any desire of obtaining worldly enjoyments, but by the sole purpose of being able to devote themselves to the study of the law and of wisdom, without being annoyed or molested, in order that they might inherit eternal felicity, as explained in the section treating on penitence.  
In the age of the advent of the Messiah there will be neither famine, nor war, neither jealousy nor envy. Prosperity will be general; all comforts in abundance. Mankind will be engaged in nothing else but obtaining a knowledge of the Lord. Israel will become great, intelligent men, and obtain a knowledge of the Creator as far as the faculty of mankind will admit; for it is said: <i>For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea,</i> (Isaiah 11. 9).
