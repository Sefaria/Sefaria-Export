Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars

Chapter 1

Three mitzvot were commanded to Israel at the hour of their entry into the land: to appoint for themselves a king, as it is said, "You shall surely appoint  a king over you (Deuteronomy 17:15);" to  wipe out the descendants of Amalek, as it is said, "Erase the memory of Amalek (Deuteronomy 25:19):" and to build the chosen house [Temple], as it is said, "Seek His Presence and go there (Deuteronomy 12:5)." 

A king is not appointed initially except by a court of 70 elders and a prophet.  As Joshua, who was chosen by Moses, our teacher, and his court. And as Saul and David who were chosen by Samuel the Ramati and his court.
A king is not established from the community of converts, even after many generations, until his mother will be Jewish, as it says "You cannot put upon yourself a foreign man who is not your brother." Not for kingship only, but for any authority position in Israel. Not a leader of the military, or a leader of 50 or a leader of 10.  Even to control the division of water to fields.  It goes without saying he cannot be a judge or a prince, who must be Jewish [by birth], as it says "from amongst your brethren shall you put upon yourselves a king".  Anyone you place upon yourself must be from among your brethren.

Chapter 5

At first, a king should fight only obligatory wars. Which wars are obligatory? The wars of the seven nations, and the war of Amalek, and saving Israel from an enemy who comes against them. And after that, he may fight a discretionary war, which means a war fought against any other nation in order to widen Israel's boundaries and increase its greatness and reputation. 
An obligatory war does not require that he seek permission from the court, rather he may go forth on his own at any time and compel the people to go out, but for a discretionary war he may not bring forth the people except on the word of a court of seventy one.






It is prohibited to leave from Eretz Yisrael to outside of the Land forever except to teach Torah or to marry a woman or to save (someone) from non-Jews and to return to the Land and so too may he leave for business, but to dwell outside the Land is prohibited unless there is intense famine where the price of wheat doubles. What cases does this refer to? When money is plentiful and the fruit is expensive. However, if the fruit is inexpensive and money is not plentiful, and it is difficult to 

Chapter 6

A war is never waged against anyone before peace is offered. This applies both to an obligatory war and to a permitted war, as it is written “when you get near a city to wage war against it, you must offer peace” (Deut. 20:10). If they agree and accept upon themselves the seven mitzvot given to the children of Noah, not a single soul is to be harmed, and they are to pay taxes , as it is written “they will pay taxes and serve you” (Deut. 20:11). If they accepted taxes but not servitude, or servitude and not taxes, we don’t listen to them, until they accepted both. … 



However, if either the seven nations or Amalek refuse to accept a peaceful settlement, not one soul of them may be left alive as ibid. 20:15-16 states: 'Do this to all the cities that ... are not the cities of these nations. However, from the cities of these nations,... do not leave a soul alive.' Similarly, in regard to Amalek, Deuteronomy 25:19 states: 'Obliterate the memory of Amalek.'...

When a city is sieged to be conquered, we do not surround the four sides of it , rather, only three, and a place is selected as a place where whoever wants to flee and save their lives can, as it is written: And they warred against Midian, as Hashem commanded Moshe (Num. 31:7) from the wording we understand that he was commanded.
We do not cut fruit-bearing trees that are outside the place, and we do not withdraw water so they will shrivel and die, as it is written: you must not destroy its trees (Deut. 20:19) and whoever cuts them receives lashes. And this does not apply just to the siege, but in every place whoever cuts down a fruit-bearing tree just to destroy receives lashes. But we do cut a tree if it is damaging other trees, or others’ field, or if its value is great – the Torah only forbids in the case of destruction.
Any fruitless tree can be cut, even if it unnecessary – and this applies to a fruit-bearing tree that was damaged and cannot bear fruit anymore, or if it bears only such a small quantity that we don’t bother harvesting it. And how much is necessary for it not to be cut? A olive tree – a quarter kav; a date tree – a full kav.Any fruitless tree can be cut, even if it unnecessary – and this applies to a fruit-bearing tree that was damaged and cannot bear fruit anymore, or if it bears only such a small quantity that we don’t bother harvesting it.

Chapter 7



Chapter 8











All who accept the seven commandments and are careful to observe them are part of the world's righteous gentiles. And that person has a share in the world to come. This applies to one who accepts them and does them because the Holy One, Blessed Be He, commanded them in the Torah and informed us through our teacher Moses that the children of Noah were previously commanded to do them. But if he observes these commandments from a knowledgeable resolve, this person is not a foreign resident and not one of the world's righteous gentiles and not one of their sages.  

Chapter 9

Regarding six things Adam the First was commanded:  regarding foreign worship, and cursing [lit. blessing] God, and spilling blood, and forbidden sexual relations, and theft, and a justice system.  Even though they are all received traditions in our hands from our teacher Moses, and reason is inclined to them from the principles of the Torah, it appears that regarding these he was commanded.  He added for Noah [the prohibition on eating] the limb of a live animal, as it is said "but flesh in its life its blood you shall not eat."  We find seven commandments.  And so was the matter in the whole world until Abraham.  Abraham came and he was commanded, in addition to these, with circumcision.  And he prayed shaharit.  And Isaac separated a tithe and added another prayer as the day wanes.  And Jacob added the [fobidden] sinew and prayed arvit.  And in Egypt Amram was commanded with additional commandments, until Moses our teacher came and the Torah was completed by him.

Chapter 10



Chapter 11

The King the Messiah (lit. the annointed) will stand up and return the Kingdom of the house of David to its old [glory], to the first rule, and build the Temple (lit. holy), and gather the scattered ones of the Israel, and return all of the laws in his days as they were before; bringing sacrifices, and making shmitahs (leaving the land fallow on the seventh year) and jubilees like all of the commandments that it says in the Torah.  And any who does not believe in him, or does not anticipate his arrival, it is not only in the other prophets that he is denying but in the Torah and in Moses our teacher; because the Torah testifies on him [the Messiah] as it says "and Hashem your Lord will return your captives and your pitied ones, and return and gather . . . if you scattered ones are at the end of the heavens . . . and Hashem will bring them to you. (Deuteronomy 30:5)"  And these express words in the Torah they include all of the things that were said by the hand of all of the prophets.  Even    the piece about Bilam  it is said, and there he prophesied about the two messiahs--about the first messiah who is David who saved Israel from their enemies and from the last messiah who will arise from his children who will save Israel [in the end].  And there it says, "I will see him, but not now,(Number 24:17)"--that's David.  "I will behold him, but not nearby,"--that's the King Messiah.  "A star will come from Jacob"--that's Daivd.  "A tribe will arise out of Israel"--that's the King Messiah.  "He will strike the corners of Moab"--that's David."  And so it says "And he defeated Moab and measured them with a cord (2 Samuel 8:2)."  "..and destroy all the sons of Seth (Numbers 24:17)"--that's the King Messiah, as it is said about him "And his reign will be from sea to sea (Zachariah 9:10).  "And Edom will be an inheritance (Numbers 24:18)"--that's David, as it is said, "And Edom were slaves to David (2 Samuel 8:14)", etc.  "And it will be an inheritance, etc. (Numbers 24:18)" --that's the King Messiah, as it is said, "Saviors will ascent Mount Zion (Ovadiah 1:21)", etc. 
nd as regarding the cities of refuge it states: "If the Lord your God expands your border" (Deuteronomy 19:8) "and you will add three cities" (Deuteronomy 19:9). And never in the world has this thing happened. And God did not command for nothing. But in the words of the prophets this matter does not need seeking out, because all the books are filled of this matter.
And don't think that the King Messiah needs to do wonders and signs and create a new reality in the world or resurrect the dead, or similar things. This is not the point (of The Messianic redemptive process). For Rebbe Akiva, the wisest of the Mishnaic sages, was the "weapons bearer" of The King Ben Kuziba (aka Bar Kochba). And he said concerning him (Ben Kuziba), that he was The King Messiah. And all the sages of the generation  were in agreement until he was killed due to his sins. Since he was killed they (then) knew that he was not (the Messiah). The sages did not request from him, neither a sign nor a wonder (i.e. miraculous actions) .The main thing is that the Torah and its laws and statutes are everlasting for ever and ever, and we do not add or subtract from them....
And if a King arises from the House of David who is fitting in (observance) of the  Torah and fulfilling its commandments, and he compels all of Israel to follow it, and he strengthens it diligently, and he fights the was of God. Then, he is assumed to be the Messiah. If he fights and is victorious and defeats all of the surrounding nations, and builds The Temple in its place, and gathers all the scattered remnants of Israel, then he is definitely the Messiah. And he will repair the entire world to worship God together, as it is said, "For then I will change all of the peoples to [having] a clear language so they can all call God by name and worship Him as one." (Zephaniah 3:9) 
And if he's not successful with this, or if he is killed, it's known that he is not the one that was promised by the Torah. And thus, he is like all of the kosher kings from the House of David who died.  And The Holy One, blessed be, only established him to test the masses, as it is said, 
Even Jesus the Christian who it seemed that he would be the Messiah and was killed in court, Daniel had already prophesied about him, as it is said, "And the violent men of your people will be lifted up to fulfill the vision, and they will be failed (Daniel 11:14)."  And is there a greater failure than this?  All of the prophets spoke of the Messiah, the redeemer of Irael and their savior, and the I gatherer of the captives, and the strengthened thier mitzvot--but this one cause Jews to be lost by the sword, and for their remnants to be scattered and humbled, and to change the Torah, and for the majority of the world to do wrong by worshiping a god other than God.  
But, the plans of the creator of the world--no person can understand them for our ways are not the same as His ways and our plans are not His plans.  And all of these things about Jesus of Nazareth, and about that Ishmaelite who rose after him--they are only to make the path for the King Messiah straight, and to fix the whole world for worshipping God together, as it is said, "For I will give the peoples clear speech, for them all to call out the name of God, and to worship Him with one purpose (Zephaniah 3:9)
How?  The whole world is already filled with the words of the Messiah, and the worlds of the Torah, and the words of the Mitzvot, and these words have been spread on disband islands, and to many peoples of uncircumcised hearts, and they deal with these words, and with the mitzvot of the Torah--they say 'These mitzvot were true but they are already nullified in this time, they aren't applicable forever.'  And they say, 'There are things hidden in them, and they're not just a simple meaning, and the Messiahnalready came and revealed their secrets.'
And when the King Messiah rises for real, and he succeeds, and he is lifted up and exalted, they will immediately return and will know that their ancestors passed down lies to them, and that their prophets and their ancestors made them do wrong.

Chapter 12

Don't think that in the days of the Messiah anything will be changed in the order of the world or that there will be some innovation in the works of creation.  Rather, the world will behave according to its custom.  And what is written in Isaiah, "And the wolf will live with the lamb and the tiger will lie down with the kid (Isaiah 11:6)"  is a metaphor and a riddle.  The ideas is that Israel will dwell safely with the evil idol worshipers who are compared to a wolf and to a tiger, as it is said, "A desert wolf will slaughter them and a tiger will keep watch over their cities (Jeremiah 5:6)."  And everybody will return to the religion of truth and they will not steal and they will not destroy.  Rather, they will eat the permitted things together with Israel, as it is said, "And the lion, like the herd, will eat straw (Isaiah 11:7)."  And so too all of things like this on the topic of the Messiah are metaphors.  And in the days of the King Messiah, it will be known to all what the metaphor is about and what is hinted at by them. 
The sages said 'There is no difference between this world and the days of the Messiah, except for subjugation to [foregin] kings.'  It seems from the simple meaning of the words of the prophets that in the beginning of the days of the Messiah, there will be a war between Gog and Magog, and that before the war between Gog and Magog, a prophet will rise to straighten Israel out and to prepare their hearts, as it is written, "Behold, I am sending to you Eliyah (Malachi 2:23)."  And he is not come to make the pure impure or to make the impure pure, and not to disqualify people who have been considered 'kosher', and not to certify those of have been disqualified, rather to bring peace to the world, as it says, "He will return the hearts of the fathers to their children (Malachi 3:24)"  And there are those among the sages who say that before the Messiah will come, Elijah will come.  And all of these things and things like them, people wont' really know how it we be until it happens.  Because these things are not explicit in the prophets' words.  And the sages also don't have a received tradition about these things, just and interpretation of the verses.  Therefore, they argue about these things.  And in any case, there is no order to these things happening and the details of them is not necessary to the religion.  And a person should never study the tales or spend a long time on the Midrash told about these issues and things like them, and they shouldn't be made to be essential, since they bring about neither awe nor love. 
In the days of the King Messiah, when he is established in hi reign and all of Israel is gathered to him, the descent of everybody will be decided by his mouth through the holy spirit that will rest upon him, as it is said, "He shall sit and refine and purify (Malachi 3:3), etc."  And he will purify the children of Levi first and say, 'this one is descended from a Cohen and this one is descended from a Levi.  And he will push those who are not descendants down to [the status of] Israel, which is why it says, "The Governor said to them...until a Cohen arises with Urim and Tumim (Ezra 2:63)....  ...
The sages and the prophets didn't desire the days of the Messiah so that they could rule over the whole world and not so that they would dominate over the idol worshippers and not to be lifted up by the nations and not to eat, to drink, and to be merry.  Rather it was so that they would be free for [study of Torah] and its wisdom without disturbances or distractions, so that they can merit living in the world to come, as we explained in the laws of T'shuvah. ...
.And at that time there won't be any famine or war there, and there won't be jealousy or competitions, for good will be flowing freely, and all delights will be as common as dust, and the only business will be to know God.  Therefore, Israel will be great sages and they will know the hidden things and they will attain knowledge of their creator as much as people can, as it is said, "For the earth will be filled with knowledge of God like water covers the oceans.  ...
