Mishneh Torah, Testimony



Chapter 1




It is a biblical positive command to investigate the witnesses and to subject them to searching inquiry and many questions, — — as it is written: "You shall investigate and inquire and interrogate thoroughly" (Deuteronomy 13:15). The judges should be careful in examining the witnesses, lest through the inquiry the witnesses learn to tell lies. The judges must examine the witnesses by asking them seven types of questions: In what seven-year cycle was the crime committed? In what year? In what month? On what day of the month? On what day of the week? At what hour? In what place? — —

They must furthermore question the witnesses exhaustively concerning things that are not essential for the testimony, the validity of which does not depend on them. These are referred to as <i>bedikoth</i> (cross-examination). The more <i>bedikoth</i> a judge uses [to test the evidence], the more praise he deserves. Here is an example of <i>bedikoth:</i> If witnesses testified that a man killed a person, they were subjected to the seven types of questions we have enumerated, relating to the exact time and place. If, upon being questioned, they gave a precise description of the act itself and the weapon with which the accused had killed a person, they are cross-examined as follows : What clothes did the slain or the slayer wear? Were they white or black? Was the dust of the earth, where the slaying took place, white or red? Such questions are <i>bedikoth.</i> It once happened that the witnesses stated that the accused had killed a person on a certain spot under a fig tree. When they were cross-examined, they were asked: Were the figs black or white? Were the stalks long or short? (Sanhedrin 40a).

Chapter 2

Wherein does examination differ from cross-examination? In the examination, if one witness has given a definite answer and the other says <i>I do not know</i>, their evidence beomes invalid. But in the cross-examination, if both say <i>we do not know</i>, their evidence remains valid. Yet if they contradict each other even in the cross-examination, their evidence becomes invalid. If, for example, they testified that the accused had killed a person and, when questioned, one said: "It happened during the seven-year-cycle … in the year … the month … the day of the month … the fourth day of the week, the sixth hour of the day; he killed him at that place." When questioned: "With what weapon did he kill him," he replied: "He killed him with a sword." The second witness, likewise, gave precise answers to all questions, except the one concerning the hour of the day, when he said : "I do not know at what time it happened" ; or, he agreed as to the time, but said: "I do not know with what weapon he killed him, I did not investigate the weapon in his hand" ; in a case such as this their evidence is invalid. But if they gave precise answers to all questions except when the judges asked them: "Were his clothes black or white," if they replied: "We do not know, we paid no attention to such unsubstantial things," their evidence remains valid.
If one witness said: "He wore black clothes," and the other said: "It is not true, he wore white clothes," their evidence is invalid. It is as if one said <i>Wednesday</i> and the other said <i>Thursady</i>, in which case there would be no evidence ; or, as if one said <i>he killed him with a sword</i> and the other said <i>with a spear</i>, then there is no evidence, as it is written: "The thing is certain" (Deuteronomy 13:15). Since they have contradicted each other in any one of the things, it is no longer certain.
If there were many witnesses, two of whom gave definite answers to the examination questions, and the third said <i>I do not know</i>, the evidence is sustained by the two and the accused is put to death ; but if the third witness contradicted them, even during the cross-examination, their evidence is void.

Chapter 5

No verdict is determined on the testimony of a single witness, whether in civil or capital cases, as it is written: "A single witness shall not take the stand against a man in regard to any crime or any offense" (19:15).






Any witness who has testified in a capital case must not act as one of the judges dealing with the same case; he must neither defend nor prosecute the accused. If he said: "I have something in favor of the accused," he is to be silenced. — — In civil cases, however, he may defend or prosecute the defendant, but he cannot be included among the judges in the lawsuit, since no witness can act as a judge even in civil cases.

Chapter 11

He who has no knowledge of Scripture or Mishnah or right conduct is presumed to be sinful, and is therefore disqualified as a witness, on rabbinic grounds. The presumption is that anyone who is on such a low level commits most of the sins that come within his reach.
Accordingly, no evidence is entrusted to a boorish person, nor is his evidence accepted, unless he is known to be an observer of religious duties, or one who practises benevolence, leads an upright life and is courteous. His testimony is accepted, even though he is ignorant and has no knowledge of Scripture or Mishnah.
Hence, you may infer that every scholar is deemed eligible to bear witness unless he becomes disqualified ; every ignoramus is considered ineligible unless it becomes certain that he follows the right paths.

So too, contemptible persons are ineligible to bear witness, on rabbinic grounds. They are men who eat while walking in the street, in front of all the people ; and those who go about undressed in the market, while they are occupied with filthy work; and similar individuals who lack a sense of shame. All these are doggish and will not hesitate to bear false witness.— —

Chapter 18

If one has given false testimony and it has become known through witnesses that he has testified falsely, he is referred to as a scheming witness. It is a biblical positive command to do to him as he intended to do to the person against whom he testified. All those who testified and were proved plotting witnesses concerning an offense punishable by stoning must be stoned; if it is punishable by burning, they must be burned ; and so, the other modes of punishment by death. If the scheming witnesses bore evidence concerning an offense punishable by lashing, each of them is lashed like all offenders who deserve to be lashed ; his physical endurance is appraised, and he is lashed accordingly. If they testified to render a person liable to paying a penalty, each is assessed an equal share of the fine, according to the number of witnesses; each pays his proportionate share. They are not lashed where they have to pay compensation.
This applies only to witnesses who were convicted of scheming. But if two sets of witnesses contradict each other so that the evidence is invalid, neither of them is punished, because we do not know which is the lying set. What is the difference between contradiction and refutation? Contradiction affects the evidence itself: one set says that <i>this event happened</i>, and the other set says that <i>this event did not happen</i>, or implies that it did not happen. Refutation affects the witnesses ; those who refute them do not know whether the thing did or did not happen. If, for example, witnesses appeared and said: "We saw this man killing a person," or "lending one hundred <i>zuz</i> to that man, on such-and-such a day and in such-and-such a place." Then, after they had testified and been examined, two other witnesses came and said: "On that very day and in that very place we were together with you and these individuals the entire day, and what you say is absolutely untrue: the accused did not kill that person," or "the plaintiff did not lend money to the defendant," this is contradiction. So too, if they said to them: "How can you testify like that? On that day the alleged homicide, or the slain person, or the borrower, or the lender, was with us in another city!" This is contradicted evidence, since it is as if one were to say: the accused did not kill the man, or the alleged creditor did not lend money to the alleged borrower, for they were with us and it did not happen. The same applies to all similar cases.<br>If, however, the second set said to the first set: "We do not know whether the accused killed the victim in Jerusalem on that day, as you assert, or whether he did not kill him, but we bear witness that you yourselves were with us in Babylon on that day," the first witnesses are thus turned out to be scheming witnesses and are put to death, or ordered to make restitution, since the refuting witnesses were not at all concerned with the testimony, whether it was true or false.
It is by divine decree that the Torah has accepted the evidence of the second set of witnesses rather than the first. Even if the first set consisted of a hundred witnesses, and two men came and refuted their evidence, saying to them : "We bear witness that the entire hundred of you were with us that day in such-and-such a place," all of them are punished on the testimony of the two, since the evidence of two is as valid as that of a hundred and the testimony of a hundred is no more effective than that of two. So too, in the case of two sets of witnesses that contradict each other, we do not follow the one that is more numerous but dismiss the evidence of both.

Chapter 19



Chapter 20

Scheming witnesses are neither put to death, nor lashed, nor ordered to make restitution, unless the two of them are eligible witnesses, and both are found to be scheming, and the scheming is detected after sentence has been passed. But if only one of them was refuted, or if both were refuted before sentence was passed, or even if both were refuted after sentence had been passed, and it was discovered that one of them was a relative or disqualified, they are not punished, although they have been refuted and become ineligible to bear witness in whatever case mentioned in the Torah.
If they were refuted after the execution of the person against whom they had testified, they are not put to death, owing to a decisive inference, as it is written: "You shall do to him as he schemed to do" (Deuteronomy 19:19), but has not yet done. This interpretation is based on tradition. However, if the accused against whom they had testified was lashed, they are lashed. So too, if by the evidence submitted by them, money was handed over from the defendant to the plaintiff, it is returned to the defendant and they make restitution to him.
If three witnesses, or even a hundred, testified in court one after the other within brief intervals, lasting as much as is needed for a mere utterance, and some of them were refuted, they are not punished unless all of them are refuted. If, however, the interval between the witnesses was longer than that needed for an utterance, or a student's greeting addressed to his teacher, the evidence has thus been divided: the two who were refuted suffer punishment, but the other two who testified after the prolonged interval are not punished. Although the entire evidence has become invalid, since they all constitute one set of witnesses, and if the evidence of some is disqualified, all of it is disqualified.



If witnesses testified that a person who was afflicted with a fatal disease killed someone, and they have been refuted, they are not put to death, because even if they had killed him with their own hands, they would not be executed, since he was anyway incurable.— —
