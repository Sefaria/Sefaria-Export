Chapter 1

1. A witness is commanded to testify in court with of all of the relevant testimony, whether it is evidence that causes a colleague to be held liable, or testimony that vindicates him.  With regards to financial cases, this will only apply when he is called to testify. As it is written ( Leviticus 5:1), "And he should witness, see, and know (of the matter), if he does not testify, he will bear his sin."
