Mishneh Torah, Fringes



Chapter 1

The fringe that is attached to the corner of the garment and produced of the same type of material as the garment is called <i>tsitsith</i>, because it is like a lock of hair, as it is written: "He took me by a lock of my head" (Ezekiel 8:3). This fringe is called <i>the white</i>, because we are not commanded to dye it. No definite number of threads is prescribed in the Torah.
A thread of wool dyed purple-blue, the color of the sky, is taken and entwined in the fringe. This thread is called <i>the blue</i>. The number of times this thread should be wound is not specified in the Torah.


Although the blue in the fringes and the white do not impair each other [even if a fringe is all white or all blue it remains valid], they do not constitute two precepts but one affirmative precept. The ancient sages interpreted: <i>You shall have it as a fringe</i> (Numbers 15:39) to mean that both, the white and the blue, constitute one precept. The absence of any one of the four fringes makes the others invalid, since all the four constitute one precept. Anyone who wears the garment with white or blue fringes, or both together, fulfills the positive command.

Chapter 2



Chapter 3

The garment that one is biblically obligated to provide with fringes is a four-cornered garment or one that has more than four corners. Its size should be large enough to cover the head and greater part of the body of a child big enough to walk by himself in the street without requiring anyone to watch and accompany him. The garment should be of wool or linen.









Although one is not obligated to buy a garment and enwrap himself in it so as to provide it with fringes, yet it is improper for a devout man to exempt himself from observing this precept. He should always strive to wear a garment that requires fringes, so as to perform this precept. He should take special care of this during prayer. It is very disrespectful for scholars to recite prayers without being enwrapped in a <i>tallith</i>.
One should always be heedful of the precept concerning fringes, since the Torah regards it to be of such importance that all the commandments have been made to depend on it, as it is written: "When you look upon it you will remember to do all the commands of the Lord" (Numbers 15:39).
