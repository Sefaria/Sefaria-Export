Mishneh Torah, Fringes



Chapter 1

The tassel that is made on the fringes of a garment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>anaf</i>, translated as "tassel," literally means "branch." Just as a branch is an extension of the tree, the tzitzit are extensions of the fringes.</i> from the same fabric as the garment<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 5.</i> is called tzitzit,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">in Numbers 15:38-39. Deuteronomy 22:12 refers to these tassels as <i>g'dilim</i> (braids).</i> because it resembles the locks of the head, as [Ezekiel 8:3] relates, "And he took me by the locks of my head."<br>This<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Note Halachah 8, which derives a halachic ruling from this comparison of terms.</i> tassel is called the white [strands], because we are not commanded to dye it.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Torah alone (מדאורייתא), we are obligated to place tzitzit only on fabrics of linen and wool (Chapter 3, Halachah 1). Both fabrics are white and need not be dyed.</i> The Torah did not establish a fixed number of strands for this tassel.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Though the Rabbis established a fixed practice, as explained in Halachah 6, according to the Torah alone (מדאורייתא) there is no fixed number of strands. Though there are some sources that appear to indicate that the Torah also fixed the number of strands required, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 88b concludes that the essence of the mitzvah of tzitzit is a Torah obligation; its explanation, however, is Rabbinic in origin.<br>Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:12) rules that if one includes more than eight strands in tzitzit, they are unacceptable. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:1 goes further and states that by doing so, one violates the prohibition forbidding adding to a Torah commandment. Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 11:60, which quotes other opinions that differ.</i>
Then we take a strand of wool that is dyed a sky-like color<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., sky-blue. <i>Menachot</i> 43b relates that this color is also reminiscent of God's throne.</i> and wind it around this tassel. This strand is called <i>techelet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam discusses the nature of this dye and its preparation in Chapter 2.</i> The Torah did not establish a fixed requirement for the number of times that this strand should be wound [around the tassel].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 39a requires that the strand of <i>techelet</i> be wound at least seven times around the tassel, as explained in Halachah 8. This is a Rabbinic ordinance.</i>
Thus, this mitzvah contains two commandments: to make a tassel on the fringe [of a garment], and to wind a strand of <i>techelet</i> around the tassel. [Both these dimensions are indicated by Numbers 15:38, which] states: "And you shall make tassels... and you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand of <i>techelet</i>."
The [absence of] <i>techelet</i> does not prevent [the mitzvah from being fulfilled with] the white strands, nor does the [absence of] the white strands prevent [the mitzvah from being fulfilled with] <i>techelet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In this aspect, they resemble the arm tefillin and the head tefillin. (See <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:4.) As explained in the following halachah, however, unlike tefillin, they are counted as one mitzvah and not two.</i><br>What is implied? A person who does not have <i>techelet</i> should make [tzitzit] from white strands alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the practice in the present age, when we do not know how to obtain <i>techelet</i>. Even in Talmudic times, when <i>techelet</i> was available, it was very expensive, and many of the common people made their tzitzit without it.</i> Similarly, if [tzitzit] were made from both white strands and <i>techelet</i>, and afterwards, the white strands snapped and were reduced until [they did not extend beyond] the corner [of the garment],<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The explanation of the Rambam's statements has been debated by the commentaries. Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Menachot</i> 4:1.</i> and thus only the <i>techelet</i> remained, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> emphasizes that the Rambam does not accept tzitzit that were made from <i>techelet</i> without any white strands. Since the verse states, "and you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand of <i>techelet</i>," there must be tassels of white strands around which to wind the <i>techelet</i>. Once this has been done, however, if the white strands are severed, one can still fulfill the mitzvah with the <i>techelet</i> alone.</i>
Although the [absence of] one does not prevent [the mitzvah from being fulfilled with] the other, they are not considered as two mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In General Principle 11 of <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:<br>One might think that since neither is dependent on the other, they would be counted as two mitzvot.... [Nevertheless,] they are a single mitzvah... because they have a single objective, "that you remember all the mitzvot...." All the elements that bring about this remembrance are counted as a single mitzvah.</i> Instead, they are a single mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 14) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 386).</i> Whether [the tzitzit] a person wears on his garment are white, <i>techelet</i>, or a combination of the two colors, he fulfills a single mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Whether [the tzitzit] a person wears on his garment are white, techelet, or a combination of the two colors, he fulfills a single mitzvah.</i><br> The Sages of the early generations<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre Zuta, Mechilta D'Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai</i></i> related: [Numbers 15:39 states:] "And they shall be tzitzit for you." This<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">the use of the singular form of the verb והיה</i> teaches that they are both one mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">teaches that they are both one mitzvah.</i><br> The [presence of each of the] four tzitzit is necessary [for the mitzvah to be fulfilled],<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., although a garment has several tzitzit, the mitzvah is not fulfilled unless it has all four.</i> because all four are [elements] of a single mitzvah.
How are the tzitzit made? One begins from the corner of a garment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the end of its woven portion. - The tzitzit must be placed at the "corners" or the "fringes" of the garment.</i> - i.e., the end of its woven portion. One ascends upward no more than three fingerbreadths from the edge,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Any further distance upward would be considered part of the garment itself and not its "corner" or "fringe" (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 11:9).</i> but no less than the distance from the knuckle of the thumb to its end.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is approximately two fingerbreadths. Any lower would be considered as "below the fringe" and not "on the fringe" (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:16).<br>Other opinions mention that these distances should also be applied in regard to the space between the hole and the side of the garment. It is customary to follow this view (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:10).</i><br>[A hole is made] and four strands inserted, [causing them] to be folded in half. Thus, there will be eight strands hanging down from the corner.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 1, the Torah does not explicitly mention the number of strands in the tzitzit. Although <i>Menachot</i> 39b derives this concept from the exegesis of Deuteronomy 22:12, the Rambam considers this process of derivation to be Rabbinic in origin (מדברי סופרים).</i> These eight strands must be at least four fingerbreadths long.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This decision is based on the Rambam's interpretation of<i>Menachot</i> 39a and 41b. Based on the same sources, Rabbenu Tam requires that the strands be at least twelve fingerbreadths long. His opinion is accepted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:4) and the later authorities.</i> If they are longer<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">even if they are a cubit or two long - it is acceptable. - It is common to make the strands slightly longer than twelve fingerbreadths, so that, even if they tear, they will still retain the desired length (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:9; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 11:21).</i> - even if they are a cubit or two long - it is acceptable. The term "fingerbreadth" refers to a thumbbreadth.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> 9:9. In contemporary measure, a thumbbreadth is approximately 2 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 2.4 centimeters according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i><br>One of the eight strands should be <i>techelet</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Though the eight strands come from folding four larger strands, only half of one of these strands should be dyed. The other half should retain its natural color, white.<br>The Ra'avad disagrees with this point and maintains that one of the larger strands should be dyed in its entirety, thus producing two smaller strands that are dyed <i>techelet</i>. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10) and other Ashkenazic authorities maintain that two of the four strands were <i>techelet</i> and two were white.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's position, noting that Numbers 15:39 states, "And you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand (singular) of <i>techelet</i>." Note also the commentary of the <i>Or Sameach</i>.<br>Significantly, archaeological excavations have uncovered tzitzit belonging to bar Kochba's soldiers. Only one of the eight strands was dyed <i>techelet</i>.</i> the other seven should be white.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The dyed strand should be slightly longer than the others, so that, even after it has been wound around them, it will be the same length as the others.</i>
Afterwards, one should take one of the white strands and wind it once around the other strands close to the edge of the garment and let it go. Then one takes the strand that was dyed <i>techelet</i> and winds it twice [around the other strands], next to the coil made by the white strand, and then ties the strands in a knot. These three coils are called a segment.<br>Afterwards, one should leave a slight space, and then make a second segment using only the strand that was dyed <i>techelet</i>. Again, one should leave a slight space, and then make a third segment [using only the strand that was dyed <i>techelet</i> for this segment as well]. One should continue in this manner until the final segment, which is made of two coils of <i>techelet</i> and a final coil using a white strand.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The pattern of winding the <i>techelet</i> mentioned by the Rambam is based on his interpretation of <i>Menachot</i> 39a. As the Rambam mentions in Halachah 9, it must be followed only when the tzitzit include a strand of <i>techelet</i>. If they do not, as in the case of our tzitzit, different principles apply.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's approach and suggests a different manner of winding the coils of the tzitzit, which resembles the pattern we use today. The Rambam was aware of this approach and, in one of his responsa, explains that the method he mentioned has its source in the Talmud (<i>Menachot</i>, ibid.), while the other approach is of later origin.</i> Since one began with a white strand, one concludes with it, because one should always ascend to a higher level of holiness, but never descend.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Menachot</i>, ibid., states that since the white strand was used first, not ending with it would appear to detract from its importance.<br>The principle, "one should always ascend to a higher level of holiness, but never descend," is applied in many other contexts within Torah law - e.g., <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 3:17.</i><br>Why should one begin using a white strand? So that [the coil that is] next to the corner of the garment should be similar to [the garment itself].<br>The same pattern is followed regarding all four corners.
How many segments should be made at every corner? No fewer than seven and no more than thirteen.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 39a explains that the <i>techelet</i> reminds one of the heavens. There are seven heavens and six spaces between them, thus resulting in a total of thirteen.</i><br>[The above] represents the most preferable way of performing the mitzvah. If, however, one wound only one segment around the strands, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This law also applies at present, as mentioned in the following halachah.</i> Should one wind the <i>techelet</i> around the majority of the [length of the] tzitzit, it is acceptable. For the <i>techelet</i> to be attractive, [however,] all the segments should be in the upper third of the strands, and the [remaining] two thirds should hang loose.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. III, p. 228b, which explains the mystical significance of the division of the tzitzit into three portions.</i><br>One must separate the strands like the locks of one's hair.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 8:7) obligates one to separate the strands of the tzitzit before putting on one's garment. Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 8:18, which quotes the <i>Ari zal</i> as stating that the word ציצת is an acronym for the Hebrew words meaning, "A righteous person constantly separates his tzitzit."</i>
A person who makes [tzitzit using only] white threads without using <i>techelet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachot 4-5, the absence of <i>techelet</i> does not prevent one from fulfilling the mitzvah of tzitzit. Indeed, this is the manner in which most people fulfill the mitzvah at present.</i> should take one of the eight strands and wind it around the others, covering one third of [the length of] the strands and leaving two thirds hanging loose.<br>When winding [this strand around the others], one may create segments as one does when winding the <i>techelet</i>, if one desires. This is our custom. If, however, one desires to wind [the strand around the others] without creating segments, one may.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, besides the knot with which the tzitzit are attached to the garment (Halachah 7), the Rambam does not mention tying knots in the tzitzit at all. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:14) mentions the common practice in which five knots are tied on the strands, leaving four spaces, which are filled with coils in between them. There are certain authorities who combine the two opinions, tying the knots as mentioned in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, but dividing the coils into segments as the Rambam mentions (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:27-28,31).</i><br>The general principle is that one should intend that one third of the tzitzit be bound, and two thirds hang loose.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If the tzitzit lack entirely strands which hang loose, they are unacceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> There are those, however, who are not precise about this matter when [making tzitzit] with white threads [alone].<br>Should one wind a white thread around the majority [of the length] of the strands or should one make only a single segment,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This principle is also accepted by the opinions that do not require that the coils be divided into segments of three. Even so, for tzitzit to be acceptable, they must possess at least three coils (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 11:63,66).</i> [the tzitzit] are acceptable.
Both the white strands and those dyed <i>techelet</i> may be made out of entwined strands.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam leaves the use of entwined strands up to a person's choice. The Ra'avad objects, quoting a passage from the <i>Sifre</i> that requires that the strands of the tzitzit be made by entwining different threads together. Numbers 15:38 uses the expression, <i>p'til techelet</i>. The word <i>p'til</i> implies "twisted threads." See the <i>Targum Yonaton</i> to this verse. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:2) follows the Ra'avad's view and obligates the use of entwined strands. From Chapter 2, Halachah 7, it appears that the Rambam also considered this as the common practice.</i> Even a strand that is made from eight threads entwined into a single strand is considered as only a single strand in this context.
Both the white strands of the tzitzit and those dyed<i>techelet</i> must be spun for the sake of being used for [the mitzvah of] tzitzit.<br>[Tzitzit] may not be made from wool which becomes attached to thorns when sheep graze among them, nor from hairs which are pulled off the animal, and not from the leftover strands of the woof which the weaver leaves over when he completes a garment. Rather, they must be made from shorn wool or from flax.<br>[Tzitzit] may not be made from wool which was stolen, which came from an <i>ir hanidachat</i>, or which came from a consecrated animal. If such wool was used, it is unacceptable. If a person bows down to an animal, its wool is not acceptable for use for tzitzit. If, however, one bows down to flax which is planted, it is acceptable, because it has been changed.
Tzitzit that were made<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., attached to the garment and tied</i> by a gentile are not acceptable, as [implied by Numbers 15:38, which] states: "Speak to the children of Israel... and you shall make tzitzit for yourselves."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 42a relates that this verse serves as the source for the ruling that only a Jew may tie tzitzit.<br>The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> state that since the phrase ישראל בני literally means "sons of Israel," tzitzit should not be made by women. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:1) does not accept this opinion. The Ramah, however, states that it is preferable for women not to tie tzitzit.</i> If, however, a Jew made tzitzit without the intention [that they be used for the mitzvah], they are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This principle can be derived from the above concept. Were it necessary for the tzitzit to be tied with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah, there would be no need for a special verse from the Torah to teach that those made by a gentile are unacceptable. The concept would be self-explanatory. Whenever a deed must be performed with a specific intention, a gentile's acts are not acceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ashkenazic authorities do not accept this premise and maintain that, at the very least, the strands must be attached to the garment with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:2.)</i><br>Tzitzit that are made from those already existing are not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This principle is explained and illustrated in detail in the following four halachot.</i>
What is implied? Should a person bring the corner of a garment which has tzitzit attached to it and sew it onto another garment, it is not acceptable. [This applies] even if that corner of the garment is a square cubit in size.<br>[This concept is derived from Numbers 15:38, which] states: "And you shall make tzitzit for yourselves" - i.e., [you should make them] and not [use those] which were made previously,since this would be as if [the mitzvah] came about on its own accord.<br>It is permissible to remove strands [of tzitzit] - whether white or <i>techelet</i> - from one garment and tie them on another.
Should one suspend the strands between two corners of the garment and tie [tzitzit on] each of the corners in the proper manner, and then separate them from each other,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is speaking about the following instance: The person used long strands and placed one end of them through each of the two holes. Afterwards, using the strands from each corner that was not passed through the hole, he tied both tzitzit, and then separated them from each other.</i> it is unacceptable.<br>[The rationale is] that, at the time they were tied, they were unacceptable, since the two corners were connected with each other through the strands. When the strands were cut, two tzitzit were made. This is considered as making tzitzit from those which already exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This law is based on the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 11a-b. Others (see <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 11:13) interpret that passage as speaking about the tzitzit of a single corner. If one inserts a single long strand in the hole several times, thus producing eight strands, ties the tzitzit, and then separates the strands from each other, the tzitzit are not acceptable. This is also considered as making tzitzit from those which are already existing.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a person ties tzitzit over existing tzitzit: Should [he tie the second set] with the intention of nullifying the first set, if he unties or cuts off the first set,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:24, which describes the manner in which tzitzit should be removed from a garment.</i> the tzitzit are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since he intended to remove the initial tzitzit, there is nothing wrong with attaching the second one (<i>Menachot</i> 40b).</i><br>Should, however, [he have tied the second set] with the intention of adding [a second tzitzit, the tzitzit] are not acceptable even though he cuts one of them off.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, it does not matter which tzitzit he removes. For the tzitzit to be acceptable, both sets have to be removed, and then a single set retied.</i> When he added the second tzitzit, he disqualified both sets<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">By adding the second set, he transgresses the prohibition against adding to the mitzvot of the Torah. Therefore, both sets of tzitzit are disqualified. The Ra'avad and the Ashkenazic authorities do not accept the Rambam's decision. They maintain that while both sets of tzitzit are hanging from the garment, their existence is not considered at all significant. It is as if they do not exist at all. Therefore, by removing the extra set, one is not making tzitzit from ones which previously exist. On the contrary, one is bringing an acceptable set of tzitzit into existence.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10:6) accepts the Rambam's view. The Ramah, however, follows the other opinions.</i>, and when he unties or cuts off the additional one, the remaining one is [disqualified because it involves] making [tzitzit] from those which are already existing, since the manner in which it existed previously was not acceptable.
Similarly, all the tzitzit of a garment are unacceptable<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements have raised questions. Though all commentaries agree that the three tzitzit made when the garment had only three corners are unacceptable, the question revolves around the fourth corner. Why is the tzitzit made upon it disqualified? When it was made, the garment already had four corners. On this basis, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (10:6) rules that, indeed, the fourth tzitzit is not disqualified and may remain.</i><br>[in the following instance]: A person placed tzitzit on a garment that had three corners.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Tzitzit are required only on a garment with four corners, as stated in the proof-text quoted from Deuteronomy and mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 1.</i> afterwards, he made the garment a fourth corner and placed tzitzit on it. [This is also excluded by the commandment, Deuteronomy 22:12:]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements: In this halachah he cites the verse from Deuteronomy as a proof-text, while in Halachah 13 he cited a verse from Numbers.</i> "Make braids," [which implies that one may not use those] which were made previously.
A garment should not be folded in half, and then tzitzit hung on the four corners of the folded garment,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Although in its present state, the garment has four corners, unless it is sewn it is possible that the folds will open and the position of the corners will change (<i>Menachot</i> 41a). Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10:6), who quotes a difference of opinion where the tzitzit should be placed during the time the garment is folded. Because of this difference of opinion, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 10:13 suggests not wearing such a garment unless it is sewn closed.</i> unless one sews it along [one] side entirely. [It is sufficient, however, to sew it] on one side alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the explanation of the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10). Note, however, the explanation of the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 10.</i>
[The following rules apply] if the corner [of the garment] to which the tzitzit were attached is torn off the garment: If more than three fingerbreadths were torn, it may be sewed back in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">When the torn portion is three fingerbreadths long, it is considered as the "corner" of the garment. Therefore, the tzitzit are considered to be attached to a significant portion of the garment and need not be untied before the corner can be sewn back on the garment (<i>Nimukei Yosef, Menachot</i> 40b). The commentaries note the apparent contradiction between this law and Halachah 13, which forbids one to sew a piece of a garment to which tzitzit are attached to another garment. The commentaries differentiate between these two laws, explaining that there is a difference between a piece of fabric from another garment (Halachah 13) and a portion of the original garment which was detached (the present halachah). The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 15:3 does not accept this distinction, and maintains that even attaching a piece of the original garment is unacceptable. The later authorities suggest following this stringency.</i><br>If less than three fingerbreadths were torn off, it should not be sewn back.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">A portion of a garment less than three fingerbreadths long is not considered significant. Therefore, the tzitzit are no longer considered to be attached to part of the garment. Accordingly, when this fragment is sewn back to the garment, the tzitzit attached to it will be disqualified, based on the principle that one must make tzitzit and not use those existing previously. If, however, one untied the tzitzit, one may sew the detached corner back onto the garment, and then attach new tzitzit to it (Rav David Arameah).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes Rav Amram Gaon as stating that, if such a small portion was detached from the garment, tzitzit may never be attached to the garment again. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 15:4) suggests following this more stringent view if possible.</i><br>If the portion of the garment is between [the hole through which] the tzitzit [are attached] and the end of the garment, it is acceptable, even though only the smallest portion of the fabric remains.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Although initially the tzitzit had to be positioned a certain distance above the end of the garment, as mentioned in Halachah 6, after they were attached to the garment in the proper manner, there is greater leniency (<i>Menachot</i> 42a). The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:10) suggests sewing a border around the hole through which the strands are placed so that it will not tear.</i><br>Similarly, if the [length of the] strands of the tzitzit was reduced,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For example, they became torn. Based on <i>Menachot</i> 38b, the Rabbis have offered two interpretations of "enough to tie a loop":<br>a) enough to tie a loop around all the strands of the tzitzit;<br>b) enough to tie a loop around the strand itself.<br>The grammatical construction of the Rambam's statements indicates - albeit not definitely - that he favors the latter view.<br>(Note the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 12, which states that the measure "to tie a loop" surely does not exceed four centimeters.)<br>The Rambam maintains that even if the majority of all the strands of the tzitzit were cut off, as long as "enough to tie a loop remains," the tzitzit are acceptable. If, however, both ends of one long strand are cut off entirely, the tzitzit are not acceptable. Rabbenu Tam does not accept this decision and requires that at least two entire strands remain their full length. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 12:1.) The later authorities, particularly in the Ashkenazi community, suggest following Rabbenu Tam's view.</i> it is acceptable, as long as enough of the strand remains to tie a loop. Should, however, even a single strand be torn off [from the place to which it is attached to the garment], it is no longer acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 12:3.</i>

Chapter 2

The term <i>techelet</i> mentioned throughout the Torah refers to wool dyed light blue - i.e., the color of the sky which appears opposite the sun when there is a clear sky.<br>The term <i>techelet</i> when used regarding tzitzit refers to a specific dye that remains beautiful without changing. [If the <i>techelet</i>] is not dyed with this dye, it is unfit to be used as tzitzit even though it is sky blue in color. For example, using isatis, black dye, or other dark dyes, is unacceptable for tzitzit.<br>The wool of a ewe that a goat gave birth to is unacceptable for use as tzitzit.
How is the <i>techelet</i> of tzitzit dyed? Wool is taken and soaked in lime. Afterwards, it is taken and washed until it is clean and then boiled with bleach and the like, as is the dyers' practice, to prepare it to accept the dye. A chilazon is a fish whose color is like the color of the sea and whose blood is black like ink.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The identity of the chilazon is a matter of question. <i>Menachot</i> 44a states that it would be visible only once in seventy years. From <i>Bechorot</i> 6:2, one can infer that it was a long snakelike fish. From other sources, it appears to be a snaillike animal. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 4:1), the Rambam writes that <i>techelet</i> is no longer available. Similarly, Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi (who lived two generations before the Rambam) writes that "we do not have <i>techelet</i>."<br>Approximately one hundred years ago, Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner attempted to reintroduce a dye which he determined to be<i>techelet</i>. Similarly, Rabbi Herzog, the first Chief Rabbi of Israel, attempted to locate the chilazon. Although, from a theoretical perspective, the Torah community appreciated the value of their research, in practice, their decisions were not accepted by the majority of Torah scholars.</i> It is found in the Mediterranean Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Though ים המלח generally refers to the Dead Sea, there are times when the Rambam uses this term to refer to the Mediterranean. See the conclusion of his Commentary on the Mishnah.</i><br> The blood is placed in a pot together with herbs - e.g., chamomile - as is the dyers' practice. It is boiled and then the wool is inserted. [It is left there] until it becomes sky-blue. This is the manner in which the <i>techelet</i> of tzitzit [is made].
One must dye tzitzit <i>techelet</i> with the intention that it be used for the mitzvah. If one did not have such an intention, it is unacceptable.<br>When one places some wool in the pot in which the dye was placed, to check whether the dye is good or not, the entire pot may no longer be used [for tzitzit].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 42b interprets the phrase, "totally <i>techelet</i>" (Exodus 28:31 , to mean that the entire dye must be intended for a ritual purpose.</i> [If so,] how should one check [the dye]? He should take some dye from the pot in a small container and place the wool he uses to check in it. Afterwards, he should burn the wool used to check - for it was dyed for the purpose of checking<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, it is unfit to be used for tzitzit. This wool should be burned lest it be discovered by someone else and unknowingly used for tzitzit.</i> - and pour out the dye used to check it, since using it for an experiment disqualified it. Afterwards, he should dye [the wool] <i>techelet</i> with the remainder of the dye which was not used.
<i>Techelet</i> should only be purchased from a recognized dealer because we are concerned that perhaps it was not dyed with the intention that it be used for the mitzvah. Even though it was purchased from a recognized dealer, if it was checked,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was purchased from a recognized dealer, there is no obligation to check it. Nevertheless, if it was checked, it can be disqualified. See Halachah 6.</i> and it was discovered that it was dyed with another dark dye which is not of a permanent nature, it is not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements appear to imply that the blood of the chilazon must be used for tzitzit, not because of a Torah decree, but because it was the only lasting dye they had (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).</i>
How can <i>techelet</i> be checked to see whether it has been dyed properly or not? One takes straw, the secretion of a snail, and urine that had been left standing for forty days and leaves the<i>techelet</i> in this mixture for an entire day. If the color of the<i>techelet</i> remained unchanged, without becoming weaker, it is acceptable.<br>If it became weaker, we place the <i>techelet</i> which changed color inside a dough of barley meal that was left to sour for fish brine. The dough is baked in an oven, and then the <i>techelet</i> is removed. If it became even weaker than it was previously, it is unacceptable. If this strengthened the color and it became darker than it was before being baked, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">These processes are mentioned in <i>Menachot</i> 42b-43a.</i>
One may purchase <i>techelet</i> from an outlet which has established a reputation for authenticity without question. It need not be checked. One may continue to rely [on its reputation] until a reason for suspicion arises.<br>Should one entrust <i>techelet</i> to a gentile for safekeeping, it is no longer fit for use, [because] we fear that he exchanged it. If it was in a container and closed with two seals, one seal inside the other,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The concept of two seals is explained in the laws of kashrut. See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 13:8.</i> it is acceptable. If, however, it had only a single seal, it may not be used.
If a person found <i>techelet</i> in the marketplace - even strands which were cut - it is not fit for use.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Even if it proves to be <i>techelet</i>, we assume that it was not dyed for the purpose of being used for tzitzit.</i>If they were twisted together, however, they are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that twisted strands of <i>techelet</i> were made to be used for tzitzit. It is unlikely that someone would go to the trouble of twisting strands of <i>techelet</i> for any other purpose. (See the Ra'avad.)<br>Our text follows the standard published versions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, which is supported by a responsum purported to have been written by the Rambam. The original printings and many authoritative editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state that even twisted strands of <i>techelet</i> are not acceptable when found in the marketplace. This version appears to be supported by the Rambam's ruling, <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 19:24, which is based on the same Talmudic passage, <i>Eruvin</i> 96b.</i><br>[The following rules apply when] a person purchases a garment to which tzitzit are attached in the marketplace. When he purchases it from a Jew, he may presume [that it is acceptable]. If he purchases it from a gentile merchant, it is [presumed to be] acceptable;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that a merchant will not risk tarnishing his reputation by misrepresenting an article.</i><br> from a non-Jew who is a private person, it is not acceptable.
When a garment is entirely red, green, or any other color [besides white], its white strands should be made from the same color as the garment itself. If it is green, they should be green. If it is red, they should be red.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this decision is that tzitzit must be "of the same type of fabric as the fringe of the garment." This also implies that they should share the same color as the fringe (Rashi, <i>Menachot</i> 43b).<br>This decision is not shared by <i>Tosafot, Menachot</i> 41b, which rules that white strands are appropriate even when the garment itself is of another color. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 9:5) mentions that those who are precise in their performance of mitzvot follow the Rambam's view. The Ramah, however, maintains that one should use white tzitziot for all garments.</i><br>Should the garment itself be <i>techelet</i>, its white strands should be made from any color other than black,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the Rambam's statements are not an exact quote from his source, <i>Menachot</i>, ibid., which substitutes the word <i>kelah ilan</i> instead of black. <i>Kelah ilan</i> is a dye which looks almost exactly the same as <i>techelet</i> except that it is not made from the blood of the chilazon. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> suggests that the Rambam meant that any dark color is unacceptable although lighter colors would be acceptable. It is necessary that there be a contrast between the color of the strands of tzitzit, just as there is a contrast between white and <i>techelet</i>.</i><br> for it resembles <i>techelet</i>. He should wind one strand of <i>techelet</i> around all the strands, as one does with other tzitzit that are not colored.
The punishment given someone who does not wear [tzitzit of white strands] is more severe than that given one who does not wear <i>techelet</i>, because the white strands are easily accessible while <i>techelet</i> is not available in every time and in every era, because of the [unique] dye mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Even in Talmudic times, <i>techelet</i> was very expensive and difficult to obtain. As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, according to most authorities, <i>techelet</i> is not available in the present era, nor has it been available for at least 1000 years.<br>144</i>

A garment to which the Torah obligates a person to attach tzitzit<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">With this expression, the Rambam could be alluding to the concept that a person is not obligated to wear tzitzit.

In contrast, a garment made of other fabrics<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">for example, clothes of silk, cotton, camels' wool, hares' wool, goats' wool, - The term "wool" when used without any modifier refers to wool from sheep or rams alone.</i> - for example, clothes of silk, cotton, camels' wool, hares' wool, goats' wool, and the like<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">are required to have tzitzit only because of Rabbinic decree - The Rambam's opinion is quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 9:1). The Ashkenazic authorities, however (see the Ramah), disagree and maintain that all four-cornered garments require tzitzit regardless of the fabric they are made of. This difference of opinion results from the interpretation of a debate between Amoraim (<i>Menachot</i> 39b).<br>Because of this difference of opinion, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 9:6) suggests that everyone wear a <i>tallit</i> of wool, so that he will fulfill the mitzvah as required by the Torah according to all opinions. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 9:4 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 9:5 suggest that a God-fearing person should have both his <i>tallit gadol</i> and his <i>tallit katan</i> made of wool.

If a garment is made of cloth<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">any cloth, not only wool or linen</i> and its corners of leather, it requires tzitzit.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The same law applies when not only the corners, but also a portion of the garment itself, is leather. As long as the majority of the garment is cloth, it requires tzitzit (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 10:8; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 10:10).</i> If the garment is of leather and its corners are of cloth,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In this case as well, as long as the majority of the garment is leather</i> it does not require tzitzit.

For a garment of wool, the white strands should be made of wool.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">alone.</i> For a garment of linen, the white strands should be made of linen.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">alone. Note the explanation in the following halachah.</i> For garments of other [fabrics],<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 2, there is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis whether garments made from fabrics other than wool or linen require tzitzit or not. According to the opinions which maintain that they do, the concepts that follow are derived from the exegesis of a Biblical verse. (See <i>Menachot</i> 39b.) According to the Rambam, who maintains that the requirement of tzitzit on these garments is Rabbinic in origin, we must assume that these concepts were part of the Rabbinic ordinance requiring tzitzit for these garments (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> the white strands should be made from the same fabric as the garment itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The authorities who consider the obligation to attach tzitzit to such garments as stemming from the Torah explain that, in the commandment to attach tzitzit, the Torah mentions the word "corner" an extra time, to teach that the tzitzit should be made of the same fabric as the corners.</i> For example, silk strands should be used for a silk garment, strands of goats' wool should be used for garments of goats' wool.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">If one chooses to make tzitzit from these fabrics, one should use them for all four tzitzit. It is questionable whether it is acceptable to make some of the tzitzit of a specific garment from wool and others from the fabric of which the garment is made (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 9:4).</i><br>If one desired to make white strands of wool or linen<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 9:2) states that at present it is customary not to make linen tzitzit at all.</i> for [garments of] any type [of fabric], one may,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i>, ibid., derives this concept from the fact that Deuteronomy 22:12 mentions the mitzvah to attach tzitzit to our garments directly after the mention of the prohibition of making garments of wool and linen. Our Sages explain, that although mixtures of wool and linen are forbidden in general, such a mixture is required in tzitzit. (See the following two halachot.) Therefore, whenever tzitzit are made, either of these two fabrics may be used.</i> because [strands of] wool and linen can fulfill the obligation [of tzitzit] for garments made of their own fabric or for garments made of other fabrics.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg maintains, however, that wool and linen strands alone are not sufficient, and only a combination of wool and linen including strands of <i>techelet</i> can be used to fulfill the obligation of tzitzit for garments made from other fabrics. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 9:4 suggests considering this opinion.</i> In contrast, [strands made] from other fabrics can fulfill the obligation [of tzitzit] only for garments made of their own fabric.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 9:5 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 9:10,13 which discuss a situation where the garment is woven from both wool and another fabric.</i>
What is the ruling regarding making woolen strands for a garment of linen or linen strands for a garment of wool<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">even though we are speaking only of the white strands without techelet? - It appears that the Rambam is asking about attaching tzitzit that have only white strands, without attaching <i>techelet</i>. Thus, one can conclude that when attaching tzitzit to a linen garment, it is forbidden to make the white strands of wool even though one includes a woolen strand of<i>techelet</i>. Though the prohibition against <i>sha'atnez</i> is lifted for this garment, it is lifted only when there is no alternative but to do so (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> - even though we are speaking only of the white strands without <i>techelet</i>?<br>One might think that it should be permitted, because <i>sha'atnez</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">a mixture of wool and linen which is forbidden. (See Deuteronomy 22:11 and <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i>, Chapter 10.)</i> is permitted to be used for tzitzit, as evident from the fact that <i>techelet</i> is made using woolen strands,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachot 1- 2.</i> and yet it should be placed on a linen garment.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">according to Torah law. See, however, the following halachah.</i> Nevertheless, this<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Using linen strands for a woolen garment or vice versa</i> is not done.<br>Why? Because it is possible to make the white strands from the same fabric as [the garment].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Woolen strands for a woolen garment, linen strands for a linen garment, and thus skirt the prohibition entirely.</i> Whenever [a conflict exists] between the observance of a positive commandment and the adherence to a negative commandment, [the following rules apply]:<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The following are general rules which apply, not only regarding tzitzit, but in other circumstances as well: for example, <i>Hilchot Milah</i> 1:9.</i> If it is possible to observe both of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">by fulfilling the positive commandment without breaking the prohibition</i> one should. If not, the observance of the positive commandment supersedes the negative commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Nissim Gaon explains that although the violation of a negative commandment receives a more severe punishment than the failure to observe a positive commandment, when God originally gave the negative commandments, He prescribed that they do not apply when adherence to them causes the performance of a positive commandment to be nullified.<br>The <i>Tanya</i> (<i>Iggeret HaTeshuvah</i>, Chapter 1) explains the rationale for this principle. Man's purpose in this world is to spread Godly light through the observance of mitzvot. Accordingly, the observance of these mitzvot is always given preference when there is such a conflict.<br>It must be emphasized that one must fulfill the mitzvah at the time one is violating the transgression. It is forbidden, however, in order to break a commandment to later perform a mitzvah.</i> In the present instance, however, it is possible to observe both of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">as explained above.<br>144</i>
<i>Techelet</i> should not be attached to a linen garment.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This decree was imposed even when <i>techelet</i> was available.</i> Rather, one should [make the tzitzit] from white threads of linen alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">even though by doing so, one does not fulfill the mitzvah of tzitzit to the fullest degree.</i> This is not because [the prohibition against] <i>sha'atnez</i> supersedes [the mitzvah of] tzitzit, but rather it is a Rabbinical decree<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis have the power to ordain that a person bypass the performance of a Torah commandment. Surely this applies in the present instance, when the mitzvah of tzitzit is not nullified entirely.</i> [imposed] lest one wear the garment at night,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, the Rambam does not quote his apparent source (<i>Menachot</i> 40b) exactly. The Talmud states "lest one wear a garment of the night." The Rambam's change of phraseology teaches two concepts. First, that not only a garment which is generally worn at night, but even one which is worn primarily during the day, should not have <i>techelet</i> attached to it, lest one wear it during the night.<br>This also sheds light on a more involved issue. There is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if the exclusion of wearing tzitzit at night applies to all tzitzit, or if it applies only to garments which are worn primarily at night. According to the latter opinion, garments worn primarily at night do not require tzitzit, even when worn during the day. In contrast, a garment which is worn primarily during the day requires tzitzit, even during the night and one does not transgress the prohibition against <i>sha'atnez</i> when wearing it at that time.<br>By altering the terminology used by the Talmud, the Rambam indicates his acceptance of the first perspective. Rabbenu Asher is the primary exponent of the second position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 18:1) mentions both views without reaching a conclusion.</i> when one is not required to wear tzitzit, and thus violate a negative commandment when the performance of a positive commandment is not involved.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 10:32, which mentions a similar concept regarding the priestly garments. The sash worn by the priests was made from <i>sha'atnez</i>. Therefore, the priests were allowed to wear it only when they were actually involved in the Temple service. Wearing it at other times constitutes a transgression, and not a mitzvah.<br>Significantly, Rabbenu Tam differs with the Rambam and allows the sash and tzitzit to be worn even during the times when doing so does not fulfill a mitzvah.</i><br>[This is because] the obligation to wear tzitzit applies during the day, but not at night [as can be inferred from Numbers 15:39]: "And you shall see them."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 8:13, which states that this verse also implies that one should wear tzitzit in a manner in which the strands can be seen.</i> [The mitzvah applies only] during a time when one can see.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the daytime hours. Note the <i>Chatam Sofer</i> and Rabbi Akiva Eiger (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 18), who mention opinions that maintain that the mitzvah is not limited by the times of day and night, but rather by situations when one can see the tzitzit. During a daytime eclipse, one would not be obligated.</i> [Nevertheless,] a blind man is obligated to wear tzitzit. Even though he does not see them, others see him [wearing them].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">There is no question concerning a blind man's obligation. He is required to wear tzitzit and may recite a blessing beforehand (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 17:1).</i>
A person is permitted to wear tzitzit at night,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., doing so is not a transgression of the prohibition against adding to the performance of a mitzvah.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 21:15 quotes the <i>Ari zal</i>, as advising one to sleep in a <i>tallit katan</i> at night.</i> both during the weekdays<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yitzchak Abuhav maintains that this law applies even to tzitzit containing <i>techelet</i>.

This ruling is based on the rationale that both the child and the adult share the same degree of obligation, a Rabbinical decree.

What is the nature of the obligation of the commandment of tzitzit? Every person who is obligated to fulfill this mitzvah,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., adult males, as explained in the previous halachah</i> if he wears a garment requiring tzitzit,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 1-4.</i> should attach tzitzit to it and then wear it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">if he desires to do so.</i> If he wears it without attaching tzitzit to it, he has negated [this] positive commandment.<br>There is, however, no obligation to attach tzitzit to a garment which requires tzitzit, as long as it remains folded in its place, without a person wearing it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">13The Rambam wants to emphasize that</i> It is not that a garment requires [tzitzit].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements in this halachah revolve around a difference of opinion of our Sages, <i>Menachot</i> 42b. There are Sages who maintain that tzitzit is an obligation that depends on the garment - i.e., the mitzvah is completed by placing tzitzit on every garment which requires them. The other opinion states that tzitzit are an obligation incumbent on a person, that a person is required to attach tzitzit to his garments. The Rambam rephrases the latter opinion as follows:</i> Rather, the requirement is incumbent on the person [wearing] the garment.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">With this choice of phraseology, he desires to indicate that - in contrast to other mitzvot (e.g., tefillin) - there is no obligation from the Torah to wear tzitzit every day. Only when a person desires to wear a garment that requires tzitzit is he obligated to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>This conception represents a change of position for the Rambam. Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, whose decisions the Rambam frequently followed, maintains that each person is obligated to wear tzitzit, apparently indicating that tzitzit, like tefillin, are an obligation which a person is required to fulfill.<br>The Rambam apparently held this view himself at one time. Therefore, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, at the conclusion of the listing of the positive commandments, he lists tzitzit (together with tefillin) as one of the positive commandments whose observance we must pursue. Here, his choice of phraseology indicates that, although the mitzvah is incumbent on the person, it does relate to the garment. Only when a person wears a garment which requires tzitzit is he obligated to fulfill the mitzvah.</i>
Even though a person is not obligated to purchase a tallit and wrap himself in it so that he must attach tzitzit to it,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">as explained in the previous halachah.</i> it is not proper for a person to release himself from this commandment. Instead, he should always try to be wrapped in a garment which requires tzitzit so that he will fulfill this mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">because of the importance of this mitzvah, as mentioned in the following halachah.<br>The Rambam mentions being "wrapped in a garment requiring tzitzit," an expression which appears to refer to a <i>tallit gadol</i>, a garment of the size and cut appropriate for "wrapping oneself." Significantly, throughout these halachot, he has used that term and never makes any reference to a <i>tallit katan</i>, the smaller garment which is colloquially called "tzitzit" today.<br>In Talmudic times, draping oneself with a garment that resembled our <i>tallitot gedolot</i> was common, but in different lands and different eras, the style of dress changed and, except for sages who would spend their day involved in study, it was rare that a person would wear a <i>tallit gadol</i> throughout the day. Accordingly, the people took to wearing the smaller <i>tallit katan</i>, which could be accommodated to other styles of dress more easily.<br>There is no explicit mention of a <i>tallit katan</i> in the Talmud, although a story related in <i>Menachot</i> 44a appears to indicate that such garments were worn in that era as well. The writings of the early Ashkenazic and later Sephardic rabbis of the Middle Ages mention the wearing of a <i>tallit katan</i> as an accepted practice.</i><br>In particular, care should be taken regarding this matter during prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam does not specify the morning service. Perhaps he refers to the afternoon service as well.</i> It is very shameful for a Torah scholar to pray without being wrapped [in a tallit].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 17b, which relates that when God revealed the thirteen qualities of mercy to Moses, "He wrapped Himself [in a tallit] like a leader of prayer and taught him the order of prayer."</i>
A person should always be careful regarding the mitzvah of tzitzit, because the Torah considered it equal to all the mitzvot and considered them all as dependent on it, as [implied by Numbers 15:39]: "And you shall see them and remember all the mitzvot of God."
