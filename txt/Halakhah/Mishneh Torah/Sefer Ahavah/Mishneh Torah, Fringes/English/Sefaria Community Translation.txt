Mishneh Torah, Fringes



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3









And it is permissible to enter a toilet or a bathouuse with fringes. If the white or turquoise (<i>techelet</i>) strings get severed, they can be thrown to the trash heap, since it is a commandment that has no holiness it its substance. And it is forbidden to sell a fringed garment to a non-Jew until he removes the fringes - not because there is holiness in the substance, but rather lest he wrap himself with it and a Jew should accompany him, [since the non-Jew] will appear to him to be a Jew, and he will (be able to surprise him and) kill him. Women and slaves and children are exempt from fringes from the Torah. But it is from the words of the [rabbis] that every child who knows how to wrap himself is obligated [to wear] fringes, in order to educate him in the commandments. And women and slaves that want to wrap themselves with fringes, may wrap themselves without a blessing. And so [too] other positive commandments that women are exempted from; if they want to do them without a blessing, we do not protest against them. A <i>tumtum</i> (a person with recessed sexual organs) and an <i>androginos</i> (a person with both male and female sexual organs) are obligated in all [of these commandments] because of a doubt. Therefore, they should not recite a blessing, but rather do them without a blessing.
