Mishneh Torah, Prayer and the Priestly Blessing



Chapter 1

It is a positive Torah commandment to pray every day, as [Exodus 23:25] states: "You shall serve God, your Lord." Tradition teaches us that this service is prayer, as [Deuteronomy 11:13] states: "And serve Him with all your heart" and our Sages said: Which is the service of the heart? This is prayer.<br>The number of prayers is not prescribed in the Torah, nor does it prescribe a specific formula for prayer. Also, according to Torah law, there are no fixed times for prayers.
Therefore, women and slaves are obligated to pray, since it is not a time-oriented commandment.<br>Rather, this commandment obligates each person to offer supplication and prayer every day and utter praises of the Holy One, blessed be He; then petition for all his needs with requests and supplications; and finally, give praise and thanks to God for the goodness that He has bestowed upon him; each one according to his own ability.
A person who was eloquent would offer many prayers and requests. [Conversely,] a person who was inarticulate would speak as well as he could and whenever he desired.<br>Similarly, the number of prayers was dependent on each person's ability. Some would pray once daily; others, several times.<br>Everyone would pray facing the Holy Temple, wherever he might be. This was the ongoing practice from [the time of] Moshe Rabbenu until Ezra.
When Israel was exiled in the time of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, they became interspersed in Persia and Greece and other nations. Children were born to them in these foreign countries and those children's language was confused.<br>The speech of each and every one was a concoction of many tongues. No one was able to express himself coherently in any one language, but rather in a mixture [of languages], as [Nehemiah 13:24] states: "And their children spoke half in Ashdodit and did not know how to speak the Jewish language. Rather, [they would speak] according to the language of various other peoples."<br>Consequently, when someone would pray, he would be limited in his ability to request his needs or to praise the Holy One, blessed be He, in Hebrew, unless other languages were mixed in with it. When Ezra and his court saw this, they established eighteen blessings in sequence.<br>The first three [blessings] are praises of God and the last three are thanksgiving. The intermediate [blessings] contain requests for all those things that serve as general categories for the desires of each and every person and the needs of the whole community.<br>Thus, the prayers could be set in the mouths of everyone. They could learn them quickly and the prayers of those unable to express themselves would be as complete as the prayers of the most eloquent. It was because of this matter that they established all the blessings and prayers so that they would be ordered in the mouths of all Israel, so that each blessing would be set in the mouth of each person unable to express himself.
They also decreed that the number of prayers correspond to the number of sacrifices - i.e., two prayers every day, corresponding to the two daily sacrifices. On any day that an additional sacrifice [was offered], they instituted a third prayer, corresponding to the additional offering.<br>The prayer that corresponds to the daily morning sacrifice is called the Shacharit Prayer. The prayer that corresponds to the daily sacrifice offered in the afternoon is called the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer and the prayer corresponding to the additional offerings is called the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer.
They also instituted a prayer to be recited at night, since the limbs of the daily afternoon offering could be burnt the whole night, as [Leviticus 6:2] states: "The burnt offering [shall remain on the altar hearth all night until morning]." In this vein, [Psalms 55:18] states: "In the evening, morning and afternoon I will speak and cry aloud, and He will hear my voice."<br>The Evening Prayer is not obligatory, as are the Morning and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers. Nevertheless, the Jewish people, in all the places that they have settled, are accustomed to recite the Evening Prayer and have accepted it upon themselves as an obligatory prayer.
Similarly, they instituted a prayer after the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer [to be recited] close to sunset on fast days only, its purpose being to increase supplication and pleading because of the fast.<br>This is called the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer, as if to say that the gates of Heaven are closed behind the sun, which becomes hidden, since it is recited only close to [the time of] sunset.
Thus, three prayers are recited daily: the Evening Prayer, the Morning Prayer, and the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. There are four on Sabbaths, festivals and Rosh Chodesh: the three that are recited daily and the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer. On Yom Kippur, there are five: these four and the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer.
The number of these prayers may not be diminished, but may be increased. If a person wants to pray all day long, he may.<br>Any prayer that one adds is considered as a freewill offering. Therefore, one must add a new idea consistent with that blessing in each of the middle blessings. [However], making an addition of a new concept even in only one blessing is sufficient in order to make known that this is a voluntary prayer and not obligatory.<br>In the first three [blessings] and the last three [blessings], one must never add, detract or change anything at all.
The community should not recite a voluntary prayer, since the community does not bring a freewill offering. Even an individual should not recite the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer twice, once as the obligation of the day and the other as a voluntary prayer, because the additional offering is never a freewill offering.<br>One of the <i>Geonim</i> taught that it is forbidden to recite a voluntary prayer on Sabbaths or holidays, since freewill offerings were not sacrificed on these days, but only the obligatory offerings of the day.

Chapter 2

In the days of Rabban Gamliel,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question which Rabban Gamliel the Rambam refers to. <i>Seder Hadorot</i> points to Rabban Gamliel, the elder, grandson of Hillel the Elder, who lived in the first half of the first century of the Common Era. <i>Dorot Harishonim</i>, however, believes this to refer to the latter's grandson, who headed the Rabbinical court in Yavneh from 80 CE, after it was established there by Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai following the destruction of the Second Temple.</i> the numbers of heretics among the Jews increased.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam describes a heretic (<i>apikoros</i>) as one who denies the notion of prophecy or the idea that knowledge could be transmitted from the Creator to human beings, one who refutes the prophecy of Moshe Rabbenu, or one who denies God's omniscience regarding the actions of human beings.<br>Some manuscript editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> use the word <i>min</i> (non-believer) instead of <i>apikoros</i>. In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:7, the Rambam describes the <i>min</i> as one who does not believe in God, whereas the heretic denies not God, but Torah.<br>Historically, this could refer to the Saducees and other Jews with assimilationist tendencies that began to multiply at this time. Though they were definitely a minority among the people, their number was signficant enough to warrant concern. Others interpret this as a reference to the early Christians who launched many missionary campaigns to attract the Jews.</i> They would oppress the Jews<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">by slandering them to the Roman conquerors.</i> and entice them to turn away from God.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">and adopt other lifestyles as above.<br>Since he saw this as the greatest need of the people, - for the devotion to Torah is the backbone of our people's continuity</i><br>Since he saw this as the greatest need of the people,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">for the devotion to Torah is the backbone of our people's continuity.</i> he and his court established one blessing that contains a request to God to destroy the heretics. He inserted it into the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> so that it would be arranged in the mouths of all.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 28b relates: Rabban Gamliel said to the Sages: "Is there no one who knows how to establish the blessing of the nonbelievers?" Shmuel Hakatan rose and composed it. <i>Olat Re'iah</i> explains why this Sage was chosen: All of our great and wise Sages were able to compose the other blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> which are full of love and giving. The blessing of the heretics differs for it appears full of hate and destruction. The composition of this blessing required great care, since the content must not imply the hatred of people per se, but a righteous indignation, born out of love for God and the pain felt when His Majesty is not honored. Shmuel HaKatan authored the famous statement: "Refrain from joy at the fall of your enemies" (<i>Pirkei Avot</i> 4:19). Thus, he was most worthy to author this blessing. His zealousness bore no trace whatsoever of hate, but was a true reflection of his unbounded love for God and His Torah.</i> Consequently, there are nineteen blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">We do, however, still call the prayer the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, based on its original eighteen blessings.</i>
In each <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., in all three prayer services</i> every day, a person should recite these nineteen blessings in the proper order.<br>When does the above apply? When his concentration is not disturbed and he is able to read fluently.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., when he is able to pray with the proper intention and recite the words properly and clearly.</i> However, if he is distracted and bothered, or unable to pray fluently, he should recite the first three [blessings],<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 28b, states:<br>Rabban Gamliel says that one should recite eighteen blessings each and every day (i.e., that each time he prays he should recite all eighteen blessings).Rabbi Yehoshua says that one should recite the abbreviated version of the eighteen.Rabbi Akiva says that if the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is fluent in his mouth he should recite all eighteen blessings; and if not, the abbreviated version of the eighteen blessings.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 110:1 states that in unusual circumstances, e.g., when travelling or when in a place where he would be distracted or interrupted, one may recite the shortened version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> adds that in normal circumstances, one is forbidden to recite this prayer. It is questionable if this is also the Rambam's intent or if he was more lenient and allowed such a prayer to be recited by a person who had difficulty concentrating even under ordinary conditions.</i> one blessing that summarizes all the intermediate ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">as stated in the following Halachah.</i> and the last three [blessings], and [thereby] fulfill his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The first and last three blessings may not be shortened or changed in any way, as we learned in Chapter 1, Halachah 9.</i>

The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God (Psalms 111:10 - i.e., our involvement in Torah is ultimately that which leads us to true fear of Heaven and <i>Teshuvah</i> (repentance).</i> Forgive us<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This corresponds to the blessing סלח לנו (Forgive us...), the third of the intermediate blessings.</i> so that we will be redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This relates to the fourth blessing, גואל ישראל (the Redeemer of Israel).</i> Distance us from pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This corresponds to the blessing of רפואה (healing), the fifth intermediate blessing.</i> Cause us to prosper and to dwell in the pastures of Your land.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This relates to ברכת השנים, the blessing for material wealth. It is interesting that this blessing also mentions specifically the idea of dwelling in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as the ultimate prosperity and blessing.<br>The Zohar explains that all blessing and bounty enters the world through <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and from there it is apportioned to the rest of the world. Jerusalem and the Holy Temple serve as the repositories for Divine grace and act as the meeting point between Heaven - the source of the bounty - and earth, the recipient of this blessing. Therefore, true prosperity, in both a material and spiritual sense, can only be achieved in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i><br>Gather the scattered from the four [corners of the earth].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This corresponds to the blessing of the gathering of the exiles, the seventh intermediate blessing.</i> Judge those led astray in accordance with Your knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This relates to the eighth intermediate blessing, "Return our judges..."</i> Raise Your hand over the wicked,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This corresponds to the blessing of the nonbelievers (Halachah 1). Even though this was not part of the original eighteen blessings, it was also incorporated into the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.</i> and let the righteous rejoice<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This relates to the tenth intermediate blessing, על הצדיקים (upon the righteous). In that blessing we ask God to grant a just reward to the righteous and pious. The text of this blessing also clarifies the Sages' appreciation of this reward - the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Temple - as expressed in the continuation of this section of the blessing.</i> in the building of Your city and the reestablishment of Your sanctuary,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">this corresponds to the blessing of the rebuilding of Jerusalem, the eleventh intermediate blessing.</i> in the flourishing of the might of David, Your servant, and in the clear shining light of the son of Yishai, Your anointed one.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This relates to the twelfth blessing, called the blessing of the Messiah, the descendant of David.</i><br>Before we call, You answer, as [Isaiah 65:24] states: "And before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I heed,"<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 29a does not quote this verse or any other verse.

When does the above apply? In the summer.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Only then, may one recite the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> mentioned in the above two halachot.</i> However, in the winter, one should not recite "Give us knowledge...,"<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Havineinu</i>, the first word of the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, is used to refer to the entire prayer.</i> since he must mention "the petition"<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">for dew and rain that is included...</i> in the blessing for material wealth.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This petition is recited only in the winter as explained in Halachot 16 and 17. The omission of this petition would render the abbreviated <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> incomplete.<br><i>Berachot</i> 29a suggests that perhaps the petition for dew and rain could be added to the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the appropriate time of year, but rejects this idea. Because of the infrequency with which one would normally recite this blessing, any change in the text would confuse people and result in errors.</i><br>Similarly, on Saturday nights and the nights after a holiday, one should not recite "Give us knowledge...," since one must say <i>Havdalah</i> in [the blessing of] the One who bestows knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">to differentiate between the previous holy day and the upcoming day. This prayer is added in the first intermediate blessing of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>: חונן הדעת ("the One who bestows knowledge") as explained in Halachah 12.<br><i>Berachot</i> 29a also suggests adding the <i>Havdalah</i> prayer in the abbreviated summary of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, distinguishing between the inclusion of <i>Havdalah</i> and the petition for rain, which could not be mentioned in the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> as explained above.<br>They explain that <i>Havdalah</i> is recited in the first of the intermediate blessings and would therefore be easy to remember and not cause errors, whereas the petition for rain is in the middle, when concentration is more difficult.<br>The question is left unresolved in the Talmud and therefore, some authorities allow it to be included in the abbreviated version. However, most do not. Rabbenu Yonah explains that it is omitted because its mention would create the impression that <i>Havdalah</i> was a blessing in its own right, just as all the other statements in this version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> are shortened versions of individual blessings.</i>
On Sabbaths and holidays,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These are days of joy and thanksgiving when pleading and supplication are not appropriate.

The sanctification of the holidays is determined by the Jewish people since the exact date of each festival is based on the establishment of Rosh Chodesh (the first day of the month) of that particular month.<br>In <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 2:10, the Rambam explains that we are obligated to rely on the day established Rosh Chodesh by the Jewish court. This matter was handed over to them completely. God, who commanded the observance of the holiday, commanded us to rely on them.<br>This concept is based on the verse in Leviticus 23:4: "These are the appointed days of God, sacred days, that you shall designate them in their appointed time." The word אתם, <i>otam</i>, translated as “them,” may, with a different pronunciation mark be read as <i>otam</i>, “you,” indicating that “you,” the court on the earthly plane, is responsible for the establishment of the times of the festivals based on their designation of the day of Rosh Chodesh.Therefore, we first mention God's sanctification of Israel and then Israel's subsequent sanctification of the holidays.</i> When the Sabbath and a festival [coincide], he concludes with "who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the appointed<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beitzah</i> 17a discusses this particular situation:<br>A holiday that falls on Sabbath: Beit Shammai says that one recites eight [blessings], reciting the blessing for Sabbath independently and the blessing for the holiday independently.Beit Hillel says that one recites seven [blessings], beginning with Sabbath and concluding with Sabbath, reciting the blessing particular to the sanctity of the holiday in the middle.Rebbe [Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi] says that one should conclude with "who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the appointed times."A student was reviewing [this matter] in the presence of Ravina and said "who sanctifies Israel, Sabbath and the appointed times." Ravina said to him: "And is Sabbath sanctified by Israel? Sabbath is eternally sanctified. Rather, one should say: 'who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the appointed times.'”Rav Yosef says: "The halachah follows Rebbe and Ravina's answer."</i> times."<br>On Rosh Hashanah, he concludes with "the King over all the Earth, who sanctifies Israel and the Day of Remembrance." If it is [also] the Sabbath, he concludes with "the King over all the Earth, who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Remembrance."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">We mention God's sovereignty for the essence of the service of Rosh HaShanah is the acceptance of God as our King (See <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 16a).<br>Rosh Hashanah is called the Day of Remembrance, since on this day, we ask God to remember us for good and to bless us. This will be discussed in the context of the blessings of the Rosh Hashanah <i>Musaf</i> Prayer in the next halachah.</i>
When does this<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the previously stated halachah that one recites seven blessings on Rosh Hashanah</i> apply? In the Evening Prayers, the Morning Prayers and the <i>Minchah</i> Prayers.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These services resemble those of other holidays.</i> However, in the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer on Rosh Hashanah, one recites nine blessings: the first three and the last three [recited] every day,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">for these are constants in all prayer services.</i> and three intermediate blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 16a mentions the source for these blessings, quoting God as saying: "On Rosh Hashanah, recite in My presence <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot</i> and <i>Shofarot</i>. <i>Malchuyot</i>, in order that you shall make Me King over you. <i>Zichronot</i>, in order that your remembrance will be good in front of Me, and with what?

The Rambam's text appears to be based on the Siddur of Rav Sa'adiah Gaon.<br>If [Yom Kippur] falls on the Sabbath, one concludes [this blessing in] each service with: "the King over all the Earth, who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Atonement." - I.e., as for the rest of the holidays, the word Sabbath is simply inserted into the <i>chatimah</i> of the blessing after מקדש (who sanctifies). This is also the case according to the more widely accepted longer version of the <i>chatimah</i> of this intermediate blessing.</i> If [Yom Kippur] falls on the Sabbath, one concludes [this blessing in] each service with: "the King over all the Earth, who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Atonement."

(See <i>Hilchot Shemitah V'Yovel</i> 10:8.)<br>In <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 12:1, the Rambam writes that with the Mashiach's coming, the celebration of the Jubilee year will be renewed.</i>
Before the first blessing of each and every Amidah-prayer, one states: "God, open my lips, and my mouth will utter Your praise" [Psalms<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Berachot</i> 4b which quotes Rabbi Yochanan as requiring this verse to be recited before every prayer.<br>Rabbenu Yonah explains that this verse must be understood in conjunction with the verse that follows it: "You do not desire that I offer sacrifices; a burnt offering, You do not want:" (Psalms 51:18 . After his relations with Bathsheva, King David realized that he could not attain forgiveness by offering a sacrifice, since a sacrifice is accepted only after an act done unwittingly. Therefore, he asked that God assist him in finding the proper means of expression through prayer to achieve atonement.<br>We, too, are in a similar situation for we have no Temple and our prayers were instituted in the place of our sacrifices. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 5.) Accordingly, we ask God to assist us in our desire to utter His praises, and request our needs in such a way that it will be desirable to Him.<br><i>Berachot</i> 4b raises a question regarding the recitation of this verse before <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Rabbi Yochanan himself states that one who starts the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> immediately after the blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, גאל ישראל (Who redeemed Israel) is called a person of the World to Come. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 18, where the Rambam mentions this halachah.)<br>Why is the recitation of this verse not considered an interruption between the blessing and the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>? The Talmud answers that this verse is considered as an integral part of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and thus, is viewed as a "long prayer."</i> 51:17].

When the Jewish people began to prosper, the Sages then required that it be said over a cup of wine. (Rashi explains that the original decree that it be mentioned in prayer was forgotten.) Then the fortunes of the Jewish people declined again, and the Sages reinstituted the obligation to recite <i>Havdalah</i> in prayer. They also ruled that after <i>Havdalah</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, one must also recite the <i>Havdalah</i> service over a cup of wine. A parallel is drawn to Friday night when we mention <i>Kiddush</i> in prayer and then make <i>Kiddush</i> over a cup of wine afterwards.<br>The Rambam begins his discussion of <i>Havdalah</i> within the context of the halachot of the specific prayers recited on various holidays.

On Chanukah and Purim, one adds "For the miracles,..."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Both Chanukah and Purim are commemorated with the same basic prayer, על הניסים.

Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah are of the opinion that it should not be mentioned, since <i>Musaf</i> is not usually recited on Chanukah, and, therefore, there is no need to refer to Chanukah during the <i>Musaf</i> prayer of the Sabbath. Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan hold that since <i>Musaf</i> is simply one of the prayers of the day, and על הנסים is recited on this day, its inclusion in <i>Musaf</i> is in place.<br>The Talmud ultimately decides in favor of the position of Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan. This is supported by the fact that on Yom Kippur which falls on the Sabbath, reference is made to the Sabbath in the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer, even though <i>Ne'ilah</i> is not normally recited on the Sabbath.<br>The Rambam does not mention this halachah with regard to Purim, since it is only in rare cases that Purim occurs on the Sabbath. Purim is generally celebrated on the fourteenth of Adar, which never occurs on the Sabbath according to our fixed calendar. However, cities which were walled at the time of Joshua's conquest of Israel celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of Adar (<i>Shushan Purim</i>). Nevertheless, there are very few such cities.<br>Jerusalem is, however, one of them, and there, Purim can fall on the Sabbath. In such a case, על הנסים is said on the Sabbath, even though most of the other commandments of Purim are fulfilled either on the Friday before or the Sunday afterwards.

Rather, Rav Yitzchak is of the opinion that it should be inserted into the blessing of "the One who hears prayer." Rav Sheshet is also of this opinion.<br>Although the Talmud refers specifically to one who accepted a fast upon himself, it is clear from the continuation of the discussion there that the same halachah applies to the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> recited by everyone on a public fast day also.<br>It is interesting to note that the Rambam obligates one to add עננו in all the prayers recited on a Fast Day. This is in line with <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states: "On fast days...in the Evening, Morning, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers, one adds a mention of the particular day in 'the One who hears prayer.' However, the <i>Tur</i> quotes the Geonim that one should recite עננו only in the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. Since one could be overcome by terrible hunger and break the fast, if one recited עננו earlier he would have spoken falsely when he mentioned the fast day. Therefore, according to this position, this prayer should be mentioned only in the <i>Minchah</i> service at the end of the fast days.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 565:3) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> position, but distinguishes between the four public fast days that occur every year (i.e., those mentioned above in our commentary) and other public fast days. On the four main public fasts, he obligates the individual to mention עננו in all his prayers. Since the Sages declared it a public fast, even were he to eat later on, he would not have spoken falsely in his prayer.<br>The Ramah (<i>ibid.</i>), however, mentions that it is customary to recite עננו in <i>Minchah</i> only. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that even one reciting <i>Minchah</i> in the early afternoon should add עננו, because even if he eats later on, at least he fasted until midday. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 562:1.)

Thus, he recites 20 blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the passage from <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b quoted above. A clear distinction is made between the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> uttered by all the congregants and the repetition recited aloud by the שליח ציבור (leader of the congregation). The שליח ציבור does establish for himself, as representative of the community as a whole, an independent blessing relevant to the fast day. Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.<br>There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the שליח ציבור to recite עננו in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3).

It is appropriate that the addition regarding the ninth of Av be placed in this blessing, which speaks of rebuilding Jerusalem.<br>Despite this logic, there is some question regarding the inclusion of this prayer in this blessing. The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the עבודה (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the הודאה (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in הודאה, while prayers regarding the future are placed in עבודה.<br>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in בונה ירושלים (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of שומע תפילה (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of בונה ירושלים.

This version is found in most siddurim, although the version of Yemenite Jewry is רחם, as in the Rambam.<br>There is also a question regarding when this prayer is recited. The Rambam seems to indicate that רחם (or נחם) is to be recited in every prayer on the ninth of Av. However, the Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) states that it should only be recited in <i>Minchah</i>, just like עננו on fast days.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557) quotes the custom of saying רחם in the Evening and Morning Prayers, and נחם during <i>Minchah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) rules that נחם should be recited in all three prayers of the day. This is the custom of Sephardim, though Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah mentioned above. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 557:1.)<br>The Ramah explains that the rationale behind his decision is that the fire which destroyed the Temple broke out on the afternoon of the ninth of Av. Hence, we ask for comfort at that time specifically. Alternatively, the Ritba explains that only in the afternoon are we able to be comforted. Until then the pain of our loss is too real.</i>

Similarly, since the crops in his area would be seriously damaged if rains were not to fall until late November, he lauds the practise (followed in Provence) which begins petitioning for rain in Marcheshvan. At present, the question has become more sensitive when many Jews live in the Southern hemisphere whose rainy season coincides with our summer.<br>Nevertheless, Rav Yosef Karo rules that all places outside of Eretz Yisrael should follow the practice observed in Babylonia. This position is accepted halachically. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim</i> 117:1 and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> which discusses this issue at length.)<br>One begins the petition for rain in the Evening Prayer of the sixtieth day (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.). Both the day of the Equinox and the sixtieth day are included in the counting of sixty days. Thus, one actually starts to petition in the first week of December (Beit Yosef ibid.).<br>The laws regarding the omission of ותן טל ומטר are mentioned in Chapter 10, Halachah 9.</i><br>
In places<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">that are too small to be considered as "lands" and thus, should be considered as individuals (Rabbenu Asher).<br>Alternatively, lands whose climate is diametrically opposed to that of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> such as the countries of the Southern hemisphere (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> that require rain in the summer months, such as the distant islands,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">or any other place whose climate is such that rain is required in the summer months (Rambam, Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:3).</i> they petition for rains when they need them,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">regardless of what time of year that may be.</i> in [the blessing of] "the One who hears prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 14b relates that the residents of Nineveh asked Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi: "We require rain even in Tammuz [August], how are we to act?

Therefore, a community who needs rain at this times is considered as an individual who requests a personal boon. Accordingly, their petition for rain is mentioned in the blessing of 18עמוש הליפת (the One who hears prayer).</i>"<br>[Even]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., surely this is the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.

Throughout the entire year, one concludes the third blessing with "the Holy God" and the eleventh blessing with "the King who loves righteousness and justice."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In his responsum (97), the Rambam teaches that one need mention "the King" only during the Ten Days of Repentance, but that during the rest of the year, "the One who loves righteousness and justice" is sufficient.</i> [However,] on the ten days from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, one concludes the third one with "the Holy King"<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 12b) mentions that God's sovereignty is more evident during these ten days when He judges the world.

The regular <i>chatimah</i> indicates God's desire that his creations act in a just and righteous manner. The special one, however, relates to God's judgement of the world.<br>The laws regarding a person who forgets these changes while praying are mentioned in Chapter 10, Halachah 13.</i>
There are places that are accustomed during these ten days to add in the first blessing:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the ten days from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, inclusive. The source for this halachah is <i>Soferim</i> 19:8. There it states the following:<br>Just as the <i>chatimot</i> [of the blessings] of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are different from those of other holidays, so too, the prayers [of these days] themselves differ.One does not make any special mention of remembrances in the first three or last three [blessings], except on the holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur themselves alone. And even on these days, they allowed it only with difficulty.<br>The ""remembrances" referred to in the Mishnah are the very additions mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah. It is clear from the Mishnah that they are to be mentioned only on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and not on any of the intermediate days. However, the general practice is to add these special prayers on all ten days. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 602.)<br>The difficulty regarding these additions stems from <i>Berachot</i> 34a which states that one may not add any special requests in the first three or last three blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. (See Chapter 6, Halachah 3.) However, Rabbi Yitzchak ibn Gayut explains that since these remembrances are relevant to the needs of the entire community, they may be recited in the first three and last three blessings. <i>Berachot</i> (ibid.) prohibits only requests made by an individual for his personal needs.</i> "Remember us for life,..."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">"Remember us for life, O King, who desires life, and inscribe us in the Book of Life for our sake, O living God."

It is our custom to add these special prayers on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur only, and not during the intermediate days.</i>

Chapter 3

The mitzvah of reciting the Morning Prayer entails that one begin praying at sunrise. The time [for prayer, however,] extends until the fourth hour, i.e., a third of the day.<br>If one transgresses or errs and prays after the fourth hour, he has fulfilled the obligation of prayer, but not the obligation of prayer in its time. Just as prayer is a positive Scriptural commandment, so too, its recitation at the proper time is a Rabbinic commandment, as established for us by Sages and Prophets.
We have already stated that the time of the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer was established in correspondence to the daily afternoon sacrifice. Since the daily [afternoon] sacrifice was offered every day at nine and a half hours, [the Sages] established its time as nine and a half hours. This is referred to as "the lesser <i>Minchah</i>."<br>When the eve of Pesach fell on Friday, they would slaughter the daily [afternoon] sacrifice at six and a half hours. Accordingly, [the Sages] ordained that one who prays [Minchah] after six and a half hours has fulfilled his obligation. When this time arrives, the time of its obligation begins. This is referred to as "the greater <i>Minchah</i>."
Many people are accustomed to recite [the afternoon service at both <i>Minchah</i>] <i>Gedolah</i> and <i>K'tanah</i>, and [to consider] one of them as an optional prayer.<br>Some of the Geonim taught that it is proper to recite the optional prayer only [at the time of <i>Minchah</i>] <i>Gedolah</i>. This is reasonable, since it corresponds to [the offering of a sacrifice] which was not frequent every day.<br>If one recites [the service] as an obligatory prayer [at the time of <i>Minchah</i>] <i>Gedolah</i>, he should recite it only as an optional prayer [at the time of <i>Minchah</i>] <i>K'tanah</i>.
Behold, you have learned that the time of <i>Minchah Gedolah</i> is from six and a half hours until nine and a half hours, and the time of <i>Minchah K'tanah</i> is from nine and a half hours until there are one and a quarter hours left in the day. One may [however,] recite [the afternoon service] until sunset.
The proper time of the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer is after the Morning Prayer, until seven hours of the day. One who recites it after seven hours, even though he has acted negligently, fulfills his obligation, since its time is the entire day.
Regarding the Evening Prayer - even though it is not obligatory - a person who does recite it [must know that] its proper time is from the beginning of the night until dawn.<br>The proper time of the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer is such that one completes it close to sunset.
One who recites a prayer before its proper time does not fulfill his obligation and must recite it again at its time. If, due to extenuating circumstances, one recites the Morning Prayer after dawn, [but before the proper time], he does fulfill his obligation.<br>One may recite the Evening Prayer of the Sabbath night on the eve of the Sabbath before sunset. Similarly, he may recite the Evening Prayer of Saturday night on the Sabbath. Since the Evening Prayer is not obligatory, we are not especially careful about its time. Nevertheless, one must recite the <i>Shema</i> at its proper time after the appearance of the stars.
Anyone who intentionally allowed the proper time for prayer to pass without praying, cannot rectify the situation and cannot compensate [for his failure to pray].<br>[If he unintentionally failed to pray or was unavoidably detained or distracted, he can compensate for the [missed] prayer during the time of the prayer closest to it. He should first recite the prayer of this time, and afterwards, the [prayer of] compensation.
How is this [exemplified]?<br>One who errs and does not recite the Morning Prayer before half the day passes should recite the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer twice, the first as <i>Minchah</i> [itself] and the second as compensation for the Morning Prayer.<br>One who errs and does not recite the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer before sunset should recite the Evening Prayer twice, the first as the Evening Prayer [itself] and the second as compensation for the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer.<br>[Similarly,] one who errs and does not recite the Evening Prayer before dawn should recite the Morning Prayer twice, the first as the Morning Prayer [itself] and the second as compensation for the Evening Prayer.
One who errs and does not recite two consecutive prayers can only compensate for the last of them. How is this [exemplified]?<br>One who errs and recites neither the Morning Prayer nor the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer should recite the Evening Prayer twice, the first as the Evening Prayer [itself] and the last as compensation for <i>Minchah</i>. The Morning Prayer, however, has no compensation, since its time has already passed. This is also the case for other prayers.
If two prayers are before him, <i>Minchah</i> and <i>Musaf</i>, he should first recite <i>Minchah</i> and afterwards <i>Musaf</i>. There are those who teach that one should not do this in a congregation, in order that people not err.

Chapter 4

Five things prevent one from praying, even though the time [for prayer] has arrived:<br>1) the purification of one's hands;<br>2) the covering of nakedness;<br>3) the purity of the place of prayer;<br>4) things that might bother and distract one; and<br>5) the proper intention of one's heart.
The purification of one's hands - What does this imply? One must wash his hands in water until the joint. [Only] afterwards may he pray.<br>[The following rules apply when] a person is travelling on the road when the time for prayer arrives: If he has no water, but is within four <i>millin</i> - i.e., 8000 cubits - of a source of water, he should proceed to it, wash his hands, and then pray. If the distance to the water is greater than this, he should clean his hands with pebbles, earth, or a beam, and pray.
When does this apply? [When the water is] ahead of him. However, if the place with water is behind him, we do not obligate him to retrace his steps more than one <i>mil</i>. However, if he has passed further beyond the water, he is not obligated to return. Rather, he should clean his hands and pray.<br>When do the above statements requiring one to purify merely his hands alone for prayer apply? To the other services, but not for the Morning Prayer. For the Morning Prayer, one should wash his face, hands, and feet, and only afterwards, may he pray. If he is far from water, he may clean his hands only and then pray.
All the ritually impure need only wash their hands in order to pray, just like those not in such a state. Even if they are able to immerse themselves [in a <i>mikveh</i>] and ascend from their impure state, this immersion is not required [for prayer].<br>We have already explained that Ezra decreed that only one who has had a seminal emission is prohibited from Torah study until he has immersed himself. The Rabbinical Court [that existed afterwards] decreed that [this applies] even to prayer, i.e., such a person alone should not pray until he immerses himself.<br>These decrees were not put into effect because of questions of ritual purity and impurity, but rather to ensure that the Torah scholars would not overindulge in marital intimacy with their wives. Therefore, they instituted ritual immersion only for one who has a seminal emission, thereby excepting him from the other ritually impure.
Therefore, at the time of this decree, it was said that even a זב who had a seminal emission, a menstruating woman who emitted semen, and a woman who saw traces of menstrual blood after relations, required immersion to recite the <i>Shema</i> and to pray because of the seminal emission, despite [the fact that they remained] ritually impure.<br>This is reasonable, since this immersion was not a matter of purity, but a result of the decree so that they would not constantly be with their wives.<br>This decree regarding prayer was also abolished, since it was not universally accepted by the Jewish people, and the community at large was unable to observe it.
It is widespread custom in Shin'ar and Spain that one who has had a seminal emission does not pray until he has washed his whole body in water, [based on the command]: "Prepare to meet your God, Israel" (Amos 4:12 .<br>To whom does this refer? To a healthy person or to a sick person who engaged in intimacy, but a sick person who has had an accidental emission is exempt from bathing and there is no such custom regarding this matter. Similarly, there is no such custom regarding a זב who has a seminal emission and a menstruating woman who emits semen. Rather, they should clean themselves, wash their hands, and pray.
The proper covering of one's nakedness: What is implied?<br>Even if one covers his genitalia in the fashion necessary for the recital of the <i>Shema</i>, he may not pray until he covers his heart. If one did not - or was unable to - cover his heart, as long as he covered his nakedness when he prayed, he has fulfilled his obligation. However, <i>a priori,</i> he should not do so.
The purity of the place of prayer: What is implied?<br>One should not pray in a place of filth, a bathhouse, a latrine or garbage heap. [Similarly, one should not pray] in a place that is not presumed to be clean until he checks it.<br>The general rule is that one should not pray in any place in which one would not recite the <i>Shema</i>. [Thus,] just as one separates oneself from excreta, urine, a foul odor, a corpse and the sight of nakedness for <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, so too, he should separate himself for <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.
[The following rules apply] when one finds excreta in his place [of prayer.] Since he transgressed by not checking the place before he began to pray, he must pray again in a clean place.<br>[The following rules apply] when one finds excreta while he is in the midst of prayer: If he can walk forwards such that [the feces] will be left four cubits behind him, he should do so. If not, he should move to the side. If he is unable [to do the latter], he should stop praying.<br>The great Sages would refrain from praying in a house in which there was beer or brine at the time of its foaming because of the foul odor, even though it was a clean place.
Things that might bother and distract him: What is implied?<br>One who must relieve himself should not pray. Whenever anyone who must relieve himself prays, his prayer is an abomination and he must pray again after he relieves himself.<br>If a person can restrain himself for the length of time that it takes to walk a <i>parsah</i>, his prayer is considered prayer.<br>Nevertheless, <i>a priori</i>, one should not pray until he has checked himself very well, checked his intestines, rid himself of phlegm and mucus and any [other] bothersome thing. [Only] afterwards should he pray.
[The following rules apply to] one who burps, yawns, or sneezes during prayer: Should a person do so voluntarily, it is deprecating. [However,] if the person checked himself before he prayed and did so against his will, it is of no consequence.<br>If saliva comes up during prayer, one should cause it to be absorbed into his tallit or clothes. If he is bothered by this, he may throw it behind him with his hand in order that he not be bothered during his prayer and be distracted.<br>If one passes gas unwittingly during prayer, he should wait until the gas subsides and return to his prayer.
One who desires to pass gas from below and is bothered exceedingly, to the extent that he cannot restrain himself, should walk back four cubits, [expel the gas], and then wait until the gas subsides. He should say:<br>Master of all the world, You created us with many orifices and ducts. Our shame and disgrace is apparent and known before You. Shame and disgrace during our life, worm-eaten and decaying in our death.<br>He then returns to his place and prays.
When urine flows on a person's legs during <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he should wait until the flow ceases, and return to the place at which he stopped. If he waited the time necessary to complete his <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he should return to the beginning.
Similarly, one who urinates should wait the length of time it takes to walk four cubits, and then pray. After one has prayed, he should wait this length of time before urinating, in order to make a distinction following the words of prayer.
Proper intention: What is implied?<br>Any prayer that is not [recited] with proper intention is not prayer. If one prays without proper intention, he must repeat his prayers with proper intention.<br>One who is in a confused or troubled state may not pray until he composes himself. Therefore, one who comes in from a journey and is tired or irritated is forbidden to pray until he composes himself. Our Sages taught that one should wait three days until he is rested and his mind is settled, and then he may pray.
What is meant by [proper] intention?<br>One should clear his mind from all thoughts and envision himself as standing before the Divine Presence. Therefore, one must sit a short while before praying in order to focus his attention and then pray in a pleasant and supplicatory fashion.<br>One should not pray as one carrying a burden who throws it off and walks away. Therefore, one must sit a short while after praying, and then withdraw.<br>The pious ones of the previous generations would wait an hour before praying and an hour after praying. They would [also] extend their prayers for an hour.
A person who is drunk should not pray, because he cannot have proper intention. If he does pray, his prayer is an abomination. Therefore, he must pray again when he is clear of his drunkenness. One who is slightly inebriated should not pray, [but] if he prays, his prayer is prayer.<br>When is a person considered as drunk? When he is unable to speak before a king. [In contrast,] a person who is slightly inebriated is able to speak before a king without becoming confused. Nevertheless, since he drank a <i>revi'it</i> of wine, he should not pray until his wine has passed from him.
Similarly, one should not stand to pray in the midst of laughter or irreverent behavior, nor in the midst of a conversation, argument or anger, but rather in the midst of words of Torah.<br>[However, one should not stand to pray] in the midst of a judgment or a [difficult] halachic issue, even though these are words of Torah, lest one's mind be distracted by the halachah in question. Rather, [one should pray] in the midst of words of Torah that do not require deep concentration, e.g., laws that have already been accepted.
Before reciting occasional prayers, e.g., the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer of Rosh Chodesh or the prayers of the festivals, one must review his prayers lest he make mistakes in them.<br>A person walking in a dangerous place, e.g., a place frequented by wild animals or bandits, when the time of the <i>Amidah</i> arrives, should recite [only] a single blessing:<br>The needs of Your people, Israel, are great and their knowledge is limited. May it be Your will, O God, our Lord, that You will provide each and every one with a sufficient livelihood, and give to each individual all that he lacks. And that which is good in Your eyes, You should do. Blessed are You, God, the One who hears prayer.<br>He may recite it as he walks on the road. [However,] if he is able to stop [to recite it], he should. When he arrives at a settlement and his mind is composed, he should recite a proper <i>Amidah</i> of 19 blessings.

Chapter 5

A person who prays must be careful to tend to [the following] eight matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The specific laws regarding these eight categories are discussed by the Rambam in the ensuing halachot of this chapter.</i> [However,] if he is pressured,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">and unable to carry out any or all of these prerequisites.</i> confronted by circumstances beyond his control,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., ill, as explained by the Rambam in Halachah 2.</i> or transgresses<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., even if one transgresses intentionally.</i> and does not attend to one them, they are not<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 2.</i> of absolute necessity.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., one is not required to repeat the prayer or compensate for its recitation.<br>In the previous chapter, the Rambam listed five categories which are of absolute necessity for prayer. A person who fails to fulfill any of those requirements must repeat his prayers. These eight categories are לכתחילה (at the outset) necessary for the <i>Amidah</i>, but, do not disqualify the prayer if they were not tended to.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> points out that even Chapter 4 refers to certain actions which were only problematic לכתחילה, such as burping and sneezing. Nevertheless, they are included in that chapter because, from a topical perspective, it is more appropriate to discuss them within the context of the general categories mentioned there.</i> They are:<br> 1) standing;<br>2) facing the Temple;<br>3)<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 3.</i> preparation of his body;<br>4)<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 4.</i> proper clothing;<br>5)<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 5.</i> proper place;<br>6)<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 6-8.</i> control of his voice;<br>7)<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 9.</i> bowing;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 10-12.</i> and<br>8) prostration.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 13-15.</i>
Standing: What is implied?<br>[Generally,] one should pray only while standing.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 1, prayer is called עבודה - service. Thus, it can be compared to the sacrifices in the Temple which are also referred to by that term. In regard to both these services, Deuteronomy 10:8 states: "...To stand before God and serve Him" (<i>Berachot</i> 30a, <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 98).<br>Indeed, the term <i>Amidah</i> - (lit. "standing") is used to refer to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> because of this requirement. (See <i>Soferim</i> 16:12.)</i> [Thus,] a person sitting in a boat or in a carriage, if able to stand, should do so;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">However, unlike one riding an animal, he is not obligated to sit if he is able to stand (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).</i> if not, he may sit in his place and pray.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 30a relates a difference of opinion among the Sages whether it is preferable to recite one's prayers early, before the desired time so that one can stand during <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> or whether one should set out on a journey in a boat or carriage and pray at the appropriate time even though one will not be able to stand.<br>From this discussion, we may conclude that, under these circumstances, it is acceptable for one to remain seated during the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> if doing so will contribute to one's ability to concentrate.</i><br>A person who is ill<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">and would have to strain to stand</i> may pray even while lying on his side,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:2 which relates that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> lying on one's side, but not lying on one's back.</i> provided he is able to have the proper intention.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., One who is ill should pray only when he is able to concentrate. However, if he is unable to concentrate, it is better that he should not pray (Rabbenu Manoach).<br><i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> relates that Rashi was accustomed not to pray when he was ill.</i> Similarly, one who is thirsty or hungry<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">to the extent that he cannot concentrate</i> is considered as one who is ill.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">and is not required to pray. The commentaries point to the statement of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) that one in discomfort should not pray as the source for this halachah.</i> [Therefore,] if he is able to concentrate properly he should pray.

After listing all the activities that are forbidden once <i>Minchah Gedolah</i> arrives, the Mishnah concludes: "And if he starts, he need not stop."<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this is the case only if he will be able to recite <i>Minchah</i> before the conclusion of the appropriate time. To emphasize this point, the Rambam mentions explicitly: "and then recite <i>Minchah</i>" - i.e., after he finishes doing whatever it is that he has started doing. However, if there will not be time to pray afterwards, he must stop and pray. Only then may he resume his activity.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 232:2, follows this interpretation of the Rambam and adds that if there will not be time afterwards, one must stop what he is doing immediately. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> points out that this means that even if it is still relatively early, if one is eating and expects the meal to continue until after the time of <i>Minchah</i>, he must stop immediately and pray, rather than wait until sometime later before the end of the day.</i>

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) rules in line with Rashi's position.</i><br>When is the beginning of [work in the] tanning house?

Rav states that washing one's hands constitutes the beginning of eating, whereas Rabbi Chanina is of the opinion that loosening one's belt before eating is the beginning of the meal.

Rav described the halachah for inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and Rabbi Chanina, for those of Babylonia.</i> For inhabitants of Babylonia, it is when they loosen their belts.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi explains that the custom in Babylonia was to wear their belts particularly tight, necessitating that they be loosened prior to eating. This was not the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>It is interesting to note that in his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions only the halachah of washing one's hands. Since the Mishnah was written in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, its interpretation must be in line with the customs and realities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam focuses on the actual halachah. Hence, he defines the beginning of eating in line with both positions, one relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the other to Babylonia.</i><br>When is the beginning of judgment?

Even though the Evening Prayer is not obligatory,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 6 and the commentary there.</i> one should not come home from his work and say: "I will eat a little and sleep a little and then I will pray," lest sleep overtake him and he sleep all night.

That passage states:<br>The Sages produced a support for their words in order that a person not come in from the field in the evening and say: "I shall go home, eat a little, sleep a little and then recite the <i>Shema</i> and pray," lest he be overcome by sleep and sleep all night.Rather, he should come from the field in the evening and enter the synagogue. If he is accustomed to recite the <i>Shema</i> immediately, he should.

A person who is involved in the study of Torah when the time for prayer arrives must stop and pray.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) states that one must stop for <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but not for prayer. The Talmud (11a) explains that this refers to one involved in the study of Torah.</i> If the study of Torah is his full-time occupation and he does not work at all,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) continues:<br>This applies only to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues, whose full time occupation was the study of Torah, but we stop studying to recite the <i>Shema</i> and to pray.<br>Rashi explains that anyone who interrupts his studies in order to work, must also interrupt his studies in order to pray.</i> and he is involved in the study of Torah at the time of prayer, he need not stop, since the commandment of the study of Torah is greater that the commandment of prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:3, the Rambam states: "There is no commandment among all the commandments that is equal to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah is equal to all the other commandments, since study brings one to action. Therefore, study comes before action at all times."<br>A person involved in Torah study achieves a level of unity with God that is unparalleled by any other activity. One's intellect and God's wisdom become inextricably linked, until they are indistinguishable during the moments of one's actual involvement in study. On this basis, we can understand the description of Torah with the metaphor of bread (Proverbs 9:5, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13). After bread is consumed by a person, it becomes assimilated into his blood and becomes part of the person himself. Similarly, when Torah is studied, it becomes absorbed into the person's character and becomes an integral part of his being (<i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 5).<br>As explained in the introduction to this text, prayer focuses on our attempt to relate to the Godliness that permeates our worldly existence. Though this is an extremely significant service, the connection established through Torah study is more complete. Thus, <i>Shabbat</i> 10a records how Ravvah rebuked Rav Hamnuna for neglecting his Torah studies to prolong his prayers. By doing he was "abandoning eternal life for transcient life." Therefore, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues whose commitment to Torah was all encompassing were not required to interrupt their studies for prayer.</i><br>Anyone involved in efforts for the welfare of the community is like one involved in Torah study.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., he can be compared to one whose full time occupation is the study of Torah. Therefore, he is exempt from the <i>Amidah</i> at that time.<br>This comparison of community work to the study of Torah is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1. However, there it is taught in the context of praying in the midst of words of Torah. (See Chapter 4, Halachah 18.) Community work is also considered like Torah, so that one may pray after such work and it is considered as if he prayed in the midst of words of Torah.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this law from the continuation of the Talmudic passage (<i>Shabbat</i> 11a) cited above. The Talmud states that one involved in the decision of whether or not to proclaim a leap year (עיבור שנה) need not stop to pray, even though Torah study is not his full-time occupation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> posits that the Rambam views involvement in עיבור שנה as community work. On this basis, he concludes that one need not stop in order to pray if he is involved in such activities.</i>
One is forbidden to interrupt his <i>Amidah</i> except in a situation where his life is endangered.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:15-17, we discussed the various situations in which one is allowed to interrupt his recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. Here, the Rambam teaches that the laws regarding the <i>Amidah</i> are much more strict. Only a threat to one's very life is considered sufficient cause to interrupt the <i>Amidah</i>.</i> Even if the King of Israel greets him, he must not answer him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 29b) states: "Even if the king greets him, he may not answer." The Talmud explains that this applies only to a Jewish king, but not to a foreign king. A Jewish king is expected to appreciate the seriousness of prayer and realize that a person's unwillingness to interrupt his prayers is not intended as an insult to the king's authority, but rather, submission to an even greater authority.<br>It is interesting to note that this halachah is taught in the Mishnah within the context of halachot stressing the serious nature of the <i>Amidah</i> and the high level of concentration necessary. Just as we learned that the level of intention necessary for the <i>Amidah</i> is greater than that necessary for <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Chapter 5, Halachah 8 and the commentary there), so too, the halachot regarding interruptions are stricter, as mentioned.</i> However, he may interrupt [to answer] a non-Jewish king, lest he<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">fail to understand the concept explained above and...</i> kill him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">as a rebel against the king.<br><i>Berachot</i> 32b-33a relates the following story which shows that the Sages did not always avail themselves of the leniency granted:<br>A righteous man was once praying on the road.

Is it not written in your Torah: 'Take heed and watch yourself carefully' (Deuteronomy 4:9 , and 'Guard yourselves very carefully' (Deuteronomy 4:15)." "When I greeted you, why didn't you answer? If I had cut off your head with my sword, who would have sought vengeance for your life?"He said to him: "Let me appease you with words. If you were standing in front of an earthly king and your friend came and greeted you would you answer him?"[The minister] said: "No.""And if you did answer him what would they do to you?"He replied: "They would cut off my head!"He said: "And is it not reasonable that if you [would not interrupt] while standing in front of an earthly king who is here today and in the grave tomorrow, so too I, standing in front of the King of Kings, the Holy One blessed be He, who is eternally present, all the more so [should I not interrupt in order to return greetings]."The minister was appeased immediately, and the righteous person returned home in peace."</i><br>A person standing in the [midst of the] <i>Amidah</i> who sees a non-Jewish king or tyrant approaching him should shorten [his prayer].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Yonah explains that this means simply to recite the beginning and end of each blessing.

The Talmud (33a) mentions that a snake does not cause an interruption, but a scorpion does. Rashi explains that though snakes are not likely to bite, scorpions are likely to sting. Thus, the passage raises questions on the Rambam's decision, for he does not distinguish between snakes and scorpions.<br>The Rambam's statements appear to be based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1, which states that one ignores a snake only if it is simply curling around his leg. However, were the snake to approach him in a menacing fashion, appearing likely to bite, he may flee from the snake.<br>It is important to note that there is no actual need to interrupt his <i>Amidah</i> in the case of the dangerous creatures. He need simply leave that spot, find a safe place and continue praying.<br><i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> points out that in all the cases mentioned, even if he did actually speak in the middle of <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he need only start again at the beginning of the blessing in which he stopped. If, however, he interrupted himself during the first or last three blessings, he should return to the beginning of the beginning of the first of the three blessings.<br>The laws mentioned in this halachah are discussed in the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 104.</i>
Women, slaves and children are obligated to pray.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 20a-b).

Some commentaries explain that this explanation would even be acceptable according to the Rambam. Though he holds that the <i>Amidah</i> is also a Torah obligation (see Chapter 1, Halachah 1), it is only necessary to pray once daily in order to fulfill one's Torah obligation. Therefore, one may be more lenient in granting an exemption from the <i>Amidah</i>, since the Torah obligation may have already been fulfilled or may be fulfilled by another <i>Amidah</i> later in the day.<br>However, the Rambam, himself, offers a different explanation in his commentary on the Mishnah. There, he states that since one is troubled (לבו טרוד) by the burial, he is exempt from the <i>Amidah</i>. This seems to be a function of the greater need for intention in the <i>Amidah</i> rather than its non-Torah status.</i>

[Then,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one first recites <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and then, the blessing of <i>hamapil</i> (the blessing discussed in Halachah 1).

Our Sages interpreted "Speak in your heart" and "upon your bed" as allusions to the phrases "with all your heart" and "upon your bed" in the<i>Shema</i>.<br>That Talmudic passage implies that the reason for reciting the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is to protect oneself from undesirable influences during the night. According to Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) and others who allow the evening service to be recited before sunset, the recitation of <i>Shema</i> before retiring enables us to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. According to the writings of the Ari, the reciting of the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is a service of spiritual preparation for the soul's ascent from the body during sleep.<br>Since <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that "it is a mitzvah" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring, it was customary in certain communities to recite a blessing before reciting the <i>Shema</i> as is customary before performing other mitzvot.

Rabbenu Yitzchok Alfasi also follows the Jerusalem Talmud.<br>The <i>Levush, Orach Chayim</i> 46, explains the reason for reciting the blessing in the negative: <i>Eruvin</i> 13a states that it would have been better for man not to have been created than to have been created (i.e., man's soul was in a higher state before its descent into the world than it is while in this world). Therefore, we do not express thanks for being created. Nevertheless, having been created, we thank God for not creating us as gentiles since gentiles have a far lesser number of commandments to fulfill.<br>The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> explains that the negative formula was chosen for the following reason. Our Sages required that we recite three blessings each morning. Torah law states that whenever a single blessing covers two different circumstances, the second blessing may not be recited. Therefore, since a statement thanking God "for making me a Jew" would make the blessing for "not making me a servant" superfluous, it is preferable to recite this blessing using the negative formula.</i><br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A woman is not obligated to fulfill all the positive mitzvot whose performance is limited to a specific time.

Rashi interprets this as רוח רעה, the spirit of impurity which rests on our hands before the morning washing.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Yoma</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) rules that one does wash his hands upon rising in the morning on Yom Kippur since רוח רעה is considered like any filth and may be removed in its normal fashion.

The Ramah adds that the custom is to be very strict in this regard and not even to wash the eyes. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (basing himself on the <i>Bayit Chadash</i>) permits one to moisten his fingertips and clean the dirt from his eyes.

The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) explains the custom:<br>Since one's hand are not clean [upon rising], the [rabbis] instituted the practice of reciting the [blessings] in order in the synagogue. [Another reason for the institution of this practice is that] many of the common people do not know how to recite the [blessings] and when they are recited in the synagogue, they can answer "Amen" afterwards, and thus, fulfill their obligation.<br>This is a mistake and it is not proper to follow this practice. One should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated to. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam sees two difficulties in this practice:a) The blessings are not recited at their proper time, i.e., immediately after the action to which they are a response;b) In the synagogue, all the blessings are recited and it is improper to recite a blessing that one is not obligated to recite.<br>In answer to the first objection, Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Yonah explain that there is no problem with reciting these blessings after the actions to which they relate have been completed. The only blessings that must be recited in direct conjunction with the deed with which they are associated are those recited before fulfilling commandments. However, blessings of thanks or praise may be uttered later. This opinion is accepted by all Ashkenazic authorities.<br>Today, many people recite these blessings at home after washing and dressing. In certain communities, they are recited communally in the synagogue. In all cases, however, each individual who is able to read the blessings from a siddur or knows them by heart should recite the blessings himself every morning.</i><br>This is a mistake and it is not proper to follow this practice. One should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated to.
One who rises to study Torah, whether the Written or Oral Law,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There is debate in the Talmud about this matter. Some Sages did not require the recitation of a blessing for the study of certain portions of the Oral Law (See <i>Berachot</i> 11b). Nevertheless, the decision quoted by the Rambam is accepted by all halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:2 explains the reason for this decision, "They [all portions of the Oral Law] are all Torah and were given to Moses at Mount Sinai."</i> before he recites the <i>Shema</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 11b states:<br>Once one has recited the <i>Shema</i>, he need not recite a blessing [for Torah study] since he has fulfilled his obligation with <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> (the second blessing before the <i>Shema</i>).<br>This blessing praises God for teaching our ancestors "the laws that bring eternal life" and includes our prayers that He "grant our hearts understanding... to learn and to teach... all the teachings of Your Torah." Therefore, <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> is considered as comparableáto the blessings recited before Torah study (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).<br>Rabbenu Asher quotes an opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) which states that the blessing of <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> can replace the blessings before the study of the Torah only when one studies immediately after reciting the <i>Shema</i> and <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. The Ra'avad and the Rashba, however, maintain that the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> is also considered as Torah study. Therefore, if one recites the <i>Shema</i> after <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i>, one is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.<br>The Rambam appears to follow the latter opinion, however, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:8) accepts Rabbenu Asher's view.<br>should wash his hands beforehand, - to fulfill the obligation of נטילת ידים upon rising in the morning.</i> should wash his hands beforehand, recite [the following] three blessings, and then study.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Both here and in Halachah 11, the Rambam states that one must study immediately after reciting these blessings. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) explains the motivating principle: All blessings recited before the performance of a commandment must be followed immediately by the fulfillment of the commandment.<br>This position is, however, not universally accepted. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b), Rabbenu Yonah, and the Mordechai disagree and do not require the repetition of the blessings even if an interruption was made between their recitation and Torah study. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>,:9) warns against making such an interruption.<br>[The comparison of the blessings before Torah study to the blessings of the mitzvot is not universally accepted. In addition to the opinion of the Ramban mentioned in the following halachah, the <i>Levush</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) compares the blessings before Torah study to the blessings recited before partaking of food. Just as one thanks God for the satisfaction granted from food and other physical things, one blesses Him for the satisfaction derived from Torah study.

This version is also found in the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon and the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchok Alfasi.<br>The siddurim of the Sephardim, Yemenites and Nusach Ari follow the Rambam's text, whereas Nusach Ashkenaz reads לעסוק בדברי תורה.[<br>In both versions, this blessing contains thirteen words corresponding to the thirteen principles of Biblical exegesis that apply to the Torah (יºג מדות שהתורה נדרשת בהן, <i>Shulchan Tahor</i>).]</i><br>And<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The presence here of the Hebrew letter <i>vav</i> (ו) which is generally translated as "and" is the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) explains that, according to <i>Rabbenu Tam</i>, any blessing that follows another blessing of only a single line must itself begin "Blessed are You..." and cannot be included in the phrase "Blessed are You..." in the first blessing. Therefore, since this paragraph does not begin "Blessed are You...," it appears to be a continuation of the first blessing and not a blessing of its own. The <i>vav</i> - "and" - indicates the connection between the two paragraphs.<br>The Rambam, however, clearly states that the second paragraph is considered as a blessing in its own right and not a continuation of the first blessing. The <i>vav</i> would, therefore, appear to be superfluous. Though most printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include a <i>vav</i>, the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Yemenite manuscripts, and the Ramah's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> all lack a <i>vav</i>.

He explains the reasons why he favors the latter version:<br>This [wording] alludes to our recognition that God gave us the Torah so that we will learn to do everything it states. [The blessing is a request] that He open our hearts to the study of Torah, for this was the reason it was given to us as a heritage.However, to conclude [the blessing with] "who teaches Torah..." is incorrect, for God... does not teach us the Torah.

He explains that this is because this blessing is also often recited in isolation, before the reading of the Torah in the synagogue.<br>The recitation of the blessings of the Torah is very important. <i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a states that Eretz Yisrael was destroyed because the Jews forsook the Torah. Our Sages clarified that statement, explaining that it means that the people would study Torah without reciting the blessings before it. A person who studies Torah without reciting the blessings fails to realize its holiness and sanctity, therefore, it is considered as if he ""forsook the Torah.''</i>
One is obligated to recite these three blessings<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The nature of this obligation is debated among the commentaries. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) and others understand the Rambam as considering these blessings similar to any other blessing recited before the performance of a mitzvah and hence, of Rabbinic origin.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Berachot</i> 21a and <i>Yoma</i> 37a state that the obligation to recite a blessing on Torah study stems from the Torah itself. In keeping with this view, the Ramban (<i>Hosafot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, positive commandment 15) reckons the recitation of the blessings of the Torah as a separate mitzvah.</i> every day.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps with the words "every day," the Rambam is implying that these blessings should be recited even if one does not sleep at night. See <i>Magen Avraham</i> 47:11.<br>The blessings are recited only once a day. In contrast to the blessings recited over other mitzvot, even if one interrupts his study and occupies himself with other matters, one need not recite a second blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 4:7 gives two reasons for this difference:1) The blessings before the Torah resemble the other morning blessings. A person enjoys the benefits associated with the morning blessings intermittently throughout the day, yet he only recites the blessings once in the morning. Similarly, though one may study at several different occasions in a single day, the blessings are recited only once daily.2) The obligation to study Torah is incumbent upon one throughout the entire day and, at all times, one's attention should be on one's studies.</i> Afterwards, one should read a few words of Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If these blessings are comparable to other blessings recited before the performance of mitzvot, the mitzvah (studying Torah) must also be fulfilled immediately after the recitation of the blessing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> [To fulfill this obligation,] the people adopted the custom of reading the Priestly Blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Priestly Blessing is found in Numbers 6:22-27. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b) also mentions the custom of reciting the Priestly Blessing each morning and Rav Amram Gaon includes the Priestly Blessing in his siddur.<br>The <i>Avudraham</i> mentions that the recitation of these verses arouses Divine blessing for the Jewish people. The <i>Even Yarchi</i> notes that the verses of the Priestly Blessing contain 60 letters, corresponding to the 60 tractates in the Talmud.</i> In certain places, they recite [the passage, (Numbers 28: 1-9)]: "Command the children of Israel...,"<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">These verses describe the morning sacrifice offered daily in the Holy Temple.

The verses of the Daily Sacrifice are recited later, with the intention that our recitation of these verses will compensate for our inability to actually offer these sacrifices (<i>Ta'anit</i> 27b, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 48).</i><br>Also, [it is proper] to read chapters or laws from the Mishnah and the <i>Beraitot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">so that we will have studied passages from the written law, the Mishnah, and the Talmud and thus, emphasize how our obligation to study Torah applies to all three. Note <i>Kiddushin</i> 30a and <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:11, which advises one to divide his Torah study, a third in the Written Law, a third in Mishnah and a third in Talmud.<br>In his Order of Prayers, the Rambam lists the following passages from the oral law after the the Priestly Blessings:<br>These are the precepts for which no fixed limit is prescribed: <i>Pe'ah</i> (the corners of the field left unharvested for the needy, Leviticus 23:22 , <i>Bikkurim</i> (the first fruits, Exodus 23:19 , <i>HaRei'on</i> (the pilgrimage offerings, Deuteronomy 16:16-17), acts of kindness and the study of Torah. [A Mishnah, <i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1.]These are the precepts, the fruits of which a person enjoys in this world, while the principle remains [for him] in the world to come: Honoring one's mother and father, acts of kindness, concentration during prayer, visiting the sick, waking early to go to the study hall, hospitality to guests, bringing peace between man and his fellow man, and the study of Torah, which is equivalent to them all. [A <i>beraita</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 127a]Rav Zeira says: "Jewish women imposed a stringent practice upon themselves. Even if they saw a drop of [vaginal] blood the size of a mustard seed, they would count seven clean days after it." [An example of Torah law, <i>Berachot</i> 31a, <i>Nidah</i> 66a, and <i>Megillah</i> 28b]It was taught in the School of Elijah: Whoever studies Torah law every day is assured of life in the world to come [as implied by Chabakuk 3:6]: "<i>Halichot</i> (the paths of) the world are his."

What is implied by [the term,] communal prayer? One [person] prays aloud and all [the others] listen.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">With this statement, the Rambam touches on a point debated both by the Sages of the Talmud and the later Rabbis. The mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 33b, states:<br>Just as the leader of the congregation is obligated [to pray], each individual is obligated. Rabban Gamliel states: "The leader of the congregation fulfills the obligation on behalf of the community."<br>The Talmud (34b) elaborates on the difference of opinion:<br>They asked Rabban Gamliel: "According to your opinion, why does the community pray?"He replied: "In order to allow the leader of the community to prepare his prayers."Rabban Gamliel asked them: "According to your opinion, why does the leader of the congregation pray aloud?"They replied: "In order to allow those who are not knowledgeable to fulfill their obligation."He told them: "Just as he fulfills the obligation on behalf of those who are not knowledgeable, he fulfills it on behalf of those who are knowledgeable."<br>The Sages of the Talmud continued to debate the issue. The ultimate decision accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, the Rambam (See Halachah 9), and Rabbenu Asher, is that during the entire year, the Sages' opinion is accepted. However, on Rosh HaShanah, because of the complexity of the blessings (See Halachah 10), Rabban Gamliel's opinion prevails.<br>Both Rabban Gamliel and the Sages agree that the practice of communal prayer involves two elements:a) the silent prayers of many individuals; andb) the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.They differ, however, as to which of these elements is considered of primary importance. According to the Sages, the essential element of communal prayer is that ten or more people recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the same time. According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.<br>[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]<br>The Rambam's statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.<br>In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam's statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan's</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9). By doing so, one will have both the advantages of individual and communal prayer.</i> This should not be done with fewer than ten<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 4 and 5.</i> adult<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Males who have reached the age of thirteen years and a day and manifested signs of physical maturity. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:19.)<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this halachah from <i>Berachot</i> 47b-48a which allows for the inclusion of a child in the <i>zimmun</i> for the grace after meals. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:7.) We assume that this leniency was granted only in regard to grace, but not in regard to prayer. See also <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 91:3.<br>Many Halachic authorities do not accept this conclusion. In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon rules that a child may be counted as the tenth in a <i>minyan</i>. Similarly, the <i>Ba'al HaMe'or</i> holds that even up to four minors may be counted in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted. There are opinions that in such a case, the minor must be at least six years old, understand that prayer is service to God, and hold a <i>chumash</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 55:5, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 55:5).</i> free males.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., excluding a Canaanite slave.

For the recitation of that blessing, the presence of ten men other than the mourner himself is required. (See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 13:1.) Perhaps the Rambam feels that this statement is necessary to clearly distinguish between the different requirements of a <i>minyan</i> for prayer and ברכת אבלים.</i><br>Even if some of them have already prayed and fulfilled their obligation, they can complete the [quorum of] ten<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Though they do not pray together with the others, their presence in the room where the others pray can complete a <i>minyan</i>.</i> provided the majority of the ten have not prayed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Soferim</i> 10:7 states:Our Sages in the West say [that <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>barchu</i> may be recited] even with seven.

[The number of people correspond] to the number of words [in the verse which describes the blessing of God].There are those who say only six [are required], since ברכו is the sixth word [of the above verse].<br>The Rambam differentiates between the ruling regarding prayer and his statements in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:8 where he writes that it is necessary that seven people out of ten eat bread in order to constitute a <i>minyan</i> for <i>zimmun</i>, for "a noticeable majority" is required.<br>There are two views quoted in the name of Rabbenu Tam (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> 23b); one, requiring a minimum of seven people who have not prayed for a <i>minyan</i> just as seven who have eaten bread are required for a <i>minyan</i> in regard to grace after meals and, another, requiring, only five. However, the Rambam's opinion is universally accepted as halachah.<br>Similarly, we should not recite Kedushah, - See Chapter 7, Halachah 17.<br>In the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is customary to recite three verses in the <i>Kedushah</i>:a) "Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the entire earth is full of His glory" (Isaiah 6:3 ;b) "Blessed be the glory of God from His place" (Ezekiel 3:12 ;c) "The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, throughout all generations" (Psalms 146:10 .<br>Only the first two of these verses are recited in the <i>Kedushah</i> of the blessings before the <i>Shema</i>. However, in the<i>Kedushah</i> recited at the end of the service, a verse similar to Psalms 146:10 is also included.<br>The commentaries debate the definition of <i>Kedushah</i> and therefore, question which passage the Rambam requires to be omitted when one prays alone. The Rambam's statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, appear to define <i>Kedushah</i> as only the first of these three verses.</i><br>Similarly, we should not recite <i>Kedushah</i>, read the Torah with its blessings<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the reading of the Torah as part of the prayer service.

The fourth side opens into the larger courtyard. The large courtyard has three full sides, with the fourth side consisting of two short walls on each side of the opening into the small one. The accompanying diagram is based on a diagram drawn by the Rambam (accompanying his Commentary on the Mishnah) to depict this situation.micha, drawing</i> If there are nine [people] in the large one and one in the small one,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">since the majority of the people are in the larger courtyard and the smaller courtyard opens up to the larger one in its entirety</i> they may be considered as a<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">single</i> group<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">located in the larger courtyard.</i> [to form a quorum of ten].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The same law would apply if four people were in the smaller courtyard.</i> If there are nine [people] in the small one and one in the large one,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since the majority is in the smaller courtyard</i> they are not considered as a<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">single</i> group.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">located in the smaller courtyard because the walls of the larger courtyard separate it from the smaller one.<br>If a congregation is in the large one, but the leader of the congregation is in the small one, - he, like the individual(s) mentioned above, is considered part of the group in the larger courtyard.

By the same token, a person(s) standing in the courtyard of a synagogue or in an adjoining room cannot be considered as part of a <i>minyan</i>.<br>Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 55:14) qualifies this restriction and states that if the person in the outer room can see - and be seen by - the people in the main room, he may be counted together with them. Even if he is merely peering through a window, he is considered as part of that group.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 55:20 also mentions that even when the people in adjoining rooms cannot see each other, those in the outer room may respond to <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>Kedushah</i>. The rabbis differed as to whether a person praying in a separate room next to the room where a <i>minyan</i> is praying may be considered to have participated in communal prayer or not (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 55:58).</i>
Similarly, if there were feces in the larger [courtyard], it is forbidden to pray<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">as stated in Chapter 4, Halachot 8-9,</i> or recite the <i>Shema</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">as stated in <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:6-15, in the larger courtyard or</i> [even] in the smaller one.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">for it is considered as part of the larger courtyard.

Though that mishnah deals with the appointment of the leader of communal prayer for a public fast, there is no reason to assume that the same principles should not apply to the appointment of a <i>chazan</i> at other times. In the Talmud (e.g., <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 32a), we find many examples of leading Sages serving as <i>chazanim</i>.</i> If he is an older man,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Though the Hebrew, זקן, is often used to connote a wise man (See <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 6:1), this translation has been chosen based on the later statements of this halachah.</i> it is very praiseworthy.

Therefore, in one of his responsa, the Rambam states that a person who is physically incapable of growing a beard may serve as <i>chazan</i> and the requirement of a beard is only mentioned as a sign of "a full state of knowledge which one [usually] reaches at the age when one's beard begins to grow." See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 53:8).<br>However, a beard is also considered a sign of commitment to Jewish practice. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 12:7) associates shaving with the practices of gentile priests. Many Rabbis have strongly encouraged growing a beard even when there is no question of violating the prohibition against shaving. (See <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> 7, <i>Shibolei Leket</i> Vol. II, 41.)<br>However, in communities where removing one's facial hair in a permitted manner is an accepted practice, the lack of a beard is not considered as a deterrent against a person serving as a <i>chazan</i>.</i> should not be appointed as the leader of the congregation even if he be a wise man of great stature, as a gesture of respect to the congregation.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:6) states that this only refers to the appointment of a permanent <i>chazan</i>.

The Radbaz and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> write that if these pronunciation errors are commonplace, even someone who pronounces a <i>chet</i> as a <i>hay</i> or a <i>shin</i> as a <i>sin</i> may serve as a <i>chazan</i>. See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 53:16, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 53:37-38.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> also cites Chapter 15, Halachah 1, from which it appears that a person who stutters, lisps, or has another speech defect which prevents him from pronouncing the letters properly should not serve as a <i>chazan</i>.<br>A teacher may appoint one of his students to lead the prayers in his presence. - even if the student lacks the above qualities (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Though the previous halachah stated that the leader of the congregation should be the man of the greatest stature in the community, the mishnah (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) and similarly, several sources throughout the Talmud (See <i>Berachot</i> 33b) indicate that a teacher could appoint a student to serve as a <i>chazan</i> instead of doing so himself.<br>The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that this refers to a student who does not articulate the letters properly. Though such a person should not ordinarily serve as a <i>chazan</i>, if he is appointed by his teacher he may. Thus, we find that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi appointed Rabbi Chiya as a <i>chazan</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 85b) even though he would pronounce a <i>chet</i> as a <i>hay</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 24b).</i><br>A teacher may appoint one of his students to lead the prayers in his presence.

However, in many communities, it is customary for a <i>chazan</i> to wear a <i>tallit</i> as a token of respect for the community.</i> - though he may recite the <i>Shema</i> publicly - may not serve as the leader of the congregation until he is covered by a cloak.

Chapter 9

The order of prayer is as follows:<br>In the morning, [while] all the people are sitting, the leader of the congregation descends before the ark in the midst of the people and recites the <i>Kaddish</i>. Everyone responds with all their strength: <i>Amen. Yehei shemeih rabba mevarach le'alam ul'almei almaya</i>. They answer "Amen" at the end of the <i>Kaddish</i>.<br>Afterwards, [the <i>chazan</i>] declares: <i>Barchu et Ado-nai hamevorach</i>, and they answer: <i>Baruch Ado-nai hamevorach le'olam va'ed</i>. He then begins by reciting the <i>Shema</i> and its blessings out loud. They answer "Amen" after each blessing.<br>A person who knows how to recite the blessings and read [the <i>Shema</i>] with him should read [the blessings by himself] until he recites the blessing <i>ga'al Yisrael</i>.
Immediately [afterwards], all stand and pray in a hushed tone. A person who does not know how to pray should stand in silence while the leader of the congregation prays in a hushed tone together with the others. Whoever concludes his prayers with the congregation should take three steps back and stand [still] in the place he reached when he stepped backwards.
After the leader of the congregation takes three steps backwards and stands still, he begins and prays in a loud voice from the beginning of the blessings, in order to fulfill the obligation on behalf of those who did not pray.<br>Everyone - both those who did not fulfill their obligation [to pray] and those who fulfilled their obligation - stands, listens, and recites "Amen" after each and every blessing.
[The leader of the congregation] recites <i>Kedushah</i> in the third blessing.<br>When the leader of the congregation reaches <i>Kedushah</i>, each individual may return to the place where he originally stood in prayer.<br>When the leader of the congregation reaches <i>Modim</i> and bows, everyone should also bow - but not bow exceedingly - and say:<br>We give thanks to You, God, our Lord, and Lord of all flesh, our Creator and the Creator of all existence. [We offer] blessings and thanks to Your great and holy name, for You have granted us life and sustained us. So may You continue to grant us life and sustain us, and gather our exiles into the courtyards of Your Sanctuary [so that we may] keep Your laws, serve You in truth, and fulfill Your will with a perfect heart, for we thankfully acknowledge You.<br>Whoever says <i>Modim, modim</i> should be silenced.
After the leader of the congregation concludes the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he and the entire congregation should sit, fall on their faces, and lean over slightly, reciting supplicatory prayers while fallen on their faces.<br>Then, he and the entire congregation should sit, lift their heads, and recite a small amount of supplicatory prayer out loud while seated. Afterwards, the leader of the congregation alone should stand and recite <i>Kaddish</i> a second time. The congregation should answer as they did previously.<br>Afterwards, while he is standing, he recites <i>V'hu rachum...</i> and <i>Tehillah [l'David]...</i> The congregation remains seated and recites together with him. Afterwards, he recites [the following verses]: <i>U'va l'Tzion go'el..., Va'ani zot..., V'attah kadosh...</i> and <i>V'kara zeh el zeh, v'amar: Kadosh...</i> and completes the <i>Kedushah</i>.<br>They respond: <i>Kadosh, Kadosh</i> three times. He then recites the <i>Kedushah</i> in an Aramaic translation. Afterwards, he recites [the verse] <i>Vatisa'eni ruach</i> and reads it in Aramaic, and then recites [the verse], <i>Ado-nai yimloch le'olam va'ed</i> and reads it in Aramaic. [The Aramaic translations are intended] in order that the [common] people should understand.
These verses [which are recited] before <i>Kedushah</i> and afterwards, together with their Aramaic translations, are referred to as "the order of <i>Kedushah</i>."<br>Afterwards, he recites supplicatory prayers and verses of mercy. He then recites the <i>Kaddish</i>. The people respond as is customary, and depart.
One who says in his supplicatory prayers: "May He who showed mercy on a bird's nest prohibiting the taking of the mother together with the chicks, or the slaughter of an animal and its calf on the same day, also show mercy on us," or [makes other] similar statements should be silenced, because these mitzvot are God's decrees and not [expressions] of mercy. Were they [expressions] of mercy, He would not permit us to slaughter at all.<br>Also, a person should not be profuse in his mention of adjectives describing God, and say: "The great, mighty, awesome, powerful, courageous, and strong God," for it is impossible for man to express the totality of His praises. Instead, one should mention [only] the praises that were mentioned by Moses, of blessed memory.
In the Minchah service, the leader of the congregation recites <i>Ashrei yoshvei veitecha...</i>, <i>Tehillah l'David...</i>. He and the congregation recite this while seated. [Then,] the leader of the congregation stands and recites <i>Kaddish</i>. They stand and respond in their normal manner. [Afterwards,] they all pray in a hushed tone.<br>Afterwards, the leader of the congregation prays out loud, as in the morning service, until he concludes the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Then, both he and the congregation fall on their faces, recite supplicatory prayers, lift their heads, and recite a few supplicatory prayers while seated, as in the morning service.<br>[The leader of the congregation] rises and recites <i>Kaddish</i>. The congregation responds in the normal manner and they depart to their affairs.
In the evening, all the people sit, and [the leader of the congregation] stands and recites: <i>V'hu rachum...</i>. [He announces:] <i>Barchu et Ado-nai hamevorach</i>, and they answer: <i>Baruch Ado-nai hamevorach le'olam va'ed</i>. He then begins by reciting the <i>Shema</i> and its blessings out loud and recites <i>Kaddish</i>. [Afterwards,] they all stand and pray in a hushed tone.<br>When they conclude, [the leader of the congregation] recites <i>Kaddish</i> and they depart. He does not repeat the evening <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> out loud, since the evening service is not obligatory. Therefore, he should not recite blessings in vain, for there is no one who is obligated [to recite these blessings] whose obligation he would fulfill [by his recitation].
On the night of the Sabbath, after praying together with the congregation in a hushed tone, the leader of the congregation prays out loud. However, he does not recite all seven blessings, but rather one blessing that includes all seven. He states:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord and Lord of our fathers, the Lord of Abraham, the Lord of Isaac, and the Lord of Jacob, the great, mighty, and awesome God, the supreme God, who, in His mercies, creates heaven and earth.<br>He shielded our ancestors with His word. He resurrects the dead with His statements - the holy God, like whom there is none. He causes His people to rest on His holy Sabbath, for to them did He desire to grant rest. We will serve Him with awe and fear and give thanks to His name every day, continually, according to the blessings [appropriate for that day]. God who is worthy of thanks, Lord of peace, who sanctifies the Sabbath and blesses the seventh day and brings rest with holiness to a people satiated with delight in commemoration of the work of creation.<br>Our Lord, and Lord of our fathers, desire our rest.... Blessed are You, God, who sanctifies the Sabbath.<br>He recites <i>Kaddish</i> and the people depart.
Why did the Sages institute this [practice]? Because the majority of people come to recite the evening service on Friday night. It is possible that someone will come late, remain alone in the synagogue, and thus be endangered. Accordingly, the leader of the congregation repeats his prayers in order that the entire congregation will remain, [allowing] the one who came late to conclude his prayers and leave together with them.
Therefore, when a festival, Rosh Chodesh or Yom Kippur coincides with the Sabbath, the leader of the congregation who recites the evening service does not mention the unique aspect of the day in this blessing. Instead, he concludes, "[Blessed are You, God,] who sanctifies the Sabbath," [mentioning] only [the Sabbath], because [on the other] days, there is no obligation [to recite] this blessing.
On the Sabbaths and the festivals, after the leader of the congregation completes the recitation of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> of the morning service out loud, he recites <i>Kaddish</i> and afterwards, <i>Tehillah l'David</i>. He recites <i>Kaddish</i> [again] and [the congregation] recites <i>Musaf</i> in a hushed tone. Afterwards, he recites the <i>Musaf</i> <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> out loud, in the same manner as the morning service. He recites <i>Kaddish</i> after <i>Musaf</i> and the people depart.<br>We do not recite <i>Kedushah</i> and supplicatory prayers after the morning service. Instead, we recite them before the <i>Minchah</i> service. What is implied? We recite <i>Tehillah l'David</i>, the order of the day, and supplicatory prayers. [The leader of the congregation] recites <i>Kaddish</i> and the <i>Minchah</i> service is recited [in a hushed tone.] Afterwards, [the leader of the congregation] repeats the service out loud, and then recites <i>Kaddish</i>.
On Rosh Chodesh and <i>Chol Hamo'ed</i>, one recites the order of <i>kedushah</i> before the <i>Musaf</i> prayer. On the night following the Sabbath, the order of the day is also recited after the evening service. [Then] one recites <i>Kaddish</i> and afterwards, <i>Havdalah</i>.

Chapter 10

A person who prayed without concentrating [on his prayers] must pray a second time with concentration. However, if he had concentrated during the first blessing, nothing more is necessary.<br>A person who errs in the recitation of the first three blessings [of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>] must return to the beginning [of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>]. Should one err in the recitation of the final three blessings, one should return to [the blessing, <i>R'tzey</i>]. If one errs in the midst of [one of] the intermediate blessings, one should return to the beginning of that blessing and [then] conclude one's prayers in the [proper] order.<br>Should the leader of the congregation err when he is praying out loud, he should [correct himself] based on these principles.
However, if the leader of the congregation errs while he is praying in a hushed tone, I maintain that he does not repeat his prayers a second time, because of the difficulty it will cause the congregation. Rather, he relies on the prayer which he will recite out loud.<br>The above applies when he does not err in the first three blessings. If he errs in their [recitation], he always repeats [his prayers] in the same manner as any [other] individual.
Should the leader of a congregation err [in his repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>], become confused and not know where to begin [again] - if he waits for a prolonged period, another person should replace him.<br>If he errs in the recitation of the blessing [that curses] the heretics, we do not wait for him [to correct himself]; rather, another person should replace him. This applies only when he did not begin this [blessing]. However, if he did begin [the blessing], we wait for him.<br>The second person should not refuse at this time.
From which point should [the substitute for the leader of the congregation] begin? If the first one erred in one of the intermediate blessings, [the substitute] should begin from the beginning of the blessing in which he erred. However, if he erred in one of the first three blessings, the [substitute] starts from the beginning [of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. If he erred in one of the final [three] blessings, the substitute should begin from [the blessing, <i>R'tzey</i>].
A person who says, "I will not lead the congregation in prayer because [I am wearing] colored clothes," should not lead the congregation in that prayer service even when wearing white clothes. If he said, "I will not lead the congregation because I am wearing sandals," he should not lead the congregation even when barefoot.
A person who is in doubt whether he prayed or not should not repeat his prayers, unless he recites the second prayer with the intention that it is a voluntary prayer, since an individual may recite voluntary prayers throughout the entire day.<br>A person who remembers that he has already prayed while he is in the midst of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> should cease [praying] immediately, even if he is in the midst of a blessing. [However,] if he was reciting the evening service, he need not cease [praying], for even at the outset, he did not begin that prayer service with the thought that it was an obligation.
A person who erred and recited a weekday prayer on the Sabbath does not fulfill his obligation. If he recalled while he was in the midst of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he should conclude the blessing which he has begun and [continue] reciting the Sabbath prayers.<br>When does the above apply? In the evening, morning, and <i>Minchah</i> services. However, in the <i>Musaf</i> service, one should cease [praying] even in the midst of a blessing. Similarly, if one completed a weekday <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> with the intention that it be one's <i>Musaf</i> prayers, one must recite <i>Musaf</i> again. This applies on the Sabbath, on a festival, and on Rosh Chodesh.
[When] one errs during the rainy season and does not recite either <i>morid hageshem</i> or <i>morid hatal</i>, he must return to the beginning of the prayers. However, if he mentions dew, he need not repeat [his prayers].<br>Should one err in the summer and recite <i>morid hageshem</i>, he must return to the beginning of the prayers. However, if he omits mention of dew [in the summer], he need not repeat his prayers, for dew is never held back, nor is there a need to request it.
[The following rules apply when] one forgets to request rain in the blessing for material prosperity: If he remembers before [the blessing,] <i>shome'a tefilah</i>, he should request rain in [that blessing]. If he [recalls] after reciting the blessing, <i>shome'a tefilah</i>, he should return to the blessing for material prosperity. If he does not recall until after he completes the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he must return to the beginning of the prayer and pray a second time.
[The following rules apply when] a person errs and fails to mention <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i>: If he remembers before he has concluded the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he should return to [the blessing, <i>R'tzey</i>], and recite it. If he remembers after he has concluded his prayers, he must repeat the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> from the beginning. If he is accustomed to recite supplicatory prayers after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> and remembers after he has concluded his prayers, but before he has lifted up his feet [to step backwards after prayer], he should return to [the blessing, <i>R'tzey</i>].
When does the above apply? On <i>Chol Hamo'ed</i> or in the morning or <i>Minchah</i> services of Rosh Chodesh. However, in the evening service of Rosh Chodesh, if one failed to mention it one need not repeat his prayers.
In every case in which an individual is required to repeat his prayers [because of an error], the leader of the congregation is also required to repeat his prayers if he made a similar mistake while praying out loud, with the exception of the morning service of Rosh Chodesh.<br>[In this instance,] if the leader of the congregation failed to mention <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> before completing his prayers, he is not required to repeat his prayers because of the difficulty it would cause the congregation. The <i>Musaf</i> service is still to be recited and Rosh Chodesh will be mentioned there.
If during the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, one erred and concluded the third blessing, <i>Ha'El hakadosh</i>, he should return to the beginning of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br>If he erred and concluded the eleventh blessing, <i>Melech ohev tzedakah umishpat</i>, he should return to the beginning of the blessing and conclude <i>Hamelech hamishpat</i>, and continue reciting his prayers in order. If he did not remember until he concluded his prayers, he must recite [his prayers again] from the beginning.<br>[These laws apply] to both an individual and to the leader of the congregation.
If a person erred and did not mention <i>Havdalah</i> in the blessing, <i>chonen hada'at</i>, he should conclude his prayers, without returning [to correct himself]. Similarly, one who did not mention <i>Al hanisim</i> on Chanukah or Purim, or <i>Anenu</i> in the prayers on a fast day, need not repeat his prayers. [These laws apply] to both an individual and the leader of a congregation.<br>If one remembers before lifting his feet [to step backwards after prayer], he should say: "Answer us because You are the one who hears prayer, redeems, and rescues in all times of difficulty and distress. May the words of my mouth...."
[A person who] forgot to recite the afternoon service on the Sabbath eve should recite the Sabbath evening service twice. [The same law applies] on a festival.<br>[A person who] forgot to recite the afternoon service on the Sabbath or a festival should recite the weekday evening service twice after their conclusion.<br>He should recite <i>Havdalah</i> in the first of these prayers and not in the second. However, if he recited <i>Havdalah</i> in both prayers or omitted it in both prayers, he fulfills his obligation. Nevertheless, if he did not recite <i>Havdalah</i> in his first <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, but mentioned it in his second, he [must] return and recite a third <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, since his first prayers were not acceptable because they were recited before the evening service.<br>Whoever recites two prayers [in succession] - even the morning service and the <i>Musaf</i> service - should not recite them one immediately after the other. Rather, he should wait between prayers, so that his mind will be settled.
It is forbidden for a person who is praying with a congregation to pray before the congregation.<br>[The following rules apply when] a person enters a synagogue and finds the congregation praying in a hushed tone: If he could begin and complete his prayers before the leader of the congregation reached <i>Kedushah</i>, he should recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. If not, he should wait until the leader of the congregation begins reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> out loud, and pray together with him word for word until the leader of the congregation reaches <i>Kedushah</i>. He should respond to <i>Kedushah</i> with the rest of the congregation and then recite the remainder of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> alone.<br>One who began reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> before the leader of the congregation, [but was unable to conclude his prayers before] the leader of the congregation reached <i>Kedushah</i>, should not interrupt his prayers [to] respond to <i>Kedushah</i> with [the congregation]. Similarly, one should not respond <i>Amen, yehei shemeih rabba mevarach...</i> while in the midst of <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Needless to say, [this applies regarding responding "Amen"] to other blessings.

Thus, the doorway on the eastern side would be opposite the ark.

How do the people sit in the synagogue? The elders sit facing the people with their backs toward the <i>heichal</i>. All the people sit row after row, each row facing the back of the row before it.

When do the above statements permitting the sale of a synagogue apply? In regard to a synagogue in a village.

By the same token, a synagogue used by a private group of people in a large city may be comparable to a village synagogue.

The inhabitants of a village<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the previous Halachah.</i> who desire to sell their synagogue in order to build another synagogue with the money, or to buy an ark or Torah scroll with the money,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">in keeping with Halachah 15</i> must establish as a condition [of the sale] that the purchaser not use the building for a bathhouse, a leatherworks, a <i>mikveh</i>, or a laundry.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The translation of the Hebrew, בית המים, is based on Rashi's commentary to <i>Megillah</i> 27b.

Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:9), Rav Yosef Karo mentions a latrine, but not a laundry.<br>The sanctity of the synagogue is transferred to the money received from its sale and the building itself is no longer considered as "holy."

When it is sold in this manner, it can be "used even as a tavern."<br>The Meiri explains the rationale for this decision as follows: Even if an explicit statement was not made to the effect that the synagogue could be used for an unbecoming purpose, it is understood that the village's inhabitants consecrated the synagogue with the understanding that it be subject to the decisions of the community's officials. Therefore, they have the right to sell the synagogue for whatever purposes they wish.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision and maintains that the license granted by <i>Megillah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) only applies to the money received from the sale, while the building that was used as a synagogue can never be used for a purpose which is unbecoming. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) quotes the Rambam's view, the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> suggests following the Ra'avad's decision, quoting the law (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 21:2), which forbids using a <i>tallit</i> for an unbecoming purpose even after its <i>tzitzit</i> have been removed.<br>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Responsa, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. II, 45) mentions this halachah in regard to the sale of synagogues in neighborhoods where Jews no longer live. Unfortunately, the natural clients for the purchase of an abandoned synagogue are churches. Rav Moshe states that selling a synagogue for use as a church is definitely forbidden. Using a synagogue for such purposes is more demeaning than using it for the purposes mentioned by the Talmud. He maintains that even according to the Rambam, selling a synagogue for this purpose could not be permitted.</i>

These authorities do not accept the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Megillah</i> 26a-b mentioned in the previous Halachah, and maintain that a certain measure of sanctity always remains in the synagogue. The Rambam maintains that the sanctity is transferred to the money received for the synagogue. Therefore, the condition made by the city officials can never effect the entire sum of money. Rather, the major portion must always be used for a sacred object.<br>[Interestingly, in his <i>Kessef Mishnah</i>, Rav Yosef Karo points out the advantages of the Rambam's position.

From the time of Ezra,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">when the Jews who returned from the Babylonian exile did not speak Hebrew fluently. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 4.)</i> it was customary that a translator would translate to the people the [passages] read by the reader from the Torah, so that they would understand the subject matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Book of Nechemiah, Chapter 8, describes Ezra's reading of the Torah to the people on Rosh HaShanah. Verses 7 and 8 explain that "they caused the people to understand the reading." <i>Megillah</i> 3a explains that this refers to the translation of the Torah.</i><br>The reader should read one verse alone and remain silent while the translator translates it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For the two voices will prevent the people from hearing either of them.</i> Afterwards, he should read a second verse.

He explains that, in his age, the custom of translating the Torah had already been ceased because the people did not understand the Aramaic translation traditionally used. The rabbis did not want to translate the Torah into the languages which the people did understand, because of the possibility of error and misinterpretation. Such fears had not existed in regard to the Aramaic translation, since it had been composed with <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i> (Divine inspiration).<br>[The <i>Tur</i>, however, also mentions the opinion of Rav Natrunai Gaon, who maintains that the translation should be done freely, so that the people can understand, without referring to the traditional text.]<br>The <i>Tur</i>'s opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 145:3) and in nearly all contemporary Jewish communities, the custom of using a translator during the Torah reading is no longer practiced. For this reason, rather than present a running commentary on Halachot 11 and 12, we have limited our comments to short footnotes.1. <i>Berachot</i> 45a states that this principle is derived from the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. God, "the Reader," did not lift his voice over that of Moses, "the translator."<br>It was also customary to use a מתורגמן in teaching the oral law. Hence, parallels to many of the laws mentioned in this halachah can also be found in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 4:3.2. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 4:1) mentions that we should approach the Torah reading with awe, reflecting the awe experienced by the Jews at Mount Sinai.3. Rabbenu Nissim maintains that this prohibition only applied before Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi permitted the oral tradition to be recorded. Afterwards, it was permitted for the translator to use a written text. Rabbenu Nissim's position is somewhat difficult to accept, since the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this law, was written several hundred years after Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi granted this leniency. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Nissim's view was widely accepted.4. The <i>Tosefta, Megillah</i> 3:21, cites the example of Aharon, who served as a spokesman for Moses. See also <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.5. Genesis 35:22. The direct translation of this verse would be unbecoming to both Reuven and Jacob (Rashi, <i>Megillah</i> 25a).6. The third of the priestly blessings states: "May God turn His countenance to you...." This appears to be a direct contradiction to the description of God (Deuteronomy 10:17  as "not turning His face...." Though our Sages resolved that difficulty (<i>Berachot</i> 20b), a problem might come up in a simple translation of the verse.<br>Rav Kapach notes that the Yemenite texts of Targum Onkelos lack a translation for the three verses of the priestly benediction.7. Were the common people given the opportunity of hearing the full story of the golden calf, they might believe that it had spiritual power (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>). Alternatively, the narrative places a major burden of responsibility on Aharon (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).8. The commentaries note that this passage is not read as a <i>haftarah</i> at present. Rav Kapach states that the need to make this statement indicates that in Talmudic times, the passages that were read as haftarot were not fixed and there was some room for choice.9. Verses from the Torah cannot be skipped in a public Torah reading. However, it is permitted to skip verses from the prophets while reading the <i>haftarah</i> (<i>Tos'fot Yom Tov, Megillah</i> 10:3).</i>
The reader is not permitted to raise his voice above that of the translator, nor should the translator raise his voice above that of the reader. The translator is not permitted to [begin] translating until the reader completes reading the verse, nor may the reader [begin] reading another verse until the translator has completed the translation.<br>The translator should not lean on a beam or on a pillar. Rather, he should stand with awe and fear. He should not translate from a written text, but rather should recite the translation by heart.<br>The reader is not permitted to assist the translator, lest people say: "The translation is written in the Torah scroll." A person of lesser stature may serve as a translator for a person of greater stature. However, it is not befitting the honor of a person of greater stature to serve as a translator for a person of lesser stature. Two people should not serve as translators simultaneously; rather, one person should read and one should translate.
Not all passages from the Torah are translated in public. All [of the following passages] should be read, but not translated: the incident involving Reuven, the priestly benediction, [the passage describing the sin] of the golden calf from "And Moses told Aharon" (Exodus 32:21  until "And Moses saw the people" (Exodus 32:25  and one other verse, "And God set a plague upon the people" (Exodus 32:35 .<br>In the [description of] the incident concerning Amnon (II Samuel, Chapter 13), the verse which states, "Amnon, the son of David" (13:1) should be neither read nor translated.

Even according to the interpretation of the term as "shopkeepers," it is possible that in consideration of the time spent preparing the festive meals, the Rabbis did not institute the reading of the Torah in the <i>Minchah</i> service.</i>

Chapter 13

The common custom throughout all Israel is to complete the [reading of] the Torah in one year. [The cycle] is begun on the Sabbath after the Sukkot festival, reading the <i>sidrah, Bereshit</i>. On the following Sabbath, [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Eleh toldot</i> [is read]; on the third, [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Vayomer Ado-nai el Avram</i>. We continue reading according to this order until the Torah is completed, during the Sukkot festival.<br>There are those who finish the Torah reading in a three-year cycle. However, this is not a widely accepted custom.
Ezra instituted the practice of having the Jews read the "curses" found in the Book of Leviticus before Shavuot, and those found in the Book of Deuteronomy before Rosh HaShanah.<br>It is common custom to read [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Bemidbar Sinai</i> before Shavuot, [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Va'etchanan</i> after Tish'ah B'Av, [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Attem nitzavim</i> before Rosh HaShanah, and [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Tzav et Aharon</i> before Pesach in an ordinary year.<br>Therefore, there are Sabbaths on which two <i>sedarim</i> are read: for example, [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Ishah ki tazria</i> and [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Vezot tih'yeh torat hametzora</i> [are often combined. Similarly, the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Im bechukotai</i> [is often combined] with [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Behar Sinai</i>, so that [the reading of the Torah] will be completed in a year, and the <i>sedarim</i> will be read at the appropriate times.
At the point [in the Torah] where the Sabbath morning [reading] was completed, the reading [is begun] on the Sabbath afternoon, on Monday, on Thursday, and on the following Sabbath.<br>What is implied? On the first Sabbath, we read [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Bereshit</i> in the morning. In the afternoon, ten or more verses from [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Eleh toldot Noach</i> are read. The same practice [is followed] on Monday and Thursday. On the coming Sabbath, we begin from <i>Eleh toldot Noach</i>, and read until the conclusion of the <i>sidrah</i>. This pattern is followed throughout the year.<br>On each Sabbath, a <i>haftarah</i> is recited that reflects the Torah reading.
On Rosh Chodesh, the first reader reads three verses from the passage (Numbers 28:1-15) <i>Tzav</i>. The second reader reads the third verse which was read by the first reader, and the following two verses, so that three verses will remain in the passage. The third reader reads the three verses that were left [unread] by the second reader, and the passage "And on the Sabbath day...." The fourth reader reads [the passage] "And on your new months...."<br>If Rosh Chodesh falls on the Sabbath, two Torah scrolls are taken out in the morning. The <i>sidrah</i> of that particular Sabbath is read from one, and the person who concludes the reading reads [the passage] "And on your new months...."<br>The person who reads the <i>haftarah</i> reads the passage concerning Rosh Chodesh, and then reads [the passage (Isaiah 66:1-24) that concludes:] "And it will be from month to month..." as the <i>haftarah</i>.<br>If Rosh Chodesh Av falls on the Sabbath [the passage, Isaiah 1:14-31, beginning:] "My soul hates your new moons and your festivals" is read as the <i>haftarah</i>.<br>If Rosh Chodesh falls on Sunday, on the preceding Sabbath [the passage (I Samuel 20:18-42), beginning:] "And Jonathan told him: 'Tomorrow is the new month...'” is read as the <i>haftarah</i>.
Whoever is called to read from the Torah should begin [his reading] with a positive matter and conclude with a positive matter.<br>However, in <i>Parashat Ha'azinu</i>, the first [person called to the Torah] reads until <i>Z'chor y'mot olam</i> (Deuteronomy 32:7 . The second begins from <i>Z'chor y'mot olam</i> [and continues] until <i>Yarkivehu</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:13). The third [reads] from <i>Yarkivehu</i> until <i>Vayar Ado-nai vayin'atz</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:19). The fourth [reads] from <i>Vayar Ado-nai vayin'atz</i> until <i>Lu chachmu</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:29). The fifth [reads] from <i>Lu chachmu</i> until <i>Ki essa el shamayim yadi</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:40). The sixth [reads] from <i>Ki essa el shamayim yadi</i> until the conclusion of the song (<i>ibid.</i>:43).<br>Why is the Torah reading ceased at these points? Because these are [verses of] rebuke, [and the intent is that] that they motivate the people to repent.
The eight verses at the conclusion of the Torah may be read in a synagogue when fewer than ten people are present. They are indeed all Torah and were related by Moses from the Almighty. However, since, on the surface, they appear to have been recited after Moses' death, the [rules governing them] are different. Therefore, it is permissible for an individual to read them.
The "curses" in Leviticus should not be interrupted. Rather, a single person should read them [in their entirety]. He should begin with the verse preceding them and conclude with the verse following them.<br>The "curses" in Deuteronomy may be interrupted if one desires. However, the people have already adopted the custom of not interrupting [this reading]. Rather, a single person reads them [in their entirety].
[The cycle of Torah readings] is interrupted for the festivals and Yom Kippur. [On these occasions,] we read [a passage that] concerns the festival and not the <i>sidrah</i> of [that] Sabbath.<br>Moses instituted [the practice that], on each festival, the Jews should read [a passage] appropriate to it. Also, it [is proper] on each festival to ask about and explain the subjects [pertinent] to that festival.<br>Which [passages] are read? On Pesach, [we read] the passage concerning the festivals in Leviticus  23:4-44). [However,] the people have already adopted the custom of reading <i>Mishchu uk'chu lachem</i> (Exodus 12:21-51) on the first day. The <i>haftarah</i> is [the description] of the Pesach celebrated in Gilgal (Joshua 5:2-15).<br>On the second day, we read <i>Shor o kesev</i> (Leviticus 22:26-23:44). The <i>haftarah</i> is [the description] of the Pesach celebrated by Josaiah (II Kings 1-9, 21-25). On the third day, we read <i>Kadesh li kol b'chor</i> (Exodus 13:1-16); on the fourth day, <i>Im kessef talveh</i> (Exodus 22:24-23:19); on the fifth day, <i>P'sol lecha</i> (Exodus 34:1-26); on the sixth day, <i>Vaya'asu Bnei Yisrael et hapesach b'mo'ado</i> (Numbers 9:1-14).<br>On the final festival, [we read] from <i>Vay'hi beshalach</i> until the conclusion of the song [sung at Red Sea] until [the verse,] <i>Ani Ado-nai rof'echa</i> (Exodus 13:17-15:26). The <i>haftarah</i> is <i>Vayedaber David</i> (II Samuel 22:1-51).<br>On the eighth day, [we read], <i>Kol hab'chor</i> (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17). The <i>haftarah</i> is <i>Od hayom</i> (Isaiah 10:32-4, 11:1-16, 12:1-6).
On Shavuot, we read [the passage, containing the reading] <i>Shiv'ah shavuot</i> (Deuteronomy 16:9 . However, it is common custom to read [the passage,] <i>Bachodesh hash'lishi</i> (Exodus 19:1-20:23) on the first day of the festival. [The vision of God's] chariot (Ezekiel 1:1-28) is read as the <i>haftarah</i>.<br>On the second day, the passage describing the festivals, <i>Kol hab'chor</i> (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17) is read, and [a passage from] Chabbakuk (3:1-19) is read as the <i>haftarah</i>.
On Rosh HaShanah, we read [the passage including the verse]: <i>Uvachodesh hash'vi'i b'echad lachodesh</i> (Numbers 29:1 . However, it is common custom to read [the passage,] <i>VAdo-nai pakad et Sarah</i> (Genesis 21:1-33). [The passage,] <i>Vay'hi ish echad min haramatayim</i> (I Samuel 1:1-2:10) is read as the <i>haftarah</i>.<br>On the second day, [the passage,] <i>V'HaElo-him nisah et Avraham</i> (Genesis 22:1-24) is read, and [the passage including the verse] <i>Haven yakir li Efrayim</i> (Jeremiah 31:1-19) is read as the <i>haftarah</i>.
On Yom Kippur, in the morning, we read [the passage,] <i>Acharei mot</i> (Leviticus 16:1-34) and read [the passage,] <i>Ki koh amar ram v'nisa</i> (Isaiah 57:14-58:14) as the <i>haftarah</i>.<br>In the afternoon, [we read the passage] in <i>Acharei mot</i> that is concerned with forbidden sexual relations, in order that anyone who has violated one of these sins will remember, become embarrassed, and repent. The third person [who] reads from the Torah recites [the Book of] Yonah as the <i>haftarah</i>.
On Sukkot, on the first two days, we read the passage that concerns the festivals: <i>Shor o kesev o eyz</i> (Leviticus 22:26-23:44). The <i>haftarah</i> read on the first day is [the passage,] <i>Hiney yom ba l'Ado-nai</i> (Zechariah 14). On the second day, [the <i>haftarah</i> is the passage,] <i>Vayikahalu el hamelech Shlomo</i> (I Kings 8:2-21).<br>On the final day of the festival, we read [the passage,] <i>Kol hab'chor</i> (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17). For the <i>haftarah</i>, we read [the passage,] <i>Vay'hi k'chalot Shlomo</i> (I Kings 8:54-66).<br>On the following day, we read [the <i>sidrah,</i>] <i>Vezot haberachah</i> (Deuteronomy 33-34). For the <i>haftarah</i>, we read [the passage,] <i>Vaya'amod Shlomo</i> (I Kings 8:22-53). There are those who read [the passage,] <i>Vay'hi acharei mot Moshe</i> (Joshua 1) as the <i>haftarah</i>.<br>On the other days of Sukkot, we read [the passages that describe] the sacrifices [offered] on the festival.
What is implied? On each of the days of <i>Chol Hamo'ed</i>, we read two passages. [For example,] on the third day [of the festival], which is [the first day of] <i>Chol Hamo'ed</i>, the priest reads [the passage,] <i>Uvayom hasheni</i>. The Levite reads [the passage,] <i>Uvayom hash'lishi</i>. The Israelite repeats [the passage,] <i>Uvayom hash'lishi,</i> and the person called for the fourth<i>aliyah</i> repeats [both passages:] <i>Uvayom hasheni</i> and <i>Uvayom hash'lishi</i>.<br>Similarly, on the fourth day [of the festival], which is the second day of <i>Chol Hamo'ed</i>, we read the passages <i>Uvayom hash'lishi</i> and <i>Uvayom harevi'i</i>. The same pattern is followed on all the [other] days.
In the morning [service] on each and every one of the festivals, on Yom Kippur, and during the seven days of Pesach, two [Torah] scrolls are taken out. We read the passages mentioned above from the first scroll, and from the second scroll we read the description of the sacrifices [offered on] that day, in the Book of Numbers. The person who reads the description of the sacrifices recites the <i>haftarah</i> from the prophets.
On any day when two or three [Torah] scrolls are taken out: if they are taken out one after the other, when the first scroll is returned, <i>Kaddish</i> is recited and the second scroll is taken out. When the second scroll is returned, <i>Kaddish</i> is also recited.<br>We have mentioned above that the common custom is to recite <i>Kaddish</i> after the reader concludes the reading at all times, and then to recite the <i>haftarah</i> from the prophets.
When the Sabbath falls during <i>Chol Hamo'ed</i> - whether during Pesach or during Sukkot - [the passage,] <i>R'ey Attah omer elai</i> (Exodus 33:12-34:26) is read on that Sabbath. On Pesach, [the passage describing Ezekiel's vision of] the dry bones (Chapter 37) is read as the <i>haftarah</i>. When [the Sabbath] falls in the midst of Sukkot, [the passage,] <i>B'yom bo Gog</i> (Ezekiel 38:18-39:16) is read as the <i>haftarah</i>.
On Chanukah, [the following passages are read:] On the first day, we read from the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:38-42) until the conclusion of the sacrifice offered on the first day (Numbers 7:17 . On the second day, we read [the passage describing] the sacrifices of the <i>Nasi</i> who brought the offering on the second day. This practice is continued until the eighth day. On the eighth day, we read [the descriptions of] all the [remaining] sacrifices until the end of the portion.<br>On the Sabbath of Chanukah, the <i>haftarah</i> is Zechariah's [vision of the Menorah (2:14-4:7)]. If two Sabbaths are celebrated during Chanukah, on the first Sabbath, Zechariah's [vision of the Menorah] is read as the <i>haftarah</i>; on the second, [the description of] Solomon's [Menorah is read as the <i>haftarah</i> (I Kings 7:40-50)]. The one who reads the [passage designated for] Chanukah is the one who recites the <i>haftarah</i> from the prophets.<br>On Purim, [the passage,] <i>Vayavo Amalek</i> (Exodus 17:8-16) [is read].
On Tish'ah B'Av, in the morning, [the passage,] <i>Ki tolid banim</i> (Deuteronomy 4:25-40) is read, and [the passage,] <i>Asof asifem, n'um Ado-nai</i> (Jeremiah 8:13-9:23) is read as the <i>haftarah</i>. During the <i>Minchah</i> service, we read [the passage,] <i>Vay'chal Moshe</i> (Exodus 32:11-14, 34:1-10), as on other fast days.<br>On the other days when we fast [to commemorate the bitter events] that occurred to our ancestors, we read the [above-mentioned passage,] in the morning and <i>Minchah</i> services [in the following manner]: The first person called to the Torah reads four verses, [beginning] <i>Vay'chal Moshe</i>. The second and the third read from <i>P'sol lecha</i> until <i>asher ani oseh imach</i>.<br>On the fasts that are declared by the community because of difficulties like famine or plague, we read blessings and curses, so that the people will repent and humble their hearts when they hear them.
It is customary on the three Sabbaths before Tish'ah B'Av to read haftarot of rebuke. On the first Sabbath, we read [the passage,] <i>Divrei Yirmiyahu</i> (Jeremiah 1:1-2:3) as the <i>haftarah</i>. On the second [Sabbath], we read [the passage,] <i>Chazon Yishayahu</i> (Isaiah 1:1-27). On the third [Sabbath], we read [the passage,] <i>Eichah hay'ta l'zonah</i> (Isaiah 1:21 .<br>Similarly, on the Sabbath after Tish'ah B'Av we read [the passage <i>Nachamu, nachamu, ami</i> (Isaiah 40:1-26) as the <i>haftarah</i>. It is the common custom in our cities to read the comforting prophecies of Isaiah as the haftarot from Tish'ah B'Av until Rosh HaShanah.<br>On the Sabbath between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, we read [the passage,] <i>Shuvah Yisrael</i> as the <i>haftarah</i>.
When Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on the Sabbath, we read <i>Parashat Shekalim</i> (Exodus 30:11-16), and read as the <i>haftarah</i> [the passage concerning] Yehoyada, the priest (II Kings 11:17-20, 12:1-17). If Rosh Chodesh Adar falls in the middle of the week - even if it falls on Friday - <i>Parashat Shekalim</i> is read on the previous Sabbath.<br>On the "second Sabbath," we read <i>Parashat Zachor</i> (Deuteronomy 25:17-19), and read as the <i>haftarah</i>, [the passage,] <i>Pakad'ti et asher asah Amalek</i> (I Samuel 15:1-34). What is meant by the "second Sabbath"? The Sabbath before the week in which Purim falls - even if Purim falls on Friday.<br>On the "third Sabbath," we read [the passage describing] "the red heifer" (Numbers 19:1-22), and read as the <i>haftarah</i> [the passage,] <i>V'zarakti aleichem</i> (Ezekiel 36:16-38). Which is the "third Sabbath"? The one preceding the fourth.<br>On the fourth Sabbath, we read [the passage,] <i>Hachodesh hazeh lachem</i> (Exodus 12:1-20), and read as the <i>haftarah</i> [the passage,] <i>Barishon b'echad lachodesh</i> (Ezekiel 45:16-25, 46:1-18). Which is the "fourth Sabbath"? The Sabbath of the week when Rosh Chodesh Nisan falls - even if it falls on Friday.
Thus, there will be times when there is an interruption between the first [of these] Sabbaths and the second, or between the second and the third. At times, there will be two interruptions - between the first and the second and between the second and third. However, an interruption is never made between the third and fourth [Sabbaths].

[When] Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on the Sabbath, three Torah scrolls are taken out. The <i>sidrah</i> of the day is read from the first scroll. The passage concerning Rosh Chodesh is read from the second scroll, and <i>Ki tissa</i> is read from the third scroll. Similarly, [when] Rosh Chodesh Nisan falls on the Sabbath, three Torah scrolls are taken out. The <i>sidrah</i> of the day is read from the first scroll, the passage concerning Rosh Chodesh is read from the second scroll, and <i>Hachodesh hazeh</i> is read from the third scroll.
[Similarly, when] Rosh Chodesh Tevet falls on the Sabbath, three Torah scrolls are taken out. The <i>sidrah</i> of the day is read from the first scroll. The passage concerning Rosh Chodesh is read from the second scroll, and the passage for Chanukah is read from the third scroll.<br>[When Rosh Chodesh Tevet] falls during the middle of the week, three people read from the passage concerning Rosh Chodesh, and the fourth person reads the passage for Chanukah.
Although a person hears the entire Torah [portion] each Sabbath [when it is read] communally, he is obligated to study on his own each week the <i>sidrah</i> of that week, reading it twice in the original and once in the Aramaic translation. [When] there is no Aramaic translation for a verse, one should read the verse three times in the original, so that one completes [the study of] one's [Torah] portions with the community.

They take the initiative, so that an interruption is not made between the recitation of the blessing before the performance of a mitzvah and its actual performance.<br>Study of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) shows that the Rambam himself had questions about this matter. In the first manuscripts, the Rambam writes that "the leader of the congregation recites <i>Y'varechecha</i>, and the priests read after him." This is also the reading in the popularly published edition of that text. However, in the later manuscripts of the Commentary on the Mishnah (see Rav Kapach's edition of that text), the Rambam changes his mind and states that the priests begin reciting <i>y'varechecha</i>.<br>In his <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128), Rav Yosef Karo mentions these different views, and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (128:13) rules that the priests begin on their own initiative.

In the present halachah, the Rambam does not make such an allowance.<br>Perhaps the difference is that in Chapter 15, there is the possibility that the recitation of the priestly blessing will be nullified entirely. Hence, greater leniency is shown. In this halachah, the congregation as a whole will not suffer if the <i>chazan</i> does not respond "Amen" to the priests' blessings.

There, the Levites would stand and accompany the Temple service with songs and music. No mention is made of the priests standing there. Also, in Halachah 14, the Rambam mentions that the priests would bless the people while standing on the steps of the Temple building.<br>The Radbaz (Vol. II, <i>Leshonot HaRambam</i>) offers a resolution to this difficulty, noting that priests with disqualifying physical deformities may not stand on the Temple steps (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:20).

In the first manuscripts, the Rambam writes that "the leader of the congregation recites <i>Y'varechecha</i>, and the priests read after him." This is also the reading in the popularly published edition of that text. However, in the later manuscripts of the Commentary on the Mishnah (see Rav Kapach's edition of that text), the Rambam changes his mind and states that the priests begin reciting <i>y'varechecha</i>.<br>In his <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128), Rav Yosef Karo mentions these different views, and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (128:13) rules that the priests begin on their own initiative.

Thus, the failure to bless the people is considered as nullifying the observance of three commands.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), the Rambam cites this teaching as a classic example of a fundamental principle regarding the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. Though the Talmud often states that many mitzvot are involved in the performance or transgression of a particular commandment, this does not mean that the mitzvah should be counted as more than one mitzvah when calculating the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
