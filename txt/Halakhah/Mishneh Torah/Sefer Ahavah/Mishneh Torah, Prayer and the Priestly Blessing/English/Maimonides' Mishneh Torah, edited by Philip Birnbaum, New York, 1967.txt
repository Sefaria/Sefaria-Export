Mishneh Torah, Prayer and the Priestly Blessing



Chapter 1




When the Jewish people were exiled in the days of wicked Nebuchadnezzar, they mixed with Persians, Greeks and other nationalities. Children were born to them in foreign lands. The language of these children was confused, a mixture of many languages. They were unable to express themselves adequately and accurately in any one language, as it is written: "Their children spoke half in the tongue of Ashdod; they could not speak Hebrew, nor any foreign tongue" (Nehemiah 13:24). When anyone of them prayed, his Hebrew vocabulary was too limited to express his needs or to praise God without mixing Hebrew with other tongues. When Ezra and his council took notice of this, they instituted the Eighteen Benedictions in their present order: the first three contain praise to God; the last three, thanksgiving; the intermediate benedictions contain petitions for the most essential needs of the individual and the community. They were to be set on everyone's lips and learned, so that the men of inarticulate speech might offer prayer as clearly as those who speak an eloquent Hebrew. For this reason they instituted all other blessings and prayers which are arrayed on the lips of all Israel, to make each blessing readily available to one who is unfamiliar with the language.

Congregational prayer is always heard by God. Even if sinners are present, God does not reject public worship. One should therefore associate himself with the congregation; he should not pray in private when he can pray with the congregation.— —


How is public worship conducted? One person recites the prayers aloud and all the rest listen. This is not done if there are fewer than ten adult men present, including the reader.— —
— — <i>Kaddish</i> is not recited unless ten are present. The <i>kohanim</i> do not raise their hands to pronounce the priestly benediction unless ten are present, the <i>kohanim</i> being included in the number. Every group of ten Israelites is called <i>congregation</i>, as it is written: "How long shall I endure this wicked congregation" (Numbers 14:27). This verse refers to ten spies, Joshua and Caleb being excluded.



The reader acts on behalf of the assembled congregation. When, for example, he recites the prayers while the people listen and respond <i>Amen</i> after each blessing, it is as if they are praying. This only applies to one who does not know how to worship; but one who knows does not fulfill his duty unless he recites the prayers himself.

The appointed congregational reader should be known for his knowledge and good conduct. If he happens to be an elderly person, so much the better. An effort should be made to secure one who has a pleasant voice and is fluent in reading.— —
An inarticulate man, who pronounces the <i>aleph</i> as an <i>ayin</i> or the <i>ayin</i> as an <i>aleph</i>, and anyone who fails to pronounce the letters correctly, should not be appointed as congregational reader.— —

Chapter 11

Any place inhabited by ten Jews should have a house of worship where they can assemble at all times of prayer. This is called a synagogue. The residents may compel each other to build a synagogue and buy a <i>Sefer Torah</i> as well as the books of the Prophets and the Sacred Writings.



Synagogues and houses of learning should be treated with respect; they should be swept and sprinkled to let the dust settle. In Spain and Morocco, in Babylonia and Eretz Yisrael, it is customary to light lamps in the synagogues and to spread mats on the floor to sit upon. In Christian countries they sit on chairs.
Synagogues and houses of learning should not be treated with irreverence, such as jesting, mocking or chatting. We must not eat, drink, have pleasures, or ramble about there. We must not enter them for protection from the sun or the rain. Teachers and their students, however, are permitted to eat and drink there when necessary.
No computing should be made there, unless it is connected with some religious duty, such as counting the proceeds of the charity fund or the collection of ransom money, and so on. No funeral address should be delivered there, unless it is of public interest, as when one of the city's leading scholars is eulogized and the entire community is likely to attend.

Chapter 12

Our teacher Moses introduced the custom of reading the Torah publicly on Sabbath, Monday and Thursday, during the morning service, so that three days should not elapse without hearing the Torah. Ezra set up the rule that the Torah should be read during the afternoon service every Sabbath for the benefit of those seated at street corners [traders, who do not attend services on weekdays]. He also established the rule that three men should be called up to the reading of the Torah on Monday and Thursday and that they should read not less than ten verses altogether.
The Torah is read publicly on Sabbaths, festivals, <i>Rosh Hodesh</i>, fast days, <i>Hanukkah, Purim</i>, and on Mondays and Thursdays. The prophetical reading (<i>haftarah</i>) is rendered only on Sabbaths, festivals, and <i>Tish'ah b'Av</i>.






As soon as the reader begins to read the Torah, it is forbidden to talk even on a religious topic. All must listen silently and pay attention to what he is reading, as it is written: "They all listened closely to the book of the Torah" (Nehemiah 8:3). It is also forbidden to leave the synagogue while the Torah is being read; but it is permissible to leave between the <i>aliyyoth</i> of the men called up to the Torah. A person who is always engaged in Torah study, this being his main occupation, may nevertheless go on studying while the Torah is read.
Since the days of Ezra it had been customary to have an interpreter present, explaining to the people what the reader is reading in the Torah, so that they may understand what it is all about. The reader reads one verse only, waits till the interpreter has explained it, and then reads the next verse. The reader may not read to the interpreter more than one verse at a time.





How many persons are called up to the reading of the Torah? Seven during Sabbath morning service, six on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, five on festivals; no fewer than these are called up, but the number may be increased. Four are called up on <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> and <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i>. Three are called up during the afternoon services of Sabbath and <i>Yom Kippur</i>, as well as during the morning services held on Mondays and Thursdays throughout the year, and also during the morning and afternoon services held on fast days. The numbers of four and three <i>aliyyoth</i>, just indicated, are neither decreased nor increased.

In each Torah reading, a <i>kohen</i> reads first, then a <i>levi</i>, then a <i>yisrael</i>. According to a wide-spread custom, even an illiterate <i>kohen</i> has priority over a great scholar who is a <i>yisrael</i> (lay Israelite). Otherwise, the person who is superior in knowledge precedes the one who is inferior as to the remaining <i>aliyyoth</i>. The person who is honored with the last <i>aliyyah</i>, who rolls up the Torah scroll, receives a reward excelling that of the others. Hence [because of the importance of the last <i>aliyyah</i>], even the chief officer of the congregation ascends to complete the Torah reading.
In the absence of a <i>kohen</i>, a <i>yisrael</i> ascends to the Torah first, in which case a <i>levi</i> should not ascend after him. In the absence of a <i>levi</i>, the <i>kohen</i>, who read the first section, reads the second section in place of the <i>levi</i>. Another <i>kohen</i> should not read after the first, lest people would say that the first is a disqualified <i>kohen</i>, substituted by another. Neither should one <i>levi</i> follow another, lest people might suspect one of the two as disqualified.

Chapter 13

The widespread custom among the Jews is that of completing the Torah reading in one year. It is begun on the Sabbath after <i>Sukkoth</i> — — and continued in regular order till the last weekly portion is read on <i>Sukkoth</i>. Some complete the Torah reading in three years, but this is not a widespread custom.























Although one hears the congregational reading of the Torah every Sabbath, one should read for himself each weekly portion three times, twice the original text and once the Aramaic version known as Targum Onkelos. A verse that is not rendered in Targum Onkelos should be read three times in the original Hebrew. In this fashion one will conclude the weekly portions of the Torah together with the congregation.
