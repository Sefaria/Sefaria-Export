Mishneh Torah, Blessings



Chapter 1

It is a positive mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 19) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 430) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> from the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">as opposed to the other blessings, which were ordained by the Rabbis.</i> to bless [God] after eating satisfying food,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> and others interpret "satisfying food" as referring to bread made from the five species of grain mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 1. Significantly, the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and the <i>Noda BiYhudah</i> maintain that with this expression, the Rambam is implying that the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>, which is recited over other foods made from these species, also has its source in the Torah itself (See also <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 209).</i> as [Deuteronomy 8:10] states: "When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless God, your Lord."<br>The Torah itself requires a person to recite grace only when he eats to the point of satiation,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis do not specify a standard quantity or measure of food that a person must eat to have reached this state. Rather, they leave the matter up to the person's own feelings.</i> as implied by the above verse, "When you have eaten and <i>are satiated,</i> you shall bless...."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The proof-text clearly indicates that the obligation to "bless" applies only when one is "satiated."</i> The Sages, however, ordained<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:<br>The angels complained to the Holy One, blessed be He: "...In Your Torah, it is written [that You] 'will not show favor, nor take bribes,' and yet You show favor to the Jews...."<br>God replied: "Are the Jews not worthy that I show them favor? In My Torah, I have written, ‘When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless,’ and they have nevertheless adopted the stringency of reciting grace after eating an amount equivalent to an olive."</i> that one should recite grace after eating [an amount of bread equal] to the size of an olive.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">a <i>k'zayit</i>. This is the measurement generally intended by the Torah for the mitzvot and prohibitions concerned with eating. In contemporary measure, it is equivalent to 28.8 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 33 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.<br>Note the commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 16, which discusses the Ra'avad's opinion that anyone who eats a <i>k'zayit</i> of bread is required by the Torah to recite grace.</i>
Similarly, the Rabbis ordained<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The definition of this obligation as Rabbinical in nature has aroused questions. <i>Berachot</i> 35a states that this concept can be derived through one of the thirteen principles of Biblical interpretation. Thus, it has all the authority of a Torah law. Though the Rambam (see the Introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, General Principle 2) refers to laws derived in this manner as מדברי סופרים - literally, "from the words of our Sages," the same term used here - his intent is not to imply that the law did not originate in the Torah itself.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot,</i> loc. cit.), however, explain that the Talmud ultimately does not accept the interpretation that the obligation is derived from the Torah, and maintain that the obligation to recite blessings is Rabbinic in origin. Even according to these opinions, it appears that the Sages ordained the recitation of blessings rather early in our national history. Midrashim referring to the age of King David explicitly mention the recitation of blessings, and there are intimations of this obligation in references to earlier periods. See also the commentary on Halachah 5.</i> that we recite blessings before partaking of any food.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, states: "It is forbidden to benefit from this world without reciting a blessing." Therefore,</i> Even when one wants to eat the slightest amount of food or drink,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., less than a <i>k'zayit</i> or a <i>revi'it</i></i> one should recite a blessing, and then derive benefit from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, however, a blessing need not be recited after eating or drinking.</i><br>Similarly, when smelling a pleasant fragrance, one should recite a blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9 with regard to the particular blessings required.</i> and then smell.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 43b quotes Psalms 150:6: "All souls shall praise God," and asks: "From what does a soul benefit? Fragrance."</i> Anyone who derives benefit [from this world] without reciting a blessing is considered as if he misappropriated a sacred article.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 35a explains that the entire world belongs to God, as Psalms 24:1 declares: "The earth and its fullness are God's." Although God allows man to benefit from this world, that license is granted only when man acknowledges God's control by reciting a blessing.</i><br>The Rabbis also ordained that one should recite a blessing after eating or drinking, provided one drinks a <i>revi'it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>revi'it</i> means "a fourth." It is one fourth of a larger measure, known as a <i>log</i>. In contemporary measure, a <i>revi'it</i> is equivalent to 86.6 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 150 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> and eats a <i>k'zayit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Anything less is not considered significant enough to require a blessing afterwards. A blessing beforehand must nevertheless be recited, because "it is forbidden to benefit from this world without a blessing."<br>There is, however, a law which appears to be an exception to this principle:</i> A person who [merely] tastes food is not required to recite a blessing before partaking of it or afterwards unless he partakes of a <i>revi'it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rav David Arameah explains that this law applies only when one spits out the food one tastes. If one swallows it, a blessing is required. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differs, and maintains that even when a person swallows the food, since his intent is not to benefit from it - but merely to taste it - and he partakes of only a very small amount, a blessing is not required.</i>
Just as we recite blessings for benefit which we derive from the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">as explained above,</i> we should also recite blessings for each mitzvah before we fulfill it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The laws governing the blessings recited over the performance of mitzvot are discussed in Chapter 11.</i><br>Similarly, the Sages instituted many blessings as expressions of praise and thanks to God and as a means of petition,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10.</i> so that we will always remember the Creator, even though we have not received any benefit or performed a mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">By reciting blessings over the special events which occur to us, we become conscious of God's control of all aspects of our daily existence. We learn to appreciate Him, not only as the Creator who brought the world into being, but as the One who directs the functioning of our lives and the world around us.</i>
Thus, all the blessings can be divided into three categories:<br>a) blessings over benefit;<br>b) blessings over mitzvot;<br>c) blessings recited as expressions of praise and thanks to God and as a means of petition, so that we will always remember the Creator and fear Him.
The text of all the blessings was ordained by Ezra and his court.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 33a explains that when the Men of the Great Assembly established the text of the prayer service (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 1:4), they also established the text for the various blessings and for <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdalah</i>.<br>This, however, does not mean that the blessings were not recited beforehand. Rather, just as explained with regard to prayer, before Ezra's time each person would recite the blessings according to his own inspiration and ability to express himself. In Ezra's time, many people had difficulty expressing themselves eloquently and, therefore, Ezra and his court established a standard text.</i> It is not fit to alter it,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">to substitute different words</i> to add to it, or to detract from it. Whoever alters the text of a blessing from that ordained by the Sages is making an error.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz (Vol. 5, Responsum 1424) states that as long as the person mentions God's name, His sovereignty over the world, and the subject of the blessing, he fulfills his obligation even if he does not use the text ordained by the Sages. (This interpretation is borne out by the next halachah.)<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's phraseology alludes to two types of changes:a) Changes which do not substantially alter the blessing from the text ordained by the Sages. With regard to such changes, the Rambam uses the expression "it is not fit," which implies that although the person's deed is not desirable, he fulfills his obligation.b) A change of an innovative nature which alters the text of the blessing entirely. These changes the Rambam considers as "errors" which prevent a person from fulfilling his obligation. See also Halachah 13, <i>Berachot</i> 40b, and <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:7.</i><br>A blessing that does not include the mention of God's name<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the phrase י-ה-ו-ה א-להנו (God, our Lord),</i> and His sovereignty [over the world]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the phrase מלך העולם (King of the universe)</i> is not considered a blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">and the person reciting it does not fulfill his obligation. See <i>Berachot</i> 40b.</i> unless it is recited in proximity to a blessing [which meets these criteria].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For example, the second and third blessings in grace, which do not mention God's sovereignty because they follow directly after the first blessing, which does. Since the blessings are recited in one continuum, one's original statement is applied to the subsequent blessings as well.</i>
All the blessings may be recited in any language,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Although the text ordained by Ezra and his court was in Hebrew, there is no absolute requirement to use that language</i> provided one recites [a translation of] the text ordained by the Sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 185:1-2, which quotes an opinion that maintains that a person who recites a blessing does not fulfill his obligation unless he understands what he is saying, even when he recites the blessing in Hebrew. Although there are other opinions that maintain that as long as the blessing is recited in Hebrew, one fulfills his obligation, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> concludes that it is preferable for a person who does not understand Hebrew to recite the blessings - in particular, the grace - in a language he understands.</i> [A person who] changes that text<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">reciting a different blessing from that ordained by the Sages</i> fulfills his obligation nonetheless<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">since he mentioned God's name, His sovereignty, and the subject of the blessing - although he did so in a ordinary language. –I.e., a language other than “the Holy Tongue,” Hebrew. See <i>Berachot</i> 40b, which states that a person who recites the phrase "Blessed be God, Master of this bread" in Aramaic fulfills his obligation for the first blessing of grace. Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:10) which requires that God's sovereignty over the world also be mentioned.</i> - since he mentioned God's name, His sovereignty, and the subject of the blessing - although he did so in a ordinary language.
A person should recite all the blessings loud enough for him to hear what he is saying. Nevertheless, a person who does not recite a blessing out loud fulfills his obligation, whether he verbalizes the blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">pronouncing the words with his lips</i> or merely recites it in his heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Berachot</i> 15a-b, which states:<br>A person who reads the <i>Shema</i> in a tone too low to hear fulfills his obligation. Rabbi Yosse states: "He does not fulfill his obligation."...The difference of opinion applies with regard to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> because it states, "Hear, Israel." With regard to other mitzvot (blessings, Rashi), everyone agrees that one fulfills one's obligation.<br>The Rambam's decision that, after the fact, one fulfills his obligation by reciting grace or other blessings in thought alone is not accepted by other authorities. Rashi, Rabbenu Asher, the <i>Tur</i>, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 185:2 maintain that though one need not recite the blessings out loud, it is necessary to subvocalize them, pronouncing them with one's lips.</i>
Whenever one recites a blessing, one should not make an interruption between the blessing and the subject for which the blessing is recited.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This applies with regard to both blessings recited before food and blessings recited before performing a mitzvah.</i> If one makes an interruption with other matters, one must recite the blessing again.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is a literal translation of the Rambam's words. Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 206:3 which states that even remaining silent for the time it takes to say, <i>Shalom alecha, Rebbe</i> constitutes an interruption.</i><br>If, however, one makes an interruption which relates to the subject of the blessing, one does not have to repeat the blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's phraseology appears to indicate that, at the outset, one should not make any interruption. If, however, the situation demands that an interruption be made or if one inadvertently does so, the blessing need not be repeated when it is of the following nature.</i> What is implied? When a person recites a blessing over bread and before eating says, "Bring salt," "Bring food," "Give<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">to eat," "Bring food for the animal," or the like - See <i>Berachot</i> 40a and commentaries, which explain why each of these statements is connected with the meal.</i> so-and-so to eat," "Bring food for the animal," or the like, he need not repeat the blessing.
A person who is ritually impure is permitted to recite all the blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 4:8, the Rambam states:<br>The words of Torah never contract impurity. Rather, they remain pure forever, as [Jeremiah 23:29] states: "Are not My words as fire...." Just as fire can never contract impurity, the words of Torah never contract impurity.<br>In <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4, the Rambam applies these same principles to the words of prayer.</i> This applies regardless of whether the impurity is of a type from which one can purify oneself on the same day<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., the impurity which comes as a result of contact with the carcass of an animal. In this case, to regain ritual purity, one must immerse oneself in a <i>mikveh</i> and wait until nightfall.</i> or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">There are some impurities - e.g., the impurity of a זב or the impurity resulting from contact with a human corpse - which require an extended period of time and other rituals besides immersion to regain ritual purity. (See also <i>Berachot</i> 3:4-6 and the Rambam's commentary on those <i>Mishnayot</i>.)</i><br>A person who is naked should not recite a blessing until he covers his genitals.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:16-17, a person is not allowed to recite the <i>Shema</i> in a place where he can see naked people or when he, himself, is naked. The same principles apply with regard to the recitation of blessings.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:3) adds that a person may not recite any blessings unless there is a separation between his heart and his genitals and his head is covered.</i> To whom does this apply? To men.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">whose genitals protrude. In contrast,</i> Women may recite blessings [while naked], provided they sit with their genitals facing the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Challah</i> 2:3, and the <i>Magen Avraham's</i> interpretation of his words (206:5).</i>
[The following principle applies to] all blessings: Although a person has already recited them and fulfilled his own obligation,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the same principle applies when the person reciting the blessing has not fulfilled his obligation, but does not desire to do so at the present time.</i> he may recite them again for others who have not fulfilled their obligation,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 29a, explains this principle on the basis of the concept of ערבות (mutual responsibility) that exists among the Jewish people. Each Jew shares a responsibility for his colleague's observance. Therefore, although he personally has already recited the blessing, he has not discharged his obligation entirely until each of his fellow Jews fulfills the requirements incumbent upon him.</i> so that they can fulfill their obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam describes the manner in which the listener fulfills his obligation in the next halachah.<br>For the above principle to apply, however, the listener must be obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. When the listener is not obligated - e.g., a woman for shofar blowing - a person should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated himself (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 589:6).</i><br>There is, however, one exception: blessings over benefit which is not associated with a mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., the blessings recited over food in an ordinary meal.</i> In this instance, one may not recite a blessing for others unless one enjoys benefit together with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, there is no obligation for a person to partake of this food. Hence, the principle of ערבות does not apply (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) unless the person reciting the blessing also desires to partake of the food. Should he desire to do so, the blessing he recites may include others as well. (Note an alternate explanation in the commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 16.)</i> Nevertheless, one may recite blessings for benefit which is associated with a mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., eating matzah on Pesach and reciting kiddush [on Sabbaths and festivals] - i.e., not only the blessing <i>al achilat matzah</i>, which mentions the mitzvah of eating <i>matzah</i>, but also the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>, which is recited for eating bread; not only the blessing of <i>kiddush</i>, but also the blessing <i>borey pri hagafen</i>, on the wine.</i> - e.g., eating matzah on Pesach and reciting <i>kiddush</i> [on Sabbaths and festivals] - for others.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">since, in this instance, the only way the mitzvah can be fulfilled is by eating the food.<br>Note the <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 273, which states that, at the outset, a person who has already recited <i>kiddush</i> should not recite <i>kiddush</i> for others, unless they are incapable of doing so themselves.</i> They may then eat or drink, even though the one [who recites the blessing] does not eat or drink with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, which states that a person is not allowed to recite<i>hamotzi</i> to enable a colleague to partake of the Sabbath meal when he does not join them. There is reason to assume that, since partaking of such a meal is a mitzvah, one would be allowed to recite a blessing, and thus enable a colleague to do so. Nevertheless, following the reasoning mentioned in <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:20) and commentaries mention only the examples cited by the Rambam.</i>
Whenever a person listens to the entire recitation of a blessing with the intention of fulfilling his obligation,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:3) rules that the person reciting the blessing also must intend that the listener fulfill his obligation by hearing the blessing.<br>The <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> 213 explain that this ruling points to a question of a larger scope: Do mitzvot of the Rabbis require intention, or is it possible to fulfill one's obligation by performing the required act without any intent.<br>According to the latter view, although the person reciting the blessing does not have the intention of fulfilling the obligation of the listener, since "one who listens is considered as though he responded," the listener is considered to have recited the blessing, and thus to have fulfilled his obligation.<br>In contrast, the former view requires that one have a conscious desire to fulfill one's obligation when fulfilling a Rabbinic obligation. Since the person reciting the blessing did not have such an intention on behalf of the listener, the listener cannot fulfill his obligation.</i> he is considered to have fulfilled his obligation although he does not answer <i>Amen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13, 213:1), this applies to all blessings. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:1) differs, however, and explains that with regard to blessings for mitzvot, the principle stated by the Rambam is acceptable. With regard to blessings for deriving benefit, however, different rules apply, and a person can fulfill his obligation to recite a blessing by listening to someone else's blessing only when they intentionally sit down to break bread or drink wine together. See the commentary on the following halachah.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 38b states:<br>What is the source which teaches that a person who listens is considered as if he responded?[II Kings 22:16] mentions: "all the words of the scroll read by the king." Did Josaiah [the king] read them? Shafan read them.... Thus, this teaches that a person who listens is considered as if he responded.</i> Whoever answers <i>Amen</i> to a blessing recited by another person is considered as if he recited the blessing himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 53b mentions two opinions, one which equates the person answering<i>Amen</i> with the person actually reciting the blessing (the opinion cited by the Rambam), and one which considers the person answering to be on an even higher level.<br>Thus, with this statement, the Rambam is explaining that, although a person can fulfill his obligation by listening without answering <i>Amen</i>, when he answers he is considered as if he actually recited the blessing himself (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> provided the person who recites the blessing is obligated to recite that blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This excludes a blessing recited by a mentally incapable individual, a deaf-mute, or a child, who are not obligated to fulfill mitzvot (<i>Berachot</i> 20a, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 29a).<br>In Chapter 5, Halachot 15-16, the Rambam mentions that an adult who did not eat a full meal and is obligated to recite grace only by Rabbinic decree can fulfill his obligation by listening to the blessings recited by a child. This, however, is a unique instance and does not apply to blessings recited in the prayer service or over the fulfillment of other mitzvot. With regard to grace, the child's recitation of the blessings comes as a result of a single Rabbinic obligation. Hence, he can fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of an individual whose obligation is also Rabbinic in origin.<br>In contrast, with regard to other blessings, the blessings themselves are Rabbinic in origin, and the child's obligation to recite them constitutes a second Rabbinic obligation. Accordingly, he cannot fulfill the mitzvah for someone whose obligation stems from a single Rabbinic decree (<i>Tosafot,</i> Megillah 19b).</i><br>If the person who recites the blessing is obligated only because of a Rabbinic ordinance,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., an adult male who has not eaten to the point of satiation</i> while the person responding is obligated by Torah law,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">an adult who ate to the point of satiation</i> the listener cannot fulfill his obligation until he repeats<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">word for word</i> in response [to the one reciting the blessings]<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation (based on <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> and the <i>Bnei Binyamin</i>) does conform to Biblical and Mishnaic interpretations of the word יענה. It does, however, appear slightly forced. Nevertheless, it is the most appropriate way to interpret the Rambam's words according to the halachah which states that, only with regard to grace, may an adult fulfill his obligation to recite a blessing by answering <i>Amen</i> to a child's blessing.<br>Rav Kapach presents a unique thesis, maintaining that in this halachah the Rambam is teaching us that an adult can fulfill his obligation to recite any blessing by responding <i>Amen</i> to a blessing recited by a child. His interpretation, though contrary to the accepted halachah, allows for a more direct translation of the Rambam's words.</i> or until he hears [the blessing recited] by someone who, like him, is obligated by Torah law.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the latter case, the listener is not obligated to recite <i>Amen</i>.</i>
When many people gather together to eat [a meal with] bread or to drink wine, and one recites the blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the standard text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. According to the source for this law, <i>Berachot</i> 6:6, and the manner it is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:11), it should read, "one person should recite the blessing." This is the preferred manner for the group to bless their food, because "within the multitude of people is the glory of the king" (Proverbs 14:28 .<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 167:18 relates that today, even when eating a meal as a group, it is customary for each person to recite the blessing over bread himself, so that an interruption is not made between the recitation of the blessing and partaking of the food.</i> while the others respond <i>Amen</i>, they are [all] permitted to eat and drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">without reciting blessings themselves. They fulfill their obligation by listening to the blessing recited previously.</i> If, however, they did not intend to eat together, but rather they each came on their own initiative, although they all eat from a single loaf of bread, each one should recite the blessings [before eating] by himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Although this is the desired practice, if one answers <i>Amen</i> to another person's blessing, he fulfills his obligation, as stated in the previous halachah.<br>This reflects the position of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13). The <i>Magen Avraham</i>, however, differs, and maintains that one cannot fulfill his obligation to recite blessings that involve benefit unless one had the intention of eating together with the other person and responding to his blessings. This view takes a more lenient position regarding blessings over mitzvot, which we are obligated to fulfill, than regarding the blessings over food, which we are not obligated to eat.</i><br>When does the above apply? With regard to bread and wine. With regard to other foods, however, which do not require [premeditated intent] to be eaten together as a group,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Our interpretation of הסבה is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Berachot</i> 6:6.</i> if one person recited a blessing and everyone answered <i>Amen</i>, they may eat and drink although they did not intend to gather together as a group.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs and maintains that when eating foods other than bread or wine, each person should recite the blessings for himself. (Significantly, on this issue there is a responsum which is attributed to the Rambam. However, it has raised difficulties among the commentaries and its authenticity has been challenged.)<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:1) accepts the Rambam's opinion, but states that this applies only when people sit around a single table as a group. Eating in a single room is not sufficient. The Ramah, however, quotes the Ra'avad's view.</i>
Whenever a person hears a Jew recite a blessing, he is obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This represents a difference of opinion between the Rambam and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 215), who considers responding<i>Amen</i> a matter left to our own volition. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 215:2) quotes the Rambam's opinion. Furthermore, the <i>Magen Avrahamh</i> 6:9 mentions an obligation to recite<i>Amen</i> ninety times each day.</i> to respond <i>Amen</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 119b states that <i>Amen</i> is an acronym for the words, א-ל מלך נאמן (God, faithful King).

In this context, it is also worthy to question whether Ezra and the Men of the Great Assembly also made any changes in the grace when they arranged all the prayers and blessings, as mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 5 and commentary.

These three, however, are unique in that they refer to the establishment of a covenant regarding the bond between the Jews and the Torah.1. <i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions both these possibilities. In "The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year," the Rambam quotes the former expression.2. The beginning of a blessing must share the same theme as its conclusion. Nevertheless, the rebuilding of Jerusalem shares a connection with God's showing mercy to the people of Israel, since the rebuilding of Jerusalem is an expression of God's mercy to the Jewish people (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).3. Although <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that two different concepts should not be mentioned in the conclusion of a blessing, this version of the blessing does not contradict that rule. The intent is a single request that Israel be granted the ultimate comfort, the rebuilding of Jerusalem.4. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 48b, mentions another reason for the mention of the House of David. It was David who conquered Jerusalem and established the holiness of the city. 5. Since an integral element of our celebration of the Sabbath and festivals is eating festive meals, the sacred element of the day should be mentioned in the grace recited after partaking of those meals. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the day does not require a blessing in its own right, nor is it made the essential element of the third blessing. Therefore, one begins and concludes that blessing in the same manner as is done during the week (Rashi, <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 48b).6. The order in which these alternatives are mentioned in this halachah is the reverse of that mentioned in the previous halachah. It can be explained that in the previous halachah, the Rambam mentioned the text he considered most appropriate first. The order he mentions in this halachah, however, is closer to the expression used by our Sages in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this halachah.7. Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. With regard to Rosh HaShanah, see the commentary on Halachah 13.8. <i>Shabbat</i> 24a explains that since an additional sacrifice (<i>korban musaf</i>) is offered on these days, they possess an element of sanctity that is worthy of mention. As obvious from the contrast of Halachah 12 to Halachah 13, however, there is a difference between the obligation to mention these days and the obligation to mention Sabbaths and festivals. 9. Since Chanukah and Purim are Rabbinic holidays which are not associated with an additional sacrificial offering, they are not mentioned in the third blessing. The second blessing is more appropriate for the mention of the miracles of these holidays, since it is an expression of thanks to God (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> note that from <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it would appear that while permission is granted to mention Chanukah and Purim in the second blessing, it is not an obligation to do so. In contrast, the Rambam requires that they be mentioned. They explain that since the Sages of the Talmud were wont to mention these holidays in grace, and the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 7:6) considers their mention a binding obligation, the Rambam established their mention as a requirement. See also Halachah 13 and commentary.10. Precedence is given to the Sabbath because it occurs more frequently than the festivals and is on a higher spiritual level (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). 11. "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, 16King13 of the Universe, the God, who is our Father and our 16King13... the 16King13 who is good." The reason for this stress on God's sovereignty in this blessing is that the blessing recited previously mentions the sovereignty of the House of David, and the Sages wanted to emphasize how all earthly kings are subordinate to a higher authority (<i>Berachot</i> 49a).12. The blessing mentioned is quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46a. That source also contains additions to the blessing that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi would recite. 13. The Rambam's words are quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46b, which relates that Mar Zutra recited this blessing.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 379:14) relates that this blessing should be recited throughout the seven days of mourning by the mourners and by all who recite grace together with him when there is a <i>zimun</i>. Other opinions (based on <i>Ketubot</i> 8a) state that this blessing should be recited only when ten people recite grace together. The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 207:7 writes that it is Ashkenazic custom to rely on this opinion, and hence, this blessing is generally not recited.14. <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates several additions Mar Zutra made on the above occasion.15. In "The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year," the Rambam includes several requests beginning with the word <i>Harachaman</i> (May the Merciful One...) in his text of grace. These requests were additions to the grace made by the Geonim, who lived in the era subsequent to the Talmud. 16. This refers to the final blessing quoted in Halachah 11.17. <i>Nisu'in</i> (marriage) is marked by the entry of a bride and groom into a private chamber together. This ceremony is referred to as <i>chuppah</i> and is accompanied by a celebration. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 10, and commentaries.<br>As mentioned at the conclusion of the following halachah, according to the Rambam this blessing is recited only when ten adult males are present. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:4) differs and maintains that it should be recited even when fewer than ten people are present. Note the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:7) who states that today this blessing is never recited alone. If "new faces" - people who had not attended the wedding celebrations previously - are present, all seven blessings are recited. If no "new faces" are present (although ten males are), the meal is considered like a meal eaten by the bridegroom alone, and the blessing is not recited.18. The same laws applying to a widow or widower apply to a person who has been divorced. Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:12, the Rambam states that even if a woman has been married before, her husband should celebrate with her for three days.19. Surely, this also applies when neither the bride nor groom have been married before. <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states: "The Sages ordained that everyone who marries a maiden should celebrate with her for seven days."<br>The differences between the time limits mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, are worthy of comparison. See the commentary on that halachah.20. <i>Ketubot</i> 8a states that after the first day of the wedding celebrations, Rav Ashi would recite the wedding blessings only when "new faces" were present. In his responsa, the Rambam's son states that his father required only two "new faces." Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 64:7 who requires only one "new face." The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> write that on the Sabbath the presence of new guests is not necessary, since the Sabbath itself is considered as "guests."21. <i>Ketubot</i> 7b derives this rule from the account of the wedding between Ruth and Boaz. Ruth 4:2 relates that Boaz invited ten men to witness the marriage. 22. Only six blessings are mentioned below; the seventh blessing is the blessing over the wine. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:4.)23. Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 7b) explains that this blessing is in praise of the creation of Adam, the first man.<br>In <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, where the text of the wedding blessings is repeated, this blessing follows the blessing "who has created all things for His glory." This order is the sequence in which these blessings are recited today. It appears more appropriate, particularly according to Rashi's commentary (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which explains that the blessing "who has created all things..." is not directly connected to the wedding itself, but rather is recited in appreciation of the guests who have come to celebrate together with the new couple.<br>[The repetition of the text of the blessings in two separate halachot, something very out of character for the Rambam in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has aroused the attention of the commentaries. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the text of the blessings here was added by the printers, and not by the Rambam himself.]24. Despite the fact that this blessing follows two (or three) blessings which begin with "Blessed...," it also begins with "Blessed...." Among the explanations offered is that the first blessings are short, and if the line "Blessed..." were not mentioned, they would appear as a single blessing (<i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).25. Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as a reference to the creation of woman, who was created from man ("his own self"), and gives him the potential for reproduction ("a structure that will last for all time").26. "The barren one" refers to Jerusalem. Psalms 137:6 states: "Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy." Thus, at the height of the wedding celebration, we recall the holy city and pray that it be rebuilt. 27. This is a prayer that the bride and groom enjoy the happiness experienced by Adam in Eve before the first sin.<br>Several manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> mention a different conclusion for this blessing, "Blessed are You, God, who brings joy to His people, Israel, and rebuilds Jerusalem." (In this context, note the commentary of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)28. The blessing joins our wishes for the happiness of the particular couple with our hope for the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The ultimate marriage relationship is the bond between God and the Jewish people, which will be realized in the Messianic age. Thus, the two themes, marriage and redemption, share an intrinsic link.29. Rashi, <i>Ketubot</i> 8a, explains the difference between the last two blessings. The fifth of the blessings concludes with a request that the bride and groom enjoy a lifetime of happiness and success together. The sixth and final blessing concludes with a request that they find happiness in each other, that their wedding joy be extended throughout their lives. Alternatively, the final blessing is a blessing for the Jewish people as a whole who find fulfillment in married life.</i>
The third blessing begins as follows: "Have mercy on us, God, our Lord, and on Israel, Your people, on Jerusalem, Your city, and on Zion, the abode of Your glory..." Alternatively, it begins: "Comfort us, God, our Lord, with Jerusalem, Your city...."<br>One should conclude: "[Blessed are You, God,] who will build Jerusalem," or "...who will comfort His people Israel with the building of Jerusalem." For this reason, this blessing is referred to as "the blessing of comfort."<br>Whoever does not mention the kingdom of the House of David in this blessing does not fulfill his obligation, because it is an essential element of the blessing. There will be no complete comfort until the return of the sovereignty to the House of David.
On Sabbaths and on the festivals, one should begin with the concept of comfort and conclude with the concept of comfort and, in the midst of the blessing, mention the sacred quality of the day.<br>How should one begin? Either with, "Comfort us, God, our Lord, with Zion, Your city..." or "Have mercy on us, God, our Lord, and on Israel, Your people, on Jerusalem, Your city...." One should conclude with: "[Blessed are You, God,] who will comfort His people Israel with the building of Jerusalem" or "... who will build Jerusalem."<br>On the Sabbath, in the midst [of the blessing], one should say:<br>Our God, and God of our fathers, may it please You, God, our Lord, to strengthen us through Your mitzvot and through the mitzvah of this great and holy seventh day. For this day is great and holy before You for us to refrain from work and rest on it with love in accordance with the commandment of Your will. In Your good will, God, our Lord, grant us tranquility and prevent distress, evil, and sorrow on the day of our rest.<br>On the festivals, one should include the prayer <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> in this blessing. Similarly, on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> and on <i>Chol HaMo’ed</i>, one should include the prayer <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> in the third blessing.
On Chanukah and Purim, one should add the prayer <i>Al hanisim</i> in the blessing for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, as one adds in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br>When a festival or <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> falls on the Sabbath, one recites <i>R'tzey vahachalitzenu</i> first, and then <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i>. Similarly, when <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> Tevet falls on the Sabbath, one recites <i>Al hanisim</i> in the blessing for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and <i>R'tzey vahachalitzenu</i> and <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> in the blessing of comfort.
In the fourth blessing, one must mention God's sovereignty three times.<br>When a guest recites grace in the home of his host, he should add a blessing for his host in this blessing. What should he say? "May it be Your will that [my] host not be disgraced in this world or shamed in the world to come." He may add to the blessing for [his] host and extend it [as he desires].
When grace is being recited in the house of a mourner, the following addition should be made in the fourth blessing:<br>The Living King who is good and does good, the true God, the true Judge who judges justly, the absolute ruler of His world who may do as He chooses. We are His people and His servants and we are obligated to thank Him and bless Him for everything.<br>He should request mercy for the mourner to comfort him in the matters that he desires. [Afterwards,] he concludes, <i>Harachaman</i>....
The blessing for the bridegroom is recited after these four blessings at each meal eaten in the place of the wedding celebration. This blessing should not be recited by servants or by minors.<br>Until when is the blessing recited? When a widower marries a widow, it is recited only on the first day. When a groom who has never married before marries a widow or when a bride who has never married before marries a widower, it is recited during all the seven days of the marriage celebrations.
The blessing that is added at the place of the wedding celebration is the final blessing of the seven blessings recited at the wedding.<br>When does the above apply? When [all] the people who eat there were present [at the wedding] and heard the wedding blessings being recited. If, however, other people were present who had not heard the wedding blessings at the wedding, the seven wedding blessings are recited for them after grace, just as they are recited at the wedding itself.<br>The above applies when [a quorum of] ten are present. The groom can be counted as part of this quorum.
These are the seven blessings:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, Creator of man.<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who created all things for His glory.<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who created man in His image, in an image reflecting His likeness, [He brought forth] his form and prepared for him from his own self a structure that will last for all time. Blessed are You, God, Creator of man.<br>May the barren one rejoice and exult as her children are gathered to her with joy. Blessed are You, God, who makes Zion rejoice in her children.<br>Grant joy to these loving companions as You granted joy to Your creation in the Garden of Eden long ago. Blessed are You, God, who grants joy to the groom and the bride.<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who created joy and happiness, bride and groom, gladness, song, cheer, and delight, love and harmony, peace and friendship. Soon, God, our Lord, may there be heard in the cities of Judah and the outskirts of Jerusalem, a voice of joy and a voice of happiness, a voice of a groom and a voice of a bride, a voice of grooms rejoicing from their wedding canopies and youths from their songfests. Blessed are You, God, who grants joy to the groom together with the bride.

Chapter 3

There are five species [of grain]:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained, there are special laws regarding the blessings recited before and after food made from these species of grain. These five species are also mentioned in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:1.</i> wheat, barley,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These grains, fundamental to day to day life in Western society, are among the seven species for which Deuteronomy 8:8 praises <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> for producing.</i> rye, oats, and spelt.

After they have been threshed and winnowed, they are referred to as grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Here, also, although these statements have other halachic implications (e.g., <i>Challah</i> 1:2 mentions these points within the context of vows: if a person vows not to benefit from <i>tevuah</i> or grain, he is forbidden to benefit from these species), the Rambam is defining these terms here because he will refer to them throughout this chapter.</i> When they have been milled and their flour kneaded and baked, they are referred to as bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">and require the ritual washing of hands and the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> beforehand and grace afterwards.</i> Bread made from these species is referred to as bread without any additional modifier.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, bread is made from other grains - e.g., rice or corn - it is referred to as ricebread or cornbread.</i>
Before eating bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">made from the five species of grain mentioned in the previous halachah</i> a person should recite the blessing, "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who brings forth bread from the earth."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 38b, notes that the conclusion of the blessing is taken from Psalms 104:14.

See Halachah 4.<br>Literally, the Rambam's words mean "grain cooked as it is."

Even though the grain has been cooked, since the kernels were not processed at all, it does not warrant a blessing of greater importance (<i>Kessef Mishnah</i>).<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:3-6 discusses the question of grains that are cooked whole, but are cooked for a long period until their shell dissolves. There are authorities who recommend that unless the kernels have been cooked to the extent that they stick together as a single mass, whole grains should be eaten only in the midst of a meal containing bread. See also Halachah 4.</i> Afterwards, he should recite the blessing <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing usually recited after partaking of foods other than those from the seven species for which <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was praised. The same rationale mentioned above applies. Since the kernels were served without being processed, they do not warrant a blessing of greater importance.</i> Before eating flour,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">which has not been cooked</i> a person should recite the blessing <i>shehakol</i>. Afterwards, he should recite the blessing <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, the special blessings for grain products are not recited because the food was not prepared in the usual fashion. Furthermore, even the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> is not recited, because generally people do not eat flour (Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, See also <i>Berachot</i> 36a).1. I.e., it resembles a porridge.2. Because of the importance of the five species of grain, the Sages ordained the recitation of a special blessing before and after partaking of them. Since this mixture is considered a food and not a beverage, it warrants the recitation of these blessings.3. Since this mixture is considered a beverage and not a food, it does not warrant the recitation of these blessings. 4. <i>Berachot</i> 37b relates that any food that is made from the five species of grain but is not considered bread requires the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>. Since these foods are cooked in a pot, they are not considered bread. See also note 6.5. Since the grain kernels have been processed slightly, they are considered worthy of the special blessings ordained for foods from the five species. As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 2, the later authorities suggest that the grains be cooked to the point that they stick together as a single mass before these blessings should be recited. If, however, both the shell of the kernel has been removed and they have been crushed, the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> may be recited even when the kernels do not stick together (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:15).6. As mentioned in Halachah 6, as long as the grain is included to add flavor, it is considered the primary element in the mixture, and the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> should be recited, even though quantitatively, the dish contains a majority of other substances. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 208:2.) 7. The definition of foods as primary and secondary depends on the person's intention and not the quantity of the foods included in the mixture.8. This principle is quoted from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7.9. Thus producing a single food, as exemplified in Halachah 6.10. In this instance, the two foods remain separate, yet the secondary food is included in the blessing recited over the primary one, as exemplified in Halachah 7. 11. The Rambam is quoting <i>Berachot</i> 39a, which states that this law applies even to turnips that require a large amount of flour.12. <i>Beitzah</i> 38a states, "Anything added for flavor is never considered negligible."<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 204:25 and the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i> (Responsum 129) explain that the Rambam's (and the Talmud's) statements apply only to products from the five species of grain. Whenever they are added to flavor foods, they are considered of primary importance even when, quantitatively, they are less than the other ingredients of a particular dish. In contrast, when two or more types of foods other than grain products are mixed together in a single dish and both are intended to add flavor and/or satiate the person eating, the food which is greater in quantity is considered as the primary ingredient.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that if the starch was added for flavor, the mixture would require the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>. He continues, explaining that when other foods - e.g., fruits which are not usually eaten raw, are cooked in sugar to produce jam, the fruits are considered of primary importance. Hence, the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> should be recited. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 204:11. 14. By adding the clause, "so that the heavy brine...," the Rambam explains the source for this ruling, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7, and clarifies a problem posed by the commentaries.<br>Although the Mishnah mentions the example of bread serving as a secondary food when it accompanies salted foods, the Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 44a) protests, and explains that in almost all situations bread would be considered the primary food. The Mishnah is describing a specific instance: people who eat fruit that originates in the area around Lake Kineret.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to people who work as watchmen in orchards. They eat large quantities of fruit. Hence, in order to help their digestion, they also must partake of brine. Since the brine itself could be harmful, they eat bread with it.<br>Here, also, the Rambam is referring to a case where the person has no desire to eat bread and does so only to protect his throat. If, however, a person wanted to eat salted fish on bread and desired both the bread and the fish, he must recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> and recite grace. (See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 212:1-2.)<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 212:2 gives another example: A person who eats bread to weaken the taste of an alcoholic beverage. 16. A <i>k'zayit</i>. In contemporary measure, it is equivalent to 28.8 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 33 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.17. Out of faithfulness to the Rambam's text, we have translated his words literally, although they have caused the commentaries great difficulty. On the surface, there is an open contradiction between the first clause and the second clause. From the first clause, it appears that a piece of bread less than the size of an olive which resembles bread warrants the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. In contrast, the latter clause appears to indicate that the bread must both be the size of an olive and have the appearance of bread to warrant the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.<br>Because of this difficulty, the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1393) and <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> have suggested amending the text and rendering the latter clause, "If they are not the size of an olive and no longer resemble bread because of the cooking process." Furthermore, even without amending the text, this interpretation can be accepted, since, as the Rambam's own descendant, Rabbi Yehoshua, explains, there are times when the Hebrew או can be rendered as "if." Thus, the passage would read, "If they are not the size of an olive, if...."<br>Rav Yosef Karo was aware of the text's difficulty and the suggestions to amend it. Nevertheless, both in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:10), he seeks to justify the Rambam's choice of phraseology, explaining his statements as follows:<br>When one cooked pieces of bread or mixed them into soup, if they are the size of an olive, one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> although they no longer resemble bread. If they are less than the size of an olive but resemble bread, one should recite this blessing when they have been mixed into soup. If, however, they have been cooked, and although it is obvious that these pieces came from a loaf of bread, they no longer have the appearance of bread, only the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited.<br>To summarize: when one breaks bread into pieces and puts them into soup, since the pieces still resemble bread they may not be eaten unless one recites the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. If the pieces of bread were cooked completely to prepare a different food and less than a <i>k'zayit</i> remains whole, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited. According to most authorities, if one cooks with bread crumbs or matzah meal, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>, should be recited on the foods produced.</i>
[The following rules apply] when a person cooks flour from one of the five species of grain, which has been mixed with water or other liquids: If the mixture is thick, so that it is fit to be eaten and chewed, one should recite the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> beforehand and the blessing <i>al hamichyah v'al hakalkalah</i> afterward. If the mixture is thin, so that it is fit to be drunk, one should recite the blessing <i>shehakol</i> beforehand and the blessing <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i> afterward.
The blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> is recited before [partaking of any of the following foods]:<br>flour from one of the five species of grain that was cooked in a pot - whether alone or whether it was mixed together with other ingredients - e.g., dumplings or the like;<br>grain that was divided or crushed and cooked in a pot - e.g., groats or grits. These [two categories] are referred to as cooked dishes.<br>The same laws also apply to any dish in which flour or bread from the five species of grain was mixed.
When does the above apply? When the person considers the [flour or bread] from the five species of grain as the primary element [of the mixture] and not as a secondary element. If, however, the [flour or bread] from the five species of grain is a secondary element of a mixture, the person should recite the [appropriate] blessing over the primary food, and thus fulfill his obligation regarding the secondary food.<br>This is a major principle with regard to blessings: Whenever a food contains primary and secondary elements, a person should recite a blessing over the primary element, and thus fulfill his obligation regarding the secondary element. [This principle applies] regardless of whether the secondary element is mixed together with the primary element or not.
What is an example of a secondary food mixed together [with a primary food]? Cooked turnips or cabbage to which flour from one of the five species was added so that it would hold together. The blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> is not recited, because the turnips are of primary importance and the flour is secondary.<br>Similarly, whenever a substance is added to hold food together, to add fragrance, or to color a dish, it is considered secondary. If, however, it was added in order to add flavor to the food, it is considered of primary importance.<br>Accordingly, when sweets are made by cooking honey and mixing it with starch so that it will stick together, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> is not recited, because the honey is of primary importance.
What is an example of a secondary food which is not mixed together? A person who wants to eat salted fish and eats bread with it so that the heavy brine will not harm his throat or tongue. [In this instance,] he should recite a blessing on the salted fish, and by doing so fulfill his obligation regarding the bread, because the bread is secondary. The same principle applies in other similar situations.
[The following rules apply when] bread was broken into pieces and cooked in a pot or mixed into soup: If the pieces are the size of an olive or they can be recognized as bread and their appearance has not changed, the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> should be recited before partaking of them. If, however, they are not the size of an olive or they no longer resemble bread because of the cooking process, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited before partaking of them.

Chapter 4

Everyone who recites grace or the single blessing that includes the three [blessings of grace] should recite these blessings in the place where he ate. If he ate while walking, he should sit down where he concluded eating and recite the blessings. If he ate while standing, he should sit down in his place and recite grace.<br>If a person forgets to recite grace and remembers before his food becomes digested, he may recite grace in the place where he remembers. If he intentionally [did not recite grace in the place where he ate], he should return to his place and recite grace. Should he recite grace in the place where he remembers, he fulfills his obligation.<br>Similarly, a person who recites grace while standing or while walking fulfills his obligation. Nevertheless, at the outset, a person should not recite grace or the single blessing which includes the three [blessings of grace] except when he is seated in the place where he ate.
A person who is in doubt whether he recited the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> or not should not repeat the blessing, because it is not required by the Torah.<br>A person who forgets to recite <i>hamotzi</i> should recite the blessing if he remembers before he completes his meal. If he remembers after he completed his meal, he should not recite the blessing.
[The following rules apply when] a person was eating in one house, interrupted his meal, and went to another house, or when a friend called to him and he went out the doorway of his house to speak to him: When he returns, he is required to recite grace after what he originally ate, and to recite <i>hamotzi</i> again because he changed his place. [Only] after this, may he complete his meal.
[The following rules apply when] friends joined to eat a meal together and [interrupted their meal to] go out to greet a groom or a bride: If they left an old man or a sick person [in the place where they ate], they may return to their place and complete their meal without having to recite a second blessing.<br>If they did not leave an old man or a sick person [in the place where they ate], when they depart they are required to recite a blessing after eating. When they return, they must recite a blessing before [beginning to eat again].
Similar laws apply when people drink together as a group or eat fruits together. Whenever one changes one's place, it is considered as if he interrupted his eating. Therefore, he must recite a blessing after what he ate and must recite a second blessing before partaking of any other foods.<br>A person who changes his place from one corner to another in the same room need not recite another blessing. In contrast, a person who ate on the east side of a fig tree and goes to eat on the west side of the fig tree must recite another blessing.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> answers that those halachot describe a situation where the person has no desire to eat the secondary food in its own right and eats it only because of the primary food. In this halachah, the Rambam is speaking about an instance in which one desires to eat the other foods; nevertheless, they are included in the blessing recited over bread because bread includes all other foods.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> offers a different interpretation, which appears more appropriate to the context in which the laws are discussed.

The clearest resolution of the difficulty is offered by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i>, who explains that the Rambam's decision is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 6:5). When the passage from the Babylonian Talmud is studied in the light of the passage from the Jerusalem Talmud, the Rambam's ruling is no longer difficult.<br>This relates to a concept frequently discussed by students of the Rambam: Does the Rambam accept the principle that when there is a difference of opinion between the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud, the Halachah follows the Babylonian Talmud, or not?</i>

When a person sits down to such a meal, he is considered to have fixed his attention on eating. People frequently become drawn into eating more than they originally intended at such meals.

Accordingly, the respect due to the Sabbath adds importance to the diversion of our attention from drinking implied by the statement, "Let us recite <i>kiddush</i>." In contrast, <i>havdalah</i> marks the beginning of the week, which we are not required to treat with such distinction. Thus, as <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:12 states, a person is not required to interrupt his meal at nightfall on Saturday, but may continue and recite <i>havdalah</i> when he concludes eating (Radbaz).<br>24. <i>Berachot</i> 59b emphasizes that this blessing is recited only when one drinks in a company. When one drinks alone, this blessing should not be recited, because it praises God for "being good" - i.e., to me - and "doing good" - for others (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 175:4).25. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) notes that the Sages instituted this blessing only for different types of wine and not for different types of bread or meat, since wine has two positive qualities: It satisfies a person's appetite and lifts his spirits.26. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), states that this blessing should be recited only when the second type of wine is better than the first. If the first type of wine is better, no blessing should be recited. The commentaries maintain that the Rambam differs and maintains that the blessing should be recited whenever one changes types of wine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 175:2-3) rules that if one knows that the second type of wine is of a lesser quality than the first, the blessing should not be recited.</i>
When a company who gathered together to drink wine were served another type of wine - e.g., they were drinking red wine and black wine was brought, or they were drinking aged wine and fresh wine was brought - they need not recite a second blessing over wine. They should, however, recite the following blessing: "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who is good and does good."
A person should not recite a blessing over any food or drink until it is brought before him.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:4) states that a person should hold the food in his right hand before reciting the blessing for it.</i> If he<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">ignored the above directive and</i> recited a blessing, and then the food was brought before him,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing is considered to be in vain, and before partaking of the food,</i> he must recite a second blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There are some authorities who maintain that even though the food was not before one at the time the blessing was recited, if one was absolutely sure that it would be brought before him immediately, he can rely on that blessing (<i>Mishneh Berurah</i> 206:19).</i><br>When a person took food in his hand and recited a blessing, but [before he could eat it] it fell from his hand and was burned or washed away by a river,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">or in any other way became inedible</i> he should take other food and recite another blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the first blessing is no longer in effect ,and a second blessing must be recited before eating.</i> [This applies] even when the food is of the same species.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:6) adds, "and even if the other fruit was before him when he recited the blessing originally."

Foods that are eaten within the meal, because of the meal,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are quoted, with slight changes, from <i>Berachot</i> 41b. In his commentary on this passage, Rashi defines this first category of foods as relishes eaten with bread. He explains that other foods - e.g., cereals or vegetables - although they are eaten as part of a meal, require an independent blessing.<br><i>Tosafot</i> differs, and maintains that any food that is eaten as part of a meal - e.g., the foods mentioned by Rashi, meat or fish - is included in this category. Even if they are not eaten with bread, merely at the same meal, they</i> do not require a blessing beforehand or afterward.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question whether the Rambam's position follows that of Rashi or <i>Tosafot</i>. The following sentence (which is the Rambam's addition to <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) sheds light on the question.</i> Rather, the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> that is recited in the beginning and the grace recited afterward include everything, because everything is secondary to the meal.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence explains the rationale for this ruling. These foods are not eaten casually during the day, but rather are eaten only as part of a meal, with the intent of satiating one's appetite. Accordingly, they are considered as secondary to bread, which is the primary element of the meal (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 177:1). Accordingly, we follow the ruling mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods.<br>This explanation appears to indicate that the Rambam follows<i>Tosafot's</i> interpretation. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 171:1) also rules accordingly. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:1, however, postulates that it is logical to assume that this ruling applies only when bread is eaten throughout the meal. If only a small amount of bread is eaten at the beginning of a meal, and no bread is eaten while the main course is being eaten, it is questionable whether the blessing over the bread covers these foods.</i><br>Foods that are eaten within the meal, but do not come because of the meal,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to fruits and the like, which are not satisfying food and are eaten throughout the day, frequently outside the context of a meal, but at times within the context of a meal. This indicates that they are not necessarily connected with the meal and, therefore, are not included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. Accordingly, they</i> require a blessing before partaking of them, but do not require a blessing afterward.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since they are eaten within the meal, they also satisfy a person's appetite. Accordingly, they are included in the blessing that is required by the commandment, "When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless...."<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:1,3, based on Rabbenu Asher's commentary on <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions two instances when fruit is included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>:<br>a) When the fruits are eaten on bread itself,b) When one eats a meal of fruit - i.e., the fruit is served to satiate one's appetite.</i><br>Foods that are eaten after the meal, whether because of the meal<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., foods served to satiate one's appetite</i> or independent of the meal,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">fruits, desserts, or drinks</i> require a blessing beforehand and afterward.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) states that this law does not apply at present. Our eating habits have changed, and bread is constantly before us during a meal, and it is customary to partake of it at all times.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> position. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:7 adds that even at large feasts, when it is customary to eat desert without eating bread, a new blessing is not required because, in Talmudic times, bread and the main course were served on a small table, which was then removed, and dessert was served on a new table. Thus, the dessert appeared as a separate meal and required separate blessings. In contrast, at present, desert is served on the same table on which the bread was served. Hence, it is still considered a continuation of the same meal and does not require a separate blessing.</i>
On Sabbaths, on festivals, at the meal after one lets blood or leaves the bath, and the like, when a person makes wine a primary element of his meal, if he recites a blessing on wine before eating his meal, that blessing includes the wine that he drinks after the meal, before he recites grace. In contrast, on other days, a person should recite another blessing on wine that is drunk after the meal.<br>If wine is served to a company in the midst of the meal, each person should recite a blessing by himself, because one's mouth may not be empty to recite <i>Amen</i>. [This blessing] does not include the wine that is drunk after the meal.

Women and slaves<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">whose Torah obligations are equivalent (<i>Chagigah</i> 4a)</i> are obligated to recite grace.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There are opinions that state that a woman does not have to recite the part of grace that blesses God for "Your covenant that You have sealed in our flesh, and for Your Torah that You have taught us," since women are not obligated to fulfill these mitzvot. Nevertheless, in practice, it is agreed that women should mention both these mitzvot, because the ultimate fulfillment of the creation of both men and women is when they marry. Therefore, a man and his wife are considered a single unit (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 187:7).</i> There is a doubt whether their obligation stems from the Torah, since [this is a positive mitzvah] that is not linked to a specific time,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Women are not obligated to fulfill such mitzvot. See <i>Kiddushin</i> (1:7). Since the obligation to recite grace is constant, whether one eats during the day or at night, it would appear that women are obligated. Some commentaries point to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 19) and the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 3:3 and <i>Kiddushin</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) as indications that the Rambam supports the view that a woman's obligation for grace stems from the Torah.</i> or whether their obligation does not stem from the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 20b explains this hypothesis: Since Deuteronomy 8:10, the proof-text requiring us to recite grace, states: "You shall bless God, your Lord, for the good land that He gave you," one might think that only those who were given an inheritance in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> are required to recite grace, thus excluding women who were not given an inheritance.</i> Therefore,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., because of this doubt</i> they should not<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">endeavor to</i> fulfill the obligation of grace on behalf of others.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 11, a person can only recite a blessing on behalf of another person if he shares an equal obligation himself.</i> Children,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Boys below thirteen and girls below twelve, or individuals above that age who have not demonstrated signs of physical maturity.</i> however, are obligated to recite grace<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This expression appears to indicate that the Sages placed the obligation on the child himself. See also <i>Hilchot Sukkah</i> 6:1 and <i>Hilchot Lulav</i> 7:19, where the Rambam uses similar expressions. (In <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:13 and <i>Hilchot Chagigah</i> 2:3, however, the Rambam states that the obligation to train a child to fulfill these mitzvot lies on the father.)<br>The hypothesis that the obligation lies on the child is supported by Halachah 16, which states that a child may fulfill the obligation of grace for a person who did not eat to the point of satisfaction (and, therefore, is obligated to recite grace only by Rabbinic decree). Were the Sages to have placed the obligation to educate the child on his father and not on the child himself, the child would not be able to fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of another person.<br>Nevertheless, it is possible to explain that the Sages placed the obligation on the father. This obligation, however, encompasses the child and, hence, causes him to be considered as obligated in the mitzvah (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 17).</i> by virtue of Rabbinic decree,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">until a child reaches intellectual maturity, the Torah itself places no obligations upon him (<i>Pesachim</i> 116a).</i> in order to educate them to perform mitzvot.
When three people eat [a meal including] bread together, they are obligated to recite the blessing of <i>zimmun</i> before grace.<br>What is the blessing of <i>zimmun</i>? If there were between three and ten participants in a meal, one recites the blessing, saying, "Let us bless Him of whose [bounty] we have eaten."<br>Everyone responds: "Blessed be He of whose [bounty] we have eaten and by whose goodness we live." The one [reciting the blessing] then repeats: "Blessed be He of whose [bounty] we have eaten and by whose goodness we live."
Afterwards, he recites, "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who sustains the entire world in His goodness..." until he completes the four blessings [of grace]. The others answer <i>Amen</i> after each blessing.
If ten or more people eat together, the <i>zimmun</i> should be recited with God's name. What is implied? The one reciting the blessing declares, "Let us bless to our God of whose [bounty] we have eaten."<br>The others respond: "Blessed be our God of whose [bounty] we have eaten and by whose goodness we live." The one [reciting the blessing] then repeats: "Blessed be our God of whose [bounty] we have eaten and by whose goodness we live." He then begins reciting grace.
When eating in the home of a bridegroom from the time when the preparations for the wedding feast have begun until 30 days after the wedding, the one reciting the blessings should say, "Let us bless Him in whose abode is joy, of whose bounty we have eaten," and the others respond, "Blessed be He in whose abode is joy, of whose bounty we have eaten...."<br>If ten people are present, he says, "Let us bless our God in whose abode is joy, of whose bounty we have eaten..." and the others respond, "Blessed be our God in whose abode is joy, of whose bounty we have eaten...." Similarly, whenever a feast is held because of the wedding for twelve months after the wedding, one should include the phrase, "in whose abode is joy."
All men are obligated in the blessing of the <i>zimmun</i> as they are obligated in grace, even priests who partook of sacrifices of the most sacred order in the Temple Courtyard. Similarly, priests and Israelites who ate together are required to recite the <i>zimmun</i> as they are required to recite grace, although the priests partook of <i>terumah</i> and the Israelites ordinary food.

In contrast, since each person may fulfill his obligation to recite grace without a <i>zimmun</i>, leniencies were granted in counting the people included.<br>Rabbenu Asher and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 199:10) do not accept this distinction, and rule that a child may not be counted in a <i>zimun</i> until he is thirteen years of age and has exhibited signs of physical maturity.</i> A gentile may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">even when we are certain that he will bless God.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:1, based on <i>Berachot</i> 47b), the Rambam states that this refers to a gentile who has already made a decision to convert and has been circumcised for that reason. Nevertheless, if he has not immersed himself in the mikveh, he is not considered a Jew, and may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>.14. This ruling is not accepted by many other authorities, including Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher. Because of the difference of opinion, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:3) rules that, at the outset, an attempt should be made to follow the Rambam's decision. If, however, the third person does not desire to eat bread, he may be included in the <i>zimmun</i> as long as he partook of a<i>k'zayit</i> of other foods.15. The commentaries note that the Rambam does not quote <i>Berachot</i> 48a (the source for this halachah) exactly. The Talmud states "dipped his food in brine with them." The Rambam's choice of phraseology is particularly difficult since, as the Rambam himself writes in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:5, brine is generally not eaten alone as a food.16. The commentaries have noted the apparent redundancy in the Rambam's expressions. The <i>Kol ben Levi</i> offers a possible resolution, explaining that, in the opening clause, the Rambam states that these people are not required to make a <i>zimmun</i>. In the final clause, he states that they are not allowed to do so. 17. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 47a, writes that if they have already decided to recite grace, the third person may not be included in a<i>zimmun</i> with them. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:1) accepts this ruling.18. According to the Rambam's opinion mentioned in the previous halachah, the third person must partake of bread. According to the other opinions mentioned above, if the third person partakes of other foods, the first two may include him in a <i>zimmun</i>.19. <i>Berachot</i> 47a relates that Rav Simai bar Chiyya joined Rav and Shemuel in a meal after the latter had completed eating. They ate another side dish together with him, and then recited the <i>zimmun</i>.20. Note the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 197, which states that they are obligated to recite the <i>zimmun</i>.21. He may, however, convey this privilege on another person if he desires (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 201:1).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that if a guest is present, he should be given the privilege of reciting the<i>zimmun</i>, so that he will be able to recite a blessing for the host, as mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 7.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) also mentions that a priest who is a Torah sage should be given the privilege of reciting the <i>zimmun</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 4:2 and <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 12:18.)<br>22. Although a sufficient number of people to recite grace with a<i>zimmun</i> will remain, each individual is personally obligated to participate in the <i>zimmun</i> and may not recite grace alone.23. Enough people remain in each group to allow them both to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>. There is, however, no obligation to separate. If the people desire, they may recite grace in a single group (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1).24. Until there are twenty people, separation will prevent - at the very least - the people who separate from reciting grace with God's name.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1, based on<i>Berachot</i> 50a) states that, at a meal attended by many people, if there is a difficulty or inconvenience preventing an individual from participating in the <i>zimmun</i> in which God's name is mentioned, he may recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i> of three.</i>
Only those who ate at least an amount of bread equal to the size of an olive should be included in a <i>zimmun</i>.<br>When seven people partake of bread and three eat vegetables or brine and the like with them, the latter may be included in the <i>zimmun</i>, so that God's name may be mentioned, provided the one reciting the blessings partook of bread. In contrast, should six people partake of bread and four eat vegetables, the latter may not be included. There has to be a distinct majority of people who partook of bread.<br>When does the above apply? With regard to [a <i>zimmun</i> of] ten. Regarding three, however, they should not recite the <i>zimmun</i> unless each one of them eats a portion of bread the size of an olive.
[The following rule applies when] two people eat together and complete their meal, and afterward, a third person comes and eats. If the others can eat any food [- they need not partake of bread -] together with him, he should be included [in the <i>zimmun</i>] with them.<br>The sage of the greatest stature among those dining should recite grace, although he arrived at the end of the meal.
When three people eat together, they may not separate [and recite grace without a <i>zimmun</i>]. The same applies to four and five people. Between six and ten people may separate [and recite grace in two groups].<br>If more then ten people are present, they may not separate until [their number reaches] twenty. [The governing principle is that a group may separate only if] the blessing of the <i>zimmun</i> will be the same for both groups if they separate.
When three people who each came<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible to explain that this is referring to three individuals who each began eating with a separate group in the same large room. Afterwards, they joined together and ate at the same table.<br>Alternatively, the halachah is speaking about three groups that ate on the same table, and one remained from each group (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>), or the three individuals came from different groups, but left their original group inadvertently or because of forces beyond their control (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:25).</i> from a different group of three<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">and thus were each personally obligated to participate in a <i>zimmun</i> (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 50a)</i> [join together],<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">even when they themselves do not eat together (<i>loc. cit.</i>).

This halachah describes a large feast, at which many people eat at different tables. Nevertheless, they all came together for the same purpose, and thus are considered a single group. (See the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 7:5; and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 195:2).<br>In contrast, in a restaurant, although many people eat in the same room, since they did not come with the intention of eating together, they are considered as a single group. 26. The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:5). Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 195:1) state that the same principles apply if the feast is held in two separate rooms (or houses), as long as they are not separated by a street.27. Similarly, if a single group is large enough to prevent the words of the blessings from being heard, people should recite the <i>zimmun</i> in smaller groups (<i>Kessef Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:1). 28. He must also respond (<i>Berachot</i> 45b; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 194:6).29. He fulfills his obligation for <i>zimmun</i>, but not for grace.30. It is only proper that God's name be mentioned when the ten people are in the same room (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>). 31. If, however, two people from a group of three recite grace alone, a <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 194:1).32. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 194:1) states that this law only applies when the individual has not answered to a <i>zimmun</i> previously. If, however, he answered to the <i>zimmun</i> of a previous group, he may not be included in this <i>zimmun</i>.33. He should respond as usual.34. <i>Zimmun</i> should precede grace. Once a person has recited grace, he can no longer fulfill his obligation for <i>zimmun</i><br>.</i>
[The following rules apply when] two groups eat together in the same building: When part of one group can see part of the other group, they may join together in a single <i>zimmun</i>. If not, they should each recite a <i>zimmun</i> separately.<br>If there is a single attendant who serves both of these groups, they may join in a single <i>zimmun</i>, even though none of the people in the two groups see each other, provided both groups can clearly hear the words of the person reciting the blessings.
When three people ate together and one went out to the marketplace, he should be called to pay attention to what they are saying. He may be included in the <i>zimmun</i> while he is at the marketplace, and thus fulfill his obligation. Afterwards, when he returns to his house, he should recite grace alone. In contrast, when ten people eat together and one goes out to the market place, the <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited until he returns to his place.
When three people eat together and one recites grace alone before the others, the <i>zimmun</i> can be recited with him and the other two fulfill their obligation. He, however, is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation, because the <i>zimmun</i> cannot be fulfilled retroactively.
When two people eat together, each person should recite grace by himself. If one knows [how to recite grace] and the other does not, the one who knows should recite the grace out loud, and the other person should recite <i>Amen</i> after each blessing. In this manner, he fulfills his obligation.<br>A son may recite grace for his father, a servant for his master, and a woman for her husband - and thus enable the person to fulfill his obligation. Nevertheless, our Sages said, "May a curse come on a person whose wife or children recite grace for him."
When do the statements that [it is possible to] fulfill one's obligation [in this manner] apply? When they have not eaten to the point of satiation. Therefore, their obligation is only Rabbinic in origin, and can be fulfilled by [listening to] a minor, a servant, or a woman.<br>If, however, they ate to the point of satisfaction, and thus are obligated according to the Torah itself to recite grace, they cannot fulfill their obligation by [listening to] either a woman, a minor, or a servant. Anyone who is obligated according to the Torah to perform a mitzvah can have his obligation fulfilled only by another person who is also obligated from the Torah [to fulfill this mitzvah] as he is.
[The following rules apply when] a person enters [a room where] others are reciting the blessing of <i>zimmun</i>]: If he [enters when] the person reciting the blessings says, "Let us recite grace," he should respond, "Blessed is He, and may He be blessed." If he [enters when] the others reply, he should say <i>Amen</i> afterward.

(It is wine and oil, not grapes and olives, which carry such an obligation.) Therefore, the Sages did not impose an obligation to wash before eating from such food if it was not consecrated (Rabbenu Yonah, <i>Berachot</i> 8).3. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 181:1), the Ra'avad, and others offer a different rationale for this washing, quoting <i>Berachot</i> 53a's interpretation of Leviticus 11:44: "'Make yourselves holy,' this refers to the first washing; 'And you shall be holy,' this refers to the second washing."

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:13) accepts the latter view.<br>Significantly, the Rambam mentions washing the hands only once before partaking of food. In <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 11:3, where he mentions the washing of the hands within the context of ritual purity, he mentions the need to wash hands twice: once to purify the hands, and once to wash off the water used to purify them. (See Halachah 10 and commentary.) In these halachot, he makes no mention of a second washing, seeming to imply that it is unnecessary to do so. (Rav Kapach adds that it is customary in certain Yemenite groups to wash only once before meals, and bases this practice on the Rambam's decision.)<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 162:2) mention washing the hands two or three times before partaking of a meal.

I.e., whether before a meal or in preparation for prayer.6. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this expression indicates that it is not necessary to wash one's hands a second time (see the commentary on the previous halachah) or to dry them before partaking of the food. When washing one's hands for food, this is required because the water used for the first washing that remains on the hands becomes ritually impure. In contrast, the water that remains on one's hands after immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> is pure. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:19.)7. A <i>mikveh</i> must have at least 40 <i>se'ah</i> of water that has flowed into it by natural means. In contemporary measurements, 331 liters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 648 liters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this applies only to water that does not emanate from a natural spring. When a person immerses his hands in such a spring, all that is necessary is that there be sufficient water to cover his hands. (See also <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 9:8.)<br>Significantly, Rabbenu Yonah maintains that it is acceptable to immerse one's hands in a <i>mikveh</i> containing even less than 40 <i>se'ah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:14) accepts this view, although the Ramah favors the Rambam's position.<br>8. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, and maintains that one may immerse one's hands in water poured into a pool in the ground. He supports his position by referring to the immersion of a <i>ba'al keri</i> (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4-5), which is acceptable even in such pool. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Mikveot</i> 8:1.) Nevertheless, most authorities accept the Rambam's decision. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 159:23; <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 159.) 9. See Halachot 7-9.10. See Halachot 4 and 10.11. See Halachot 11-12. The Rashba quotes the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> as explaining that it is necessary to wash with a vessel, because the washing of hands is derived from the sanctification of the priest's hands in the Temple.12. See Halachot 13-14.13. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) states that this concept is derived from the laws of the <i>ki'or</i> (the basin in the Temple from which the priests washed their hands). If its water changed color, it could no longer be used.14. E.g., ink or another coloring fell into it.15. It became rusty from a metal container. Note, however, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:22, which state that water that has become murky from mud or dirt is acceptable, because even this is often the color of natural stream water.<br>If after water was disqualified because of an abnormal color, its color reverts to the norm, it can be used to wash one's hands (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:5).<br>16. See <i>Hilchot Rotzeach USh'mirat HaNefesh</i> 11:6-16, which discusseshe prohibition of water left uncovered. This prohibition was enacted out of fear of the possibility that a poisonous snake or the like released venom into the water.17. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 30b states that washing with such water could be dangerous lest the venom seep into cuts or sores or even through the body's pores. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) notes that since the presence of poisonous snakes and the like is no longer widespread, the prohibition against drinking - and hence, washing with - such water need not be observed at present. This ruling is accepted by the later authorities.18. The Rambam is implying that the water in a <i>mikveh</i> or in a natural stream remains acceptable for washing although it was used for other tasks (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).19. If, however, the bread fell into the water accidentally, the water is not disqualified (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:8).20. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:2) states that even if the baker washed his hands in the water, the water does not become unacceptable. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (160:3) refutes this ruling. His opinion is accepted by the later authorities. 21. Slightly murky water is acceptable, as mentioned above. The determining factor is whether or not a dog will drink from the water.22. Since a <i>mikveh</i> containing such water is acceptable for the immersion of one's entire body, it is surely acceptable for the immersion of hands, which is only a Rabbinic commandment.23. These hot springs have a high mineral content and are very bitter.24. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this as referring to a stream that was diverted into a trench that does not contain forty <i>se'ah</i>. Although logically, this would be acceptable for the immersion of hands, the Sages forbade using such water, lest one also immerse one's hands in a container of water. Significantly, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:7), Rav Yosef Karo adds a further point, that the water was cut off from its source.25. I.e., the washing before partaking of bread.26. I.e., the washing after the meal (see Halachah 17); alternatively, the second pouring of water over one's hands, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4. Note the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. 27. In both instances, one must pour at least a <i>revi'it</i> of water over one's hands in a single pouring. In the first instance, while the water is being poured one gradually moves one's hands under the water, while in the second instance, one pours hurriedly, but forcefully, over the entire hand at once.28. I.e., several people stand with their hands outstretched, and a person passes in front of them pouring water over their hands.29. Although the water first passes over the hands of one person, it is still acceptable for the person whose hands are held below, because as long as it contains the required quantity and comes in one continuous stream, it does not become impure.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:16 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:68,72 state that the two people must originally have the intention to wash their hands as one, and must hold their hands close together. Otherwise, it is considered as if the second person washed with the water that was rendered impure by the first person's washing.<br>30. Note the difference of opinion on this issue between the Rambam and the other Halachic authorities mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4.</i> of hands].
Whoever had to wash his hands and [instead] immersed them in the water of a <i>mikveh</i> need not do anything else. If he immersed them in a body of water that does not have the required measure of a <i>mikveh</i>, or in water that has been poured onto the ground, he has not accomplished anything. Water that is poured [by man] can purify hands only when it is poured over them.
Everyone who washes his hands must show concern for four matters:<br>the water itself - that it not be unacceptable for washing hands,<br>its measure - that there be a <i>revi'it</i> for each pair of hands,<br>the container - that one wash from a container,<br>the individual pouring - that the water come from the power of a person who pours it.
There are four matters that render water unacceptable: a change in its color, its being left open, its having been used for work, and its becoming spoiled to the point that an animal would not drink from it.<br>What is implied? Water whose color changes becomes unacceptable whether it is contained [in a pool] in the ground or in a container, or whether it changed because of something that fell into it or because of the place where it is contained.<br>Similarly, if the water was left uncovered in a manner that causes it to become forbidden to be drunken, it is unacceptable for washing hands.
Any water that was used for a task is considered as sewage water and is unfit to use for washing hands. What is implied? Water that has been drawn from its source, which was used to wash utensils, to dip one's bread in, or the like, whether [it was stored] in a container or [in a pool] in the ground, becomes unacceptable for washing hands.<br>If one uses the water to wash clean utensils or new ones, it does not becomes unacceptable. Water in which a baker dips crackers is unacceptable. In contrast, water from which [he removes some] to baste the dough when kneading it is acceptable. It is the water that he removes that was used for a task; the water from which he removed it remains acceptable [as before].
All water that becomes unfit for a dog to drink - e.g., bitter [water], salty [water], very murky [water], foul-smelling [water] - which is contained in a vessel may not be used for washing hands. If [such water] is [contained in a pool] in the ground, one may immerse one's hands in it.<br>[The following rules apply to] the hot springs of Tiberias. In their [natural] place, one may immerse one's hands in them. If, however, one removed them with a container or diverted a stream of them into another place, they may not be used for either the first or the final washing of the hands, because they are not fit for an animal to drink.
One may pour water over one's hands a little at a time until one has poured out the entire amount. If, however, one poured out the entire <i>revi'it</i> at one time, it is acceptable.<br>Four or five people may wash with a single pouring while they are standing next to each other or with their hands above each other's, provided:<br>a) they leave space between their hands for the water to enter, and<br>b) there is enough water in that pouring to provide each one with a <i>revi'it</i>.

In contrast, a sack or a basket is never used to contain liquids. Therefore, even after modification, it is unacceptable.</i> One may not hold water in one's hands and pour it over a colleague's [hands], because one's hands are not a vessel.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:6).</i><br>Vessels that have been broken to the extent that the laws of ritual impurity no longer apply to them<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Keilim</i>, Chapters 6, 11, and 19, relates the following general principle: Once a vessel is broken to the point that it can no longer serve its original purpose, it is no longer considered a vessel and can no longer contract ritual impurity.<br><i>Chulin</i> 107a mentions that a vessel that is used for containing liquids becomes disqualified when it contains a hole large enough to allow liquids to enter when the vessel is placed within them.</i> may not be used to wash hands, because they are considered to be broken vessels.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo states that the Rambam would consider a vessel acceptable if the hole is on the side and the portion of the vessel below the hole contains more than a <i>revi'it</i> of liquid.<br>In contrast, in his <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159), he explains that the Rambam would disqualify such a utensil because even though it can still contain a sufficient amount of liquid, it is a broken vessel and, as such, unsuitable for use for this mitzvah. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:1), he rules that a hole on the side disqualifies a vessel unless one is able to pour water through the hole.</i>

According to our custom of pouring water twice (or three times) over our hands, the second pouring need not contain a <i>revi'it</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 11:8.)</i>
All people are acceptable to pour water over one's hands, even a deaf-mute, a mentally incapable person, or a minor. If no one else is present, one should hold the vessel between one's knees, and thus pour it out over one's hands; lean a jug over so that the water will fall out over one's hands; or pour the water over each of one's hands individually.<br>It is acceptable if a monkey pours water over one's hands.
When a person pours water into a trough by hand or by using a pulley, and afterwards the water flows out from it through an irrigation channel that brings the water to vegetables or to animals, it is not acceptable for one to place one's hands in the trough and have the water pass over them, because the water is not coming from "the power of a giver." If one's hands were close to the place where the bucket is poured out so that the water passes over one's hands because of the power of a human being, the washing is acceptable.
When there is a doubt with regard to the water [used to wash one's hands] - e.g., whether it had been used for other tasks or not, whether it contained the required quantity or not, whether it [the water itself] is ritually pure or not, and, similarly, when a person has a doubt whether he washed his hands or not, [in all these instances,] his hands are considered to be pure. In all instances where doubt arises concerning the ritual purity of hands, the hands are considered to be pure.
When washing before eating, a person should raise his hands upward so that that water will not flow past the wrist, and then return and make the hands impure. In contrast, when washing after eating, a person should hold his hands downward so that all the power of the salt should be rinsed away off one's hands.<br>Before eating, one may wash into a container or onto the ground. After eating, one should wash only into a container. Before eating, one may wash with hot water or with cold water. After eating, one should not wash with hot water - i.e., water that will scald one's hands. It will not [serve the purpose of] removing filth, because one cannot rub one's hands together with it. If the water is merely warm, it may be used for washing after eating.
A person may wash his hands in the morning and stipulate that [the washing will be effective] for the entire day. Thus, he will not have to wash before each time he eats. [This rule applies] only when he does not divert his attention from his hands. If, however, he diverts his attention from them, he must wash them whenever it is required.
A person may wrap his hands in a cloth and eat bread or food dipped in liquid although he did not wash his hands.<br>A person who feeds others need not wash his hands. The person who eats, however, must wash his hands, although another person puts food into his mouth and he does not touch the food at all. Similarly, a person who eats with a fork must wash his hands.
It is forbidden to feed someone who did not wash his hands even if one puts the food directly into his mouth.<br>It is forbidden to treat the washing of hands with disdain. Our Sages have authored many commands and warnings about this manner. Even when one has a minimum amount of water to drink, one should wash one's hands with a portion, eat, and drink the remainder.
[After washing,] a person must dry his hands before eating. Anyone who eats without drying his hands is considered to have eaten impure bread.<br>Similarly, whenever a person washes his hands after eating, he should dry them and then recite grace. One should recite grace directly after washing one's hands. No interruptions should be made. It is even forbidden to drink water after washing one's hands after eating until one recites grace.

Chapter 7

The Sages of Israel were wont to follow many customs at meals. All these are included in the realm of mannered behavior. Among them:<br>When entering for a meal, the man of greatest stature should wash his hands first. Afterwards, all should enter enter and sit down, reclining on couches. The man of greatest stature reclines at the head of the company, and the person who is second in prominence reclines below him. If there are three couches, the man of greatest stature reclines at the head of the company, the person who is second in prominence reclines above him, and the person who is third in prominence reclines below him.
The host should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. When he completes the blessing, he should break bread. A guest should recite grace, so that he will bless the host. If they are all members of the household, the person of greatest stature should break bread and recite grace.
The person breaking bread is not permitted to do so until salt or relishes have been brought before each individual, unless their intention was to eat bread by itself.<br>One should not break off a small piece, lest one appear stingy, nor a piece larger than the size of an egg, lest one appear like a glutton. On the Sabbath, however, one may break off a large piece. One should break the bread at the place that it has been baked thoroughly.
The most preferable way to perform the mitzvah is to break open a whole loaf. When one possesses a whole loaf of barley bread and a sliced loaf of wheat bread, one should put the sliced loaf together with the whole loaf, so that one will break open both a loaf of wheat and a whole loaf.<br>On Sabbaths and on festivals, one is obligated to break bread on two whole loaves. One should hold both in one's hands [when reciting the blessing] and break open one.
The person who breaks bread should give a slice of bread to each individual, the latter should each pick up the piece with his hand. The person who breaks bread should not place the bread in the hand of a person who is eating unless the latter is a mourner.<br>The person who breaks bread should take the bread first and eat. Those assembled may not eat until the person who recites the blessing tastes [from the bread]. The person reciting the blessing may not taste [from the bread] until those assembled complete the recitation of <i>Amen</i>. Should the person breaking bread desire to honor his teacher or a scholar of greater stature than he by allowing him to take the bread before he does, he may.
Two people should wait for each other when [eating from the same] dish. When three people are [eating from the same dish], it is not [necessary] to wait. When two have completed eating, the third should also cease. If, however, one completes eating, the other two need not cease.<br>One should not talk during a meal lest a dangerous situation arise. For this reason, if wine is brought in the midst of the meal, each person should recite the blessing alone. Were one to recite the blessing and another to answer <i>Amen</i> while he is swallowing, a dangerous situation might arise.<br>One should not look at the face of a person who is eating or at his portion, lest he become embarrassed.
An attendant who stands before those dining should not eat together with them. As an act of mercy, one should allow him to taste each dish to satisfy his desire. If the assembled give him wine, he should recite a blessing over each cup, because his drinking is dependent on their desire, not his own.
Should one of the assembled go out to urinate, he need wash only one hand [before] entering. Should he speak with a friend and thus remain outside for an extended period of time, he should wash both his hands [before] entering.<br>If [the company] was sitting and drinking, he should enter, sit in his place, wash his hands [with his back turned], and then turn to face the guests. Why should he wash in his place? So that the others will not say that he did not wash his hands because bread is not being served.
Raw meat should not be placed on bread, nor should a full cup be passed over bread. Similarly, bread should not be used as a support for a plate, nor should it be thrown. The same applies to pieces [of meat or fish] and other foods that do not have shells - e.g., berries, grapes, and figs - because they will become disgusting.<br>It is permissible to cause wine to flow through pipes in the halls of bridegrooms, and roasted grains and nuts may be tossed at the bridegrooms in summer. This is not permitted in the winter, however, because they will become disgusting.<br>We should not wash our hands with wine, whether it has been mixed with water or not. Similarly, we may not spoil any other food or beverage in a contemptuous and derisive manner.
It is forbidden for guests to take any of [the food] that they have been served and give it to the sons or the daughters of the host. Perhaps the host will become embarrassed because all he had was what he had served and that will have been taken away by the children.<br>A person should not send a friend a cask of wine with oil floating on its surface, lest one send a friend a cask that is [almost] entirely wine with only [a small amount] of oil on its surface. The recipient may be [unaware of the cask's contents,] invite guests [with the intention of serving them oil,] and become embarrassed [at his inability to do so]. Similarly, any other activity that may cause a person who holds a feast to become embarrassed is forbidden.
After [everyone] finishes eating, the tables should be removed and the place where they ate should be swept. Afterwards, [those assembled] should wash their hands [as mentioned above].<br>[This practice should be followed] lest pieces [of bread] the size of an olive be found on the floor. It is forbidden to walk or wash over [pieces of this size]. If, however, the pieces are smaller than an olive, it is permissible to destroy them intentionally.
When water is brought to wash, the one who recites grace washes his hands first, so that the person of greatest stature will not sit with dirty hands while others are washing. The remainder of the people eating wash one after another.<br>Honor is not paid to anyone with regard to [the order of washing], because honor is not extended with regard to dirty hands, crossing bridges, or on the roads, with the exception of an entrance that is fit to have a mezuzah, and even then only with regard to entering.
After [the assembled] finish washing their hands, drying their hands, and reciting grace, the person who recited grace should recite the blessing over the incense when the incense burner is brought in. Everyone should answer <i>Amen</i>.
If wine is available, [grace should be recited over a cup of wine]. We bring a cup that contains a <i>revi'it</i> or more and spices. [The person reciting grace] should hold the wine in his right hand and the spices in his left hand while reciting grace. Afterwards, he should recite the blessing on the wine, and then the blessing on the spices.<br>If the spices were fragrant oil or the like, he should spread them on the head of the attendant afterwards. If the attendant was a Torah sage, he should spread it on the wall so that he will not be going out to the marketplace with perfume.
Although grace does not require wine, should one recite grace over wine according to the custom we have mentioned, [several conditions must be met:]<br>One should wash out the cup over which the blessing is recited on the inside and rinse its outside.<br>It should be filled with undiluted wine. When one reaches the blessing for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, one should add a small amount of water so that it will be pleasant to drink.<br>Conversation should not be made over the cup over which grace is recited. Rather, everyone should remain silent until grace and the blessing of the wine is concluded, and then they should drink.

Chapter 8

[When partaking of] all fruit that grows on trees, we recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> beforehand, and <i>borey nefashot rabbot...</i> afterward. An exception is made regarding the five species of fruit mentioned in the Torah: grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates. The single blessing that includes the three [blessings of grace] is recited after them.<br>[When partaking of] fruit that grows from the earth and vegetables, we recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> beforehand and <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i> afterward.<br>[When partaking of] foods that do not grow from the earth - e.g., meat, cheese, fish, eggs, water, milk, honey, and the like - we recite the blessing, <i>shehakol</i> beforehand and <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i> afterward.<br>When a person drinks water for an intention other than fulfilling his thirst, it is not necessary for him to recite a blessing beforehand or afterward.
When a person squeezes fruit - with the exception of grapes and olives - to extract its juices, he should recite the blessings <i>shehakol</i> beforehand and <i>borey nefashot</i> afterward.<br>Over wine, he should recite the blessing <i>borey pri hagafen</i> beforehand and the single blessing that includes the three [blessings of grace] afterward. Over oil, he should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> beforehand.<br>When does the above apply? When he has a sore throat and drinks the oil together with the sauce of cooked [vegetables] and the like, for he benefited by drinking. If, however, a person drank oil alone or did not have a sore throat, he should recite the blessing <i>shehakol</i>, because he did not benefit from the taste of the oil.
When fruits and vegetables that are usually eaten raw are cooked or stewed, one should recite the blessings <i>shehakol</i> beforehand and <i>borey nefashot</i> afterward.<br>[Conversely,] when one eats vegetables that are usually eaten cooked - e.g., cabbage or turnips - raw, one should recite the blessings <i>shehakol</i> beforehand and <i>borey nefashot</i> afterward. When one eats them cooked or stewed, one should recite the blessings <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> beforehand and <i>borey nefashot</i> afterward.<br>When foods are commonly eaten both raw and cooked, regardless of whether one eats them raw or cooked, one should recite the blessing appropriate for them: i.e., if they are fruit that grows on trees, <i>borey pri ha'etz</i>; if they are fruits that grow from the ground or vegetables, <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>.
When one stews vegetables that are frequently stewed, one should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> on the soup produced, because the soup produced by stewing is equivalent to [the vegetables] that are stewed if it is common custom to stew them. This applies only when one stews them to drink the soup.<br>The blessing <i>shehakol</i> is recited over date-honey. Nevertheless, when one crushes dates by hand, removes their pits, and makes them into a substance resembling a dough, one should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> beforehand and the single blessing that includes the three [blessings of grace] afterward.
Regarding sugar cane whose sap is extracted and cooked until it crystallizes like salt: The overwhelming majority of the <i>Geonim</i> require that the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> is recited upon it. Others say that the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> should be recited upon it.<br>Similarly, they say that one who sucks sugar cane should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>. I say that this is not a fruit, and the blessing <i>shehakol</i> should be recited upon it. The "honey" produced by these canes that has been altered by fire should not be given greater prominence than date honey, which is not changed by fire, and yet the blessing <i>shehakol</i> is recited upon it.
[When partaking of] the top stalk of the palm tree [hearts of palm], which is like white wood, one should recite the blessing<i>shehakol</i>.[When partaking of] petals from [the flowers of] the caper bush, one should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>, because they are not fruit. Caper berries - the fruit of this bush which looks like small dates - require the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i>.
[When partaking of] fresh peppers and ginger, one should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>. When these products are dry, they do not require any blessing, neither beforehand nor afterward, because they are considered spices and not food.<br>Similarly, foods that are not fit to be eaten and beverages that are not fit to be drunk do not require any blessing, neither beforehand nor afterward.
The blessing <i>shehakol</i> is recited over bread that has become moldy, wine on which a film has risen, food that has spoiled, windfall fruit that is underdeveloped, beer, vinegar, locusts, salt, truffles, and mushrooms.<br>Whenever <i>shehakol</i> is recited before partaking of a food, the blessing <i>borey nefashot</i> is recited afterwards. Whenever a food requires a blessing afterwards, it also requires a blessing beforehand.
When one pours three measures [of water] over [wine] dregs and receives four measures of liquid, one should recite the blessing <i>borey pri hagafen</i> upon it, for it is considered to be diluted wine. If one receives less than four measures of liquid, one should recite the blessing <i>shehakol</i> even when the liquid tastes like wine.
A person who recited the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> over fruits that grow on trees fulfills his obligation. Conversely, one who recited the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> over fruits that grow from the ground does not fulfill his obligation. One who recites the blessing <i>shehakol</i> over any food fulfills his obligation. [This applies even in regard] to bread and wine.
Should a person take a cup of beer in his hand and begin reciting a blessing with the intention of saying <i>shehakol...</i>, and instead err and say <i>borey pri hagafen</i>, he is not compelled to repeat [the blessing].<br>Similarly, if fruits that grow from the earth were placed before him, and he began reciting a blessing with the intention of saying <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>, and instead erred and said <i>borey pri ha'etz</i>, he is not compelled to repeat [the blessing].<br>By the same token, if a cooked dish of grain was placed before him and he began reciting a blessing with the intention of saying <i>borey minei mezonot</i>, and instead erred and said <i>hamotzi...</i>, he fulfills his obligation.<br>[These decisions were rendered] because at the time when he mentioned God's name and His sovereignty, which are the essence of this blessing, he had the intention of reciting the appropriate blessing for this food. Therefore, since the essence of the blessing was not recited in error, he is considered to have fulfilled his obligation and need not repeat it, although he erred at its conclusion.
With regard to all these blessings, if a doubt arises whether one recited the blessing or not, one should not repeat the blessing, neither before eating or afterwards, because [the blessings] were instituted by the Sages.<br>[The following rules apply when] a person forgets and places food in his mouth without reciting a blessing: with regard to beverages, he should swallow them and recite a blessing afterwards. If they were fruit which would become disgusting if he would remove them [from his mouth] - e.g., berries or grapes - he should push them to the side [of his mouth], recite the blessing and swallow them afterwards. If they would not become disgusting - e.g., beans or peas - he should remove them, so that his mouth will be free to recite the blessing and eat them afterwards.
[The following rules apply when] several types of food are placed before a person [at the same time]: If the same blessing applies to all of them, one should recite the blessing on one, and thus fulfill one's obligation regarding the others. If the same blessing does not apply to all of them, one should recite the blessing that is appropriate for each one individually. The order of precedence depends on one's desires.<br>When there is no one type of food that one desires more than the others, [the order of precedence is as follows:] If among the foods there are foods from the seven species [for which <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was praised], the blessing should be recited over them first. The species that are mentioned first in the verse receive precedence with regard to the blessing.<br>The seven species are those mentioned in the following verse, [Deuteronomy 8:8:] "A land of wheat, barley, vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olives that produce oil and honey." Honey refers to date-honey.<br>Dates are given precedence over grapes because dates were mentioned second in proximity to the word "land," and grapes were mentioned third in proximity to that word.
The single blessing that includes the three blessings [of grace] recited over the five species of fruit and over wine is the same as that recited over grain products, except that for fruit, one should say [at the beginning]: "for the trees, for the fruit of the trees and for the produce of the field, and for the precious land..." and for wine, one should say [at the beginning]: "for the vines and for the fruit of the vine...."<br>For both [wine and fruit], one should conclude: "for the land and for the fruits." A person in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> should conclude: "for the land and for its fruits."<br>There are some who add the following phrase before the conclusion of this blessing: "For You, God, are good and do good," for it reflects the fourth blessing [of grace]. There is, however, an opinion that states that the fourth blessing was instituted for grace alone.
Should a person drink wine, eat dates, and also eat cooked food made from the five species of grain, he should recite [a single] blessing afterwards: "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, for the life-giving and the sustaining [food], for the vines and the fruit of the vine, for the trees and for the fruit of the trees and for the produce of the field, and for the precious land...." He should conclude, "Blessed are You, God, for the land and for the sustenance and for the fruits."
If, however, a person ate meat and drank wine, he should recite a separate blessing afterwards for each food. Nevertheless, if he ate figs or grapes with apples, pears, and the like, he should recite the single blessing that includes the three blessings [of grace] afterwards. It includes everything that he ate, since all the foods are "fruit of the trees." The same principles apply in other similar situations.

Chapter 9

Just as it is forbidden to benefit from food or drink before reciting a blessing, so too, it is forbidden to benefit from a pleasant fragrance before reciting a blessing.<br>What blessings should be recited over pleasant fragrance? If the fragrant substance is a tree or the product of a tree, one should recite the blessing "[Blessed...] who created fragrant trees." If the fragrant substance is an herb or the product of an herb, one should recite the blessing "[Blessed...] who created fragrant herbs."<br>If it is not from a tree or an herb - e.g., musk, which comes from an animal - one should recite the blessing "[Blessed...] who created various kinds of spices." If it is a fruit that is fit to eat - e.g., an etrog or an apple - one should recite the blessing "[Blessed...] who endowed fruits with pleasant fragrance."<br>Should one recite the blessing "[Blessed...] who created various kinds of spices," on any fragrance, one fulfills one's obligation.
A blessing should not be recited on incense until a cloud of smoke rises up.<br>What blessing should be recited over it? If the incense comes from a tree, one should recite the blessing "[Blessed...] who created fragrant trees." If it comes from an herb, [one should recite] "... who created fragrant herbs." If it came from an animal or the like, [one should recite] "... who created various kinds of spices."
Balsam oil and the like require the blessing "... who created pleasant oil." If, however, one pressed or soaked olives until they produced oil with a pleasant fragrance, one should recite the blessing "...who created fragrant trees." Oil in which spices were mixed, as was done for the anointing oil, requires the blessing "...who created various kinds of spices."<br>If one brought both oil and a myrtle to a person, he should recite the blessing on the myrtle and include the oil, because the same blessing, "...who created fragrant trees," applies to both of them.
When one has both a fragrant spice from a tree and a fragrant spice from an herb, a single blessing should not be recited to include both of them. Rather, a blessing should be recited for each one individually.<br>When wine and fragrant oil are brought before a person, he should hold the wine in his right hand and the oil in his left hand, recite the blessing over the wine and drink it, and then recite the blessing over the oil, smell it, and then, spread it on the attendant's head. If the attendant is a Torah scholar, he should spread it on the wall.
If there is a doubt whether a spice requires the blessing "...who created fragrant trees" or the blessing "...who created fragrant herbs," one should recite the blessing "...who created various kinds of spices." Similarly, one should recite the blessing "...who created various kinds of spices" over a mixture of spices prepared by a perfumer.<br>When a person enters a perfumery, he should recite the blessing "...who created various kinds of spices." If he spends the entire day there, he should recite only one blessing. If he enters and leaves several times, he should recite a blessing each time he enters.
Anemones and lavender require the blessing "...who created fragrant trees." Lilies that are raised in a garden require the blessing "...who created fragrant trees"; those that grow in the field require the blessing "...who created fragrant herbs."<br>Roses, rose water, frankincense, and rock roses require the blessing "...who created fragrant trees."
There are types of pleasant fragrances over which blessings should not be recited: a pleasant fragrance that is forbidden, a pleasant fragrance used as a deodorant, and a pleasant fragrance that was not prepared with the intent that it be smelled itself.
What is implied? One should not recite a blessing over perfumes of false gods or over perfumes of women with whom sexual relations are forbidden, because it is forbidden to smell them.<br>Blessings should not be recited over perfumes placed by the dead, perfumes placed in toilets, or an oil used to remove filth, because they are intended to remove a foul odor.<br>A blessing is not recited when incense is burned to perfume utensils or clothes, because the incense was not prepared with the intent that it be smelled itself. Similarly, a blessing should not be recited on clothes that were perfumed in this manner, because the fragrant substance itself is not present; there is merely a fragrance without any substance.
A blessing should not be recited on spices used at a gentile party, because we assume that a gentile party is dedicated to idol worship.<br>[The following rules apply when] a person smelled a pleasant fragrance while walking outside a city: If the majority of the city are gentiles, he should not recite a blessing. If the majority of the city are Jewish, he should. If a fragrance for which a blessing should be recited becomes mixed with a fragrance for which a blessing should not be recited, the ruling depends on the majority.

When a person hears favorable tidings,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is complemented by Halachah 7, which explains that the blessing <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i> is recited when the positive nature of the tidings effect others as well as oneself. If the favorable tidings are individual in nature, the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> should be recited. The Rambam mentions <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i> in this halachah, because he is referring to - although not quoting exactly - the text of the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 9:2.</i> he should recite the blessing: "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who is good and does good."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Chapter 4, Halachah 9, this same blessing is also recited when different wine is served during a meal.</i> If he hears bad tidings, he should recite the blessing: "Blessed [are You...] the true Judge."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This blessing has the implication that, although one personally feels upset over the event, he realizes that since everything is controlled by God and He is "the true Judge":<br>a) the occurrence, however tragic, was just,b) ultimately, it is intended for the good.

Because of the deep message communicated by that Mishnah, it is worthy to quote it and the Rambam's commentary upon it:<br>We are obligated to bless [God] for undesirable occurrences in the same manner as we bless [Him] for desirable occurrences. [This is implied by Deuteronomy 6:5]: "And you shall love God, your Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.""With all your heart": with both your inclinations; the good inclination and the evil inclination;"With all your soul": even if it takes your soul; "With all your might": with all your money. Alternatively, the expression בכל מאדך [can be associated with the words בכל מדה and interpreted to mean] for every measure that He deals you be very, very thankful to Him.<br>On this Mishnah, the Rambam comments:<br>[The Mishnah] states: In the same manner as one blesses Him for good... [i.e.,] he should accept them with happiness, overcome his feelings, and compose his mind when reciting the blessing <i>Dayan ha'emet</i> to the extent that he should appear in the same state as when reciting the blessing <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i>.Our Sages declared... "Everything Heaven does is for good."... Although many matters may originally look unfavorable, ultimately they will bring great good. Conversely, there are many things which, at the outset, appear good, and ultimately are very bad. Therefore, an understanding person should not become aggrieved when beset with difficulties... because he does not know the ultimate outcome.A person should concentrate his thoughts [on the following objective] and ask God [for it to be realized]: That everything that happens to him in this world, both positive and unfavorable occurrences, should be with the intent of bringing him the ultimate happiness, [a portion in the world to come].</i>
When a desirable event occurred to a person or he heard favorable tidings, although it appears that this good will ultimately cause one difficulty,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 9:3, based on <i>Berachot</i> 60a), the Rambam gives an example of such a situation: A person who found a lost object in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in Talmudic times. The Romans would punish anyone who did not deliver a lost object he discovered to the government authorities. Thus, one could ultimately be reported for having found a lost object and be forced to pay an exorbitant fine for it. Nevertheless, at the time the object is found, it is an obvious good.</i> he should recite the blessing <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i>. Conversely, if a person suffered a difficulty or heard unfavorable tidings, although it appears that this difficulty will ultimately bring him good,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam (<i>ibid.</i>) exemplifies this situation as follows: A person's fields were flooded, damaging his crops. Although the fact that his fields were watered will ultimately prove advantageous, he should recite <i>Dayan ha'emet</i>, since, immediately, he suffered a loss.</i> he should recite the blessing <i>Dayan ha'emet</i>. Blessings are not recited in consideration of future possibilities, but rather on what happens at present.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> relates that the Rambam's choice of phraseology implies that even when one is certain that the opposite quality will ultimately become manifest, he should recite the blessing appropriate for the situation at present.</i>
[The following rules govern the recitation of blessings for] abundant rainfall: If one owns a field [individually], he should recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i>. If one owns it in partnership with others,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher maintains that even if one owns a field individually, if there are other Jews in the area who will benefit from the rain, he should recite <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i>.</i> he should recite the blessing <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i>. If one does not own a field, he should recite the following blessing:<br>We<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, this blessing does not begin: "Blessed are You, God...."</i> thankfully acknowledge You, God, our Lord, for each and every drop that you have caused to descend for us. If our mouths were filled....<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">One continues, reciting the text of the <i>Nishmat</i> prayer recited on Sabbath mornings.</i> They shall all give thanks, praise, and bless Your name, our King. Blessed are You, God, the Almighty, who is worthy of manifold thanksgiving and praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 221:1) state that it is not customary to recite this blessing in European countries. Since rain is plentiful there, people do not appreciate it as much. Nevertheless, should there be a drought in these countries, this blessing should be recited (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 221:2).</i>
When should the blessing be recited? When much water collects on the face of the earth, the raindrops cause bubbles to form in the rain that has already collected, and the bubbles begin to flow one into another.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 6b, the source for this halachah, describes this situation metaphorically, "when the groom goes out to greet the bride." (See also <i>Berachot</i> 59b.)</i>
[The following blessings should be recited] when a person was told that his father died and that he is his heir: If he has brothers [who will share the inheritance] with him, he should first recite, <i>Dayan ha'emet</i>, and afterwards, <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i>. If he has no brothers [who will share] with him, he should recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The same holds true for other circumstances that are, simultaneously, of both a positive and undesirable nature. For example, Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 223:1) mentions the recitation of the two blessings (<i>shehecheyanu</i> and <i>Dayan ha'emet</i>) when a man's wife dies after giving birth to a son.</i><br>To summarize the matter: Whenever a circumstance is of benefit to one together with others, he should recite the blessing <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i>. Should it be of benefit to him alone, he should recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i>.
Four individuals are required to render thanks: a person who had been sick and recuperated, a person who had been imprisoned and was released, people who alight [at their destination] after a journey at sea, and travelers who reach a settlement.<br>These thanks must be rendered in the presence of ten people, of whom two are sages, as [implied by Psalms 107:32]: "They will exalt Him in the congregation of the people and they will praise Him in the seat of the elders."<br>How does one give thanks and what blessing should he recite? He should stand in the midst of the [abovementioned] company and say:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who bestows benefits upon the culpable, who has bestowed all goodness upon me.<br>Those who hear should respond: May He who granted you beneficence continue to bestow good upon you forever.
A person who sees a place where miracles were wrought for the Jewish people - for example, the Red Sea or the crossings of the Jordan - should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who wrought miracles for our ancestors in this place.<br>This blessing is recited wherever miracles were performed for many people. In contrast, in a place where a miracle was performed for an individual, that individual, his son, and his grandson should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who wrought a miracle for me in this place.<br>or "...who wrought a miracle for my ancestors in this place."<br>A person who sees the den of lions [into which Daniel was thrown] or the fiery furnace into which Chananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were thrown should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who wrought miracles for the righteous in this place.<br>A person who sees a place in which false gods are worshiped should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who grants patience to those who transgress His will.<br>[When a person sees] a place from which the worship of false gods has been uprooted in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, he should recite the blessing:<br>[Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe,] who uproots foreign worship from our land.<br>In the Diaspora, he should recite the blessing:<br>...who uproots foreign worship from this place.<br>In both instances, he should say:<br>As You have uprooted [foreign worship] from this place, so may it be uprooted from all places. And may You turn the hearts of its worshipers to serve You.
A person who sees a settlement of Jewish homes should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who establishes the border of the widow.<br>[One who sees Jewish homes that are] destroyed should recite the blessing, "the true Judge." A person who sees Jewish graves should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who created you with justice, judged you with justice, sustained you with justice, took your lives with justice, and ultimately, will lift you up with justice to the life of the world to come. Blessed are You, God, who resurrects the dead.
The following should be recited when one sees 600,000 people at one time. If they are gentiles, he should recite the verse (Jeremiah 50:12 : "Your mother shall be greatly ashamed; she that bore you will be disgraced. Behold, the ultimate fate of the gentiles will be an arid wilderness and a desolate land."<br>If they are Jews and in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, he should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, the Wise [who knows] secrets.<br>One who sees a gentile wise man should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has given from His wisdom to flesh and blood.<br>[When one sees] Jewish wise men, he should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has given from His wisdom to those who fear Him.<br>[When one sees] a Jewish king, he should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has given from His glory and might to those who fear Him.<br>[When one sees] a gentile king, he should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has given from His glory to flesh and blood.
A person who sees a Kushit or a person who has a strange-looking face or an abnormal limb should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has altered His creations.<br>When one sees a blind man, a one-legged person, a person with skin boils or white blotches, or the like, he should recite the blessing "the true Judge." If they were born with these afflictions, he should recite the blessing "who has altered His creations."<br>When one sees an elephant, monkey, or owl, he should recite the blessing: "Blessed... who has altered His creations."
A person who sees beautiful and well-formed creations or pleasant-looking trees should recite the blessing:<br>[Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe,] whose world is like this.<br>A person who goes out to the fields or gardens in the month of Nisan and sees flowering trees sprouting branches should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who did not leave anything lacking in His world and created within it fine creations and beautiful and fine trees so that they would give pleasure to men.
[When one perceives] any of the following: winds that blow extremely powerfully, lightning, thunder, loud rumblings that sound like large mills when they are heard on the earth, shooting stars, or comets, he should recite the blessing:<br>[Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe,] whose power and might fill up the world.<br>If one desires, he may recite the blessing:<br>[Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe,] who performs the work of creation.
Whenever one sees mountains, hills, seas, deserts, or rivers after a thirty day interval, he should recite the blessing "who performs the work of creation."<br>A person who sees the ocean after an interval of thirty days or more should recite the blessing:<br>[Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe,] who created the ocean.
A person who sees a rainbow should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who remembers the covenant, is faithful to His covenant, and maintains His word.<br>When a person sees the moon after it is renewed, he should recite the blessing:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who created the heavens with His word and all their hosts with the breath of His mouth. He granted them a fixed law and schedule so that they should not alter their tasks. They rejoice and are glad to carry out the will of their Creator. They are faithful servants whose work is righteous. And He instructed the moon to renew itself as a crown of glory to those who are borne [by Him] from the womb, who are destined to be similarly renewed and to glorify their Creator for the name of the glory of His kingdom and for all He has created. Blessed are You, God, who renews the months.
This blessing should be recited while standing, for whoever recites the blessing on the new moon at its appropriate time is considered as if he greeted the Divine Presence.<br>If a person did not recite the blessing on the first night, he may recite the blessing until the sixteenth of the month, until the moon becomes full.
A person who sees the sun on the day of the spring equinox at the beginning of the twenty-eight year cycle that begins on Wednesday night [must recite a blessing]. When he sees the sun on Wednesday morning, he should recite the blessing "who performs the work of creation."<br>Similarly, the blessing "who performs the work of creation" should be recited when the moon reaches the beginning of the zodiac constellation <i>taleh</i> at the beginning of the month when it is not pointing to the north or the south, when any of the other five stars [that revolve in separate spheres] arrive at the beginning of the constellation <i>taleh</i> and do not point to the north or the south, and when one sees the constellation <i>taleh</i> ascend to the eastern corner [of the sky].
When a person sees a settlement of gentile homes, he should recite the verse (Proverbs 15:25): "God will pluck up the house of the proud." Should he see a desolate settlement of gentile homes, he should recite the verse (Psalms 94:1): "The Lord is a God of retribution. O God of retribution, reveal Yourself." When one sees gentile graves, he should recite the verse (Jeremiah 50:12): "Your mother shall be greatly ashamed...."
A person who enters a bathhouse should say "May it be Your will, God, our Lord, to allow me to enter in peace and leave in peace, and may You save me from this and the like in the future."<br>When one leaves the bath, he should say, "I give thanks to You, God, our Lord, for saving me from fire."
A person who goes to let blood should say, "May it be Your will, God, our Lord, that this activity bring me a recovery, for You are a generous healer." Afterward, he should recite the blessing, "Blessed are You, God... Healer of the sick."
A person who goes to measure his silo should say, "May it be Your will, God, our Lord, that You send blessing to the work of my hands." When he begins to measure, he should say, "Blessed be He who sends blessings to this heap of grain."<br>If he asks for mercy after measuring [his grain], his prayer is considered to be in vain. [Similarly,] whoever calls out [to God] over events that have already happened is considered to have uttered a prayer in vain.
When a person enters a house of study, he should say:<br>May it be Your will, God, our Lord, that I not stumble regarding a point of law, that I not call something that is pure impure, nor something that is impure pure, nor call something that is permitted forbidden, nor something that is forbidden permitted, and that I not err regarding a point of Scriptural Law and cause my colleagues to laugh at me, nor my colleagues err and I laugh at them.
When one leaves the house of study, he should say:<br>I thank You, God, our Lord, that You have granted me a portion among those who sit in the House of Study and have not granted me a portion among those who sit on the street-corners.<br>I rise early and they rise early: I rise early to the words of Torah, and they rise early to fruitless matters. I labor and they labor: I labor for the words of Torah and receive a reward; they labor and do not receive a reward. I run and they run: I run to the life of the world to come, and they run to the pit of destruction.
A person who enters a metropolis should say, "May it be Your will, God, my Lord, to allow me to enter this metropolis in peace." If one enters in peace, he should say, "I thank You, God, my Lord, for allowing me to enter in peace."<br>When one desires to leave, he should say, "May it be Your will, God, my Lord, to allow me to depart from this metropolis in peace." If one departs in peace, he should say:<br>I thank You, God, my Lord, for allowing me to depart in peace. As You have allowed me to depart in peace, lead me [on my way] in peace, direct my steps in peace, support me in peace, and save me from the hands of the enemies and lurking foes on the way.
The general rule is: A person should always cry out [to God] over future possibilities, asking for mercy. He should thank [God] for what has transpired in the past, thanking Him and praising Him according to his capacity. Whoever praises and thanks God abundantly and continuously is worthy to be praised.

There are positive commandments that a person is obligated to make an effort to pursue [their fulfillment] until he performs them - for example, <i>tefillin,</i> sukkah, <i>lulav</i>, <i>and</i> <i>shofar.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tefillin</i> represent a mitzvah that we are required to fulfill each day, while <i>sukkah</i>, <i>lulav</i>, and <i>shofar</i> are fulfilled only on the holidays with which they are associated. By mentioning both these types of obligations, the Rambam expresses his point more clearly. It is, nevertheless, worthy of question why the Rambam lists the mitzvot of sukkah, <i>lulav</i>, and <i>shofar</i> in this order. In Hilchot Shofar V'Sukkah V'Lulav, he discusses them in a different order.</i> These are referred to as obligations, since a person is obligated to fulfill them.<br>There are other mitzvot that are not obligations, but resemble voluntary activities - for example, [the mitzvot of] <i>mezuzah</i> and constructing a guardrail.

Therefore, since blessings are recited before Torah study (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 7:10), a blessing should also be recited before fulfilling a mitzvah. It must, however, be emphasized that this is an <i>asmachtah</i> and the obligation to recite these blessings originates in Rabbinic law and not in the Torah itself.</i> before<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, there is one exception to this principle: the ritual immersion of a convert, as explained in Halachah 7. Although other authorities maintain that the blessing before washing hands should be recited after washing and not beforehand, as mentioned in Chapter 6, Halachah 2, the Rambam does not agree, and requires that this blessing also be recited before fulfilling the mitzvah.</i> fulfilling all positive commandments that are between man and God,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements imply that a blessing should not be recited before fulfilling any of the mitzvot between man and man. The Rabbis have given several explanations why blessings are not recited before fulfilling such commandments:<br>a) A blessing is recited only when a person can fulfill a mitzvah on his own, without requiring the assistance of another person. Many of the mitzvot between man and man require a recipient - e.g., charity cannot be given without a poor man being willing to receive it, a lost object cannot be returned unless its owner accepts it (Rashba, Vol. I, Responsum 18).<br>b) Many of the mitzvot between man and man (e.g., visiting the sick, comforting mourners, giving charity) were instituted because of undesirable circumstances. Hence, it is not appropriate that a blessing be recited in connection with them (Rav David Avudraham).<br>[Although as stated in the previous chapter, a person is obligated to recite a blessing when undesirable events occur to him, it is not appropriate to do so when such events happen to a colleague. Should a person do so, he would appear to be rejoicing in his colleague's misfortune.]<br>c) The gentiles are also obligated to give charity and establish a stable society. Hence, they fulfill many of the positive commandments. Thus, the blessing recited before fulfilling a mitzvah, praising God for sanctifying - i.e., differentiating - "us with Your commandments" is inappropriate (<i>Torah Temimah</i>).</i> whether they are mitzvot that are obligatory or are not obligatory.
Similarly, with regard to all the Rabbinic mitzvot - both the mitzvot that the Rabbis established as obligations<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., mitzvot that we are required to fulfill at a specific time.</i> - e.g., regarding the <i>megillah</i>, lighting Shabbat candles, and lighting Chanukah candles - and the mitzvot that are not obligations<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., mitzvot that have a voluntary dimension; thus, if one desires to carry within a <i>carmelit</i> on the Sabbath, one must establish an <i>eruv</i>; if one desires to eat bread, one must wash one's hands.</i> - e.g., an <i>eruv</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">There are several types of <i>eruvim</i>, as the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i>. All are included in the same blessing.</i> or washing hands<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements. Although washing hands before eating has a voluntary aspect, as explained above, we are required to wash before prayer each morning. (See Chapter 6, Halachah 2.)</i> - one should recite a blessing before performing them, [praising God] "who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us….”<br>Where has He commanded us [to fulfill these commandments]?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's question is: Since these commandments were instituted by the Sages, how can we say that God commanded us to fulfill them?</i> In the Torah, which states [Deuteronomy 17:11]: "Act [according to the judgment] they relate to you."<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Shabbat</i> 23a, except that he quotes a different portion of the proof-text mentioned by the Talmud in order to emphasize the positive nature of the Biblical commandment (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Compare also to Chapter 6, Halachah 2, where he quotes another portion of the verse.<br>(Note the Ramban's objection to the Rambam's definition of Rabbinic commandments and the <i>Kiryat Sefer's</i> resolution of the difficulty in the fifth chapter of his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.)</i> [Based on this Biblical verse, the blessing recited before fulfilling a Rabbinical commandment] can be interpreted as follows: Who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us to listen to these [sages] who have commanded us to light Chanukah candles or read the <i>megillah</i>. The same applies regarding all Rabbinic commandments.
Why do we not recite a blessing before washing our hands after [eating]? Because the Sages obligated us [to do] this only because of danger.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6, Halachot 2-3, which explain that the obligation to wash after eating was instituted lest a person use Sodomite salt and, after eating, inadvertently pass his hands over his eyes and blind himself. Note also the objection of the Ra'avad to the Rambam's statements in Halachah 2 of that chapter.</i> Blessings are not recited over an [obligation that was instituted] because of danger.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements. In Halachot 9 and 12, the Rambam states that a blessing is recited when one fulfills the mitzvah of constructing a guardrail. On the surface, the purpose of that mitzvah is to prevent danger. This question can, however, be resolved on the basis of <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 9:7, which states:<br>One who says... "May He who showed mercy on a bird's nest... show mercy on us"... should be silenced, because these mitzvot are God's decrees and are not [expressions of] mercy.<br>Although the obvious reason for the mitzvah of chasing away the mother bird is to show mercy (and the Rambam himself gives such an explanation in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 38), that mitzvah - and every mitzvah - is ultimately a Divine decree that surpasses human intellect. Any rationale we provide is limited and cannot define the mitzvah in a complete manner.<br>The same applies in the present instance. Although the obvious reason for constructing a guardrail is to prevent a dangerous situation from arising, this nevertheless represents only man's conception of the mitzvah. God's purpose is beyond our comprehension. Therefore, a Rabbinic ordinance like washing after the meal can be considered as having been established because of danger, and, for that reason, a blessing is not recited in connection with its performance. In contrast, with regard to a commandment from the Torah itself, there is no way that we can define the ultimate purpose for its performance and consider it as having been granted us only to avoid danger (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>). [See also <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. IX. Note also that although the Rambam and the <i>She'iltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon mention reciting a blessing over the construction of a guardrail, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, Chapter 427) does not mention this blessing.]</i><br>To what can this be compared? To someone who strains drinking water at night because of the danger of leeches. [Surely,] he does not recite a blessing, [praising God,] "who commanded us to strain water." The same applies in all similar situations.
[The following rules apply when] a person performs a mitzvah, but does not recite a blessing: If the fulfillment of the mitzvah still continues, he may recite the blessing even though he already performed it.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">To explain this concept, using one of the examples cited by the Rambam: When one puts on <i>tefillin</i>, one's fulfillment of the mitzvah continues throughout the entire time one is wearing them. Therefore, although one should recite the blessing before putting them on, if one did not, it is still proper to do so afterwards, because one is still fulfilling the mitzvah.</i> If the mitzvah is a deed that is completed, he should not recite a blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam gives examples of this concept in the following halachah.</i><br>What is implied? When a person wrapped himself in <i>tzitzit</i>, donned <i>tefillin</i>, or sat in a <i>sukkah</i> without reciting a blessing at the outset, after wrapping himself [in <i>tzitzit</i>] he should recite the blessing "... who commanded us to wrap ourselves in <i>tzitzit</i>"; after donning [<i>tefillin</i>], he should recite the blessing "... who commanded us to put on <i>tefillin</i>"; after sitting [in the <i>sukkah</i>], he should recite the blessing "... who commanded us to sit in the <i>sukkah</i>." The same applies in all similar situations.
In contrast, if a person slaughtered [an animal] without reciting a blessing,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since the mitzvah is already completed, there is no further cause to recite the blessing. On the contrary, according to the Rambam, doing so would be a recitation of the blessing in vain. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:23.)</i> he should not recite the blessing "... who sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us concerning slaughter," after the slaughter [is completed]. Similarly, if he covered [a fowl's] blood, separated <i>terumah</i> or the tithes, or immersed himself without reciting a blessing beforehand,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See note 17 in the commentary on the following halachah.</i> he should not recite a blessing afterwards. The same applies in all similar situations.
There is no mitzvah for which the blessing should be recited after its fulfillment, with the exception of the immersion of a convert.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As he mentions in the previous halachah, the Rambam maintains that this exception applies only regarding the immersion of a convert. Other individuals - e.g., a woman immersing herself to emerge from the <i>niddah</i> state or, in the times of the Temple, a person immersing himself to emerge from other states of impurity - should recite a blessing before immersing. (As the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4, there is no difficulty in a person who is ritually impure reciting prayers.)<br><i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 51a, differ, maintaining that since an exception is made regarding the immersion of a convert, the Sages did not differentiate and required that the blessings for all immersions be recited afterwards. The Rambam's opinion is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 200:1), while the Ramah follows <i>Tosafot's</i> view. (See also the commentary on Chapter 6, Halachah 2, which discusses whether the blessing for washing hands should be recited before washing or afterwards.)</i> [In this instance, the exception was made] because he could not say, "who sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us." Until [the convert] immersed himself, he was neither sanctified nor commanded. Therefore, he recites the blessing over the immersion [only] after immersing himself. [This is allowed] since at the outset, he was unfit and unable to recite the blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, in this instance, at the outset, the Sages instituted the obligation to recite a blessing after immersion.</i>
Whenever the performance of a mitzvah constitutes the completion of one's obligation, he should recite the blessing before performing it. When, however, there is another commandment that follows the performance of a particular mitzvah,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's phraseology is somewhat problematic, for it implies that there is a separate mitzvah in making a <i>sukkah</i> or a <i>lulav</i>.

What has to be made? According to the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Lulav</i> 7:6), we are not required to bind the three species of the <i>lulav</i> together. This question can be resolved, however, because according to Rabbinical decree, it is desirable that the species be bound together (Rav Kapach).</i> a <i>shofar,</i> tzitzit, <i>tefillin</i>, or a <i>mezuzah</i>, he should not recite a blessing at the time he made [them]: [praising God for] "sanctifying us with Your commandments and commanding us to make a <i>sukkah</i>" or "a <i>lulav</i>," or "to write <i>tefillin</i>," because there is another commandment that follows this action.<br>When is the blessing recited? When one sits in the <i>sukkah</i>, shakes the <i>lulav</i>, hears the sounding of the <i>shofar, wraps oneself in</i> tzitzit, dons <i>tefillin</i>, or affixes the <i>mezuzah</i>. In contrast, when one constructs a guardrail,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Chatam Sofer</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i>, Responsum 52), who states that whenever the fulfillment of a mitzvah takes a long time, one should recite the blessing before one completes the last phase.

(See also Halachah 4, note 13.)</i> before constructing it one should recite the blessing "...who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us to construct a guardrail." The same applies in all similar situations.
The blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> is recited:<br>[before] fulfilling every mitzvah that we are obligated to fulfill only at a specific time - e.g., <i>shofar,</i> sukkah, <i>lulav</i>, reading the Megillah, and [lighting] Chanukah candles,<br> [before fulfilling] every mitzvah that involves the acquisition of property<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that just as we recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> over the acquisition of new clothing (Chapter 10, Halachah 1), we recite this blessing over the acquisition of new mitzvot.</i> - e.g., <i>tzitzit</i>, <i>tefillin</i>, and a guardrail - and<br> [before fulfilling] every mitzvah that we are obligated to fulfill infrequently - for this resembles a mitzvah we are obligated to fulfill only at a specific time - e.g., circumcising one's son<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ashkenazic custom, the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> is not recited over circumcision.

Whether a person performs a mitzvah for himself or for a colleague,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For example, he affixes a <i>mezuzah</i> for a colleague.</i> before performing the mitzvah, he should recite the blessing "... who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us...."

There are, however, other commentaries who have explained these. For example, before eating <i>matzah</i> (and similarly, with regard to other mitzvot that involve partaking of certain foods), we recite the blessing "... concerning the eating of <i>matzah</i>," and not "...to eat <i>matzah</i>." This is because the activity of eating itself is not what God has commanded - indeed, man performs this function on his own accord - what is holy is the object that the person eats. By placing the emphasis on "the eating of" a particular food, we focus our attention on the food and not its actual consumption (<i>Or Sameach</i>).</i>

Although the tithes should be separated because of this doubt, since it is possible that they had been separated previously, a blessing should not be recited.<br>b) Covering the blood of a <i>kvi</i>. The Sages were unsure whether such an animal should be classified as a <i>behemah</i>, whose blood should not be covered, or as a <i>chayah</i>, whose blood must be covered. Because of the doubt, we cover the animal's blood. We do not, however, recite a blessing (see <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 14:4).<br>c) Dwelling in the <i>sukkah</i> on Shemini Atzeret. Although it is customary to dwell in the <i>sukkah</i> on this day in the diaspora, in deference to the possibility that Sukkot actually began on the second day, a blessing is not recited. (See <i>Hilchot Sukkah</i> 6:13.)</i> it should be performed without reciting a blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing is not recited lest the deed one performs not be necessary, and thus the blessing one recites would be considered as taking God's name in vain.<br>Note the question of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> concerning the Rambam's decision (<i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i>13 2:13) that a person who is unsure whether he recited the <i>Shema</i> should recite its blessings as well.</i><br>A person should always take care not to recite blessings that are not necessary, and should recite many blessings that are required. Thus, David declared [Psalms 145:2]: "I will bless you each day."<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 46a quotes a similar verse and comments, "Each day, respond to Him in a manner that reflects His blessings."<br>The Rambam appears to be implying that a person should be continuously aware of the kindness God is granting him and respond by blessing Him.</i>
