Mishneh Torah, Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll



Chapter 1

The four biblical sections which begin with verses “Consecrate all the first-born to me… And when the Lord will bring you into the land” (Exodus 13:1-10; 11:16), “Hear, O Israel… And if you will carefully obey my commands” (Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:13-21) are written separately and covered within a small square box of leather. They are called <i>tefillin;</i> and are worn one on the head and one on the left arm.— —




There are three kinds of parchment: <i>gvil, klaf</i> and <i>duxustus</i>. They are made as follows: The skin of a sheep, goat, or other animal, is taken, and after removing its hair, is sprinkled with salt and treated with flour and gall-nut resin, or anything that contracts the pores of the hide and makes it durable. This parchment is called <i>gvil</i>.
If the hide had been split, after removing its hair, so as to make it two skins, one thin which was next to the hair, and the other thick which was next to the flesh, and these were treated first with salt, then with flour and gall-nut resin or similar substance, the skin which had been next to the hair is called <i>klaf</i> (outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called <i>duxustus</i> (inner-skin parchment).
According to an ancient tradition, attributed to Moses at Sinai, a <i>Sefer Torah</i> should be written on <i>gvil</i> (unsplit parchment), on the side which was next to the hair; <i>tefillin</i> should be written on <i>klaf</i> (the exterior part of the split hide), on the side which was near the flesh); a <i>Mezuzah</i> should be written on <i>duxustus</i> (the inner part of the split hide), on the side that was next to the hair. If the scribe has written on a <i>klaf</i> next to the hair, or on a <i>gvil</i> or <i>duxustus</i> next to the flesh, the <i>Sefer Torah, tefillin</i> and <i>Mezuzah</i> so written are disqualified.



According to an ancient tradition, attributed to Moses at Sinai, a <i>Sefer Torah</i> and a <i>Mezuzah</i> must be written only on traced lines. <i>Tefillin</i> do not need traced lines, because they are covered (within a leather box). <i>Tefillin</i> and a <i>Mezuzah</i> may be written from memory, because these passages are generally known by heart. A <i>Sefer Torah</i>, however, must not be written from memory, not even a single letter.

Chapter 4

Where are the <i>tefillin</i> placed? The head-phylactery is placed on the upper part of the head where the hair next to the forehead ends; it is the place where the child’s brain pulsates. The phylactery should be adjusted in the center of the forehead, between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the neck in the back, which is the end of the skull. 
The hand-phylactery is attached to the left arm over the biceps, which is the flesh rising above the elbow, between the shoulder-blade and the forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs the phylactery will be opposite the heart, in keeping with the precept: “These words … shall be on your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:6). 



When a person has recited the blessing for wearing the phylacteries and tied the hand-phylactery onto his arm, he must not talk, not even return a greeting to his master, till he has put on the head-phylactery. If he did talk, he has committed a transgression, and must recite another blessing “concerning the precept of <i>tefillin</i>,” and then he puts on the head-phylactery. 


















The sanctity of the <i>tefillin</i> is profound. As long as a man wears the <i>tefillin</i> on his head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not engage in evil thoughts but fills his mind with thoughts of truth and justice. One should therefore strive to wear phylacteries all day, which is the right way of performing this precept. It is said of Rav, the disciple of our saintly Master [Rabbi Judah the Prince] that throughout his life no one saw him walking four cubits without Torah, <i>tsitsith</i>, or <i>tefillin</i>. 
Although the requirement is prescribed for wearing them the whole day, it is especially so during the recital of prayers. The sages said: “Whoever reads the <i>Shema</i> without wearing phylacteries is regarded as if he offered false evidence against himself [since the <i>tefillin</i> precept is contained in the <i>Shema</i>]. And whoever does not wear phylacteries at all breaks eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four passages the command is given to wear a head-phylactery and a hand-phylactery. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will enjoy a long life, as it is written: “The Lord is upon them, they shall live” (Isaiah 38:16).

Chapter 6



Chapter 7

Every Jew is affirmatively commanded to write a <i>Sefer Torah</i> for his own use, as it is written: "Now therefore write down this song for yourselves" (Deuteronomy 31:19). This means: Write down the Torah which contains this song, for the Torah is not written in separate sections. Even if a person has inherited a <i>Sefer Torah</i> from his forebears, it is a religious duty to write one at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is as if he had received it at Mount Sinai. If he does not know how to write one, he should have others write it for him. Anyone who corrects a single letter in a <i>Sefer Torah</i> is credited with writing all of it.


If a <i>Sefer Torah</i> has been written without traced lines, or partly on <i>gvil</i> parchment and partly on <i>klaf</i>, it is disqualified. It must be written entirely either on <i>gvil</i> or on <i>klaf</i>. How should a <i>Sefer Torah</i> be written? The scribe must use a correct, fine script; he is to leave the space of a small letter between words, and a hair space between letters; he should leave the space of a line between lines. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough for a ten-letter word written three times.— —

Chapter 8

An open section in the Torah has two forms. If the scribe has completed the preceding section in the middle of the line, he should leave the rest of the line blank and start the open section at the beginning of the next line. This applies only to a case where the last unfinished line still has space for nine letters; but if the space left is less, or if the preceding section has been completed at the end of the line, then the scribe must leave the next line blank and start the open section at the beginning of the third line.
A closed section has three forms. If the scribe has completed the preceding section in the middle of the line, he must leave a blank space sufficient for nine letters and start at the end of the line with one word of the closed section, so that the blank space is between it and the preceding section. If space for the required blank has not been left enough to write one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the rest of the line blank, then indent the next line somewhat and start the closed section within the line. If the scribe completed the preceding section at the end of the line, he should leave the required blank space at the beginning of the second line and start to write the closed section within the line. Hence you may say that the beginning of an open section is always at the beginning of the line, and the beginning of a closed section is always in the middle of the line.
A <i>Sefer Torah</i> that is incorrect in regard to the <i>plene</i> and defective spellings can be corrected as we have already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section in the form of a closed section or a closed section in the form of an open one, or left a blank space where a section is not ended, or continued writing without leaving a blank space where a section ends, or deviated from the prescribed form of the poetic passages, then the <i>Sefer Torah</i> is disqualified for use and there is no remedy for it other than discarding the entire column in which the scribe committed the error.
Inasmuch as I have detected much blundering in all the scrolls of the Torah that I have examined with regard to these things, while the Masorites who write books about open and closed sections differ on the basis of varied scrolls upon which they rely, I have seen fit to list here all the closed and open sections as well as the forms of the poetic verses, so that all the scrolls may be prepared and corrected accordingly. The copy on which I have relied as to these things is the well-known codex in Egypt, containing the twenty-four books of the Bible, which was used in Jerusalem for many years as the standard text for the proofreading of scrolls. All relied upon it, because it had been examined by Ben-Asher who had paid close attention to it for many years, correcting it as often as he was copying from it. It was this codex from which I copied the scroll and prepared it according to the traditional rules.<br>The song on crossing the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) should be written in thirty lines, the first line as usual; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts, with a blank space corresponding to writing above and below it, like this… (See the Hebrew text.)<br>Throughout the Torah, in the poetic verses as well as in the remaining text, the scribe should aim to write the letters of each word close together, seeing to it that they are not joined to each other, nor far from each other to make the word seem two words; there should be merely a hair space separating the letters. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that a child who is not familiar with the text would regard one word as two words, the scroll is disqualified until the correction is made.

Chapter 10

Hence you may infer that there are twenty things, each of which disqualifies a <i>Sefer Torah</i>. If any of these occurs, the <i>Sefer Torah</i> is like a regular <i>Hummash</i> out of which children are taught; it has not the sanctity of a <i>Sefer Torah</i>, and is not used for congregational reading. They follow:<br>1) If it was written on the skin of an unclean animal; 2) if it was written on the skin of a clean animal that had not been made into parchment; 3) if the skin had been made into parchment but not for the express purpose of writing a <i>Sefer Torah;</i> 4) if it was written on the wrong side: on <i>gvil</i> next to the flesh, or on <i>klaf</i> next to the hair; 5) if it was written partly on <i>gvil</i> and partly on <i>klaf;</i> 6) if it was written on <i>duxustus;</i> 7) if it was written without traced lines; 8) if it was not written with indelible black ink; 9) if it was written in any language other than Hebrew; 10) if the scribe who wrote it was a heretic or one of other disqualified individuals; 11) if the scribe wrote the names of God without intent; 12) if he omitted a single letter; 13) if he added one letter; 14) if one letter touched another; 15) if one letter was so distorted that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter; 16) if the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word; 17) if he altered the form of the sections; 18) if he altered the form of the poetic verses; 19) if he wrote any other section in the form of a poetic passage; 20) if he did not sew the parchment sheets with dried tendon of a clean animal.— —
