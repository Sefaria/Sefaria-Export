Mishneh Torah, Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll



Chapter 1

Four passages [of the Torah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">contain references to the mitzvah of <i>tefillin</i>.</i> <i>Kadesh Li</i> and <i>V'hayah ki y'viacha Ado-nai</i> in the book of Exodus  13:1-10 and<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries suggest that, in this instance, the Rambam cited the source for these passages because there is also a passage in the book of Deuteronomy that begins <i>V'hayah Ki Y'viacha</i>.</i> 13:11-16) and <i>Shema</i> and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 422) explains that these four passages were chosen because they include the concepts of the oneness of God, the acceptance of His yoke and the yoke of His commandments, and the description of the exodus from Egypt. These are fundamental principles of the Jewish faith.</i> 11:13-21) should be written separately<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">on parchment</i> and covered with leather.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">as described in Chapter 3.</i> They are called <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Menachot</i> 34b states the word is related to the root ללפ, which means "dispute." The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25) inteprets the word as meaning "sign." <i>Tefillot Yisrael</i> associates the term with the power of thought, citing Genesis 48:11. The <i>Pri Megadim</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:20) understands the term as meaning, "mark of distinction."</i><br>They are placed on the head and tied<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note the difference between the two verbs, "placed" and "tied." See also our commentary on Chapter 4, Halachah 4. It is, nevertheless, worth noting that in the listing of the mitzvot in the introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam mentions "tying the <i>tefillin</i> on the head."</i> on the arm.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandments 12 and 13) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvot 421 and 422) consider these obligations to be two of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. (See <i>Menachot</i> 44a.) Since they are two separate mitzvot, the performance of one is not dependent on the performance of the other, as stated in Chapter 4, Halachah 4.</i> According to Torah law, even a mere point of one of the letters<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">for example, the <i>yud</i> has a short foot in its lower right-hand corner. If that foot is missing, it is considered to have been improperly formed. Therefore, not only it, but the entire passage is not acceptable.</i> from these four passages prevents all of them from being acceptable. All four must be written in the proper manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">If even one of the passages is not written in the proper manner, the person is not considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah at all. (See also the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Menachot</i> 3:7.)<br>Accordingly, it is proper to have one's <i>tefillin</i> checked from time to time to make sure that none of the letters have faded. (See the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 11.)</i>
Similarly, if even one letter of the two passages<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">which mention the mitzvah and, hence, are</i> contained in the <i>mezuzah</i>, <i>Shema</i> and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> (Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and 11:13-21), is lacking a point,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">from its proper shape,</i> it is not acceptable according to Torah law, which requires that they [each] be written in a perfect manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, as well, a disqualifying factor in a single point of a single letter prevents the entire mitzvah from being fulfilled.</i> Similarly, a Torah scroll which is lacking even one letter<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Ben Yedid</i> explains that the difference in the phraseology used by the Rambam with regard to <i>tefillin</i> and mezuzot ("lacking a point") and a Torah scroll ("lacking even one letter") alludes to the difference in the phraseology used by the sources for these laws (<i>Menachot</i> 34a and <i>Bava Batra</i> 15a).</i> is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Though Rabbenu Nissim (<i>Megillah</i>, Chapter 2) appears to contest the Rambam's statements on this issue, the Rambam's view is accepted by most authorities. (See also Chapter 7, Halachah 9.)</i>
There are ten requirements for <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Though all of the ten principles mentioned by the Rambam have their source in the Talmud, their organization into a list of ten is original.</i> All of them are halachot transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yad Malachi</i> interprets the latter expression as a law which has all the authority of a Torah commandment, even though there is no allusion to it in the Written Law. (See also the Rambam's Introduction to his Commentary on the Mishnah, Chapter 4.)</i> It is necessary to fulfill them all. Therefore, if one made any changes with regard to them, the <i>tefillin</i> are not fit for use:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A person who wears <i>tefillin</i> which do not fulfill these requirements is not considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah at all.</i> Two of them involve their composition,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These are listed below and discussed in the following halachot.</i> and eight involve the coverings [placed around the passages] and the tying of their straps.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">These eight conditions are mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and discussed in the subsequent halachot of that chapter.</i><br>These are the two that involve their composition:<br>a) They must be written in ink;<br>b)<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">as opposed to other tints</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is not precise.

How is ink prepared? One collects the vapor of oils,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 23a states that it is preferable to use olive oil.</i> of tar, of wax, or the like, [causes it to condense,]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shabbat</i>, ibid., and commentaries, where it is explained that they would heat the above substances and hold a glass above, upon which the vapors would condense. Afterwards, the soot would be collected.</i> and kneads it together with sap from a tree<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i>, ibid., states that it is preferable to use balsam sap.</i> and a drop of honey. It is moistened extensively,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In one of his responsa, the Rambam writes that it is customarily moistened with oil.</i> crushed until it is formed into flat cakes, dried, and then stored.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Niddah</i> 20a teaches us that their ink was stored while dry.</i><br>When one desires to write with it, one soaks [the cakes of ink]<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From the statement in <i>Shabbat</i> forbidding ink to be soaked on the Sabbath, we can assume that the normal process is to soak it before using it.</i> in gallnut juice<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">which endows the ink with a lasting quality. In contrast, the Rambam writes in one of his responsa that if one were to soak the ink in water, it would fade rapidly.<br>In the same responsum, he states that a liquid possessing qualities similar to gallnut juice can be obtained from pomegranate shells or the outer shells of other nuts.</i> or the like and writes with it. Thus, if one attempts to rub it out, he would be able to.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 20a derives this concept from Numbers 5:23, which states, "He shall write and he shall blot out." Proper ink should be able to be blotted out after writing.</i><br>This is the ink with which it is most preferable to write scrolls, <i>tefillin</i>, and mezuzot.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 159a), which requires that ink be made from substances that are derived from the plant kingdom.</i> If, however, one wrote any of the three<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Torah scrolls, <i>tefillin</i>, and mezuzot.</i> with gallnut juice<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">itself, and not in a mixture with other substances</i> or vitriol,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">a substance produced by the rusting of metal. Our translation is based on Rav Kapach's commentary which has its source in the Rambam's responsa. Others render this phrase "with gallnut juice and vitriol," implying that the two substances should be combined.</i> which remains without being rubbed out, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">after the fact (בדיעבד).</i>
If so,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., if there are no specific substances which are excluded, as stated above</i> what was excluded by the halachah conveyed to Moses on Mount Sinai, which stated that it be written in ink?<br>It excludes tints of other colors, such as red, green,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megillah</i> 17a explicitly disqualifies a <i>megillah</i> written in red ink. From that and other sources, it appears that such ink was frequently used at that time, but was deemed unacceptable for use for a Torah scroll.</i> and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Bi'ur Halachah</i> (32), which states that even blue ink is unacceptable.</i> If even one letter of a Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or mezuzot is in another tint or in gold,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Soferim</i> 1:9 relates that a Torah scroll was written for Alexander with every one of the names of God written in gold. When the Sages heard about this, they said that the scroll should be entombed.<br>Besides excluding the use of gold-colored ink, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:3) explains that covering the ink with gold dust is not acceptable.</i> they are invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">From this, we learn that all black inks are acceptable, regardless of their makeup. Though scribes continue to make ink in the traditional fashion, there is no prohibition against using commercially produced black ink.</i>
There are three types of parchment: <i>g'vil</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">whose preparation is described in this halachah.</i> <i>k'laf</i>, and <i>duchsustos</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">whose preparation is described in the following halachah.</i><br>What is implied? The hide of a domesticated or wild animal is taken.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 10, the animal must be kosher.</i> First, the hair is removed from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (32:10) states that if the hair is not entirely removed, the parchment is not fit to be used. Even after the fact, it is unacceptable. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> quotes this opinion as well, but also mentions other opinions, which do not invalidate the parchment if some hair remains, as long as it had been placed in lime for a long enough time for thehair to fall off.</i> Afterwards, it is salted and then prepared with flour. Then resin and other substances which cause the skin to contract and become harder<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:8) mentions that lime is customarily used for this purpose.</i> are applied to it. In this state, it is called <i>g'vil</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the term <i>g'vil</i> is used to describe any coarse, uneven surface. Note a parallel usage in <i>Bava Batra</i> 3a.<br>If the hide is not prepared in this fashion, it is referred to as <i>diftera</i>, and a Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or <i>mezuzah</i>, written upon it is invalid. Even בדיעבד (after the fact), such parchment is not acceptable, as stated in Halachah 14.</i>
After the hair is removed, the hide may be taken and divided in half in the manner known to the parchment processors.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There is, however, no obligation to divide the parchment. If it has been processed correctly, it may be used for a Torah scroll without being separated, as stated in the following halachah.</i> Thus, there are two pieces of parchment: a thin one, which is on the side where the hair<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">or wool of the animal</i> grew, and a thicker one, on the side of the flesh.<br>After it has been processed using salt, then flour, and then resin and the like,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Several of the Rambam's responsa were addressed to communities where it was not customary to prepare hides in this manner. In these letters, the Rambam stresses that even after the hair is removed from the hide, it must be processed in this manner. Otherwise, it may not be used for either a Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or <i>mezuzah</i>.</i> the portion on the side where the hair grew is called <i>k'laf</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">which means "peel." It is given this name because it is a thin layer of flesh which is peeled easily.</i> and the portion on the side of the flesh is called <i>duchsustos</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Duch</i> is Aramaic for "place," and <i>sustos</i> is Greek (Median in other texts) for "meat." Thus, the word means "the place of the meat" (<i>Aruch</i>).<br>Our translation and commentary follows the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, which is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:7. It must, nevertheless, be emphasized that the authoritative Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> reverse the interpretations of <i>k'laf</i> and <i>duchsustos</i>. The latter interpretation is reinforced by several responsa of the Rambam on the subject. It also is supported by <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 11:6. The Rashba's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> also contained this version, as is obvious from his responsa (Vol. 1, Responsum 579).</i>
It is a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai that a Torah scroll should be written on <i>g'vil</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Bava Batra</i> 14b, it appears that Moses wrote the Torah scroll which he placed in the holy ark on <i>g'vil</i>. Similarly, <i>Gittin</i> 54b mentions that Torah scrolls would be written on <i>g'vil</i>.</i> on the side on which the hair had grown.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This side is smoother and better to write on.</i> When <i>tefillin</i> are written on <i>k'laf</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's expression is somewhat inexact, because it is permissible to write <i>tefillin</i> only on <i>k'laf</i>. If they are written on <i>g'vil</i> or <i>duchsustos</i>, they are unacceptable (<i>Shabbat</i> 79b).</i> they should be written on the side of the flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., on the portion of the <i>k'laf</i> where it is separated from the <i>duchsustos</i>.</i> When a <i>mezuzah</i> is written on<i>duchsustos</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in the following halachah, it is preferable - but not obligatory - to write a <i>mezuzah</i> on this type of parchment.</i> it should be written on the side of the hair.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., on the portion of the <i>duchsustos</i> where it is separated from the <i>k'laf</i>.</i><br>Whenever one writes on <i>k'laf</i> on the side of the hair<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">the epidermis</i> or on <i>g'vil</i> or <i>duchsustos</i> on the side of the flesh,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">the side facing the inside of the body</i> it is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Aruch</i> states that this practice is alluded to by Proverbs 25:2: "The glory of God is in the concealment of a matter." Only "the concealment of a matter," the sides of the parchment which are naturally concealed, are fit to be used for "the glory of God," the fulfillment of mitzvot.<br>It must be emphasized that the Yemenite manuscripts mentioned in the previous halachah, which reverse the definitions of <i>k'laf</i> and <i>duchsustos</i>, do not change the text of this halachah. Thus, according to these texts, when writing on the thin upper parchment, one should write on the epidermis, and when writing on the thick lower parchment, one should write on the part facing the inside of the body.<br>There is an advantage to this version. According to the standard texts, there is an apparent contradiction. Although one should write on the epidermis when writing on <i>g'vil</i>, it is improper to do so when writing on <i>k'laf</i>.</i>
Although it is a halachah which was transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai, that if one wrote a Torah scroll on <i>k'laf</i>, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The entire scroll, however, must be written on one or the other of these types of parchment. If half was written on <i>k'laf</i> and half on <i>g'vil</i>, it is unacceptable (Chapter 7, Halachah 4; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:4).</i> <i>G'vil</i> was mentioned only to exclude <i>duchsustos</i>. If a Torah scroll was written on the latter, it is not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Though this concept is not mentioned explicitly in the Talmud, the rabbis derive it from their understanding of <i>Bava Batra</i> 14b.</i><br>Similarly, if a <i>mezuzah</i> was written on <i>k'laf</i> or on <i>g'vil</i>, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even in Talmudic times, <i>Shabbat</i> 79b mentions that on occasion it was preferable to write a <i>mezuzah</i> on <i>k'laf</i>, because the <i>mezuzah</i> would be preserved better than if it were written on <i>duchsustos</i>.</i> <i>Duchsustos</i> was mentioned only as a mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., it is preferable to do it in this manner.<br>It must be noted that at present, a single type of parchment is used for all three sacred objects. The parchment is not separated in two. A thin portion is removed from the upper layer, and the majority of the - if not the entire - lower layer is rubbed off. The parchment produced in this manner is more attractive and also lighter (a factor significant with regard to a Torah scroll. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:7; Ramah, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:3, 288:6; <i>Siftei Cohen</i>, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:9.)</i>
[Torah] scrolls, <i>tefillin</i>, and mezuzot<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:14 expands the scope of this law, stating that it is not befitting to write the name of God on parchment from a non-kosher animal. This applies even when the intent is not to use the parchment for a sacred purpose.</i> may not be written on hide from a non-kosher animal, fowl, or wild animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 108a derives this concept from the exegesis of Exodus 13:9, "So that the Torah of God will be in your mouths." They conclude: Only what is permitted to be "in your mouths" - i.e., species which are kosher - is acceptable for a Torah scroll. Even בדיעבד (after the fact), such parchment is not acceptable, as stated in Halachah 14.<br>As explained in Chapter 3, this requirement applies not only to the parchment, but also to all the other elements involved in making these sacred articles.</i> One may write on the hides of [all] kosher animals, wild beasts, and fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 20 in regard to writing on parchment made from the skin of birds.</i> This applies even when these animals died without being ritually slaughtered or when they were killed by wild beasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> (ibid.) offers the following parable to explain why even though such animals may not be eaten, it is permitted to use their hides. There were two people who were sentenced to death. One was executed by the king himself and the other by the executioner. Which is more noteworthy? Obviously, the one whom the king executed himself.<br>Similarly, in the present instance, the fact that these kosher animals were "executed by the king" - i.e., their death came about at God's decree - distinguishes them from other animals which are never fit to be eaten.</i><br>We may not write on the skin of a kosher fish because of the foul secretions, since the processing of the skin will not cause the foul secretions to cease.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Keilim</i> 1:4 states: "The skin of a fish is not susceptible to contracting ritual impurity and would be fit for <i>tefillin</i> to be written upon, were it not for its foul secretions." This implies that the only problem is the secretions of the fish skin.</i>
The <i>g'vil</i> for a Torah scroll and the <i>k'laf</i> for <i>tefillin</i> and for a Torah scroll must be processed with this purpose in mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:8; <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1) states that when placing the skin in lime at the beginning of the process of making it into parchment, one should explicitly say that one is processing it for these purposes.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (32:11) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (32:26-27) explain that parchment processed to be used as a Torah scroll may be used for <i>tefillin</i> (or for a <i>mezuzah</i>). Parchment processed for the sake of <i>tefillin</i>, however, may not be used for a Torah scroll, because a Torah scroll is on a higher level of holiness.</i> If they were not processed with this intent, they are not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Even if no parchment that was processed with the proper intent is available, this parchment should not be used, as stated in Halachah 14.</i><br>Accordingly, if they were processed by a gentile, they are not acceptable. Even when [a Jew] instructed a gentile to process the parchment with the intent that it be used for a Torah scroll or for <i>tefillin</i>, it is not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the gentile states that he is processing the parchment with the intent that it be used for these purposes, we do not rely on his word, because we suspect that</i> The gentile follows his own intentions and not those of the person who hires him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Note the comments of Rav Chayim Soloveitchik, who approaches the concept differently, and explains that the above phrase, "the gentile follows his own intentions...," is a description of the gentile's fundamental nature. It is not that we suspect that the gentile will not listen to the person who hires him, and his act is therefore not acceptable. Rather, because his nature is to "follow his own intentions," he is disqualified from performing any act that requires a sacred intention.<br>According to this interpretation, the question of whether a gentile's actions are accepted if he is supervised by a Jew must be understood as follows: The act of preparing the parchment for a Torah scroll is not, in and of itself, a sacred act, but merely a preparation for performing such an act. Accordingly, one might assume that it is sufficient for a Jew to command the gentile to process the scroll for the proper intent. The gentile would be considered like a machine which performs activities with no will of its own, and it would be as if the Jew performed the act himself. In conclusion, however, it is accepted that because the gentile acts independently, the intention of the Jew who hires him cannot be associated with his acts.</i> Therefore,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">the scope of this ruling can be expanded:</i> whenever an article must be made with a specific intent in mind,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., the strands of tzitzit (<i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 1:11) or a bill of divorce (<i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 3:16)</i> it is unacceptable if made by a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher does not accept the Rambam's ruling with regard to these parchments. Though he accepts the general principle, he explains that this particular instance is an exception.<br>In other instances, the gentile must act according to the Jew's intent for a prolonged period of time. Here, it is absolutely necessary to have the intent to use the parchment for <i>tefillin</i> or a Torah scroll only at the moment it is placed in the lime. We can assume that if a gentile is given instructions to place it in the lime with that intent, he will do so with that intent.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes both opinions in <i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:9. <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1, however, mentions only the Rambam's opinion. In both places, the Ramah states that it is customary to follow Rabbenu Asher's opinion.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:12 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:28-29 quote Rabbenu Asher's statements that a Jew should be present at the time the parchment is placed in the lime and that he should explicitly tell the gentile to put it in the lime to be used for a Torah scroll. Afterwards, he should assist the gentile somewhat in the process of preparing the parchment.</i><br>[The parchment used for] a <i>mezuzah</i> need not be processed with this purpose in mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 3:6) states, "Parchment which was processed for use as a talisman is acceptable for a <i>mezuzah</i>."<br>In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the reason for the difference in law between a <i>mezuzah</i>, on the one hand, and a Torah scroll and <i>tefillin</i>, on the other, stems from the fact that a Torah scroll and <i>tefillin</i> are mitzvot which each person is obligated to fulfill. In contrast, the mitzvah of <i>mezuzah</i> is an obligation that is not incumbent on a person unless he dwells in a house that requires one. (It must be noted, however, that there are opinions which maintain that this responsum was not written by the Rambam.)<br>This ruling is not accepted by the other authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 288:5) states that לכתחילה (at the outset), one must seek a <i>mezuzah</i> that was written on parchment processed with this intention in mind. Only if it is impossible to find such a <i>mezuzah</i>, may one use a <i>mezuzah</i> which was not processed with this intent. (Note also our commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 15.)</i>
It is a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai that a Torah scroll or <i>mezuzah</i> should be written only [on parchment] which has been ruled.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The parchment should be ruled with a stylus or a reed. It is improper to use a substance that leaves a mark. Each line of the parchment should be ruled and a border made on both sides. If unruled parchment is used for a Torah scroll or for a <i>mezuzah</i>, it is unacceptable (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:5, 288:8).</i> [The parchment used for] <i>tefillin</i>, however, need not be ruled,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:6) states the top line of <i>tefillin</i> must be ruled because the Sages forbade writing more than three words from a verse from the Bible without ruling the line above them. See Chapter 7, Halachah 16, and also see the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 284:2).<br>In <i>Orach Chayim</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> continues, explaining that a person who cannot write on a straight line without ruling the parchment should rule the parchment before writing <i>tefillin</i>. The Ramah states that it is customary for even the most competent scribes to write <i>tefillin</i> on ruled parchment.

Chapter 2

In what manner are the <i>tefillin</i> [placed on] the head written? [The] four passages<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 1: <i>Kadesh Li</i> (Exodus 13:1-10), <i>V'hayah ki y'viacha</i> (Exodus 13:11-16), <i>Shema</i> (Deuteronomy 6:4-8), and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> (Deuteronomy 11:13-21).</i> are written on four parchments<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 34b explains that the word <i>totafot</i>, with which the Torah refers to the head <i>tefillin</i>, is a combination of the Carthaginian and African terms for two. Since two and two equals four, the word thus means "a four-sectioned ornament."</i> and rolled closed,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">more precisely, folded closed. Though in this halachah, the Rambam mentions only the <i>tefillin</i> of the arm, the parchments in the <i>tefillin</i> of the head are also folded from the end to the beginning, so that when they are opened, one begins reading at the beginning (Chapter 3, Halachah 7).</i> each as a separate entity. They are placed in four compartments, which are covered by a single piece of leather.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 2, for a description of how these <i>tefillin</i> are made.<br><i>Menachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, derives this concept from the fact that Exodus 13:9 refers to the head <i>tefillin</i> as "a remembrance," using a singular form of the word. This teaches that all four passages must appear as a single entity, "one remembrance."<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Keilim</i> 18:8), the Rambam also mentions <i>tefillin</i> of the head in which four separate compartments are sewn together. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:58 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:172 write that <i>tefillin</i> made in this manner or by gluing the four compartments together are acceptable. They nevertheless suggest that it is preferable to purchase <i>tefillin</i> that are made from a single piece of leather.<br>[At present, frequently, <i>tefillin</i> which are made from four compartments that are either sewn or glued together are referred to as <i>peshutot</i> and sold for a substantially lower price than <i>tefillin</i> made from a single piece of leather. The difficulty in purchasing them extends beyond one's willingness to opt for the more lenient opinion mentioned in the above sources. Since most halachic authorities advise accepting the more stringent view, most careful scribes do not use these <i>peshutot</i>. Thus, it is likely that they will have other problems as well.]</i><br>The four passages of [the <i>tefillin</i> placed on] the arm are written on four columns on a single parchment.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They may, however, be written on four separate parchments, which are later glued together (<i>Menachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> They should be rolled closed like a Torah scroll from the end to the beginning and placed in a single compartment.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, derives this concept from the exegesis of Exodus, <i>loc. cit.</i>: "And they shall be a sign for you on your hand." The verse implies that just as the <i>tefillin</i>'s external appearance is as a single sign, so too, internally, they should be a single entity.</i>
Care must be taken in writing these passages. If one wrote a passage which should be <i>s'tumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains at length in Chapter 8, there are two general categories for the passages of the Torah, <i>s'tumah</i> and <i>p'tuchah</i>.<br><i>S'tumah</i> means "closed." It refers to a passage whose first word is always written in the middle of a line in the Torah. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)</i> as <i>p'tuchah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>P'tuchah</i> means "open." It refers to a passage whose first word is always written at the beginning of a line in the Torah. See Chapter 8, Halachah 1.</i> or a passage which should be <i>p'tuchah</i> as <i>s'tumah</i>, it is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:36) quotes an opinion which explains that the <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified for such an error. Since there is a difference between <i>tefillin</i> and a Torah scroll - in a Torah scroll, there are many other passages between <i>Shema</i> and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> - the <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified if <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> is written as <i>p'tuchah</i>. Contemporary Ashkenazic practice is based on this opinion. [Note our commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 2.]</i><br>The first three passages are all <i>p'tuchot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For this reason, the first two passages should be written in a manner in which they end at least nine letters before the end of the column (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:36).</i> while the final passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>, is <i>s'tumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As is explained in the commentary on Chapter 8, Rabbenu Asher differs with the Rambam and offers a different interpretation of the terms <i>s'tumah</i> and <i>p'tuchah</i>. Their difference of opinion does not create a difficulty with regard to the first three passages. A problem, however, does arise with regard to the passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that the Rambam's opinion should be followed. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:26) offers a compromise, which satisfies, according to his interpretation, both the Rambam's and Rabbenu Asher's views. His interpretation, however, is not accepted by all authorities.</i>
One must be careful regarding [the spelling of the words in these passages] with regard to the short or full form.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There are times when the Hebrew vowels <i>cholam</i> and <i>shuruk</i> are written with a letter <i>vav</i>, and times when that letter is omitted. Similarly, there are times when the vowel <i>chirik</i> is written with a <i>yud</i>, and times when that letter is omitted.<br>The expression, <i>malei</i>, rendered as "full form," refers to the form which includes the extra letter. <i>Chaseir</i>, rendered as "short form," refers to the form which lacks the extra letter.</i> [The manner in which] these four passages are written [in <i>tefillin</i>] should resemble the manner they are written in a Torah scroll that has been checked [for accuracy in this regard].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In this context, note the comments of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:20) and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (32:33), which elaborate on the responsibility of a scribe.</i><br>When one writes a word which requires a short form using a full form, it is invalid until one erases the extra letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, every letter of the four passages in the <i>tefillin</i> must be written in order. Nevertheless, although an entire passage was written, correcting a word by erasing an extra letter is not a contradiction to this principle.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:23) mentions that a problem may arise if the letter to be erased is in the middle of a word, since, when it is erased, the space left will cause the word to appear divided. The commentaries explain that the difficulty can sometimes be corrected by extending a letter, for example, writing a <i>resh</i> with an extended upper line.</i> If one writes a word which requires a full form using a short form, it is invalid and may not be corrected.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Because the additional letter will not have been written in the proper order.</i><br>These are [the correct spellings of the words that could present difficulties] with regard to the short and full forms in these four passages.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's inclusion of these particulars in the next four halachot is a clear expression of the desire he expressed in his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, to compose a text that will serve as "a compilation of the entire Oral Law," that would allow a person to "comprehend the entire Oral Law from it without having to study any other text." He saw the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as a guide to the performance of the mitzvot, and therefore included in it details that would allow every individual to understand - and thus carry out - the minute particulars involved in the fulfillment of each mitzvah.<br>1. The Rambam does not use the expression, "short form," because the <i>chirik</i> of the <i>alef</i> possesses a <i>yud</i>. Similarly, the Rambam states "without a <i>vav</i>" or "without a <i>yud</i>" in several other instances in these halachot, because the form of the word is neither short or full in its entirety. 2. Generally, the word is written ידך. <i>Menachot</i> 37a explains that this departure from the norm was intended to teach us that <i>tefillin</i> are worn on the left hand, as explained in the commentary on Chapter 4, Halachah 2. 3. There are three sizes of letters in the Torah - the normal size, an enlarged size, and a reduced size - as mentioned in Chapter 7, Halachah 8. The <i>Baal HaTurim</i> notes that <i>ayin</i> and <i>dalet</i> spell the word <i>eid</i>, which means "witness." The <i>Shema</i> describes God's oneness. By reciting this verse and placing it in their <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzot</i>, the Jews serve as witnesses, testifying to that oneness. 4. The Rambam also discusses the subject of crowns in Chapter 7, Halachot 8-9. When discussing this matter, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 36:3) mentions the obligation to place crowns on the letters, שעטנ"ז ג"ץ. The obligation of placing crowns on these letters is explicitly mentioned in the Talmud, <i>Menachot</i> 29b. Hence, they are regarded with greater stringency.<br>Afterwards, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also states that there are scribes who customarily place crowns on other letters. Significantly, even in Yemen, where the Rambam's directives are usually adhered to precisely, an exception is made in this instance, and there are different customs with regard to the crowns placed upon letters.<br>5. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (36:5) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (36:15) require that one add any crowns that are lacking in the passages. This refers, however, to the crowns on the letters, שעטנ"ז ג"ץ, and not to the crowns required by the Rambam.</i>
[In] the first passage, <i>Kadesh li kol b'chor</i>, [the word] <i>b'chor</i> [is written using] the full form; the word <i>zachor</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>b'chozek</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>hotzi</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>yotzi'em</i> without a <i>vav</i>; the word <i>y'viacha</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>v'ha'emori</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>v'hay'vusi</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>la'avotecha</i> without a <i>vav</i>; the word <i>ha'avodah</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>matzot</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>hash'vi'i</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>matzot</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>s'or</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>g'vulecha</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>ba'avur</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>l'ot</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>ul'zikaron</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>einecha</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>torat</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>hotziacha</i> without a <i>yud</i>; the word <i>hachukkah</i> [using] the short form; and the word <i>l'moadah</i> [using] the full form.
[In] the second passage, <i>V'hayah ki y'viacha</i>, [the word] <i>y'viacha</i> [is written] without a <i>yud</i>; the word <i>chamor</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>b'chor</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>b'chozek</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>hotzianu</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>vayaharog</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>b'chor</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>mib'chor</i> [using] the short form; the words <i>v'ad b'chor</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>zove'ach</i> without a <i>vav</i>; the word <i>b'chor</i> in <i>v'chol b'chor</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>l'ot</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>yadecha</i> is written with a <i>hey</i>; the word <i>ul'totafot</i> without the final <i>vav</i>; the word <i>einecha</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>b'chozek</i> [using] the short form; and the word <i>hotzianu</i> [using] the full form.
[In] the third passage, <i>Shema</i>, the <i>ayin</i> of [the word] <i>Shema</i> and the <i>dalet</i> of [the word] <i>echad</i> are enlarged.<br>The word <i>m'odecha</i> [is written using] the short form; the word <i>l'vanecha</i> [using] the full form; the word<i>b'vetecha</i> without a second <i>yud</i>; the word <i>uv'kumecha</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>l'ot</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>yadecha</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>l'totafot</i> without both <i>vavim</i>; the word <i>einecha</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>mezuzot</i> without the first <i>vav</i>; the word <i>beitecha</i> without a second <i>yud</i>; the word <i>uvish'arecha</i> [using] the full form.
[In] the fourth passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>, [the word] <i>shamo'a</i> [is written using] the short form; the word <i>mitzvotai</i> with only one <i>vav</i>; the word <i>yoreh</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>umalkosh</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>v'tiroshcha</i> without a <i>vav</i>; the word <i>v'hishtachavitem</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>y'vulah</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>hatovah</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>notein</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>otam</i> [using] the short form; the word <i>l'ot</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>l'totafot</i> lacking the second <i>vav</i>; the word <i>einechem</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>otam</i> [using] the short form; the word<i>b'vetecha</i> without a second <i>yud</i>; the word <i>uv'kumecha</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>mezuzot</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>beitecha</i> without a second <i>yud</i>; the word <i>uvish'arecha</i> [using] the full form; the word <i>la'avoteichem</i> without a <i>vav</i>.
Care must be taken regarding the placement of crowns on the letters. They are formed like [small] <i>zeiynin</i> on the [tops of the] letters which possess crowns as in a Torah scroll. These are the letters which possess crowns in these four passages.
There is only one letter [with a crown] in the first passage: the final <i>mem</i> of <i>miyamim</i>. There are three <i>zeiynin</i> upon it. In the second passage, there are five letters [with crowns]. Each of these is a <i>heh</i>, and four <i>zeiynin</i> are placed on each of them. They are: the <i>heh</i> of <i>un'tanah</i>, the first and final <i>heh</i> in the word <i>hikshah</i>, the <i>heh</i> of <i>vayaharog</i>, and the <i>heh</i> of <i>yadecha</i>.<br>In the third passage, there are five letters [with crowns.] They are: the <i>kof</i> of <i>uv'kumecha</i>; it has three <i>zeiynin</i>; the <i>kof</i> of <i>uk'shartam</i>; it has three <i>zeiynin</i>; the two <i>tetim</i> and the <i>pei</i> of <i>l'totafot</i>; each of these letters has four <i>zeiynin</i>.<br>In the fourth passage, there are five letters [with crowns.] They are: the <i>peh</i> of <i>v'asafta</i>; it has three <i>zeiynin</i>; the <i>tov</i> of <i>v'asafta</i> has one <i>zayin</i>; the two <i>tetim</i> and the <i>peh</i> of <i>l'totafot</i>; each of these letters has four <i>zeiynin</i>.<br>There are a total of sixteen letters which require crowns. If one did not place crowns above them, added other crowns, or reduced the number of <i>zeiynin</i>, the passages are not invalid.
A person who purchases <i>tefillin</i> from a person who is not an expert<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 39:8), which states: "One should not purchase [tefillin] from a person who is not an expert."</i> is required to inspect them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">checking to see that no extra letters were added, no letters were omitted, and that each letter is formed correctly.<br>[The <i>Shulchan Aruch's</i> directive and the importance of checking <i>tefillin</i> today must be emphasized, because many scribes, particularly those who write inexpensive <i>tefillin</i>, are not experts. Very frequently, people have purchased <i>tefillin</i> only to find that the passages are not acceptable. For this reason, the Rabbis have suggested buying only <i>tefillin</i> that have been written and inspected by an expert.]</i> If he purchased 100 <i>tefillin</i>, he should inspect three, either two head <i>tefillin</i> and one arm <i>tefillin</i>, or two arm <i>tefillin</i> and one head <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 97a states that one must check at least one arm <i>tefillin</i> and one head <i>tefillin</i> to see that the scribe is proficient in writing both.</i> If he finds them acceptable, [from this time onward,] he can assume the scribe [to be proficient].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">One of the fundamental principles of Torah law is that a <i>chazakah</i> ("assumption upon which one can rely") about a matter can be established when the matter is repeated on three consecutive occasions.</i> Thus, they are all considered to be acceptable and need not be checked.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">provided the person who sells them states that they were all written by the same individual (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 39:22).</i><br>If, however, one purchases them in different packages, they must all be checked, because it can be presumed that each package was purchased from a different scribe.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It is, however, sufficient to check three <i>tefillin</i> from each package.</i>
After a person writes <i>tefillin</i> himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">and inspects them</i> purchases them from an expert,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">whose work need not be inspected</i> or purchases them from another person and has them inspected, and places them in their leather [compartments], they need not ever be checked again.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that since they are enclosed in compartments that are not exposed to air, we can presume that the letters are intact.<br>Though this decision is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 39:10), a qualification is already made. A pair of <i>tefillin</i> which is not worn on a regular basis should be checked twice in seven years. The later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 39:11 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:26) suggest checking even <i>tefillin</i> that are worn regularly. At present, perhaps because of the differences in the way the compartments are made or in the parchment or ink that is used, it is very common for letters in <i>tefillin</i> to smudge, fade, and crack. The <i>Mateh Efrayim</i> suggests that each person have his <i>tefillin</i> inspected every year.

Chapter 3

There are eight requirements in the making of <i>tefillin</i>. All of them are halachot transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In Chapter 1, Halachah 3, the Rambam mentioned that there were ten requirements for <i>tefillin</i> that were communicated as "halachot transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai." The first two involve the actual composition of the <i>tefillin</i>. They, and the other laws involving that subject, were discussed in the first two chapters. Now the Rambam discusses the requirements involved in making the <i>tefillin</i>'s compartments and straps.</i> and, therefore, it is necessary to fulfill them all. If one deviates with regard to any of them, the [<i>tefillin</i>] are unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Though a "halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai" is not written in the Torah itself, it is as binding upon us as those laws which are stated explicitly.</i> They are:<br>a) The <i>tefillin</i> must be square<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">There is a homiletic dimension to this requirement. Nothing is naturally square. Thus, this shape alludes to man's power of achievement. Wearing <i>tefillin</i> on our heads and opposite our hearts implies that we should exercise our powers of achievement when our minds and hearts are tied to God's mitzvot.<br>The base of the <i>tefillin</i> must also be square. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:39) states that this is also a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai.<br>Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:59 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:181, which state that since the squareness of <i>tefillin</i> is a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai, the <i>tefillin</i> must remain square at all times.

How are the head <i>tefillin</i> made? We take a cubic wooden block.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This appears to be the Rambam's preference. It is not, however, an absolute requirement.</i> [It need not, however, be a perfect cube]. If its height is [slightly] more or less than its width, it is of no consequence. We are required to take care only that its width and length are alike.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the top of the <i>tefillin</i> must be a perfect square, but its side surfaces need not be square. This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:39).<br>The <i>Bi'ur Halachah</i> emphasizes that it is not the top surface of the <i>tefillin</i> alone which must be square. At every point along its height, its circumference must be a perfect square. Thus, even if the top surface itself remains square, should the <i>tefillin</i> be crooked or noticeably indented at the sides, they are unacceptable.</i><br>Three grooves are carved into it so that four projections will be made as depicted.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The accompanying diagram is based on a drawing by the Rambam himself, which has been copied in all printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i> Leather is taken<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Note our commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1, regarding making <i>tefillin</i> by sewing or gluing together separate compartments.

In contrast, there are other opinions (<i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> and the Ra'avad) who maintain that the order of the passages should be calculated from the perspective of the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i>. (This produces two further perspectives regarding the order of the <i>tefillin</i>. The <i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> follows the same order as the Rambam except that <i>V'hoyoh im Shamoa</i>, is placed in the first compartment on the left side of the person putting on the <i>tefillin</i>, not on the right side.

When the passages<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">both of the head and the arm <i>tefillin</i> - are rolled closed - to be inserted into their compartments.</i> - both of the head and the arm <i>tefillin</i> - are rolled closed, they should be rolled from the end to the beginning,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">as a mezuzah must be rolled from אחדtowards שמע(<i>Menachot</i> 31b).</i> so that were the passage to be rolled open, it would be possible to read each portion from the beginning to the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Bi'ur Halachah</i> (32) states that although rolling the passages is preferable, if the parchments were placed in the <i>tefillin</i> without being rolled closed they are acceptable.</i>
Before the passages are placed in their compartments, they should be wrapped in a fabric,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The present custom is to use a piece of parchment (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:44).

In contrast, the Rambam, who maintains that it is necessary to wrap them, obligates the hair to be placed around that wrapping.<br>In practice, it is customary to satisfy both opinions and wrap the hair around the passages, cover them with a parchment, and then wrap the same hair around the parchment as well (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:69, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:209).</i><br>This hair should be from a kosher species of animal or beast.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Chapter 1, Halachah 10, all the elements required for <i>tefillin</i> must be made from species which may be eaten.</i> Even when these animals died without being ritually slaughtered or were <i>treifah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">wounded or possessing an illness that will cause them to die within a year.

At present, after the compartments of the <i>tefillin</i> are fashioned into a single block, a sinew is passed between the compartments. Afterwards, they are glued together, and then the entire block is shaped into a square. The grooves we see do not represent the real divisions between the blocks, but are merely external impressions.<br>This process is employed, because were the compartments not to be glued together, it would be difficult to form the <i>tefillin</i> into a square. Even if that were possible at the outset, problems might arise over the course of time, because the compartments might spread further apart, and thus prevent the square shape from being maintained. Though it is acceptable to use <i>tefillin</i> made in the present manner, the Rabbis suggest using those in which the separation between the compartments remains openly visible afterwards.

This constituted the "oral tradition." Though the Sages of the Talmud may have used certain verses from the Torah as allusions to these instructions, the fulfillment of the mitzvot began at Sinai (or shortly afterwards, depending on the mitzvah).

Rather, directly after they were given the commandment to put on <i>tefillin</i>, the Jews placed them on their arms and heads.

The [absence of the] head <i>tefillah</i> does not preclude [wearing <i>tefillin</i>] on the arm,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., if a person does not have a head <i>tefillah</i> or is in a situation where it is inappropriate to wear the head <i>tefillah</i> (see Halachah 23), he should still wear the arm <i>tefillah</i></i> and similarly, the [absence of the] arm <i>tefillah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">or if a person lost the arm on which he should place <i>tefillin</i></i> does not preclude [wearing <i>tefillin</i>] on the head.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions a version of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 4:1) which differs with this ruling. Rav Kapach explains that he is referring to the initial version of the Commentary on the Mishnah, which the Rambam later revised.<br>In that initial version, the Rambam explains (based on <i>Menachot</i> 44a) that the Sages feared that if a person were given license to wear only one <i>tefillah</i>, he might hesitate from purchasing the other one. Therefore, they allowed one to wear a single <i>tefillah</i> only when he already possessed the second one. When the Rambam reviewed that commentary, he emended the text to concur with the decision here.</i> They are two mitzvot, each one to be considered independently.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since there are two different commandments in the Torah, "And you shall tie... and they shall be...," they are regarded to be two separate mitzvot.</i><br>What blessings are recited?

On the arm <i>tefillin</i>, one recites: "[Blessed are You...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to put on <i>tefillin</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible to explain the difference in the two blessings as follows: With regard to the arm <i>tefillin</i>, the Torah states, "And you shall tie them," requiring a deed, and hence the expression "put on." In contrast, the head <i>tefillin</i> are required "to be... between your eyes." Since less emphasis is placed on our actions, it is appropriate to praise God "concerning the mitzvah of..."

When does the above apply? When one puts on only one of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the previous halachah, at times one can put one on without the other.

Hence, if no interruption is made between the two, it is unnecessary - and therefore, we are forbidden - to recite a second blessing.<br>This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:5) and is followed by all Sephardic authorities and some Ashkenazic authorities. The majority of the Ashkenazic community follows the opinion of Rabbenu Asher (quoted by the Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) which maintains that the two blessings should be recited even when no interruption is made between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>.<br>This opinion agrees that the blessing "...to put on <i>tefillin</i>" also applies to the head <i>tefillin</i>. Therefore, even according to this opinion, it is forbidden to make an interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>; nevertheless, the Sages instituted a second blessing in recognition of the unique importance and holiness of the head <i>tefillin</i>.<br>The later authorities have added that because of the possibility that the second blessing is being recited in vain, one should recite the phrase <i>Baruch shem kavod malchuto le'olam va'ed</i>.</i> should tie the <i>tefillin</i> on one's arm,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:11) write that one should put on the head <i>tefillin</i> directly after tying the <i>tefillin</i> to the arm, before continuing to wind the straps around the hand. Thus, no interruption at all will be made between the fulfillment of the two mitzvot.<br>There are, however, certain opinions (see the commentary of Rav David Arameah) that maintain that since tying the arm <i>tefillin</i> around the middle finger is an essential element of the mitzvah, this should be done before putting on the head <i>tefillin</i>.<br>Our present practice follows the <i>Ari zal</i> who would wind the <i>tefillin</i> straps around his forearm, put on the head <i>tefillin</i>, and then, tie the straps around his hand (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 25:24, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 25:38).</i> and afterwards put on the head <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">following the order stated in the Biblical commandment (<i>Menachot</i> 36a).</i> When one removes them, the head <i>tefillin</i> should be removed, and then the arm <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) continues, explaining that the phrase, "they shall be <i>totafot</i> (plural) between your eyes," teaches us that "as long as the <i>tefillin</i> are 'between your eyes,' 'they should be' - i.e., one should wear both <i>tefillin</i>. Thus, the head <i>tefillah</i> should be removed before the arm <i>tefillah</i>.</i>
[After] reciting the blessing, "...to put on <i>tefillin</i>," and tying the <i>tefillin</i> on one's arm, one is forbidden to talk<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">for doing so would constitute an interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>.

Accordingly, although normally one is forbidden to interrupt the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, one may do so to greet his teacher or return his greetings, according to the rules outlined in <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:15-16.<br>The comparison to a teacher is also significant from a different perspective. <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) discusses when one may interrupt one's prayers "because of fear" - e.g., when one encounters a gentile king. Whenever an interruption is allowed in deference to such a king, one may also respond to <i>Barchu, Kedushah,</i> or <i>Kaddish</i>, for they are expressions of deference to the King of kings (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 66).<br>From the fact that the Rambam mentions the prohibition against talking between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i> in the context of deference to one's teacher, one might assume that he would allow an interruption in the above situations when deference to God is involved. Though this opinion is accepted by many early and later authorities (Rabbenu Tam, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi), the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:10) forbids making such an interruption.</i> - until he puts on the head <i>tefillin</i>. If he talks, it is considered to be a transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">since, by doing so, he obligates himself to recite a second blessing that would otherwise not be required. Reciting an unnecessary blessing violates the prohibition, "Do not take the name of God, your Lord, in vain" (Exodus 20:7 .<br>Based on Deuteronomy 20:8, the Sages explained that the Jewish army should be composed only of righteous men. Any sinners were excused from military service. Significantly, there are opinions which consider this transgression significant enough for a person to be included in this category (<i>Sotah</i> 44b).</i> [In such an instance,] one is required to recite the second blessing, "...concerning the mitzvah of <i>tefillin</i>," and then put on the head <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:9) requires that the person also repeat the blessing "...to put on <i>tefillin</i>" in this instance.

In contrast, the obligation to put the arm <i>tefillin</i> on first is derived from the Torah itself.

The time for wearing <i>tefillin</i> is the day and not the night, as [Exodus 13:10] states: "And you shall observe this statute in its appointed time, from day to day."

Shortly afterwards, he slipped and fell to his death. When the story became known, the Sages ordained that a person should bring his <i>tefillin</i> into a lavatory lest the story repeat itself.</i><br>What should he do?

At home, or in other places where one could keep the <i>tefillin</i> in a safe place, it is forbidden to wear <i>tefillin</i> in a lavatory (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 43:5).1. See Halachah 11, which prohibits putting on <i>tefillin</i> after sunset.2. As explained in Halachah 24, a container which is always used for <i>tefillin</i> or other sacred articles is considered as an accessory to the <i>tefillin</i> with no importance of its own. Thus, it is as if the <i>tefillin</i> are being held without any covering at all. Nevertheless, if it is a handbreadth in size, it is given halachic significance as an <i>ohel</i>. Hence, it is considered to be a separation between the <i>tefillin</i> and the lavatory.<br>Needless to say, these laws apply only when the person does not have a safe place where he can deposit his <i>tefillin</i>. If such a place is available, he may not bring <i>tefillin</i> into a lavatory (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).3. See Halachah 24, which forbids engaging in intercourse in a room which contains <i>tefillin</i> that are open.4. Thus, it is feared that they may have touched the genitalia (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 26b). Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 40:7), who prohibits a person from wearing <i>tefillin</i> if he has any traces of semen on his body. 5. This halachah is dependent on the description of a bathhouse in<i>Shabbat</i> 10a. There were three rooms: a waiting room, a dressing room, and the actual bathing room.6. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:3 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:5 explain that this applies even when no one there is actually naked. Those sources also state that these laws apply only in bathhouses which contain filth. In contrast, there are no restrictions against wearing <i>tefillin</i> in the bathing room of a mikveh if no people are standing there naked. Compare also to <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:3-4, 16.</i>
When does the above apply? In a permanent lavatory where drops [of urine] will not sprinkle upon him. In contrast, in a place that is temporarily being used as a lavatory, one should not enter, [holding <i>tefillin</i>] wound up in one's hand. Instead, one should remove them [outside the lavatory] and give them to a colleague to guard.<br>Urine cannot be expelled [without drops sprinkling] even in a permanent lavatory unless one squats. If [the floor is covered] with soft dust, [drops will not sprinkle] even when one stands. If the floor is hard, one should stand on an incline [and urinate], so that drops will not sprinkle on him.
When a person is wearing <i>tefillin</i> and must relieve himself in the evening, when there would be no time left in the day to put them on again after he finishes, he should not enter a lavatory, [holding them] rolled up in his clothes.<br>What should he do [instead]? He should remove them and place them in their container if it is a handbreadth in size, or in another container which is not specific for them even though it is not a handbreadth in size. He should hold the container in his hand when he enters the lavatory. Similarly, if he needs to relieve himself at night, he should place them in a container and enter the lavatory, holding the <i>tefillin</i> in his hand.
If a person forgot and entered a lavatory while wearing <i>tefillin</i>, he should cover them with his hand until he completes expelling the first issue of feces or urine, and then leave the lavatory, remove the <i>tefillin</i>, return, and complete relieving himself. Were one to interrupt in the midst of expelling the first outburst of feces or urine, he might become very dangerously ill.
If a person forgot and had intercourse while wearing <i>tefillin</i>, he should not hold either the straps or the compartments themselves until he washes his hands. [Then, he should] remove them. [This restriction was instituted] because hands are active.
[The following rules apply to] a person who enters a bathhouse: In the rooms where people stand clothed, it is permitted to put on <i>tefillin</i>. In the rooms where some of the people stand naked and some clothed, one need not remove one's <i>tefillin</i>, nor, at the outset, should one put <i>tefillin</i> on there. In the rooms where [everyone] stands naked, one should remove one's <i>tefillin</i> and, needless to say, one should not put them on.
A person should not walk in a cemetery<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">even if he is not within four cubits of a grave (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:1)</i> wearing his head <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Arm <i>tefillin</i>, however, need not be removed, for they can be worn under one's sleeve. As mentioned in Halachah 4, the two <i>tefillin</i> are two separate mitzvot, whose observance is not necessarily dependent on each other. One must be careful, however, to cover the straps of the arm <i>tefillin</i>, even those around one's hand and finger (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:3).</i> Even [outside a cemetery], a person should remove his<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">head</i> <i>tefillin</i> if he comes within four cubits of a corpse or a grave,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 17:5 states: "One who mocks the poor (רש) reproaches his Creator." <i>Berachot</i> 18a explains that the word רש can also refer to the dead, and states that performing mitzvot in the presence of a corpse or by his graveside would be, in a certain sense, mocking him, since he is unable to perform mitzvot. Accordingly, the Sages forbade Torah study, the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, and the performance of other mitzvot in these situations.</i> until he distances himself four cubits from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Beyond this distance, one is not considered to be in the actual presence of the corpse. If a cemetery is surrounded by a wall, one may wear <i>tefillin</i> outside the wall even within four cubits of a grave, because the wall constitutes a separation (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:1).</i><br>A person should not put on <i>tefillin</i> [when he is naked]. He must first cover his genitalia<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 2:3), it appears that, in addition to wearing a cloak over one's body, one must also cover one's genitalia before putting on <i>tefillin</i>.</i> and put on his clothes.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:3 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:5 associate this prohibition with the prohibition against standing naked in the presence of sacred texts.</i><br>A person who is carrying a load on his head should remove his head <i>tefillin</i> [and not put it on again] until he puts down his load.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 105b considers this a lack of respect for the <i>tefillin</i>.</i> It is even forbidden to wear a handkerchief<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">or any other article which is not a garment and is not usually worn on one's head (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 41:1)</i> around one's head when wearing <i>tefillin</i>.

Our Sages relate that the High Priest would wear his turban over the <i>tefillin</i> (<i>Zevachim</i> 19b), and the king would wear his crown above the <i>tefillin</i> (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 44a).</i>
When <i>tefillin</i> or a Torah scroll are in a room, it is forbidden to engage in sexual relations, unless they are removed or placed into a container, and that container placed into a second container<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These laws also apply with regard to sacred texts (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 40:4) and mezuzot (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 40:5).</i> which is not specific to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Covering the <i>tefillin</i>'s container with another garment is sufficient.

This practice was instituted since <i>tefillin</i> require "a clean body" (Halachah 15) and one cannot divert his attention from them (Halachah 14), and most people cannot meet these requirements (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 37:2).</i> for this is the mitzvah associated with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Note the questions in the <i>Pri Megadim</i> and the <i>Bi'ur Halachah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 37): Is the mitzvah of <i>tefillin</i> to wear them all day, or is the mitzvah to put <i>tefillin</i> on once each day, with the remaining time one wears them being merely the continuation of the mitzvah.</i> Among the praises conveyed upon Rav, the student of Rabbenu Hakadosh,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Though we find <i>Megillah</i> 28a conveying such praise on Rav Zeira, there is no passage in the Talmud which describes Rav in these terms.

Although it is a mitzvah to wear [<i>tefillin</i>] throughout the entire day, it is most important during prayer. Our Sages declared: "Whoever recites the <i>Shema</i> without <i>tefillin</i> is considered as if he is giving false testimony."<br>Whoever does not wear <i>tefillin</i> transgresses eight positive commandments, for in each of the four passages contained in the <i>tefillin</i> we are commanded to wear both head and arm <i>tefillin</i>. [The rewards for wearing <i>tefillin</i> are also great.] Whoever wears <i>tefillin</i> regularly will live long, as [implied by Isaiah 38:16]: "God is upon them, they shall live."

This perspective, however, is not accepted by other authorities, who explain that surely, the Rambam requires order within the passages. He gave the above example only because he felt that it was more important to emphasize that even if the passages themselves were written in order, if their order was reversed, the <i>mezuzah</i> is not acceptable.</i> - e.g., one wrote the passage [<i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>] before the passage [<i>Shema</i>] - it is not acceptable.

Therefore, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:27, the Rambam rules that they should not be saved from a fire on the Sabbath if the violation of even a Rabbinic transgression is involved (accepting the possibility that they have not become consecrated).

Indeed, a person who makes additions to the <i>mezuzah</i> in an attempt to increase its influence demonstrates that he is concerned with "his own benefit" and "the vanities of the world" and not with the fulfillment of God's mitzvah. Therefore, he deserves the Rambam's severe words of criticism. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 19.1. Our translation follows the standard text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions another version which states "at the beginning or the end of the line." That version parallels the apparent source for the halachah, <i>Menachot</i> 31b.2. This custom is also recorded by Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, and earlier, in the halachot of Rav Yehudai Gaon. It is not clear when this custom was begun.3. As mentioned in Halachah 2, a space is left at the beginning of the line so that the passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>, will be written in the <i>s'tumah</i> form.</i>
It is a mitzvah to write <i>al ha'aretz</i> on the final line [of a <i>mezuzah</i>], either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. It has become universally accepted custom for scribes to write [mezuzot] with 22 lines, with <i>al ha'aretz</i> at the beginning of the final line.<br>These are the letters that appear at the beginning of each line in order: <i>shema, י-ה-ו-ה, hadevarim, l'vanecha, uv'shochbicha, beyn, v'hayah, m'tzaveh, b'chol, yoreh, esev, pen, v'hishtachavitem, hashamayim, va'avad'tem, v'samtem, otam, otam, baderech, uvish'arecha, asher, al ha'aretz.</i>
When [a <i>mezuzah</i>] is folded,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states, the intent is that the <i>mezuzah</i> be rolled.

Before affixing it on the doorpost of the entrance, one should recite the blessing:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">as is done before the fulfillment of a positive commandment. This blessing should also be recited again when affixing a <i>mezuzah</i> which falls from the doorpost. There is a question whether a <i>mezuzah</i> should be recited when affixing it after removing it to have it checked (<i>Pitchei Teshuvah</i> 289:1).</i> "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to affix a <i>mezuzah</i>."<br>One<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:12-13, the Rambam states that when one affixes a <i>mezuzah</i> for a colleague, the blessing should conclude, "concerning the affixing of a <i>mezuzah</i>."<br>Although the verses which relate the command to affix a <i>mezuzah</i> state, "And you shall write...."</i> should not recite a blessing when writing [the <i>mezuzah</i>], because affixing it fulfills the mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">13 In the listing of the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 15), the Rambam also states that the mitzvah is to "affix a <i>mezuzah</i>."<br>With regard to the blessings, see <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:8, which states:<br>For every mitzvah whose performance fulfills one's obligation, one recites the blessing when one performs it. Whenever a mitzvah has a further commandment involved after its performance, one should not recite a blessing until one performs the latter commandment. For example, when one makes a sukkah, a lulav,... <i>tefillin</i>, or a <i>mezuzah</i>, one does not recite a blessing when one makes them.... When does one recite the blessing?

When a person frequently enters and leaves through an entrance between a synagogue and a house of study<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">which do not require a <i>mezuzah</i>, as mentioned in Halachah 6 above,</i> and his own house, that entrance requires a <i>mezuzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">because the fact that it is an entrance to one's own house is considered of predominant importance.</i><br>When there is an entrance between two houses,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">or more particularly, between two rooms in the same house</i> [the position of the <i>mezuzah</i>] is determined by the door-hinge.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This principle is called <i>heker tzir</i> (<i>Menachot</i> 33a).</i> The <i>mezuzah</i> is placed on the side on which the hinge can be seen.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the side to which the door opens. This halachah is very significant with regard to contemporary homes, which possess many rooms, and it is necessary to determine the side of the entrance on which the <i>mezuzah</i> should be placed. The Rambam explains that this is determined by the direction to which the door opens: The <i>mezuzah</i> is placed on the right side of the entrance to the room to which the door opens.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 289:3) quotes the Rambam's decision. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 289:4 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 289:6 mention two other factors:a) The order in which one enters the rooms from the entrance to the house. The room which is closer to the entrance to the house is considered as leading to the room which is further removed, and the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed on the right side of the entrance to the latter room;<br>b) The importance of the rooms. The room which is less important is considered as leading into the room which is more important, and the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed on the right side of the entrance to the latter room.These principles are also significant if an entrance has no doors or has sliding doors. The above concepts apply only to rooms within a house. If the door leads to the public thoroughfare, the <i>mezuzah</i> is always placed on the right-hand side as one enters the house.</i>

A person must show great care in [the observance of the mitzvah of] <i>mezuzah</i>, because it is an obligation which is constantly incumbent upon everyone.<br>[Through its observance,] whenever a person enters or leaves [the house], he will encounter the unity of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and remember his love for Him. Thus, he will awake from his sleep and his obsession with the vanities of time, and recognize that there is nothing which lasts for eternity except the knowledge of the Creator of the world. This will motivate him to regain full awareness and follow the paths of the upright.<br>Whoever wears <i>tefillin</i> on his head and arm, wears <i>tzitzit</i> on his garment, and has a <i>mezuzah</i> on his entrance, can be assured that he will not sin, because he has many who will remind him.

There are two forms for a passage<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah is divided into 669 passages, each containing one or more verses.

Accordingly, today, a scribe should write a scroll based on a Torah scroll that is accepted as correct, and not from this list.</i>

Chapter 9

A Torah scroll should not be written in a way which causes its length to exceed its circumference, or its circumference to exceed its length.<br>What is the appropriate length? When the scroll is written on <i>g'vil</i>, six handbreadths - i.e., 24 thumbbreadths. When the scroll is written on <i>k'laf</i>, it may be more or less, provided that the length is equal to the circumference. If one wrote a scroll on <i>g'vil</i> less than six handbreadths long and concentrated one's writing, or [wrote a scroll] more than six handbreadths long and spread out one's writing, if the length is equal to the circumference, it has been written in the proper manner.
The following margins should be left [on each column]: Below the column: four thumbbreadths; above the column: three thumbbreadths; and between each column: two thumbbreadths.<br>[To allow for these margins,] one should leave an additional thumbbreadth at the beginning and the end of each portion of parchment and room to sew the parchments together. Thus, when one sews all the portions of parchment together, there will be two thumbbreadths between each column throughout the entire scroll.<br>One should also leave an extra portion of parchment at the beginning and the end of the scroll, to wind around its staves.<br>All these measures are part of [performing] the mitzvah [in the optimum manner]. If one decreased or increased any of them, [the scroll] is not disqualified.
How should a person structure the scroll [he is writing] so that its length will be equal to its circumference? He should begin by making equal portions of parchment, each having a standard width of six handbreadths.<br>Afterwards, he should wind the parchments, each in the same manner, making one tight coil. He should continue adding to the coil, winding the parchments tightly until the circumference of the coil is six handbreadths, the width of the parchment. He should measure with a red cord that [is long enough] to surround the entire coil.
Afterwards, one should make a measuring rod, forty or fifty thumbbreadths long. Each thumbbreadth on the rod should be divided into halves, thirds, and quarters, so that it will be possible to have exact measurements, including even half and quarter thumbbreadths.<br>One should measure each piece of parchment with this rod to determine its length in thumbbreadths. In this manner, one can calculate the length in thumbbreadths of the entire coil.
Afterwards, one should take two or three other parchments [as an experiment] to check the size of one's writing. One should write a [sample] column.<br>It is obvious that the length of the column [used for the writing] will be seventeen thumbbreadths, since three thumbbreadths are left for a margin above the column and four thumbbreadths are left for a margin below. The width of the column, however, varies according to the thickness of one's writing. Similarly, the number of lines within each column varies according to the writing. The space of a line should be left between each two lines.
After one writes the experimental column as one desires, one should measure the column with the rod. Then one should add the two thumbbreadths to be left between columns and calculate the number of columns one will have in the entire coil [should one continue] using the same [size] writing.<br>Once one knows the number of columns [for which there is space in the coil], one should calculate according to the scroll from which one is writing whether the entire Torah will be able to be contained in the number of columns there are in the coil based on this [size] writing.<br>If the entire Torah can be contained within this number of columns, [the scroll] will be [written in the] desired [fashion]. If, according to one's calculations, there are more columns than necessary to contain the Torah, one should write with a broader script, so that fewer columns will be included. One should write another [experimental] column [and recalculate until the calculations are resolved].<br>If, according to one's calculations, there are fewer columns than necessary to contain the Torah, one should write with a thinner script, so that more columns will be included. One should write another [experimental] column and recalculate until the calculations are resolved.
After one knows the width of the column and the measure of one's writing, one takes the coil [of parchment] and divides each parchment into columns according to the [size of the] column with which one experimented and made the [above] calculation, ruling each column. When more than three or four fingerbreadths remain after the final column [which fits onto] the portion of parchment, one should leave only a thumbbreadth and the space necessary to sew it and cut off the rest.<br>One need not worry that, ultimately, additional parchments will have to be added to the coil to compensate for the portions which were cut off. This is not a factor of circumstance, because the writing will cause [the size of the scroll] to be extended [only] according to the number of columns [originally calculated].
Similarly, if one desires to make the width of the scroll more than six [thumbbreadths] or less than six [thumbbreadths], one should follow similar calculations. Thus, the length of the scroll will be equal to the circumference, neither less nor more, provided one does not err in his calculations.
The thumbbreadth mentioned in all these calculations - and in all other Torah measurements - refers to the width of a normal person's thumb. We have calculated this measure precisely and found it to be equal to the width of seven average barley-corns when placed next to each other in a cramped manner. This is equivalent to the length of two barley-corns amply spaced apart.<br>Whenever the term "handbreadth" is mentioned, it refers to four of these thumbbreadths. Whenever the term cubit is mentioned, it refers to six handbreadths.
In the Torah scroll which I wrote, the width of each column was four thumbbreadths [with the exception of the] columns on which the Song of the Red Sea and the song <i>Ha'azinu</i> were written; they were six thumbbreadths wide. There were 51 lines in each column and 226 columns in the entire scroll. [In its entirety,] the scroll was approximately 1366 thumbbreadths long.
The six thumbbreadths beyond the number that one would arrive at by calculation were used for the margin of the scroll left at the beginning and the end. I wrote the scroll from parchment made from ram skin.<br>Should one desire to write a scroll using these measurements or deviating from them only slightly - i.e., adding or subtracting two or three columns, there is no necessity to trouble oneself with calculations; without any difficulty one will have a scroll whose length is equal to its circumference.
One should not write fewer than three columns on a piece of parchment, nor [should one write] more than eight columns. If one has a piece of parchment large enough to contain nine columns, one should divide it in two, one portion containing five columns, and one portion four columns.<br>When does the above apply? At the beginning of the scroll or in the middle. At the end of the scroll, however, even if there is one verse in one column, that column may be written on a separate piece of parchment and sewn together with the other parchments.
When one sews the parchments together, one should use only sinews from a kosher species of animal or beast. [Sinews taken from] animals which died without being ritually slaughtered or which were killed by wild beasts [are, nevertheless, acceptable].<br>This is a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai. Therefore, if one did not sew them with sinews, or used sinews from a non-kosher animal, the scroll is unacceptable until one removes the threads and sews them again.
When sewing all the pieces of parchment together, one should not sew the entire length of the parchment. Rather, one should leave a certain portion unsewn on both the top and bottom of the parchment, so that the parchment will not tear in the middle when the Torah is rolled.<br>Two staves of wood should be made for a [Torah scroll], one at the beginning and one at the end. One should sew the parchment left over at the beginning and the end [of the scrolls] to these staves with sinews, so that it can be rolled around [these staves]. Space should be left between the staves and the columns of writing.
When a tear in a Torah scroll is contained within two lines, [it is sufficient to] sew [the tear]. If it [extends to] three [or more], [it] should not be sewn.<br>When does the above apply? With regard to an old Torah scroll which one cannot recognize as having been processed with gallnut juice. If, however, one can recognize that the parchment was processed with gallnut juice, one may sew it, even if the tear extends to three [lines]. Similarly, [if there is a tear] between columns or between words, one may sew it.<br>All these tears may be sewn only with the sinews which are used to sew the parchments together. When sewing, one must be careful that a single letter is not omitted or has its form distorted.

Chapter 10

Thus, it can be concluded that there are twenty factors that<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">each in its own right - can disqualify a Torah scroll. If a scroll contains one of these factors, it does not have the sanctity of a Torah scroll, but rather is considered like a chumash used to teach children - i.e., although it is still considered to be a sacred text, it does not have the same degree of holiness as a Torah scroll. (See also Chapter 7, Halachah 14, and <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 11:14.)</i> - each in its own right - can disqualify a Torah scroll. If a scroll contains one of these factors, it does not have the sanctity of a Torah scroll, but rather is considered like a <i>chumash</i> used to teach children.

It is permissible to place a Torah scroll on another Torah scroll and, needless to say, upon <i>chumashim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This applies to scrolls on which between one and four of the five books of the Torah are written, and not to printed texts.</i> <i>Chumashim</i> may be placed upon books of the Prophets or of the Sacred Writings.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Books of the Prophets and the Sacred Writings may be placed upon each other without distinction.</i> In contrast, books of the Prophets or the Sacred Writings may not be placed on <i>chumashim</i>, nor may <i>chumashim</i> be placed on Torah scrolls.<br>All sacred writings, even texts of Torah law and allegories, may not be thrown.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Eruvin</i> 98a and <i>Soferim</i> 3:12, it would appear that the meaning of this statement is that one should hand sacred texts to a colleague rather than throw them.

Therefore, they are not considered to be a container.

There are authorities who interpret the Talmud's statement to mean that one should not hold a Torah scroll while the scroll is uncovered. See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 147:1). Note also the <i>Noda BiYhudah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i>, Responsum 7), who discusses the Rambam's perspective on this law.

Any impure person, even [a woman in] a <i>niddah</i> state or a gentile, may hold a Torah scroll and read it.

A person who was journeying from one place to another with a Torah scroll should not place the Torah scroll in a sack, load it on a donkey, and then ride on [the beast]. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, it is permissible. If there is no danger, he should carry it in his bosom while riding the animal, and journey [onward].<br>Anyone who sits before a Torah scroll should sit with respect, awe, and fear, because [the Torah] is a faithful testimony [of the covenant between God and the Jews] for all the inhabitants of the earth, as [Deuteronomy 31:26] states: "And it will be as a testimony for you."<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The proof-text chosen by the Rambam is somewhat difficult. It states that the Torah will be "testimony for you," while previously he spoke of its being "testimony for all the inhabitants of the earth." This difficulty can be resolved by interpreting the proof-text, "It will be testimony about you" - i.e., the Torah will be testimony to all the inhabitants of the world that an essential bond exists between God and the Jewish people. The awareness that the Torah communicates this concept should naturally, without effort, bring a person to "sit with respect, awe, and fear" in the presence of a Torah scroll (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Shavuot 5747).</i><br>A person must honor a Torah scroll [to the full extent] of his potential.
