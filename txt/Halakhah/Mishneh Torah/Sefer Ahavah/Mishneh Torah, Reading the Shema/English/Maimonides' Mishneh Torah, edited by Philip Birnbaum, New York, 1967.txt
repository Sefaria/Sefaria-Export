Mishneh Torah, Reading the Shema



Chapter 1




Anyone reciting the <i>Shema</i> inserts a sentence between the first verse and the rest of the biblical passage, saying in a low tone: "Blessed be the name of his glorious majesty forever and ever." Then he goes on to say: "You shall love the Lord your God…" to the end. Why is the <i>Shema</i> recited in this manner? We have it on tradition that when our father Jacob was about to die in Egypt, he gathered his sons about him and exhorted them concerning the Oneness of God and the uprightness of Abraham and Isaac who followed the way of God. Then he asked them, saying: "My sons, is there one among you with a defect, who is not with me in believing in One God?" They all replied: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One." They meant to say: "Israel our father, hear our confession of faith: the Lord is our God, the Lord is One." The aged patriarch uttered thereupon: "Blessed be the name of his glorious majesty forever and ever." Hence it is a custom in Israel to insert the praise of patriarch Israel immediately after the first verse of the <i>Shema</i>.

Chapter 2








— — One should recite the <i>Shema</i> audibly enough for himself to hear; if he has not done so, he has not fulfilled his obligation. He should enunciate the letters distinctly; if he has not done so, he has done his duty nevertheless.
How should one enunciate the letters clearly?— — One should pause between words which are likely to be jumbled together, between two identical letters with which one word ends and the immediately following one begins, as in the phrase <i>b'khol l'vavkha</i>. A pause should be made after <i>b'khol</i> before reading the word <i>l'vavkha</i>. Similarly, <i>va'avadtem m'herah, ha-kanaf p'thil</i>. So too, the <i>zayin</i> in <i>tizkeru</i> should be pronounced distinctly. One should draw out the <i>da-leth</i> in <i>eḥad</i> long enough to acclaim God as King in heaven and on earth, and toward the four cardinal points of the compass. One must not slur over the <i>ḥeth</i> in <i>eḥad</i>, lest the word might sound <i>ee ḥad</i> (not one).
A person may recite the <i>Shema</i> in any language he knows. He must carefully avoid blunders in whatever language he happens to recite the <i>Shema</i>, and must try to be as accurate in that language as he would have to be in the sacred tongue.
