During the summer one should say in the second blessing, "great is Your power to save, who causes the dew to fall, You sustain the living with compassionate love, etc."  And in the ninth blessing, in this formula, "Bless us Lord, our God with all of the work of our hands and bless our years with favorable dew, blessing and generosity as in the good years.  Blessed are You, who blesses the years." ...
On the evening following the Sabbath or Yom Kippur or a festival, recite the fourth blessing following this formula. You favor humans with knowledge and teach people wisdom.  You distinguish between holy and profane, between light and darkness, between Israel and the [other] nations, between the seventh day  and the six days of work, just as you distinguished between holy and profane, this redeem us and save us from all types of destruction and all form of calamity that come into the work and guard us from everything.  Graciously give us from you....etc.
On new months and on the intermediate days of festivals add to the 17th blessing in the evening, morning and afternoon and recite it according the this formula.

On a fast day, an individual recites the sixteenth blessing according to this formula. Hear our voice, Lord our God, have pity and mercy on us and receive in mercy and in favor our prayers before you.  Do not cause us to return empty-handed, our King.  Answer us, our Father, answer us on our fast day because in this great distress we do not turn your face from us and do not block your ears from hearing our pleas and may our salvation be soon.  Before we call, you answer, we speak and you listen as it is said, "And it will be that before they call, I will answer (Isaiah 65:23)." They also say, "And I will hear because you hear the prayer of of every mouth."  Blessed are You, Adonai, who hears prayer.  And the representative of the community recites this blessing on behalf of himself.  After the seventh blessing, he says "Answer us, etc." until "because you answer at a time of trouble, redeem and rescue us at every time of trouble and distress.  Blessed are You, Lord  who answers at times of trouble."
On the ninth of Av, recite the fourteenth blessing according to this formula. Have mercy Lord on us and on Israel Your people and on Jerusalem Your city, the city of mourning, destruction and desolation given over to the hand of strangers.  She sits, her head uncovered like a barren woman that has not given birth.  Legions have devoured her and idolators have inherited her and given the carcasses of Your servants as food to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth.  Therefore Zion weeps bitterly and Jerusalem raises her voice.  My heart, my heart grieves for their slain ones; I am in anguish, I am in anguish for those they killed.  See her desolation and comfort her because with fire You consumed it and with  fire You will rebuild it, as it is written, "And I myself will be, says the Lord, a wall of fire around it and will be its glory within (Zechariah 2:9)."  Blessed are You, Lord, who rebuilds Jerusalem.  
On Purim, recite the eighteenth blessing according to this formula. We gratefully acknowledge that You are the Lord our God...for our lives which are handed over into your hands and for our souls which are entrusted to You for Your miracles that are with us every day and Your wonders  that are with us at all times, etc.  For the miracles  and for the mighty deeds and for the salvations, etc. And for all of these, Lord, our God, we gratefully acknowledge You, the goodness which does not cease, etc.
On Chanukah recite this blessing according to this formula. We gratefully acknowledge You, etc. until and for Your wonders that are with us at all times, evening, morning and afternoon...for the miracles, etc. until and then Your children entered, etc.
The agent of the community always blesses the third blessing according to this formula. We sanctify you and we declare you King and three times  daily we declare Your holiness as it says by the hand of Your prophet, "And they turned one to the other and said, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole earth is filled with His Glory (Isaiah 6)." His Glory and His Greatness fill the world and His servants ask, 'where is the place of His Glory?'  To revere him, those facing praise and say, "Blessed is the glory of God from His place (Ezekiel 3)."  From Your place, our King, appear and rule  over us because  we wait for You.  When will You rule  in Zion?  In our lives and in our day may you dwell, be sanctified and be exalted in the midst of Jerusalem, Your city,  from generation to generation forever.  May our eyes see the kingdom of your strength, as it is said in Your holy writings by the hand of David your righteous anointed one, "The Lord will reign forever, Your God O Zion, from generation to generation, Halleluyah(Psalm 146)!"  From generation to generation we will declare Your greatness and from eternity to eternity proclaim Your holiness; Your praise, our God, shall not cease from our lips because You, God, are a great and holy King.  Blessed are You, Lord, the holy God.  At the time when the communal agent says within this blessing, "And one turned to the other," all the people respond, " Holy, holy, holy, etc."  And when he says, "Where is the place of Your glory?" All of the people respond, "They praise and say, blessed, etc."  And when he says, "In our lives and in our days," all the people respond, "Amen."  And when he says, " By the hand of David, Your righteous anointed one," all the people respond, "The Lord will reign forever."  And all of these, the words that the congregation responds, he recites with them and does not raise his voice at the time that they respond with him, one for the individual and one for the communal agent.  During the ten days from Rosh Hashanah until Yom Kippur, one says at the end of this blessing, as it is said, the Lord of Hosts is exalted by justice and the holy God is sanctified through righteousness.  Blessed are you, Lord, the Holy King. 

The prayer leader always says Kaddish before and after each prayer. And after he says the order of the day each day, at any time that he should say the order of the day, he should supplicate a little and [then] say Kaddish. And when he finishes reading from the Torah, and at any time that he supplicates with words of supplication, he should say Kaddish when he finshes his supplications. 
<b>The text of Kaddish</b>
May His great name be exalted and sanctified in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His kingdom, spring forth His redemption, bring His Messiah near and redeem His people. In your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future, and say, Amen. May His great Name be blessed for ever and ever. Blessed. etc. At the time that the prayer leader says, "May His great name be exalted and sanctified," all of the people say, "Amen." And when he first says, "And say, Amen," all of the people answer, "Amen. May His great Name be blessed for ever and ever." And it is a commandment of the first Sages to answer, "Amen. May His great Name be blessed for ever and ever," with all of a person's strength. And when he says, "Blessed [etc.]," all the people answer, "Amen." And when he says, "Blessed be He," all the people answer, "Amen." And when he says at the end, "And say, Amen," all the people answer, "Amen." And they answer according to this order for every kaddish. [Concerning] the last kaddish after every kaddish that the prayer leader says after he finishes the prayer, such that he does not say anything after it, but all the people rather hear it and leave, people have the practice of adding this formula at its end: May You accept the prayers and render effective the requests and the prayers and requests of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. May there be abundant peace, assistance and salvation from the Heavens upon you and upon us and upon the congregation of Israel, and say, Amen. He Who makes peace in His high heavens, may He, in His mercy, make peace for us and for all Israel. Amen. The Rabbis' Kaddish: Whenever ten or more Jews finish occupying themselves with study of the Oral Torah - even of Midrash or Aggadah (non-legal sections) - one of them says Kaddish according to this formula: May His great name be exalted and sanctified who in the future will refresh the world, to bring the dead to life, to redeem the living, to build the city of Jerusalem, to complete the holy sanctuary, to uproot the foreign service from the land (of Israel) and to place the service of the Heavens in its place, with its splendor and its uniqueness, etc. [It then concludes:] and the consolations that we say in this world, and say, Amen. Upon the rabbis, and upon their disciples, and upon the disciples of their disciples who occupy themselves with Torah in this place and in every place; may there be favor, kindness, compassion, assistance and ease for them and for you from before their Father who is in the heavens, and say Amen. May there be peace, etc. And this is what is called the Rabbis' Kaddish.
