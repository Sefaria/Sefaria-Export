Mishneh Torah, Admission into the Sanctuary



Chapter 1

Whenever a priest who is fit to perform Temple service<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This excludes a <i>challal</i>, a son born to a priest from a forbidden relationship, and a priest who has a disqualifying physical blemish. They are not liable for this severe punishment.</i> drinks wine, he is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 73) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 152) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. Note also the parallels in <i>Hilchot Nesiat Kapayim</i> 15:4.</i> to enter the area of the Altar or [proceed] beyond there.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., ascends the steps to the Temple building or enters that structure. See also Halachah 15 and notes.</i> If he entered [that area]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If he entered this area while intoxicated, but did not perform service, he is only liable for lashes, as stated in Halachah 15. Similar concepts apply if he drank intoxicating beverages while in this area (Halachah 16).</i> and performed service,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The services for which he is liable are described in Chapter 9, Halachah 2.</i> his service is invalid and he is liable for death at the hand of heaven, as [Leviticus 10:9] states: "[Do not drink intoxicating wine...] so that you do not die."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He may, however, be punished by a mortal court with lashes and thus freed from the more severe spiritual punishment. See <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 19:2.</i><br>The above applies provided one drinks a <i>revi'it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A liquid measure equal to 86 cc. according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 150 cc. according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>. [It is reputed that the wines of the Talmudic era were very strong and drinking even this small amount could cause intoxication.]</i> of undiluted wine at one time, provided the wine is over 40 days old.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">And thus has had time to ferment and reach an alcoholic content sufficient enough to cause intoxication.</i> If, however, one drank less than a <i>revi'it</i> of wine, one drank a <i>revi'it</i> intermittently,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since he paused while drinking it, its intoxicating effect will be less.</i> one mixed it with water,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Even if one drank the entire quantity, since it was diluted, it will have a lesser effect.</i> or one drank even more than a <i>revi'it</i> of wine from the vat, i.e., within 40 days of its being brought into being,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since its alcoholic content will not be that high, one is not liable. There is, nevertheless, a prohibition against serving in the Temple even when having drunk such wine (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> he is exempt and his service is not profaned. If he drank more than a <i>revi'it</i> of wine, even though it was diluted and even though he drank it intermittently, he is liable for death and his service is invalidated.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that although serving in the Temple in such a condition is forbidden, the priest is not liable for such severe punishment, nor is his service disqualified. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offer interpretations of <i>Keritot</i> 13b that substantiate the Rambam's position.</i>
If a person is intoxicated from beverages other than wine, he is forbidden to enter the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">One of the opinions in <i>Keritot</i> 13b derives this concept from the literal meaning of Leviticus 10:9, translated above as: "Do not drink intoxicating wine," i.e., it interprets the term <i>veseicher</i> according to its simple meaning, i.e., an alcoholic beverage other than wine. There is another opinion in that source that interprets <i>veseicher</i> as an adjective (which we have translated as "intoxicating") describing the manner in which one drinks wine. Apparently, the Rambam does not see the two interpretations as mutually exclusive. See <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. See also Halachah 15.</i> If he enters and performs service while intoxicated from other beverages - even if he is intoxicated from milk or figs - he is liable for lashes, but his service is valid, for one is liable for death only when drinking wine at the time of service and one does not invalidate service unless he is intoxicated from wine.
Just as a priest is forbidden to enter the Temple while intoxicated, so too, it is forbidden for any person, whether priest or Israelite, to render a halachic ruling when he is intoxicated.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, where the Rambam links the two prohibitions in the same negative commandment. One is not, however, liable for death for delivering a ruling while intoxicated. Note the discussion of this matter by the Ramban and <i>Megilat Esther</i> in their glosses to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>.</i> Even if he ate dates or drank milk and his mind became somewhat confused, he should not issue a ruling, as [the above passage (<i>ibid.</i>:11)] continues: "And to give instruction to the children of Israel." If he gave a ruling concerning a matter that is explicitly stated in the Torah to the extent that it is known by the Sadducees, he is permitted. For example, he ruled that a <i>sheretz</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">One of the eight forbidden teeming animals mentioned in Leviticus 11:29-30. A frog is not one of those animals.</i> is impure and a frog is pure; [he ruled that] blood is forbidden, or the like.
It is permitted for a person who is intoxicated to teach Torah, even Torah law and the interpretation of verses, provided he does not deliver a ruling.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a directive for actual practice.</i> If he was a sage who delivers rulings on a regular basis, he should not teach, for his teaching constitutes the delivery of a ruling.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 7:5) which quotes an opinion stating that it is permitted to rule in cases involving financial law when slightly intoxicated.</i>
When a person drank precisely a <i>revi'it</i> and it was diluted with the slightest amount of water, he slept a bit, or he walked a <i>mil</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A Talmudic measure equivalent to a kilometer. If he rode rather than walked, he must ride three <i>mil</i> (<i>Eruvin</i> 64b).</i> the effects of the wine will have worn off and he is permitted to serve [in the Temple]. If, however, he drank more than a <i>revi'it</i> even if it was diluted, sleeping slightly or journeying adds to his drunkenness. Depending on how intoxicated he was, he must wait until there is no trace of his drunkenness whatsoever.
The men of the priestly watch<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Who serve in the Temple that week. See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:3, 11.</i> are permitted to drink wine at night, but not during the day, during the week [they serve in the Temple]. Even the members of the other clans<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in that source, on each particular day, there was a clan whose members would perform the Temple service for that day.</i> who were not scheduled to work on a particular day [are forbidden], lest the Temple service overburden the members of the clan who serve that day and they require other members of the watch to help them.<br>The members of the clan of a particular day are forbidden to drink both during the day and night of that day, lest they drink at night and arise to their service in the morning without the effects of the wine having worn off.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that the intent of <i>Ta'anit</i> 17a (the Rambam's source) is not the night before the priests serve in the Temple, but the night afterwards. They are forbidden because it is possible that they will have to continue offering the limbs and fat-tails of the animals at night if they were not able to offer them during the day. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's interpretation, explaining that there is no need to prohibit the priests from drinking wine the entire night for this reason. It is sufficient that they be restrained until these limbs have been offered.</i>
Whenever a priest knows the watch from which he descends and the clan from which he descends, and he knows the day on which the members of his clan were scheduled to serve [in the Temple], he is forbidden to drink wine that entire day.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Were it not for the reason mentioned at the conclusion of the halachah, this law would apply even in the present era. This is a decree, enacted lest the Temple be rebuilt and the priests be required to serve at their appointed time.</i> If one knows from which watch he is descended, but does not know his clan, he is forbidden to drink wine the entire week during which his clan worked.<br>If [a priest] does not know [the identity of] his watch or his clan, the law would dictate that he should never be allowed to drink wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Lest he be drinking on a day forbidden for him.</i> Nevertheless, his difficulty<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his lack of knowledge of his watch and clan.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam with regard to the reason why there is no decree against the priests drinking wine in the present age. He rejects the Rambam's view, because with Mashiach's coming, the lineage of the priests will be established according to the spirit of prophecy (see <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 12:3) and the priests will immediately be called upon to begin their service in the Temple. Instead, the rationale is that because of the length of the exile, we do not expect that the Temple will be built instantaneously. [This is also the view of Rashi (<i>Ta'anit</i> 17a)]. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's view, noting that according to the Rambam, we may offer sacrifices even if the Temple is not rebuilt (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:15) and furthermore, the establishment of the priest's lineage even through the spirit of prophecy will not take only one day.</i> leads to his solution and he is permitted to drink wine at all times, for he is not allowed to serve [in the Temple] until his clan and watch are established.
A priest who lets his hair grow long<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 11 for a definition of this term.</i> is forbidden to enter the area of the Altar or [proceed] beyond there.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 163) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 149) includes this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. Note the objections of the Ramban to the inclusion of this charge as one of the mitzvot and the resolutions offered by <i>Megilat Esther</i> in their glosses to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>.</i> If he enters this area and performs service,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The law that applies if he does not perform service is explained in Halachah 15.</i> he is liable for death at the hand of Heaven like an intoxicated [priest] who serves,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 1.</i> as [indicated by Ezekiel 44:20-21]: "None of the priests shall drink wine. They shall not shave their heads, nor allow their hair to grow long."<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The prooftext for this prohibition from the Torah (Leviticus 10:6 , "Do not let [the hair of] your heads grow long," is not sufficient, because that could be interpreted as merely granting license for Aaron's sons to conduct themselves in this manner. Other mourners must rend their garments and let their hair grow and they were not required to. The verse from Ezekiel teaches that the charge applies at all times and is not specific to that situation (<i>Kessef Mishneh; Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>).</i> Just as [priests who serve] intoxicated from wine are liable to die, so too, those who allow their hair to grow long are liable to die.
[Priests who] let their hair grow long do not disqualify their service. Even though they are obligated to die, their service is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the equation of their service to that of intoxicated priests is not complete.<br>The Rambam's view is not accepted by all authorities. There are some who maintain that such a priest's service is also disqualified. See the Ramban's gloss to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>.</i>
Just as the priests are not warned against drinking wine except at the time they enter the Temple, so too, they are forbidden to grow their hair long only at the time they enter the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs, and from the verse in Ezekiel cited above understands that all priests are prohibited against growing their hair long and must take haircuts once in 30 days. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's position. See the following halachah and notes.</i><br>To whom does the above apply? To an ordinary priest. A High Priest, by contrast, is forbidden to let his hair grow long and rend his garments forever,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 5:6 where the Rambam explains the restrictions incumbent on the High Priest in greater detail. As he states there, these prohibitions apply to a High Priest even outside of the Temple and even when he is not in mourning.</i> for he should be in the Temple at all times.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i> 5:7.</i> Therefore with regard to him, [Leviticus 21:10] states: "He should not let [the hair of] his head grow long, nor should he rend his garments."
What is meant by growing one's hair long? [Leaving it uncut for] 30 days like a Nazirite, concerning whom [Numbers 6:5] states: "He shall let the mane of the hair of his head grow long" and a nazirite vow is not less than 30 days.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Nizirut</i> 3:2. Thus we can assume that growing one's hair long encompasses a 30 day period.</i> Therefore an ordinary priest who serves [in the Temple] must cut his hair every 30 days.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is that if a priest does not desire to serve, he is not required to cut his hair (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
The priests of the watch [serving in the Temple that week] are forbidden to cut their hair and launder their garments during that week,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This does not refer to the priestly garments, for the priestly garments are not washed (<i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 8:5). Instead, the intent is the priest's personal garments. As a mark of respect, he should ascend to the Temple in freshly laundered clothes (<i>Yeri'ot Shlomo</i>).</i> so that they will not enter the Temple when they are unkempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Note a parallel decree in <i>Hilchot Shivitat Yom Tov</i> 7:19. See also <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 6:11.</i> Instead, they should cut their hair, wash, and do their laundry before coming [to the Temple].
When a priest's watch is concluded in the midst of a festival, he is permitted to cut his hair in the midst of the festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Although doing so is usually forbidden, as stated in <i>Hilchot Shivitat Yom Tov, loc. cit.</i> Here leniency was granted, because he is considered to have been held back from cutting his hair before the festival by forces beyond his</i> If, however, his watch concludes on the day preceding a festival, he should cut his hair only on that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">And not during the festival.</i>
The laws [applying to a priest who enters the Temple with] torn garments are the same as those [applying to one with] long hair, as [Leviticus 10:6] states: "Do not let [the hair on] your heads grow long or rend your garments lest you die."<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 164) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 150) includes this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. In this instance as well, the Ramban objects to the inclusion of this charge as one of the 613 mitzvot.</i> Thus if [a priest] served with torn garments, he is liable for death at the hand of Heaven although his service is valid and was not profaned.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling appears in direct contradiction to <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 8:4 where the Rambam writes: "If [the priestly garments] were muddy, torn, longer than his appropriate measure... and a priest performed service while wearing them, his service is invalid." Among the resolutions offered is that in <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i>, the Rambam is speaking about clothes that remain torn (therefore, even after the fact, the service is invalid), while here he was speaking about torn garments that were mended. As the Radbaz explains, here the Rambam is speaking about a tear like the tear made when one rends his garments in mourning (which can be mended) as indicated in the following halachah, and there, he is speaking about a garment that was torn in many places.</i>
It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This expression indicates a conclusion which the Rambam reached through the process of deduction and not derived from any specific source.</i> that any priest who is fit to serve who enters the area of the altar or [proceeds] beyond there<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad agrees that this law applies to a priest that ascends the altar in these unkept states, but differs with regard to a priest who proceeds further and ascend the steps of the Temple. He maintains that entering that area in these unkept states is forbidden only according to Rabbinic Law. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offers an explanation that justifies the Rambam's ruling.</i> while intoxicated due to wine, drunk due to other alcoholic beverages, with long hair, or with torn garments as one tears because of a person's death, he is liable for lashes, even if he did not perform service. [The rationale is that] he is fit for service and entered [the Temple] at the time of service in such an unkept manner although he was warned not to enter.
The laws that apply to someone who enters beyond the altar and the laws that apply to ones who depart from there are the same. What is implied? One drank<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as a conscious transgression.</i> a <i>revi'it</i> of wine between the <i>Ulam</i> and the altar or tore his garments there and departed, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad offers a different interpretation of the Rambam's source, the <i>Sifra</i> to <i>Parshat Shemini</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others offer support for the Rambam's interpretation.</i> Similarly, if he performed service as he departed, he is liable for death.
Similarly, it is forbidden for any person, whether a priest or an Israelite, to enter the entire Temple area, from the Courtyard of the Israelites and onward<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>, ch. 7, the other areas of the Temple Mount have a lesser degree of holiness.</i> when he is intoxicated from wine, drunk [from other beverages], with unkept long hair or with torn garments. Although there is no explicit warning [against this in the Torah], it is not a sign of honor or reverence<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.</i>, which speaks of the command to fear the Temple.</i> to the great and holy house to enter it unkept. If, however, an Israelite<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Or a Levite as will be explained.</i> lets his hair grow until it is formed into a weave and it was not unkept, he is permitted to enter the Courtyard of the Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rambam LeAm</i> gives the example of the prophet Samuel who was a Nazirite and hence, allowed his hair to grow long. Nevertheless, he combed it until it was attractive and hence, he was allowed to remain in the Sanctuary of Shiloh.</i>

Chapter 2

The High Priest enters the Holy of Holies each year only on Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Halachah 3.</i> An ordinary priest may enter the Sanctuary for service every day.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to offer incense, kindle the <i>menorah</i>, or to bow.</i>
The priests were all<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to its simple meaning, the prooftext cited below refers only to Aaron. Nevertheless, through the Biblical exegesis, the <i>Sifra</i> interprets it as referring to all priests (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> warned not to enter the Sanctuary or the Holy of Holies when they are not in the midst of the service,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 68) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 184) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam explains that this mitzvah is an expression of honor and reverence toward the Temple.</i> as [Leviticus 16:2] states: "He shall not come to the Holy Chamber at all time" - this refers to the Holy of Holies. "...Within the curtain" - this warns [the priests against unwarranted entry] into the entire Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's interpretation of the verse, for seemingly, "within the curtain" refers to the Holy of Holies. On the surface, the opposite would be more appropriate: "The Holy Chamber" could be interpreted as referring to the entire Temple and "within the curtain" to the Holy of Holies. He explains the verse as follows: Were the verse to have mentioned "the Holy Chamber" alone, we would have thought that it refers only to the Holy of Holies and not to the Temple at large. Since, however, the verse adds "within the curtain," we understand that it refers to the Holy of Holies" and "the Holy Chamber" refers to the entire Sanctuary.<br>There is, however, a difference in the punishments for which one is liable for the violation of the two aspects of this commandment, as the Rambam states in Halachah 4.</i>
A priest - whether an ordinary priest or a High Priest - who enters the Holy of Holies on any of the other days of the year, or a High Priest who enters there on Yom Kippur outside the time of service, he is liable for death at the hand of heaven, as [<i>ibid.</i>] states: "And he shall not die."<br>How many times does he enter on Yom Kippur? Four, as will be explained in the appropriate place.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i>, ch. 4.</i> If he enters a fifth time, he is liable for death at the hand of heaven.
One - whether an ordinary priest or a High priest - who enters the Sacred Chamber outside the Holy of Holies, not for the sake of service, nor prostrating oneself,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the priests' prostrating themselves, see <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 5:11. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the priests were not allowed to enter the Sanctuary to prostrate themselves at all times. Instead, they would enter only at a specific time, when the service of the morning was completed.</i> is liable for lashes, but is not liable for death. [This is derived from the above verse which states:] "Before the covering [that is upon the Ark] so that he will not die." [Implied is that] for [unauthorized entry into] the Holy of Holies, he is liable for death, but [entering] the remainder of the Sanctuary is merely the violation of a negative commandment and is punishable by lashes.
A priest - whether an ordinary priest or a High priest - who departs from the Temple is liable for death<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 165) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 151) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> [at the hand of heaven] only in the midst of his service,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he is not involved in the Temple service, he is not required to remain in the Temple.</i> as [<i>ibid</i> 10:7] states: "From the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, you shall not depart, lest you die." Implied is that you should not abandon the service and leave hastily and in panic because of this decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, maintaining that the prooftext the Rambam cites was directed to Aaron's sons and applied only at the time of the death of Nadav and Avihu at the dedication of the Sanctuary. In other instances, there is no prohibition for an ordinary priest to leave the Temple. The prohibition applies to the High Priest alone. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> refers to the <i>Sifra</i> which - as interpreted by the Ramban - serves as support for the Rambam's ruling.</i> Similarly, the charge [issued to] the High Priest [<i>ibid.</i> 21:12]: "He shall not depart from the Temple," applies only in the midst of his service, i.e., that he should not abandon his service and depart.
If so, why was this warning repeated for the High Priest? [Because there is a difference between the laws that apply to him and those which apply to an ordinary priest]. When an ordinary priest was in the midst of his service in the Temple and he heard that a person for whom he is obligated to mourn has died, he should not perform sacrificial service, even though he does not leave the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad amplifies his difference of opinion with the Rambam, maintaining that the ordinary priest should certainly leave the Temple to participate in the funeral of a close relative. Indeed, he is forced to become impure to take part in the burial. Indeed, since he cannot complete the service, what value is there in him remaining?<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that were he to depart from the Temple, it would be demeaning to the service that he had performed. The implication would be that it was not of serious importance to him. Also, there is a practical dimension; if he would depart, there might not be anyone to see that the service is in fact completed.</i> because he is in an acute state of mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 9 for a definition of this term. See also <i>Hilchot Evel</i> 4:6, 9, for particulars with regard to the state of <i>aninut</i>, acute mourning.</i> if he performed service while in an acute state of mourning, he profanes his service, whether he is offering an individual sacrifice or a communal offering. A High Priest, by contrast, performs sacrificial service while he is in a state of acute mourning, as [implied by <i>ibid.</i>]: "From the Temple, he should not depart and not profane." Implied is that he should remain [in the Temple] and perform the service with which he was involved and it does not become profaned.
What is the source that teaches that the service of one in an acute state of mourning is invalid? [It is derived from] an inference from a less severe situation to a more severe one.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are taken from <i>Zevachim</i> 17b. The Talmud there offers another derivation. Significantly, in his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, the Rambam uses that derivation and not the one mentioned here.</i> A priest disqualified because of a physical deformity may partake of sacrificial foods.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6, Halachah 12.</i> Nevertheless, if he performs service, he profanes it.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 10:17.</i> How much more so should one who is in acute mourning and thus forbidden to partake of sacrificial foods<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:7.</i> - as [Deuteronomy 26:14] states: "I did not eat from it in a state of acute morning" - profane his service [if he performs it].
Although a High Priest may perform service while he is in a state of acute mourning, he is forbidden to partake of sacrificial food, as [Leviticus 10:19] states: "If I had partaken of the sin-offering today, would it have found favor in God's eyes."<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron asked this rhetorical question to Moses after serving in the Sanctuary, but not partaking of the offerings, on the day his sons died.</i> Similarly, he does not participate in the division of the sacrificial foods so that he could partake of the food in the evening.<br>When a person in an acute state of mourning performs sacrificial service, he is not liable for lashes. He is permitted to touch sacrificial foods even though he did not immerse himself [in a <i>mikveh</i>], for this safeguard was enforced only with regard to eating. With regard to touching [objects], he is considered as pure, as will be explained in the appropriate place.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Shaar Avot HaTuma'ah</i> 12:15, since a person who was in a state of acute mourning was forbidden to partake of holy objects, it is possible that he diverted his attention from his hands and touched a source of impurity unknowingly. Nevertheless, this is only a safeguard and applies only with regard to partaking of food and not to touching it.<br>[It must be emphasized that there is a difference in the versions of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 12:1). Some versions of the text follow the ruling here, but others state that it is forbidden for a person to touch sacred food.]</i>
What is meant by a person in an acute state of mourning? One who lost one of the relatives<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A person's mother, father, son, daughter, brother, and sister. One must mourn for his or her spouse according to Rabbinic Law (<i>Hilchot Evel</i> 2:1).</i> for whom he is required to mourn. On the day of the person's death, he is considered in acute mourning according to Scriptural Law. And at night, he is in acute mourning according to Rabbinic Law.
When [it was necessary] to wait several days and [only] afterwards, a corpse was buried, for all those days after the day of the deceased's passing, [his relative] is considered in an acute state of mourning according to Rabbinic Law.

Chapter 3

It is a positive commandment to send all impure persons away from the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 31) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 362) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Numbers 5:2] states: "And they shall send away from the camp all those with <i>tzara'at</i> and <i>zav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A physical affliction somewhat similar to gonorrhea that renders one ritually impure.</i> [afflictions] and all those who are impure because of contact with a corpse.

[The area] from the entrance to the Temple Mount until the entrance to the Temple Courtyard, the gate of Nicanor, is comparable to the camp of the Levites. And [the area] from the entrance to the Temple Courtyard inward, is comparable to the camp of the <i>Shechinah</i>.<br>See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Keilim</i> 1:8).</i> Should one infer that a person with <i>tzaraat</i> or <i>zav</i> ailments and one impure due to contact with a corpse are all three sent to the same place? With regard to one inflicted with <i>tzara'at</i>, [Leviticus 13:46] states: "He shall abide alone outside the camp where he dwells." [The camp from which he is sent] refers to the camp of the Israelites which parallels the area from the entrance to Jerusalem and beyond.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The verse implies that he must abide in a place where others do not dwell.</i> [From this we conclude,]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifra</i> understands this to be an example of the principle of Biblical exegesis: A subject (a person impure because of <i>tzara'at</i>) was included in a general category (impure people) and then was singled out to teach us a new law (that he must dwell separate from all others). This does not only teach us about this instance, but about the entire category (that there are distinctions in the extent people with impurity must distance themselves).</i> just like a person who is afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i>, because his impurity is more severe, is sent away in a more severe manner than others,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For in no other instance is an impure person required to depart from the camp of the Israelites.

A person who is impure because of contact with a human corpse - and even a corpse itself - is permitted to enter the Temple Mount.

What are the types of impurity for which one is liable [for entering] the Temple [while impure]?<br>a) Anyone who became impure through contact with a human corpse in a manner which would require a nazirite to shave [his head] because of them; these are explained in [<i>Hilchot] Nizirut</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nizirut</i> 7:1-6 which describes this subject in detail.

Implied is that since a nazirite is forbidden to cut his hair according to Scriptural Law, when he contracts ritual impurity stemming from a human corpse that is only Rabbinic in origin, he should not cut his hair, because then the Rabbinic safeguard would lead to the violation of Scriptural Law. Note also the commentary to <i>Hilchot Nizirut</i> which explains that the Rambam is referring to ritual impurity that is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, but could be considered of Scriptural origin, because it was derived through the laws of Biblical exegesis.</i><br>b) one who touched a person or a utensil that became impure through those types of impurity for which a nazirite must shave [his head]; for such a person is considered as a second level of impurity to a primary object of impurity that touched a corpse;<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">A person or an object that touches a human corpse becomes a source of impurity that can cause other people or objects to become ritually impure (see <i>Hilchot Tuma'at Meit</i> 5:4-5).<br>The Ra'avad states however that a nazirite is not obligated to shave his head if he touched a utensil or a person that became impure due to contact with a corpse. Hence, he concludes, one should not be liable for entering the Temple after having contracted impurity in this manner. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that the simple meaning of the passage in <i>Nazir</i> 54a appears to support the Ra'avad's understanding. Nevertheless, he cites a passage from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nazir</i> 7:4) which could be interpreted as supporting the Rambam's ruling.</i><br>c) one who became impure through contact with another primary source of impurity as mandated by Scriptural Law,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">There are entities that are considered sources of impurity according to Rabbinic Law.

The general principle is: Anyone who is required to immerse himself in water<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in a <i>mikveh</i>.</i> according to Scriptural Law is liable for <i>karet</i> for entering the Temple [while impure] even after he immersed himself until nightfall [that day].<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in Halachah 6, one who has immersed himself to emerge from ritual impurity is still impure until nightfall of that day. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that such a person is not liable for <i>karet.</i> The Radbaz cites the Rambam's ruling in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 18:14 which would seem to support the Ra'avad's ruling. It states that a person who was ritually impure, then immersed himself, and then partook of sacrificial foods before nightfall is liable for lashes, but is not liable for <i>karet</i>. Nevertheless, the Radbaz explains that a distinction can be made between these two situations.</i> If, however, one became impure due to impurity stemming from a human corpse that does not require a nazirite to shave [his head], he is exempt for entering the Temple, even though his impurity lasts for seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Although he is required to observe the strictures of someone who is ritually impure, he is not liable for entering the Temple.</i>

For these matters are laws received through the Oral Tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>ibid.</i>:5, the Rambam continues: "Even though according to the Oral Tradition [one is rendered impure for such matters], this is not Scriptural Law. For it is not explicitly stated in the Torah that one who becomes impure through contact with a human corpse becomes a source of impurity and one who touches him becomes impure to the first degree." In this instance, however, the Rambam is probably following his renown approach that any concept that is not explicitly stated in the Torah is considered as "from the Oral Tradition" even though it was also conveyed to Moses at Sinai.</i> Although he is exempt, he is given stripes for rebellious conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For the Rabbis instituted decrees to insure that the prohibitions established by the Oral Tradition were observed.</i>
A person who brings a dead teeming animal<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">This is speaking about a situation where he brought the dead teeming animal into the Temple without touching it, since, as stated in <i>Hilchot Shaar Avot HaTuma'ah</i> 4:1, a dead teeming animal imparts ritual impurity only when one touches it and not when one carries it. For if the person had touched it, he would become impure and be liable for <i>karet</i> entering the Temple in that state.</i> or the like<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., another source of impurity that imparts impurity through touch, but not when carried.</i> into the Temple or when he brings an impure person into the Temple, he is liable for <i>karet</i>, because he made God's sanctuary impure.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's view, explaining that there is a logical basis for his conclusion. Since the Torah was lenient with regard to utensils (and garments), absolving one from <i>karet</i> even when the utensil was a source of impurity, we can conclude that leniency would also be shown with regard to lashes.</i> He does, however, receive stripes for rebellious conduct.
Similarly, when an impure person inserts his hand [alone] into the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he stands outside the Temple Courtyard and inserts only his hand. He is not given lashes, because his entire body has not entered the Temple Courtyard. Even the Rambam would agree that he is forbidden by Rabbinic decree to insert his hand.

Similarly, anyone who purposely enters the Temple before immersing himself<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's words imply that once he immersed himself, he is not liable for stripes for rebellious conduct for entering the Temple even if night has not yet fallen.

In all places where one is liable for <i>karet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the Temple Courtyard.</i> for a willful transgression or a sacrifice for an unknowing transgression, should an impure object be found there on the Sabbath, it should be removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">An object for which one has no purpose is <i>muktzeh</i> and there is a Rabbinic prohibition against transporting it on the Sabbath.

Both an impure person who entered the Temple when it was pure<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 12.</i> and a pure person who entered the Temple when there was impurity within it - e.g., a corpse was lying under a shelter in the Temple and he entered under that shelter - are liable for <i>karet</i>.

It is forbidden for him to tarry, to bow, or to depart via a longer way.

Chapter 4

When an impure person serves in the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that the words "in the Temple" are not an exclusion. Instead, in the era when offerings were brought on private altars, this law also applied to a priest bringing an offering on such an altar.</i> he desecrates his service and is liable for death at the hand of heaven for [performing] this service even if he did not tarry there,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in the conclusion of the last chapter, one is liable for <i>karet</i> for tarrying in the Temple Courtyard even if he does not perform service. Halachah 3 describes how it is possible to perform service without tarrying in the Temple Courtyard.</i> as [indicated by Leviticus 22:2]: "so that they draw back for the sanctified objects of the children of Israel and not desecrate My holy name." This is a warning for a person who serves while ritually impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 75) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 278) include this charge as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i><br>Further on,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In reference to <i>terumah</i>.</i> [<i>ibid.</i>:9] states: "They will die because of it, because they desecrated it." Just as in the latter instance, desecration makes one liable for death at the hands of heaven, so too, with regard to [offering sacrifices while impure, desecration] makes one liable for death at the hand of heaven. Lashes are given for [the violation of] all negative commandments punishable by death at the hand of heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:1. If he receives lashes from an earthly court, he is absolved of the punishment from above.</i>
Although one who serves in a state of impurity is liable only for lashes in court, his priestly brethren<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:6, the Rambam quotes the wording of <i>Sanhedrin</i> 81b: "The young priests would take him out...."</i> would not bring him to the court. Instead, they would take him outside<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz relates that if the priests did not interrupt him in the middle of his service and seize him, but instead, allowed him to complete his service and leave the Temple on his own initiative, they are not allowed to administer this punishment to him. All they can do is bring him to the court.</i> [the Temple]<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., beyond the Women's Courtyard and the surrounding rampart, because a corpse is not allowed in these areas according to Rabbinic Law.

They would not be rebuked for this.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz elaborates in explaining why this punishment can be given. He explains that although there is no legal license for it, there are instances (see <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 24:4), where he states that at times punishments are given with no legal basis. By serving in the Temple, the priests offer their tacit acquiescence to such action being taken.</i>
How is it possible for a priest to perform service without tarrying so that he will be liable only for death at the hand of heaven and not <i>karet</i>? For example, he contracted impurity in the Temple Courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For if he contracted impurity outside the Temple Courtyard, he is liable for <i>karet</i> as soon as he enters, as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 12.</i> and departed in the shortest way possible,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, as explained at the conclusion of the previous chapter.</i> but as he was leaving, he used a cylinder in his hand to turn over a limb [from a sacrifice] on the fire of the altar and thus hasten its consumption by the flames.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 4, for more particulars concerning this act.</i> [The rationale is that] any contribution to the Temple service<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">And offering the limbs on the fire of the altar is part of the Temple service.</i> is considered as equivalent to that service.
Similarly, if one who was impure immersed in the <i>mikveh</i> and then performed service before nightfall of that day,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the notes to the previous chapter, until nightfall he is still considered as impure.<br>The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, noting that according to the Rambam, a person who entered the Temple on the day he immersed is liable for <i>karet</i> for the entry alone. Thus why is it necessary to speak of a second obligation for <i>karet</i>. He explains that it could be speaking about a person who was standing outside the Temple Courtyard and moved limbs on the Altar using a long pole. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves the difficulty by distinguishing between <i>karet</i> and death at the hand of heaven, for <i>karet</i> is a more severe punishment.</i> his service is invalid and he is liable for death at the hand of heaven, as [<i>ibid</i> 21:6] states: "They shall not desecrate the name of their God."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 83b for an explanation for how this prohibition is derived from this prooftext. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 76) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 265) include this prohibition as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that this is a warning to a person who [was impure, but] immersed himself that day who performs service [in the Temple], for he is still impure. [This is derived from <i>ibid.</i> 22:7]: "And the sun sets and he will become pure." Implied is that until then, he was not pure.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam adds this explanation to differentiate between a person who immersed in the <i>mikveh</i>, but must wait until sunset and one who has not completed his atonement process. The latter individuals are considered as pure, even though they may not enter the Temple.</i> A person whose atonement process was not completed<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a <i>zav, zavah</i>, or the like who must bring a sacrifice before becoming ritually pure.</i> who performs service [in the Temple] is exempt [from punishment]<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions this ruling, noting that in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 19:2, the Rambam mentions one who serves despite the fact that his atonement process is not completed as among those who are liable for death at the hand of heaven and whose offense is punishable by lashes. This is also evident from Chapter 9, Halachah 11. The Ra'avad also quotes Talmudic sources that indicate that such a person is liable. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the questions raised by the Ra'avad can be resolved, but the apparent contradiction in the Rambam's own rulings remains difficult.</i> even though his service is invalid and it desecrates [the sacrifice].
What is the source that teaches that such service is impure? [With regard to a woman impure due to childbirth, Leviticus 12:8] states: "And the priest shall atone for her and she shall become pure." Implied is that until now, she was not pure. The same applies to all others whose atonement process is not complete.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a <i>zav, zavah</i>, and one afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i>.</i>
[The following laws apply if] a priest performed service and afterwards, it became known that he was impure. If the source of impurity was known,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">To even one person.</i> all of the sacrifices that he offered are invalid, for his work is defiled. If, however, he became impure due to the impurity [likened to] the depths,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 7:7), the Rambam explains that this term is used to refer to "a corpse that is hidden and not known about at all, to the extent that it is in the very depths." See also the gloss of Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura (<i>Parah</i> 3:2) which explains the term as follows: Just like mortal wisdom cannot fathom the extent of the depths, so, too, the existence of this corpse is not known to any mortal.<br><i>Hilchot Nizirut</i> 6:18 describes this impurity as stemming from contact with a human corpse, about which "no one, not even one at the end of the world, knows about."</i> the forehead plate brings about appeasement and all the sacrifices he offered are accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 80b) states this concept with regard to the Paschal sacrifice (see <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 4:2). The Rambam extrapolates that the law applies to all sacrifices.</i> Even if he became aware of the fact that he was impure before the blood was sprinkled on the altar and then he sprinkled the blood, it brings about appeasement. For the forehead plate brings about appeasement for the impurity [likened to] the depths even though he [transgresses] intentionally.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the Rambam's words imply that as an initial preference, such a priest should not sprinkle the blood. Only after the fact, it is acceptable. In <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 6:11, however, the Rambam rules that a person who becomes impure due to impurity [likened to] the depths may offer a sacrifice as an initial preference. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that a distinction can be made between the two instances, because the Paschal sacrifice is an immediate obligation, while other sacrifices may be offered by other people at other times. Moreover, failure to offer the Paschal sacrifice is more severe, as indicated by the fact that it is punishable by <i>karet</i>.</i> We have already explained the impurity [likened to] the depths in <i>Hilchot Nizirut</i>.
Similarly, the forehead plate brings atonement if the objects being sacrificed are impure,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the blood and the other portions of the sacrifices offered on the altar. See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 1:34.</i> as [Exodus 28:38] states: "And it shall be on the forehead of Aaron and Aaron will bear the sins of the sacred objects." It does not, however, bring about appeasement if the portions of the sacrifices that are eaten are impure or if the one [offering the sacrifice] is impure when he became impure because of a known source of impurity unless the impurity was superseded by a communal obligation,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., communal sacrifices that are offered at a fixed time should be offered even if there is impurity involved, as explained in the following halachot.</i> in which instance the forehead plate generates appeasement for it.
The forehead plate does not bring about appeasement unless it is on the High Priest's forehead,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion concerning this matter in <i>Yoma</i> 7b and the Rambam accepts the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. The commentaries have noted that this could be understood as a contradiction to his ruling in Halachah 15. Nevertheless, there are other approaches to that passage which allow the two rulings to coexist.</i> as [the above verse] continues: "It will be on his forehead at all times, for appeasement before God."
[The offering of] any sacrifice that does not have a set time does not supersede [the observance of] the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., offering a sacrifice involves the violation of certain Sabbath prohibitions. As the Rambam proceeds to state, sacrifices that must be brought at a set time may nevertheless be offered, but not those which do not have a set time.</i> or [the laws of] ritual impurity. [The rationale is that] if it is not sacrificed today, it will be sacrificed tomorrow or afterwards. [The offering of] any sacrifice that does have a set time, whether it be a communal offering or an individual offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the <i>chavitin</i> offering of the High Priest, the bull he brings on Yom Kippur, or the Paschal sacrifices.</i> supersedes [the observance of] the Sabbath and [the laws of] ritual impurity. It does not supersede all types of ritual impurity, however, only those stemming from contact with a human corpse.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For the fundamental concept was derived from the Biblical story (Numbers, ch. 9) concerning the people who approached Moses to offer the Paschal sacrifice and they were impure because of contact with a human corpse.</i>
All<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., all of the communal sacrifices that are brought from the money collected for the communal sacrifices. There are certain atonement offerings, the bull offered when the people at large err with regard to a Scriptural prohibition, and the goat offered when they err with regard to the prohibition against idolatry. These, unlike the other communal sacrifices, are not offered at a specific time.</i> of the communal sacrifices have a fixed time when they must be offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">And if they are not offered at this time, they may not be offered afterwards (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Hence [offering them] supersedes [the observance of] the Sabbath and [the laws of] ritual impurity stemming from contact with a human corpse.
All of the sacrifices that were brought in a state of ritual impurity are not eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">With the exception of the Paschal offering, as explained in <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 7:8. For the Pesach sacrifice was ordained primarily for the purpose of the people partaking of it (<i>Pesachim</i> 7:5).</i> Instead, the elements of the sacrifice that are fit to be consumed by fire are offered on the fire [of the altar].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For the primary purpose of these sacrifices is for them to be offered on the altar.</i> The remaining portions that would [ordinarily] be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 76a mentions five communal sacrifices that are ordinarily eaten: the <i>omer</i> offering of barley, the two breads offered on Shavuot, the showbread, the communal peace offerings, and the goat offered on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>.</i> are burnt in the same manner<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Akiva Eiger asks why a communal sacrifice would not be eaten if it was offered by an impure priest who did not touch it and did not cause it to become impure.

What is meant by saying it supersedes [the laws of] ritual impurity? If the time when that sacrifice is to be offered arrives and the majority<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Half is not sufficient (<i>Pesachim</i> 79a).</i> of the people offering it were impure due to contact with a human corpse,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This applies only with regard to the Paschal sacrifice, for it must be eaten by the people at large.

Both the impure and the pure should be involved in its offering together<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., with regard to the Paschal sacrifice, a person who is pure should not say: "Since I am pure, I should not share my sacrifice with those who are impure." Instead, the sacrifices should be offered and eaten together (see Radbaz; <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and enter the Temple Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if their entry would in some way contribute to the sacrifice being offered properly (Radbaz).</i><br>Those who are impure because of other reasons, <i>zavim, zavot,</i> women in their menstrual state, those after childbirth, those who came in contact with the corpse of a teeming animal or large animal, or the like should not be involved [in the sacrifice] and should not enter the Temple Courtyard even though sacrifices are being offered in a state of impurity. If they transgressed and took part [in the sacrifice] or entered the Temple Courtyard, they are liable for <i>karet</i> for entering [the Courtyard]<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 12.</i> or death [at the hand of Heaven]<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 1 of this chapter.</i> for [carrying out] the service.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">They are, however, exempt from punishment if they partake of the Paschal sacrifice in this state of impurity if the majority of the people are ritually impure because of contact with a human corpse (<i>Pesachim</i> 95b).</i> For only the impurity stemming from contact with a human corpse was superseded [by the obligation to offer these sacrifices].
When a Paschal sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Although this law also applies with regard to other communal sacrifices, the Paschal sacrifice is mentioned, because it is the only instance when there would be a large throng of people in the Temple Courtyard.</i> is offered in a state of impurity and those who were impure due to contact with a human corpse pressed on and entered the Sanctuary, they are exempt even though they were only permitted to enter the Temple Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, they are forbidden to do so (Radbaz), for the activities involved in the offering of the Paschal sacrifice are carried out only in the Temple Courtyard and not in the Sanctuary itself.</i> Since the charge [Numbers 5:3]: "Send them beyond the camp" does not apply to them, they are exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">There is a question concerning this issue in <i>Pesachim</i> 95b. Hence, an earthly court may not punish them with lashes. The question of whether they would be liable for death at the hand of Heaven is also not resolved on this plane.

If a portion of the priests of the clan scheduled to serve in the Temple that day<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:11 for a definition of this term.</i> were impure and a portion were pure, even if the majority were impure due to contact with a human corpse, only those who are pure should offer the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As long as it is possible to offer the sacrifices in a state of purity, we do not offer them while impure.</i> If all the priests of that clan were impure, the priests of another clan should be brought [to serve].<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">For the reason stated in the following halachah.</i> If all the priests of that watch were impure due to contact with a human corpse, we look for [those of] another watch. If most of the priests who entered Jerusalem at a given time were impure, [the appropriate sacrifice] should be offered in a state of impurity.
Why do we search for a priest who is pure from another clan?<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">And even from another watch (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Because [the prohibition against serving while] impure was not released entirely [in order to offer] the communal [sacrifices]. Instead, the prohibition is still standing, it is merely superseded temporarily, because of the pressing situation.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is explaining a difference of opinion between the Sages in <i>Yoma</i> 6b. One Sage maintains that the prohibition against ritual impurity is <i>hutra</i>, released entirely, with regard to communal sacrifices. The other opinion is that the prohibition is <i>dichuya</i>, i.e., as the Rambam explains, the prohibition continues to exist and must be respected to the fullest degree possible. Similar concepts also apply with regard to the Sabbath prohibitions being overridden by questions of life and death. See the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 2:1.</i> We do not override any prohibitions that may be superseded except in a situation where there is no alternative. For this reason, the forehead plate is required to bring about appeasement.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 7.</i>
What is the source that teaches that [the prohibitions against] ritual impurity are superseded [to bring] communal [offerings]? [Numbers 9:6] speaks of: "Men who were impure because of a [deceased] human soul."<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The passage relates that after Moses communicated the command to offer the Paschal sacrifice, several individuals who were impure because of contact with a corpse came to him and asked for an opportunity to offer the Paschal sacrifice. Moses relayed their question to God Who answered that they - and all other individuals who are impure at the time the Paschal sacrifice must be offered may bring such a sacrifice a month later on Pesach Sheni. Implicit in that command is, as the Rambam proceeds to explain, that the license to offer a sacrifice on Pesach Sheni was granted only to individuals. If the majority of the Jewish people become impure, they must offer the Paschal sacrifice on the first Pesach in a state of impurity.</i> According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught: Particular individuals are deferred to Pesach Sheni if they were impure. If, however, the community at large is impure due to contact with a human corpse, it is not deferred.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 7:12.</i> Instead, [the prohibition against] ritual impurity is superseded and the Paschal sacrifice should be offered in a state of impurity. The same applies to every sacrifice that has a fixed time like the Paschal sacrifice:<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 77a explains the derivation of this concept as follows: With regard to the Pesach sacrifice, Numbers 9:2 states that it should be offered "at its appointed time," which our Sages interpret as meaning ...at its appointed time,' even on the Sabbath, even in a state of ritual impurity." Now since Numbers 29:39 uses the term "in their appointed time" in reference to other communal sacrifices, we understand that the same concepts apply to them as well.</i> [the obligation to offer it] supersedes [the prohibition against] ritual impurity.
This concept is explicitly stated in Scripture [II Chronicles 30:17-18]: "For a multitude of the congregation had not sanctified themselves and the Levites presided over the slaughter of the Paschal sacrifice for all who were not pure....<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">King Chizkiya assumed the throne after the rule of Achaz, an idolatrous sinner. After years when the people had been led astray, Chizkiya inspired them to repent. He invited all the people to offer the Paschal sacrifice. Unfortunately, a sufficient number of priests had not purified themselves and also, the people were somewhat slow in responding. To enable the Paschal sacrifice to be offered by as many people as possible, he had a leap year declared, so as to give them an extra month.</i> For many of the people, many from Ephraim, Menasheh, Issachar, and Zevulon had not purified themselves."<br>What then is meant by the statement (<i>ibid.</i>): "They partook of the Paschal sacrifice not in accordance with what was written"?<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one should not infer that the error was that they partook of the sacrifice while ritually impure (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Because they made that year a leap year because of ritual impurity, as [<i>ibid.</i>:2-3] states: "And the king, his officers, and all the congregation in Jerusalem had conferred [and decided] to offer the Pesach... in the second month,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they delayed its offering by a month, by declaring a leap year.</i> because they were not able to offer it at its time because there were not enough priests who had sanctified themselves."<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the addition of this month, the majority of the people who came to Jerusalem were ritually impure. Hence, the prohibitions against impurity had to be overridden (see Rav Yosef Corcus).</i> As we explained already in <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodeh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 4, Halachah 6.</i> as an initial preference, we do not declare a leap year because of ritual impurity.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">For the preference is to offer the sacrifices in a state of ritual impurity.</i>
There was another [difficulty] that year. King Chizkiya made the year a leap year on the thirtieth day of Adar which was fit to be Rosh Chodesh Nissan. Instead, he made it the thirtieth of Adar. The Sages did not agree with him, for a leap year should not be declared on this day, as we explained in [<i>Hilchot] Kiddush HaChodesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 4, Halachah 14. Instead, the leap year should be declared earlier, indeed, preferably months before.</i><br>Because of these two matters which were not done as prescribed by Jewish Law, it was said: "They partook of the Paschal sacrifice not in accordance with what was written."[ Chizkiya] entreated for mercy for himself and for the Sages who concurred with his actions,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the minority who did, for the majority did not, as stated above (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> as [<i>ibid.</i>:18] states: "For Yichezkiyahu prayed for them, saying: 'May God Who is good atone for those....' [<i>ibid.</i>:20] states: 'God heeded Yichezkiyahu and healed the people.'[ Implied is that] their sacrifice was accepted.

Chapter 5

It is a positive commandment for a priest<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam emphasizes that this mitzvah applies to a priest, because an animal offered as a sacrifice may be slaughtered by a non-priest. Such a person need not sanctify his hands and feet. This explanation is reinforced by some of the versions of <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 24) which state "A priest alone is obligated...," i.e., a priest and not a non-priest.</i> who serves [in the Temple] to sanctify his hands and feet<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Through washing them from the basin in the Temple Courtyard, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> and afterwards perform service,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 106) consider this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Exodus 30:19] states: "And Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet from it." A priest who serves<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If he does not perform service in the Temple Courtyard, he is not liable even if he enters without sanctifying his hands and feet (Rav Yosef Corcus).</i> without having sanctified his hands and feet in the morning<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">With the latter addition, the Rambam excludes the extra sanctifications performed by the High Priest on Yom Kippur before and after the changes of his garments.

Their service - whether that of a High Priest or an ordinary priest - is invalid.
Which source teaches that his service is invalid? [<i>Ibid.</i>:21] states: "It will be an eternal statute for him and his generations," and with regard to the Priestly garments [<i>ibid.</i> 25:43] also uses the expression: "An eternal statute."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> does not quote the verse exactly.</i> Just as [a priest] who is lacking the priestly garments invalidates his service, as we explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 10:4.</i> so, too, one who did not wash his hands invalidates his service.
A priest does not have to sanctify [himself] between every service [that he performs]. Instead, he consecrates [his hands and feet] once in the morning and may continue serving throughout the day and [the subsequent] night,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">On the following day, he must sanctify his hands and feet again, even if he did not sleep at night, as stated in Halachah 8.</i> provided he does not: a) depart from the Temple;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 5.</i> b) sleep;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this requirement is derived from the obligation to sanctify one's hands and feet if one diverts attention, for it is likely that while sleeping, one did divert his attention.</i> c) urinate;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 5 with regard to defecation.</i> or divert his attention [from his hands and feet]. If he does any of the above, he must sanctify his hands and feet again.
If a priest departed from the Temple, returned and then performed service without sanctifying [his hands and feet], his service is acceptable<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">There is an unresolved question concerning this point in <i>Zevachim</i> 20b.

Anyone who defecates must immerse himself [in a <i>mikveh</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See the conclusion of Halachah 6.</i> Anyone who urinates must sanctify his hands and feet.<br>[The following rules apply when] one goes outside the walls of the Temple Courtyard. If he departed [with the intent of] staying outside for an extended time, he must immerse [in a <i>mikveh</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Even if he actually remained outside for a short time.</i> If [his intent] was to return immediately, when he returns, all that is necessary is that he sanctify his hands and feet. If he did not immerse, nor sanctified his hands and feet and carried out [sacrificial] service, his service is acceptable<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">There is an unresolved question concerning this point in <i>Zevachim</i> 20b. Hence, the Rambam rules leniently (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> since he did not divert his attention, nor did he defecate or urinate. If he merely placed his hands outside the Temple Courtyard, he is not required to sanctify them again.
If [only] a person's hands become ritually impure,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This refers, not to ritual impurity prescribed by Scriptural Law, but instead, to certain states of ritual impurity ordained by our Sages that affect the hands alone. See <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i>, ch. 8.</i> he may immerse them and they are ritually pure. He need not sanctify them again.<br>If his body became impure because he partook of impure foods or drank impure beverages and immersed himself, even though he does not have to wait until nightfall [to become ritually pure],<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i> 9:9.</i> he must sanctify [his hands and feet] after immersing himself, for everyone who immerses himself must sanctify his hands and feet [before] serving. If he did not sanctify [his hands and feet], his service is not desecrated since he did not divert his attention.
When a High Priest does not immerse himself nor sanctify his hands and feet between his changes of clothes and between his different services on Yom Kippur<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 2:2 for a description of these changes of clothing, immersions, and sanctifications.</i> and [continues] serving, his service is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">He does, however, violate a positive commandment, because he does not perform the Yom Kippur service as prescribed (<i>Yoma</i> 30b).</i> [The rationale is that] since those immersions and sanctifications are not applicable equally to Aaron and his sons,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">They are obligations of the High Priest (Aaron), but not an ordinary priest (his sons).</i> as [Exodus 30:19] states: "And Aaron and his sons will wash from it." Only an obligation that is equally applicable to all the priests is an indispensable obligation, i.e., the first sanctification of one's hands.
If a person sanctified his hands on one day, he must sanctify them again on the following day even though he did not sleep at all that night, for the hands are disqualified because of the passage of the night. [Even] if he sanctified his hands at night and offered fats on [the altar's pyre] the entire night,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he was continually involved in the Temple service.</i> he must go back and sanctify [his hands] on the next day<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">At daybreak.</i> for that day's service.
If a priest sanctified his hands and his feet for the removal of the altar's ashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Which is carried out at dawn (<i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 2:11-12).</i> even though he sanctifies them before sunrise,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Halachically, depending on the different opinions, dawn is between 72 minutes and two hours before sunrise. Sunrise is the time when the priest should sanctify his hands. Nevertheless, in this instance, he has no alternative, since he is sanctifying them for that day's service and that service is performed before dawn.</i> he does not have to sanctify them again after daybreak, because he sanctified them at the beginning of the day's service.
It is a mitzvah to sanctify [one's hands and feet] from the basin.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See the description of this utensil in the conclusion of ch. 4 of <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>.</i> If, however, one sanctifies them from a sacred utensil, the sanctification is effective. Sanctification may not, however, be performed with an ordinary utensil.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one that is not consecrated.</i> If one sanctified [his hands and feet] with a sacred utensil outside the Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The sanctification must be performed within the Temple Courtyard, for that is where the basin is located. Even though the sanctification need not be performed with water from the basin, it must be performed in the area where it is located (<i>Zevachim</i> 22a).</i> or did so with an ordinary utensil within the Temple and then performed service, his service is disqualified. One does not sanctify his hands and feet inside the basin or a sacred utensil, but from them, as [implied by the verse]: "Aaron and his son's will wash from it;" ["from it"] and not "inside of it." If one sanctified [his hands and feet] in such a utensil and performed service, he did not desecrate it.
If one immerses his hands and feet in the waters of a <i>mikveh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">There were several <i>mikvaot</i> on the Temple Mount.</i> or even a spring, this is not considered as sanctification. One must wash them from a utensil. One may sanctify them using any sacred utensil whether or not it contains a <i>revi'it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">86 cc. according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>; 150 cc. according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>. The Ra'avad states - and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this is also the Rambam's intent - that if one uses a small utensil, he must take the water originally from the basin.</i>
All water is acceptable for the sanctification, whether water from a spring or water from a <i>mikveh</i>, provided its appearance has not changed and it is [thus] acceptable for immersion.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Mikvaot</i> 7:1, if the appearance of water has changed, e.g., one poured wine or juice into it and changed its color, it is not acceptable for immersion.</i> Mud that can be poured, from which a cow would drink,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since a cow will drink it, it is considered as water and not as earth. Compare to <i>ibid.</i> 7:3, 8:9. 11:2.</i> can be used to fill the measure of the basin. This is the general rule: Any water that can be used to make up the measure of a <i>mikveh</i> can be used to make up the measure of the basin.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mikveh</i> must be 40 <i>se'ah</i> in volume.</i>
How much water must there be in the basin? At least enough for four priests to sanctify [their hands and feet] from it, as [indicated by Exodus 30:19 which] mentions "Aaron and his sons." Together with him, there were Elazar, Itamar, and Pinchas, a total of four.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 21b cites Exodus 40:32 which states "And Moses, Aaron, and his sons will wash from it." "His sons" is plural indicating at least two, thus reaching a total of four. The Rambam, here and in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 2) substitutes Pinchas for Moses. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions that explanation on two counts: Firstly, at the time, the basin was first used, Aaron's older sons, Nadav and Avihu, were still alive. Moreover, the priesthood had not been granted to Pinchas as of yet. Rav Yosef Corcus tries to support the Rambam's understanding, explaining that according to certain views, Moses did not serve as a priest when Aaron did, only in the seven days of preparation.</i>
The water in the basin is disqualified if left [in it] overnight, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 3:18.</i> What would be done [to prevent the water from being disqualified]? The basin would be submerged in a <i>mikveh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 1:4), the Rambam explains that each night the basin would be submerged in a <i>muchani</i>, a large container which held a reservoir of water. This container was not a sacred utensil and hence the water it contained was not disqualified overnight. See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.</i>, for a description of this container.</i> or a spring and on the following day, it would be raised or it would be filled each day in the morning.
The "sea" fashioned by Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See I Kings 7:23-26. This was a circular copper tank, ten cubits in diameter and five cubits deep.</i> had the status of a <i>mikveh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">As II Chronicles 4:6 states, the priests would use it as a <i>mikveh</i>.</i> because a channel of water from the Spring of Aitem<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">A mountain spring slightly south of Jerusalem. It was 32 cubits higher than the Temple Mount. Hence the water would naturally flow through a conduit built from it to the Temple.</i> would pass through it.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Usually, water contained in a utensil is not acceptable for immersion. Nevertheless, since water from a flowing spring passed through this tank, its water was acceptable [the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 3:8)].</i> Therefore,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because it was connected to a flowing spring.</i> its waters were not disqualified with the passage of night like the water of the basin and [indeed,] the basin was filled from it.
How is the mitzvah of sanctification performed? [A priest would] put his right hand on his right foot and his left hand on his left foot and bend over and sanctify them.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a colleague would pour water over them; alternatively, he would stand under a tap.<br>See <i>Hilchot Nesiat Kapayim</i> 15:5 which states that one would wash until the wrist.</i> All the substances that are considered as intervening with regard to immersion,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Mikvaot</i>, ch. 2, no significant substance may intervene between the flesh of the person immersing and the waters of the <i>mikveh</i>. That chapter details those substances that are considered as significant and hence, as intervening, and those which are not.</i> are intervening with regard to the sanctification of hands.<br>One may not sanctify his hands while sitting, because [the sanctification] is comparable to the Temple service and the Temple service may be performed only when standing, as [Deuteronomy 18:5] states: "To stand and to serve."<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim, loc. cit.</i>), he offers another rationale: that one is not allowed to sit in the Temple.</i>
Anyone who performs service while he is seated, desecrates his service and disqualifies it. He does not receive lashes, because the warning against doing so stems from a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">And lashes are given only when a negative commandment is violated.</i><br>Similarly, anyone involved with one of the Temple services must be standing on the floor.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 24a relates that since both the Temple utensils and the ground of the Temple Courtyard have been sanctified, an equation is established between them. Just as there can be no intervening substance between a priest's hand and a sacred utensil, so too, there may be no intervening substance between his feet and the Temple Courtyard.</i> If there was anything intervening between himself and the ground,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the stones of the Temple or the Temple Courtyard.</i> e.g., he was standing on a utensil, an animal, or a colleague's foot, [his service] is invalid. Similarly, if there was anything intervening between his hand and the utensil with which he was performing the service, it is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from Leviticus 4:5: "And the priest shall take." Implied is that the taking must be performed by the priest's body without any intermediary (<i>Zevachim, loc. cit.</i>).</i>
The Temple service may be performed only with one's right hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam writes that "Whenever the word "hand" is mentioned [with regard to the Temple service], the intent is the right hand."<br>The above is referring to a right-handed person. A left-handed priest is disqualified from serving in the Temple, as stated in Chapter 8, Halachah 11.</i> If one performed service with his left hand, it is invalid. He is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">For there is no explicit prohibition that he violates. Instead, it is an extension of a positive commandment (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>[The following laws apply when] one of [a priest's] feet are on a utensil and one is on the floor, one is on a stone [that was not embedded in the floor] and one was on the floor. We evaluate [the situation]. Whenever he would be able to stand on his one foot if the utensil or the stone were taken away, his service is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For then, the support provided by the second foot is not of consequence.</i> If not, his service is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">For then it is significant.</i><br>If he received [blood from a sacrifice] with his right hand and his left hand is supporting it, his service is acceptable, because we do not pay attention to [something that is] a [mere] support.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle, applying in other situations as well (see <i>Shabbat</i> 93b).</i>
When one of the stones of the Temple Courtyard has become loosened, one should not stand upon it during one's Temple service until it is affixed in the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">As long as it is not fixed in the ground, the stone can be considered as a separate entity and therefore, it could be considered as an intervening substance between the priest and the earth.</i> If he performed service, his service is acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">There is an unresolved question concerning this issue in <i>Zevachim</i> 24a. Hence, the Rambam does not rule stringently. See also the commentaries to <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:10.</i> since it is located in its place.

Chapter 6

Any priest who has a physical blemish - whether a permanent blemish or a temporary blemish<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">From the repetition of verses in Leviticus concerning this issue, the <i>Sifra</i> derives that the prohibition encompasses both types of blemishes.</i> - should not enter the area of the altar and beyond in the Temple, as [Leviticus 21:21-23] states: "[Any man from among the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a blemish...] shall not come near the curtain,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The curtain separating between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.</i> nor may he approach the altar.

In his gloss to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Ramban differs. He maintains that although there is a prohibition against a blemished priest serving in the Temple as the Rambam continues to explain, there is no Scriptural prohibition against merely entering this portion of the Temple area. The <i>Megilat Esther</i> supports the Rambam's view.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that from <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 19:4, it appears that lashes are given only if the priest enters the building of the Temple, not this portion of the courtyard.</i> he is liable for lashes even if he did not perform any service.<br>If he performs service in the Temple, he invalidates and desecrates his service. He is worthy of lashes for the service as well,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 70) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 275) consider also this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

Similarly, a person with a temporary blemish who performs service in the Temple invalidates [his service] and is liable for lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 71) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 276) consider also this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. The Ramban differs and maintains that there is only one negative commandment against a priest with a blemish serving in the Temple and it includes both instances, a permanent blemish and a temporary blemish.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i>:18] states: "Any man who has a blemish shall not draw close...." According to the Oral Tradition, we have learned that this is a warning against [a priest] with a temporary blemish [serving]. [A priest] with a blemish who serves is not liable for death, only for lashes.
All physical blemishes - whether the priest had them from birth or acquired them afterwards, whether they will heal or they will not heal - disqualify [him] until they heal.
A permanent blemish is a broken leg or a broken arm.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Leviticus 21:19.</i> A temporary blemish is a dry skin eruption or a moist skin eruption also known as a <i>chazizit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:20.</i> Not only the blemishes mentioned in the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:18-21.</i> but any apparent bodily blemish disqualifies the priests, as [<i>ibid.</i>:21] states: "Any man who has a blemish," i.e., any type. Those mentioned by the Torah are merely examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary to the Torah, the Ramban takes a slightly different approach, maintaining that those blemishes mentioned in the Torah outline the general categories of blemishes.</i>
There are three types of blemishes [involving humans]:<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">There are also blemishes that disqualify an animal, but do not disqualify a human, as stated in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i>, ch. 2. See the gloss of the Radbaz there which explains that it appears that the Rambam's intent is not that if these conditions are found in men, they do not disqualify a priest. Instead, the intent is that it is extremely uncommon to find such a condition in a human. Hence they are "not appropriate to be found in a human." Nevertheless, if a priest does have such a condition, it is considered as a blemish and he is disqualified.</i><br>a) blemishes that disqualify a priest from serving and an animal from being offered [as a sacrifice];<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">These are described in Chapter 7.</i><br>b) blemishes that only prevent a man from serving;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">These are described in Chapter 8.</i><br>c) blemishes that do not disqualify a priest, but because of the impression that would be created,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See the conclusion of ch. 8.</i> [our Sages] stated that every priest who has such a blemish should not serve.
Whenever [a priest] who has a blemish that disqualifies both a person and animal serves, whether inadvertently or intentionally, his service is invalid. If he served intentionally, he is liable for lashes. Whenever [a priest] who has a blemish that disqualifies only a person serves, even though he is liable for lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">If he serves intentionally.</i> his service is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that there appears to be a contradiction between this statement and the Torah's explicit statements. The Torah mentions exceptionally long eye-brows and crushed testicles as blemishes. These blemishes apply to a human and not to an animal. Nevertheless, it appears that they are also included by the statement (<i>ibid.</i>:23): "He shall not desecrate My sacred offerings."</i> If he has one of the blemishes that disqualify him because of the impression that could be created, he is not liable for lashes and his service is valid.
Only blemishes that are apparent<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Even blemishes that are ordinarily covered by a person's clothes are considered as apparent.</i> disqualify a person. Blemishes that are within the cavity of the body, e.g., a person's kidney or his spleen was removed or his intestines were perforated, even though he becomes a <i>treifah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A person who will not live more than 12 months.</i> his service is acceptable. [This is derived from the mention, Leviticus 21:19, of] "a broken leg or a broken arm." Just as these are apparent, all [disqualifying blemishes] must be apparent.
An uncircumcised person<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even when there was no transgression in the priest remaining uncircumcised, e.g., an instance when two of his brothers died because of circumcision (Rashi, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 83a).</i> is like a foreigner [as Ezekiel 44:9] states: "Any foreigner<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This term also has the connotation of an idolater.</i> with an uncircumcised heart and uncircumcised flesh."

The Rambam's view is based on <i>Zevachim</i> 18b which maintains that the prohibition was taught by the Oral Tradition. Ezekiel merely provided a support. The Rambam, however, mentions the verse from Ezekiel because of the connection to the non-priest so that there will be a link to an explicit prohibition from the Torah.</i> like a non-priest<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 1.</i> who serves. He is not, however, liable for death.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As a non-priest is (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
A priest who married women sinfully<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., he married a divorcee or another woman forbidden to the priesthood. See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>, chs. 17-19 where these prohibitions are detailed.</i> may not serve<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">These laws have parallels in the present era as well. Such a priest may not recite the Priestly Blessing [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:40)].</i> until he is compelled by the court to take a vow dependent on the discretion of other people so that it cannot be nullified<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since the vow is not being taken dependent on his own discretion, but on that of other people, it cannot be nullified. See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 6:8.</i> that he will not continue to sin. He may then perform the service, descend [from the altar], and divorce her. Similarly, if he would become impure due to contact with a human corpse,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Which is forbidden to a priest, as stated in <i>Hilchot Evel</i>, ch. 1.</i> he is disqualified until he makes a resolution in court not to contract such impurity.

If, however, he does [continue] to serve, he does not desecrate the service. [This is derived from Deuteronomy 33:11]: "May God bless His legion and find acceptable the work of his hand." [implied is that] He will find acceptable even the desecrated among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Challal</i>, "desecrated," and <i>chayl</i>, "legion," share two of the same root letters. Hence the above concept can be derived (<i>Kiddushin</i> 66b).</i>
The High Court would sit in the Chamber of Hewn Stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The presence of the <i>Sanhedrin</i> in this chamber is discussed in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:17 and <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 14:11-12.</i> Their primary ongoing activity was sitting and judging the priests, e.g., examining the lineage of the priests<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 20:2.</i> and inspecting their blemishes. Whenever a disqualifying factor was found in the lineage of a priest, he would put on black clothes and wrap himself in black and leave the Temple Courtyard. Whoever is found to be bodily sound and of acceptable lineage puts on white garments and enters and serves with his priestly brethren.
[A priest] who is discovered to be of acceptable lineage, but was discovered to have a physical blemish should sit in the Chamber of Wood<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Located in the Women's Courtyard; see <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:8.</i> and [removes] worm-eaten wood for the [Altar's] pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">For worm-eaten wood is undesirable.

Chapter 7

There are a sum total of 50 physical blemishes that disqualify both humans and animals. In particular, they are:
Five involving the ear: a) one whose ear lobe has been blemished<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., its substance has been diminished.</i> to the extent that one's nail would become held back by the blemish.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if one would run his nail over the lobe of this person's ear, like one runs his nail over a ritual slaughterer's knife, the progress of his nail would be held back by the blemish. See Rashi, <i>Bechorot</i> 37b.</i> There is, however, no concept of a blemish with regard to the skin which surrounds the lobe of the ear, whether it is perforated, marred, or cracked.
b) one whose ear has cracked to the slightest extent even though its substance has not diminished;<br>c) one whose [ear] lobe has been perforated, [leaving a hole] the size of a carshinah bean.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A small bean about the size of a lentil (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> Whether the hole is round or long, if its area is the size of a carshinah bean, it is considered a blemish.<br>d) one whose ear has dried to the extent that if it was perforated, it would not bleed;<br>e) one whose ear was double.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it appears as if he has two ears, one inside the other.</i> [This applies] even to a goat kid whose ears are often extended and appear double, provided it has two lobes. If, however, it has only one lobe and it appears like one entity that is double-sized, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam's version of the source for this ruling, <i>Bechorot</i> 6:9 differs from the standard printed text of the Mishnah, the interpretation of both versions is the same.</i>
There are three involving the eye-lashes:<br>a) one whose eye-lids are perforated even to the slightest extent;<br>b) one whose eye-lids are cracked even to the slightest extent;<br>c) one whose eye-lids are blemished<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., its substance has been diminished.</i> even to the slightest extent.<br>These three blemishes are included in the term <i>cherutz</i> mentioned in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:22.</i>
There are eight involving the eye:<br>a) one who is blind,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As explicitly mentioned in Leviticus 21:18.</i> whether in one eye or in both eyes;<br>b) one who cannot see from both of his eyes or one of them, even though there is no apparent change in them, because he has water continuously descending into his eyes;<br>c) one who cannot see with both or one of his eyes clearly, because he has continuous nerve deterioration;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on Rav Kapach's version of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 6:3).</i><br>d) one who has a mound like a grape in his eye,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Due to a retinal infection (<i>ibid.</i>:2).</i> even though he can still see;<br>e) one who has cataracts<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the term <i>chilazon nachash</i> mentioned in the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> in his eyes which cover some of the pupil of the eye;<br>f) one who has the white of his eyes extended slightly into the pupil until the pupil is interrupted by the white of the eye. This is the meaning of the term <i>tivlul</i> mentioned in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:20.</i> If, however, the pupil is extended and enters the white of the eye, it is not considered a blemish, for there are no blemishes in the white of the eye;<br>g) one who has a white point in the midst of his pupil. This is the meaning of the term <i>dak</i> mentioned in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Due to a retinal infection (<i>ibid.</i>:2).</i> [The above applies] provided it appears floating on the pupil. If, however, it is not floating, or if it is submerged in the pupil, it is not a blemish. Similarly, if there was a black mark in the midst of the white, even if it appeared to be floating, it is not considered a blemish, for there are no blemishes in the white. If there was a black mark sunk in the pupil, it is also included in the blemish called <i>dak</i>. If, however, it appears to be floating, since it is black within black, it is not considered as a blemish.
There are three involving the nose:<br>a) One whose nose is perforated, even from only one side;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the cartilage between the nostrils is perforated and it is not visible externally, it is not considered as a blemish [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 6:4)].</i><br>b) one whose nose is split;<br>c) one whose nose is blemished.
There are six involving the mouth:<br>a) One whose lip is perforated; this applies even if only one is perforated;<br>b) one whose lip is blemished;<br>c) one whose lip is cracked, provided the surface of the lip is split into two sides;<br>d) one whose lower jawbone extends even the slightest measure further than his upper jawbone;<br>e) one whose mouth is swollen congenitally, as part of the structure of his body.

There are six involving the hands and the feet:<br>a) one who limps;<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As explicitly mentioned in Leviticus 21:18.</i> b) one whose hip has been displaced. This is the meaning of the term <i>serua</i> used by the Torah;<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:18; 22:23.

Even if it is not apparent when he stands, if it is apparent when he walks, it is a blemish;<br>f) one whose legs are swollen congenitally, as part of the structure of his body. If, however, they are swollen because of the wind, it is not considered a blemish.
There are four [types of blemishes] that may occur in any place in the body. They are:<br>a) one who has a dry skin eruption of even the slightest size. This is the meaning of the term <i>gerev</i> mentioned in the Torah;<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:20; 22:22; Leviticus 21:20.</i>
d) Whenever there is a groove made in any bone that is apparent,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., an arm or a leg (<i>Bechorot</i> 40b).</i> it is considered a blemish. It is included in the category <i>charutz</i> mentioned in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:22.</i> The ribs are not considered as bones that are apparent.
There are also three other types of blemishes:<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The laws pertaining to animals with these three blemishes are slightly different than those pertaining to animals with other blemishes. See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 2:6.</i><br>a) an elderly man who has reached the stage that he quivers and trembles when he stands;<br>b) a person who is sick and trembles because of his illness and the weakening of his strength.<br>A <i>treifah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A man or an animal that has a physical infirmity that will cause him to die within twelve months.

c) One who is foul-smelling. A priest who has a foul-smelling odor because of sweat may wash and rub perfume on his flesh and serve. If he has a foul odor emanating from his mouth, he may put pepper, ginger, or the like in his mouth and serve. If, however, he serves while his body is foul-smelling due to sweat or he had bad breath, he desecrates his service like one who has any of the other blemishes.

Chapter 8

There are a total of 90 physical blemishes that [disqualify] humans alone. In particular, they are: There are eight involving the head:<br>a) one who has the center of his forehead depressed below as if it was pushed down with one's hand;<br>b) one who has the center of his forehead raised up above, like an egg;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad (and this is also Rashi's interpretation of <i>Bechorot</i> 43a) differs with the Rambam's interpretation of this disqualifying factor. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that the Rambam had a different version of that Talmudic passage.</i><br>c) one who has the sides of his head emerge toward his face like a hammer;<br>d) one whose head projects outward abnormally from his neck;<br>e) one whose head is abnormally large to the extent that it sits on his neck like a turnip on top of its leaves;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The accompanying drawing is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 7:1). Similarly, all of the disqualifying factors mentioned here are discussed there and in the following mishnah.</i><br>f) one who is bald and has no hair whatsoever on his head. If, however, he has a row of hair extending across the back of his head from ear to ear, it is acceptable.<br>g) a person's whose hair extends from ear to ear on the front of his head, but he is bald on the remainder of his head, he is unacceptable;<br>h) a person whose hair extends around his entire head from the front and the back, but he has no hair on the top of his head. He also is deemed bald and is unacceptable.
There are two involving the neck. They are:<br>a) one whose neck is sunk [into his trunk] so much that it appears to be placed on his shoulders;<br>b) one whose neck is so long that it appears unconnected with his shoulders.
There are four involving the ears. They are:<br>a) one whose two ears are very small;<br>b) one whose two ears are very swollen like sponges;<br>c) one whose ears hang down low;<br>d) one who has one ear differ from another in appearance.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 7:3), the Rambam explains that when a person has a pair of organs, it is expected that they be identical and a deviation is considered a blemish.</i>
There are five involving the eyebrows. They are:<br>a) one who does not have any hair at all on his eyebrows. This is the meaning of the term <i>gibein</i> mentioned in the Torah; <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:20. The Rambam chooses the first interpretation of this term offered by <i>Bechorot</i> 7:2. Rashi follows the second interpretation, overly long eyebrows. In his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam states that the two opinions both agree that these two conditions are blemishes, the difference of opinion between them concerns only the definition of the term <i>gibein</i> in the Torah.</i><br>b) one whose eyebrows hang low;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Reaching his eyelids [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>)].</i><br>c) one who has only one eyebrow;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Some interpret this simply. Others understand it as meaning that the person's two eyebrows are connected above his nose so that they appear as one long eyebrow.</i><br>d) one who has more than two eyebrows;<br>e) one who has one eyebrow that is different in appearance than the other, whether the hair on one is long and on the other, short, or the hair on one is black and, on the other, white or red, since there is a difference in appearance, he is unacceptable.
There are four involving the eyelids. They are:<br>a) one who does not have any hair at all on his eyelids;<br>b) one who has very thick hair on his eyelids;<br>c) one who has an eyelid whose hair is different from that of the other eyelid, e.g., one is black and the other white, one is thin and the other is thick;<br>d) one whose eyelids are closed slightly and do not open wide like those of other people.
There are eleven involving the eyes. They are:<br>a) one whose two eyes are positioned above their appropriate place, close to his forehead;<br>b) one whose two eyes are positioned below their appropriate place;<br>c) one whose two eyes are round and are not extended slightly as other eyes are;<br>d) one whose eyes pop out like the eyes of a tiger and like the eyes of a person who looks at someone when he is very angry;<br>e) one whose eyes are very large, like those of a calf;<br>f) one whose eyes are small, like those of a duck;<br>g) one who is continuously tearing;<br>h) one who has fluid [continuously]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed addition is made on the basis of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 7:3).</i> dripping from the tip of his eyes near his nose or the ends of his eyes near his temples;<br>i) one who contracts his eyelids and squints slightly when he sees light or when he wishes to look at something carefully;<br>j) a person who is cross-eyed to the extent that he sees two storeys of the same building as one.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., while focusing on one storey, he will see the other.</i> This defect can be noticed when such a person is speaking with one person and it appears that he is speaking with another;<br>k) one who has one eye that is different than the other, whether in place, in appearance, e.g., one is black and the other is of mixed color, or one is small and one is large. Since there is a difference between them, he is unacceptable.
There are six involving the nose. They are:<br>a) one whose bridge of the nose is sunken, even [if it is not sunken] to the extent that he can apply ointment to both of his eyes at once.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for most people, the bridge of the nose interposes between one eye and the other and it is impossible to apply ointment to them both in one motion. There are certain individuals whose bridge of the nose is so sunk that they can do so.<br><i>Bechorot</i> 7:3 defines <i>charum</i> as having a bridge of the nose sunk to the extent that the above is possible. Nevertheless, in the Talmud, another opinion is cited which states that as long as the bridge is sunken more than what is ordinary, it is considered a blemish even if it does not reach such an extreme state. The Rambam accepts this view, because it appears to be favored by the Talmud (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> This is the meaning of the term <i>charum</i> mentioned in the Torah;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:18.</i><br>b) one whose middle of the nose projects upward;<br>c) one whose tip of the nose points downward;<br>d) one whose tip of the nose is crooked;<br>e) one whose nose is disproportionately large;<br>f) one whose nose is disproportionately small. How is this measured? With one's pinky. If one's nose is larger or smaller than his pinky, it is considered a blemish.
There are three involving the lips. They are:<br>a) one whose upper lip extends beyond his lower lip;<br>b) one whose lower lip extends beyond his upper lip;<br>c) one whose mouth [hangs] loosely and [hence,] spittle is continually descending from his mouth.
There are three involving the belly. They are:<br>a) one whose belly is swollen;<br>b) one whose navel projects outward, rather that being concave like that of other people;<br>c) one whose breasts are extended and lie on his stomach like the breasts of a woman.
There are three involving the back. They are:<br>a) one whose spine is crooked;<br>b) one who has a vertebra that slipped out of the spinal column, regardless of whether it projected outward, penetrated inward, or slipped to the side. This is included in the term <i>baal chatoteret</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This term is used by the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 7: 1). Although the term is generally interpreted as meaning a hunchback in contemporary Hebrew, the implication above is also included in the Talmudic term.</i>;<br>c) a person with a hunchback. Even though a vertebra has not slipped from its place, this is still considered a blemish.
There are six involving the hands. They are:<br>a) one who has an extra finger on his hands, even if he has six on each hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">And thus the two hands appear the same.</i> If he cuts the extra finger off, he is acceptable.

This is the meaning of the term <i>miruach ashech</i> mentioned in the Torah;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:20.</i>
There are fifteen involving the thighs and the legs. They are:<br>a) one who is bow-legged to the extent that even when he stands with his feet together, his knees will not touch each other;<br>b) one whose ankle-bone projects outward. The ankle bone is the round bone that is above the heel, toward the inside of the body. It resembles the weaving needle with which women weave;<br>c) one whose heel juts outward to the extent that his shin appears to be in the center of his foot;<br>d) some whose feet are wide like a duck's even though they are not webbed like a duck's;<br>e) one who has a projection emerging from his large toe;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam concerning this point. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justify the Rambam's view.</i><br>f) one who has an extra toe on his feet, even if he has six on each foot. If he cuts the extra toe off, he is acceptable, provided it does not have a bone;<br>g) one who is lacking one of the toes of his foot;<br>h) one whose toes are bent over each other;<br>j) one whose toes are webbed until below the joint. If they were connected and he cut and separated them, he is acceptable;<br>k) one whose foot is entirely straight; i.e., the width of his forefoot and his toes is the same as the width of his heels, and they appear as one straight unit;<br>l) one whose foot is curved so that his forefoot and toes and his heel appears as the two ends of a bow;<br>m) one whose foot is hollow; i.e., his mid-foot is upraised above the earth and it is as if he is standing on his heel and his toes;<br>n) one whose ankles click with each other when he walks;<br>o) one whose knees click with each other when he walks;<br>p) one who is left-footed.
There are four that involve the entire body:<br>a) one whose trunk is disproportionately larger than his limbs;<br>b) one whose trunk is disproportionately smaller than his limbs;<br>c) one who is extremely tall;<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bechorot</i> 45b explains that although a tall person is considered attractive, if he is exceptionally tall, people consider it objectionable.</i><br>d) a dwarf, i.e., one who is extremely short, so that they are distinguished from people at large.
There are eight involving the skin.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 34:2) quotes Rashba as stating that in his (medieval) times the size of an <i>isar</i> was already not known. More recently, <i>Middos VeShiurei Torah</i>, p. 169, gives the diameter of an <i>isar</i> as 23 mm. Thus its area would be slightly more than 3.6 cm.</i> but rather of the smallest size;<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since it has hair, it is considered objectionable, regardless of its size.</i><br>g) one who has a facial mole the size of an <i>isar</i> or more;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">If it smaller, it is not that noticeable, and hence, it is not considered a blemish.</i> h) one afflicted with warts, [when] a person's flesh or skin should distend or the fluids in the skin should distend to any part throughout the body, this is a blemish.
There are four other blemishes possible for a human:<br>a) one who is deaf;<br>b) one who is intellectually or emotionally unstable;<br>c) an epileptic, even if his seizures come at far intervals;<br>d) one who suffers from severe depression,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 7:5), the Rambam describes this condition as severe melancholia to the extent that the person's physical functioning is impaired.</i> whether on a consistent basis or from time to time.

Chapter 9

When a non-priest serves in the Temple, his service is invalid and he is liable for death at the hand of heaven, as [Numbers 18:7] states: "A non-priest who draws close will die." According to the Oral Tradition, we have learned that one does not become liable unless he draws close to perform service.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and it does not forbid merely entering the Temple or ascending the Altar.</i> Where is the warning concerning this?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., where is stated the prohibition for which this punishment is given? (<i>Sifri</i>)</i> [<i>Ibid.</i>:4] states: "A non-priest shall not draw close to you."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 74) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 390) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i><br>What is meant by a non-priest? Anyone who is not a male descendant of Aaron, as [Leviticus 1:8] states: "And the sons of Aaron shall arrange" and [Leviticus 3:8] states: "And the sons of Aaron shall set afire." [These service are performed by] "the sons of Aaron" and not the daughters of Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Thus restricting the priestly service to males and excluding females. The Radbaz questions why two verses are necessary to exclude the women of the priestly family. He explains that since they are permitted to partake of <i>terumah</i> and certain sacrificial foods, they are not entirely similar to Israelites. Hence, a second verse is necessary.</i>
Although non-priests are warned not to perform any of the services associated with offering sacrifices, they are liable for death [at the hand of Heaven] only for performing "complete service,"<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Service which is the final stage in a sacrifice being brought to the altar (<i>Yoma</i> 24a).</i> not on service that is followed by other service.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., receiving the blood, carrying the blood or the limbs to the altar.</i> [Thus] a non-priest is liable for death only for four services: a) sprinkling;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 3.</i> b) setting afire [sacrifices on the altar];<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 4.</i> c) pouring water [on the altar] on Sukkot, and d) pouring wine on the altar at all times.
How is one liable for sprinkling?

Rav Yosef Corcus questions why the water libations and the wine libations are considered as separate categories and the sprinkling of blood and oil are not. He explains that the two different libations stem from entirely different commandments. The sprinkling of the oil, by contrast, is not a commandment in its own right, but an ancillary element to the offering of a sacrifice and that sacrifice also involves sprinkling blood. Hence, the two are included in the mitzvah.</i> he is liable for death.
How is one liable for setting afire [sacrifices on the altar]? Whether he set afire limbs [of animal sacrifices], a handful of flour, or of frankincense<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., entities that are usually set afire on the altar.</i> on the altar - or even if he turned over limbs that had not been consumed by fire and hastened their being burnt,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>Sh'vuot</i> 17b states, this applies even if the entity would have ultimately been consumed by fire without his activity, but his act hastens its consumption.</i> he is liable for death, provided he set afire an olive-sized portion of these entities. Similarly, if one sets afire incense on the golden altar, when he sets afire an olive-sized portion,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For one to be liable, a portion of this minimum size is necessary, for an incense offering may not be smaller, as stated in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 5:2. Hence, if he sets afire less, he is not performing service. Even though a larger amount of incense is offered each day, that is a Rabbinic enactment and not a Scriptural requirement (Radbaz).</i> he is liable. In contrast, one who sets fire to incense on Yom Kippur in the Holy of Holies is not liable for death for this until he sets fire to a handful, for that is the measure explicitly [required] by the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:12; <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 5:26. If he sets fire to a lesser amount, he is not performing service. Hence, he is not liable.</i>
[A non-priest] who arranges two logs of wood on the altar's pyre is considered comparable to one who set [sacrificial] limbs afire and he is liable for death [at the hand of heaven for doing so]. For the wood is also considered as a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 14:1. Arranging these two logs is the final stage in the arrangement of wood on the altar. Hence a non-priest is liable (Radbaz).</i><br>In contrast, [a non-priest] who pours [oil onto the flour offerings], one who mixes [the flour offerings with oil],<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Akiva Eiger cites <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:23 which states that the preliminary stages of the offering of a meal offering may be performed by a non-priest.</i> one who breaks [the wafers of meal offerings] into pieces, one who salts [the sacrifices], one who waves [the sacrifices], one who brings [a meal offering] close to the altar, one who arranges the showbread or the bowls of incense on the [golden] table, one who prepares the lamps [of the <i>Menorah</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 7.</i> one who kindles light on the altar, one who takes a fistful [of flour or incense], and one who receives the blood [of a sacrifice], even though he disqualifies his service, he is warned against doing so and is liable for lashes for doing so, he is not liable for death at the hand [of Heaven]. [The rationale is that] all of these services are followed by another service and they do not represent the completion of the offering [of a given sacrifice].
The slaughter of sacrificial animals is acceptable if performed by non-priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:1; <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 1:1.</i> [This applies even to] sacrifices of the most holy order, both individual sacrifices and communal sacrifices, as [Leviticus 1:5] states: "And he shall slaughter the bull before God and the sons of Aaron shall offer it." Implied is that from receiving [the blood], the mitzvah belongs to the priesthood. Similarly, skinning an animal, cutting it up, and bringing wood to the altar are acceptable when performed by non-priests, for with regard to the limbs, [<i>ibid.</i>:9] states: "And the priest shall set afire everything on the altar," this refers to bringing limbs [from sacrificial animals] to the [altar's] ramp. [We may infer that] bringing such limbs requires a priest, but not bringing wood.
Similarly, the kindling of the lamps [of the <i>Menorah</i>] is acceptable<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Even as an initial preference (Radbaz). The Ra'avad differs and maintains that, after the fact, if a non-priest kindled the lamps, it is valid, but as an initial preference, he is not allowed to kindle them. The Radbaz brings support for the Rambam's position from <i>Yoma</i> 24b which states that kindling the lamps of the <i>Menorah</i> is not an act of service. Since it is not an act of service, asks the Radbaz, why should a non-priest be restricted from performing it? How is it different from the slaughter of an animal?<br>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (mitzvah 98) reinforces the Ra'avad's question, asking how is it possible for the <i>Menorah</i> to be lit outside its proper place? The <i>Rambam LeAm</i> explains that the mitzvah is not lighting the lamps, but rather putting the lamps in their place.</i> if performed by a non-priest. Therefore, if a priest cleaned the lamps and brought them outside,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., out from the Temple building to a place in the courtyard where a non-priest is allowed to stand. Note the discussion of the meaning of the term <i>hatavah</i> in <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 3:12 and notes.</i> a non-priest is permitted to kindle them.
The removal of the ashes [from the altar] must be performed by a priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i> 2:10.</i> as [Leviticus 6:3] states: "And the priest will put on his linen fit tunic...." If an Israelite removes [the ash], he is liable for lashes.<br>He is not liable for death [at the hand of Heaven] even though this is a service that is not followed by another service.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 2.</i> [This is derived as follows. The verse that speaks of the punishment of death at the hand of Heaven, Numbers 18:7,] speaks of "work of giving."<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the verse has two connotations: a) that the priestly service is a gift to the priests, b) (and this is the focus here), that the priestly service involves giving: offering sacrificial substances on the altar.</i> [Implied is that] the work of giving must be performed by a priest alone. If a non-priest offered [a sacrifice], he is liable for death. The service of removal<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the removal of the ashes.</i> does not make a non-priest liable for death. Similarly, if a non-priest cleaned the inner altar or the <i>Menorah</i>, he is not liable for death.
[If a non-priest] arranged the wood on the altar, the arrangement should be taken apart and rearranged by a priest, because the [initial] arrangement is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Because arranging the wood is considered sacrificial service (Radbaz). The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> points out that from <i>Yoma</i> 27-28a, one might conclude that it is permitted for a non-priest to arrange the wood of the altar. Nevertheless, according to the Rambam that passage only absolves a non-priest from the punishment of death. It does not grant him permission to arrange the wood.</i>
An impure [priest], one with a disqualifying physical blemish, and one who did not wash his hands or feet<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question why the Rambam omits a priest who does not wear the priestly garments.

An impure priest and one who did not wash his hands and feet are liable for death and one who is physically blemished is liable for lashes (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> except for services that a non-priest is liable for death.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., services that are not followed by other services which involve giving.</i> For other services, he [violates merely] a warning.
A priest who immersed that day<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">And must wait until the evening before performing service.</i> who is lacking atonement,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., a person afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> who must bring an atonement offering before serving.</i> who became impure,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">With another type of impurity.</i> who did not wash his hands and feet and yet served [in the Temple] is liable for each transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since he violated many prohibitions with one act of service, he is liable for a sacrifice for each violation.<br>The Ra'avad cites a <i>Tosefta</i> that does not accept the Rambam's ruling on this point and instead, maintains that he is liable for only one sacrifice. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, support the Rambam's ruling, explaining that each of the prohibitions expands the scope of the obligation. See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 7:2 and <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 8:6 which discusses the ground rules for these concepts.</i> If he was a non-priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Even if he also possessed all the other disqualifying factors.</i> he is liable for lashes only for serving as a non-priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For all of the other prohibitions were given only to a priest.

When a non-priest performs [Temple] service on the Sabbath, he is liable for violating the Sabbath laws<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">For the Temple services involve performance of forbidden labors. These prohibitions are superseded by the obligation to offer the sacrifices, but since a non-priest's service is not valid, he is considered as liable for these prohibited acts.</i> and for serving as a non-priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Here also although a single act is performed, since two different prohibitions are involved, he is liable for both of them. We do not follow the principle: One prohibition does not fall on another prohibition, because the prohibition against performing the Sabbath labors is greater in scope, encompassing other acts besides the Temple service.</i> Similarly, when a priest with a physical blemish serves while ritually impure, he is liable [both] for [serving] while impure and for serving with a blemish.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For the ritual impurity increases the scope of his liability, making him liable also for entering the Temple and partaking of sacrifices. Since it is of a greater scope, we do not follow the principle, one prohibition does not fall on another (Radbaz).</i>
Any priest who served a false deity, whether willingly or inadvertently - even if he repented completely - may never serve in the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">A parallel also exists with regard to the recitation of the priestly blessing. See <i>Hilchot Nesiat Kapayim</i> 15:3. There the Rambam also excludes a priest who was compelled to serve idols and he cites a different prooftext, II Kings 23:9.</i> as [Ezekiel 44:13] states: "They<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The priests who "who distanced themselves from Me during Israel's straying, when they strayed after false deities" (Ezekiel 44:10 .</i> shall not draw near to Me, to serve Me." [This prohibition applies] whether [a priest] serves the false deity in its rites, e.g., he became a priest to the false deity, he bowed down to it, or acknowledged its [divinity] and accepted it as god. [In all these instances,] he is disqualified [to serve in the Temple] forever.<br>If [such a priest] transgressed and performed service, his sacrifice is not considered as a pleasing fragrance<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., though it is not disqualified, it is not considered as desirable.</i> even if he acted inadvertently when he served, bowed down to, or acknowledged [the false deity]. If, by contrast, one slaughtered an animal for a false deity inadvertently and then transgressed and offered a sacrifice [in the Temple], the sacrifice is considered a pleasing fragrance and is accepted, for he did not perform service for the false deity or become its priest; all he did was slaughter an animal for it<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Note a parallel in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 2:15.</i> and that was performed inadvertently. Nevertheless, as an initial preference, he should not perform service [in the Temple].
If one transgressed and built a shrine outside the Temple and offered a sacrifice to God there,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is not speaking about a mere hypothetical situation. As he relates in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 13:10), Chonio, the son of Shimon the Just entered into a power struggle with his brother Shimi to inherit his father's position as High Priest. Chonio incurred the people's wrath, because he brought about a very deprecating situation in the Temple. He fled to Alexandria where he established a following, constructed a temple to God resembling the Temple in Jerusalem, and offered sacrifices there just like those offered in Jerusalem. Needless to say, our Sages shunned Chonio's shrine, because its sacrificial worship violated the prohibition against offering sacrifices outside the Temple. Indeed, the majority of those who worshiped there were non-Jewish Egyptians whom Chonio had attracted to God's service.</i> it is not considered as a Temple to a false deity. Nevertheless, any priest who serves in such a shrine should never serve in the Temple. Similarly, utensils that were used there should never be used in the Temple. Instead, they should be entombed. It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This represents a conclusion reached by the Rambam on the basis of deduction without a prior Rabbinic source.</i> that if a priest who served in such [a shrine] performs service in the Temple, it does not invalidate it.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Since they were disqualified by Rabbinic decree, after the fact, their service is acceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
Thus there are eighteen factors that disqualify [a person] from serving [in the Temple]. They are: a) one who served a false deity;<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 13.</i> b) a non-priest;<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 1.</i> c) one with a disqualifying physical blemish;<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 6, Halachot 1-2.</i> d) one who is uncircumcised;<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:8.</i> e) one who is impure;<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 4, Halachah 1.</i> f) one who immersed that day [and must wait until nightfall to become pure];<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:4.</i> g) one who is lacking atonement;<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:5.</i> h) one who is in a state of acute mourning;<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachah 7.</i> i) one who is intoxicated;<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 1.</i> j) one who is lacking the priestly garments;<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 10:4.</i> k) one who is wearing extra garments;<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:5.</i> l) one whose garments were torn;<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 14.</i> m) one whose hair has grown long;<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:8-9.</i> n) one who did not wash his hands and feet;<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5, Halachah 1.</i> o) one who sits;<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:17.</i> p) one who had an entity intervening between his hand and the sacred utensil [he is using];<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> q) one who had an entity intervening between his foot and the earth;<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> r) one who served with his left hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:18.</i><br>All of the above are disqualified from serving and if they serve, they invalidate their service with the exception of those with long hair, those with torn garments, and one who slaughtered for a false deity inadvertently.
