Mishneh Torah, Vessels of the Sanctuary and Those Who Serve Therein



Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment to prepare<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording here represents a change from his wording in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 35) where he describes the mitzvah in passive terms: "having the oil made in a unique fashion available for anointing." Perhaps he chose that wording for, as explained in Halachah 5, after the oil was made at Moses' command, no other such oil was ever made and the mitzvah was merely "to have it."</i> the anointing oil so that it will be ready [to use] for those articles that require anointing,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 107) includes this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. See the gloss of the Radbaz who explains that anointing the kings and the High Priest is not considered one of the mitzvot, for there were times when this anointment was not practiced.</i> as [Exodus 30:25] states: "And you shall make it<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The mixture of spices mentioned in the previous verses.</i> as the oil of sacred anointment."
While in the desert, Moses our teacher [had]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This addition is necessary, for as indicated by Exodus 37:29, Moses himself did not prepare the anointment oil. It was prepared by Betzalel and the other craftsmen working with him.</i> it prepared. He took the equivalent of 500 <i>shekel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to Scriptural Law, based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 8:8), in modern measure a <i>shekel</i> of the Torah is equivalent to 16 grams of pure silver. Nevertheless, as the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 1:2, in the era of the Second Temple, our Sages increased its measure by almost a fourth. Accordingly, the measure of silver required for the redemption of the firstborn and other obligations where a <i>shekel</i> is required is significantly larger.</i> of the holy <i>shekalim</i> of musk, cinnamon, and costus<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam describes these spices in the following halachah.</i> and the equivalent of 250 <i>shekel</i> of fragrant cane. The Torah's statement [<i>ibid.</i>:23]: "And fragrant cinnamon, half its measure, 250," implies that [the entire quantity] should be weighed out in two measures, 250 each time. Each one should be ground separately, mixed together<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the obligation to grind the herbs is derived from a comparison to the incense offering. The order in which they are ground and then mixed is a logical deduction. If they are ground first, they will be mixed more thoroughly and more effectively.</i> and then soaked in pure, sweet water until all of its power was extracted into the water. A <i>hin</i> - which is equivalent to twelve <i>log</i> with each <i>log</i> comprising four <i>revi'iot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A common halachic measure equivalent to approximately 86 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and approximately 150 cc according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>. Thus a <i>hin</i> is 48 times this amount.</i> - of oil was placed above the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For the oil will float above the water.</i> The entire mixture was then cooked over fire until the water boiled off and only the oil remained.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, the amount of oil used would not be sufficient to soak all the herbs (Rashi, in his commentary to Exodus 30:24 .</i> It was then set aside for [future] generations.
Musk refers to the blood contained with a wild beast from India that is of universal renown which people everywhere use as a fragrance.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to a secretion of the abdominal gland of the male musk deer, a large animal that roams the mountains of Nepal and Tibet. The secretion is reddish-brown, with a honeylike consistency and a strong fragrance. After the gland is cut open, the secretion hardens, assumes a blackish-brown color, and when dry becomes granular.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's definition, stating that it is improper that the blood of a beast - and certainly, a non-kosher beast - be used in the Sanctuary. He interprets the term <i>mor</i> as referring to the fragrant herb, myrrh. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's view, explaining that the loathsome quality one would associate with the blood of a beast departs from it when the secretion dries and becomes granular. See also the Ramban's commentary to Exodus 30:23, where he discusses both positions.</i> Cinnamon is a tree that comes from the Indian islands which has a pleasant fragrance and which people use as incense. The term <i>kidah</i> refers to costus.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">It is the root of a tall herb, whose botanical name is <i>Saussurea lappa</i>, which even today grows only in the highlands of Kashmir.</i> Fragrant cane, this refers to thin canes<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In his notes to his translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Keritot</i> 1:1), Rav Kapach identifies this as the acorus calamus plant. In his Living Torah, Rav Aryeh Kaplan identifies this as the cymbopogon martini or palmarosa plant.</i> like red straw that come from the Indian islands and have a pleasant fragrance. They are types of herbs which doctors place in balsam.
One who willfully prepares anointing oil in this manner and with these measurements without adding or reducing [the quantity of the herbs] is liable for <i>karet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the soul's being cut off. This involves premature death in this world (before the age of 50, <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 28a) and the soul not meriting a portion in the world to come (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1).<br><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 83) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 109) includes the prohibition against making such oil among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> If he prepares it unknowingly, he must bring a fixed sin-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The term "fixed sin-offering" is used to differentiate between this offering and "an adjustable guilt offering" in which instance, the offering the person brings changes according to his financial capacity. See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:4.</i> [as <i>ibid.</i>:34] states: "One who makes such a compound shall be cut off from his nation." [The above applies] provided he prepared it for anointment. If, however, he prepared it for practice or to give to other people,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even if those people desire to use it for anointment. As long as he personally does not intend to use it for anointment, he is not liable (Radbaz).</i> he is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the act is forbidden, but he is not liable.</i>
One who anoints himself with an olive-sized portion<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For to be liable, one must benefit from a minimum measure and that minimum measure is, as is true with regard to partaking of forbidden substances, an olive-sized portion.</i> of the oil of anointment willfully is liable for <i>karet</i>. If he [anoints himself] unknowingly, he must bring a fixed sin-offering, [as <i>ibid.</i>] states: "And one who applies it to an unauthorized person,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., someone other than a High Priest, a king, and the priest who lead the people in war, as stated in Halachah 7.</i> shall be cut off from his nation."<br>One is liable only for anointing oneself with the oil of anointment made by Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">And not a copy, even if it was made in the exact same manner.</i> as the prooftext states "from it," from [the oil] of which [<i>ibid.</i>:31] states "This will be oil for sacred anointing for Me." No other [anointing] oil was ever made aside from that made by Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">That oil remained throughout the majority of the First Temple period until it was entombed by King Josiah together with the ark, as the Rambam relates in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 4:1. From that point onward, neither the High Priests or kings were anointed.<br>On the surface, one might ask: Since no other oil was ever made, why is making the oil considered one of the 613 mitzvot? For as the Rambam clarifies several times in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, if an obligation is not ongoing, it is not appropriate to consider it as a mitzvah. On that basis, a number of commands, for example, the command to wage war against Midian (Numbers 7:2 , were excluded from this reckoning.<br>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (positive mitzvah 107) notes that the prooftext quoted by the Rambam concludes "for your generations," i.e., for all time. The mitzvah was to have the oil made by Moses available at all time. After the oil was entombed by King Josiah, new oil was not made, because the oil which Moses made is still available. At the coming of <i>Mashiach</i>, that oil will surface and again be used.</i>
[One is liable] whether he anoints himself or others,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz maintains that if the others willfully allow the oil to be applied to their flesh, they are also liable. The <i>Tosefta, Makkot,</i> ch. 3, also rules in this manner.</i> as [the prooftext] states: "And one who applies it to an unauthorized person." One who spreads it on utensils, an animal, a gentile - who is [halachicly equivalent] to an animal<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Kiddushin</i> 68a; <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 2:9.</i> - or who spreads it on a corpse, is exempt, as [implied by <i>ibid.</i>:32]: "It should not be spread on the flesh of a man."<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">And none of the above are halachicly equivalent to a man.</i>
For all time,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in contrast to the era of Moses where this oil was also used to anoint the priestly garments and the vessels of the Sanctuary, as stated in Halachah 12.</i> we do not [use this oil] except to anoint the High Priest, the priest who leads the nation in war,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i>, ch. 7, which states that a priest is appointed to speak before the nation and inspire them in war.</i> and kings from the House of David.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The kings of the ten tribes, by contrast, were not anointed with this anointing oil, only balsam oil, as stated in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:10. According to the Rambam (<i>ibid.</i>:7), King Saul was also anointed with this oil. He is not mentioned, because his regal line did not continue for posterity.</i> Even a High Priest who is the son of a High Priest should be anointed,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, the kings were anointed only when there is a dispute over the inheritance or during a civil war (<i>ibid.</i>:12 and Halachah 11 of this chapter).</i> as [Leviticus 6:15] states: "The priest from his sons anointed in place of him...."
Since there was no anointing oil [during] the Second Temple [era],<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, the anointing oil was entombed toward the conclusion of the First Temple Era.</i> the High Priest was installed in his office by putting on the garments of the High Priest alone.
How was the High Priest anointed? The oil should be poured on his head and applied between his eyes in the form of the Greek letter <i>chi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Our text follows the manuscript versions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and the manuscript versions of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 6:3). Most of the later printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> replace the C with an X, for in fact, this is the form of the Greek letter. <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> suggests that although the Rambam speaks about the Greek letter, perhaps his intent was the Roman letter.</i> like this C as [Leviticus 8:12] states: "And he poured the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him." The kings of the Davidic dynasty are anointed [with the oil] spread as a crown on their foreheads.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The translation of <i>rosho</i> as "forehead" rather than "head," is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Keritot</i> 1:1).</i> They should not be anointed on other places [on their bodies], nor should one use an excessive amount of oil.
A person who places the anointing oil on a king or High Priest who had been anointed previously is exempt, for [the prooftext] speaks of "one who applies it to an unauthorized person." And these individuals are not unauthorized with regard to this oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For we are obligated to apply it to them.</i><br>If, however, one - even a king or a High Priest - spreads it [on his flesh], he is liable, for [the prooftext] states: "It should not be spread on the flesh of a man." This implies all men.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Including a High Priest or king.</i> When a High Priest takes the anointment oil from his head and spreads it on his belly, he is liable for <i>karet</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the oil was placed on his flesh, since it should not have been applied to this portion of the body, doing so is included in the above prohibition.</i> provided he spreads an olive-sized portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to this qualification, maintaining that once he places an olive-sized portion of the oil on his skin, he is liable even if he spreads a smaller measure. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that the simple meaning of <i>Keritot</i> 6b appears to support the Ra'avad's position. Nevertheless, they also provide interpretations that support the Rambam's understanding.</i>
A king should only be anointed next to a spring.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Horiot</i> 12a explains that the king was anointed there as an sign that his dynasty should be perpetuated, just as a stream continues in a never-ending flow. This symbolism is only appropriate for kings of the Davidic dynasty, whose dynasty will continue for-ever. In contrast, the dynasties of the kings of Israel will eventually be interrupted [see <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:9 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)].<br>Accordingly, King David ordered that Solomon be anointed at the Gichon Stream (1 Kings 1:33 .</i> We do not anoint the king who is the son of a king, for the kingship is a hereditary position for the king for all time,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">When mentioning this law, <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:7 continues: "Not only the monarchy, but all other positions of authority and appointments in Israel, are transferred to one's children and grand-children as inheritances forever." The order of inheritance of the crown follows the order of inheritance of property as explained in <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i>, ch. 1. The first in line for the monarchy are the deceased king's sons, in order of age. Should none of his sons be alive, the right is passed to his grandchildren. The children of the elder son are granted preference. If the king has no male descendents, the monarchy is given to his brothers. If they are not alive, it is granted to their sons. From them, the right to the throne passes to the deceased king's nephews (his sister's sons), then to his uncles, to his first cousins.</i> as [Deuteronomy 17:20] states: "[Thus] he and his descendants [will prolong their reign] in the midst of Israel." If there is a controversy, he should be anointed to resolve the controversy and to notify to all that he alone is the king, as Solomon was anointed because of the controversy [stirred up by] Adoniyahu.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">1 Kings, Chapter l, describes Adoniyahu's abortive attempt to declare himself as David's successor.</i> Yoash was anointed because of Atal'ya,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings, Chapter 11, describes Atal'ya's murder of the children of King Achazyahu, her assumption of the throne, and the revolt which established Yoash as king.</i> and Yehoachaz was anointed because of his brother Yehoyakim.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoachaz was younger than Yehoyakim. Nevertheless, he was given the throne, because he was more capable than his brother, and better suited to serve in his father's position. See the commentaries to II Kings, ch. 23.</i> When Elisha had Yehu anointed,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See II Kings, ch. 9.</i> he did not have him anointed with the anointment oil, but with balsam oil. This is an accepted tradition among the sages.
All of the vessels of the Sanctuary that were fashioned [at the command] of Moses were sanctified only by being anointed with the anointing oil,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz uses this concept to reinforce his thesis that the Rambam does not consider applying the anointing oil as a mitzvah, because it did not apply for all time.</i> as [Numbers 7:1] states: "And he anointed them and sanctified them." This practice was not followed in the coming generations. Instead, all of the utensils became sanctified when they were used for their purpose in the Temple, as [implied by Numbers 4:12] "...that they will serve with them in the Sanctuary," i.e., through service, they are sanctified.
The spoons and the bowls used to contain the meal offerings and similarly, the basins used to receive the blood, and the other vessels used [in the Sanctuary] were all made of silver and gold. It was permitted to make them from other metals, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:18-19. There the Rambam explains that it is preferable to make them from precious metals. Nevertheless, if this is beyond the financial capacity of the community, they can be made from base metals. Indeed, when the Hasmoneans conquered Jerusalem, it is said that they first made a <i>Menorah</i> of iron coated with tin.</i> They receive their holiness by being used for the [desired] tasks. If they were broken, they should be smelted down and another utensil made from them,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Note a similar ruling in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 8:21.</i> for their holiness never departs from them.
If the sacred utensils became perforated or cracked, the cracks are not plugged close. Instead, the utensils should be smelted down and new utensils made.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For patchwork is not becoming to the Temple.</i>
When a knife has become dislodged from its shaft or blemished, it is not returned to its shaft, nor is it sharpened. Instead, it should be entombed on the side of the Temple, between the Sanctuary and the Entrance Hall on the south<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This portion of the Temple was called <i>Beit HaChalafot</i>, "the Chamber of the Knives," for this reason (<i>Middot</i> 4:7).</i> and new ones should be made. For [conduct bespeaking] poverty is not [appropriate] in a place where wealth [is in place].
There were two containers for dry measure in the Temple: an <i>isaron</i> and a half an <i>isaron</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>isaron</i> is the size of 43.2 eggs. According to modern measure, the size of an egg is considered to be 57.6 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 99.5 cc according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> The <i>isaron</i> was for the meal offering<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:5, the meal offerings were measured out using an <i>isaron</i> as the basic measure.</i> and the half <i>isaron</i> to separate the meal offering brought by the High Priest every day.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>ibid.</i> 12:4, 13:2, each day the High Priest would bring a meal offering and he would divide it in half. Half was offered in the morning, and half in the afternoon.</i>
There were seven containers of liquid measure: a <i>hin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 2.</i> a half a <i>hin</i>, a third of a <i>hin</i>, a fourth of a <i>hin</i>, a <i>log</i>, a half a <i>log</i>, and a fourth of a <i>log</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, a <i>revi'it</i>, a fourth of a <i>log</i>, is a common halachic measure equivalent to approximately 86 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and approximately 150 cc according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i><br>Why were there measures of a half a <i>hin</i>, a third of a <i>hin</i>, a fourth of a <i>hin</i>? To measure out the wine libations for the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">As Numbers 28:14 states, the wine libation for a bull was half a <i>hin</i>, for a ram, one third of a <i>hin</i>, and for a ewe, one fourth of a <i>hin</i>. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbonot</i> 2:4.</i> A <i>log</i> was necessary to measure the oil for the meal offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbonot</i> 12:7, a <i>log</i> of oil is poured over all the different meal offerings.</i> A half a <i>log</i> was necessary to measure out the oil for every lamp of the lamps of the <i>Menorah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 3:11, this quantity of oil was placed in the lamps every day of the year.</i> And a fourth [of a <i>log</i>] to divide the oil for [the High Priest's] <i>chavitan</i> offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">For as indicated by <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 13:3, a fourth of a <i>log</i> of oil is poured on each of the cakes the High Priest brings.</i>
There is nothing that is measured with a <i>hin</i>. Why [then] was it there? [It remained, because] it had been in the Sanctuary from the time of Moses who used it to measure the oil for the anointing oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 2 above.</i> With the measure of a half a <i>log</i> that was in the Temple, water was measured for the <i>Sotah</i> water<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>sotah</i>, a woman accused of adultery, was forced to drink water in which a scroll containing a curse with God's name had been blotted out. See <i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 3:9.</i> and oil for the thanksgiving offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbonot</i> 9:20, a <i>log</i> of oil was used in the baking processes of the different types of wafers used for this offering. <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> asks: Since there were specific measures employed in making each type of wafer, why weren't smaller measures used to measure out this oil?</i> With the measure of a fourth [of a <i>log</i>], oil was measured for the bread brought by a nazirite<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 9:23, a fourth of a <i>log</i> of oil was used in the preparation of this bread.</i> and water for the purification of a <i>metzora</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">A person with a physical affliction similar to - but not identical with - leprosy. As related in <i>Hilchot Tuma'at Tzara'at</i> 11:1, as part of such a person's purification process, a bird was slaughtered and its blood poured over water.</i> It is not that through these deeds the measures became sanctified,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., receiving the blood of a sacrificial animal is an act of service. Therefore it consecrates the container. Preparing the meal offerings, by contrast, is not an act of service. Therefore it does not sanctify the container.</i> but rather because of the tasks [performed] in the Sanctuary that were mentioned [in the preceding halachah].
All of these measures are consecrated and are considered as sacred utensils. [There is, however a difference between them.] The liquid measures were anointed on both the inside and the outside, while the dry measures were anointed only on the inside. Therefore the overflow of the liquid measures was consecrated,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Because it had touched a sacred utensil, the outside of the measure. These liquids were collected and used as libations or sold and the proceeds used to bring sacrifices for the altar. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbonot</i> 2:9-11.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 3:20.</i> and the overflow of the dry measures was not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Because it never touched a sacred utensil.</i>

Chapter 2

The incense offering was prepared every year. Preparing it fulfills a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As the Radbaz states, the Rambam does not consider the preparation of the incense offering as a separate mitzvah. Indeed, in his Sefer HaMitzvos, General Principle 10, he explains that preparing the incense offering should not be considered as a separate mitzvah, for until it is actually offered it is an incomplete act. The mitzvah of bringing the incense offering is mentioned in <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 3:1.</i> as [Exodus 30:34] states: "And you take spices...." Four of the spices are explicitly mentioned in the Torah. They are balsam,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam defines the terms mentioned here in Halachah 4.</i> onycha, storax, and frankincense. The others were communicated as a halachah communicated to Moses at Sinai.
[The requirement for] eleven spices was communicated to Moses at Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., through the principles of Biblical exegesis, our Sages (<i>Keritot</i> 8b) derived that the incense offering contained this number of spices.</i> They would prepare them with an exact weight and add to them - without weighing them: Salt of Sodom,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Although a measure of volume was mentioned for Salt of Sodom (see the following halachah), a measure of weight was not.</i> Jordanian amber,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Amber is the fossilized resin from ancient forests. The resin becomes buried and fossilized through a natural polymerization of the original organic compounds. Heating amber will soften it and eventually it will burn, producing a pleasant fragrance. Others identify <i>kipat hayardein</i> with roses. Living Torah refers to it as cycla men, an attractive flower that grows in the Mediterranean region.</i> and an herb that would produce smoke. Only select people would know its identity and that knowledge was conveyed as halachah from person to person.
This is the weight of the eleven spices: balsam, onycha, storax, frankincense, 70 <i>maneh</i> from each one. A <i>maneh</i> is 100 <i>dinarim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>dinar</i> is 76.8 grams (81.6 grams according to a more stringent view) in modern measure.</i>musk, cassia, spikenard, and saffron, 16 <i>maneh</i>, costus, 12 <i>maneh</i>, cinnamon, 9 <i>maneh</i>, Ceylonese cinnamon 3 <i>maneh</i>. The weight of the entire mixture was 368 <i>maneh</i>.<br>The entire mixture was ground very thin. A fourth of a <i>kab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A measure of volume equal to 1376 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, 2400 cc according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> of the salt of Sodom and a small amount of Jordanian amber and the smoke raising herb were added. A <i>maneh</i> of it was burned every day<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Half a <i>maneh</i> in the morning and half in the afternoon.</i> on the golden altar. There were 365 <i>maneh</i>, corresponding to the 365 days of the year. The three remaining <i>maneh</i> were ground again on the day before Yom Kippur very finely for [the High Priest] to take a handful to offer on Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the Holy of Holies. See <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 4:1.</i> The remainder is the remainder of the incense that was mentioned in <i>[Hilchot] Shekalim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">365 portions of incense were prepared although an ordinary lunar year has 353, 354, or 355 days. Hence, at the end of the year, there was a certain amount left over. In <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 4:12, the Rambam writes that on Rosh Chodesh Nissan, the remainder of the incense was redeemed and then given to the craftsmen who prepared it. Afterwards, it was repurchased from them. Thus when a leap year was declared, there was enough incense.</i>
<i>Nataf</i> mentioned by the Torah are the balsam trees that produce balsam oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Balsam is an evergreen tree whose sap has a very pleasant fragrance.</i> Onycha is <i>tziporen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The claw or nail of the strombus or wing-shell, a shell-fish common in the Red Sea.

An equation is established between that oil and the incense offering.</i> When one prepares the incense offering from unconsecrated ingredients or in an unconsecrated utensil, it is unacceptable.
Twice a year, the incense would be returned to the grinder.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">To grind it again, lest it have solidified.</i> In the summer, it would be spread out so that it would not become musty.

If one prepared it little by little in appropriate proportions, it is acceptable. Even if one prepared half [a <i>maneh</i>] in the morning and half in the afternoon, [it is acceptable].
When a person prepares incense from these eleven spices according to these proportions to smell its fragrance, he is liable for <i>karet</i> for its preparation<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 85) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 110) consider the prohibition against preparing incense for its fragrance as one of the Torah's 613 commandments.</i>if he prepared it willfully, even if he did not actually smell its fragrance. If he did so inadvertently, he is liable for a fixed sin offering. Even if he did not prepare the entire quantity [of 368 <i>maneh</i>], but merely a half or a third, since he prepared it according to the above proportions, he is liable for <i>karet</i>, as [Exodus 30:38] states: "You shall not make [incense] for yourselves according to its formula. Anyone who prepares [incense] like this to smell its fragrance shall be cut off from his people."
If he prepared it to learn or with the intent of giving it to the community, he is not liable. If he smelled its fragrance, but did not prepare it, he is not liable for <i>karet</i>.

In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, however, the Rambam writes that the mitzvah for all time was to have the ark carried by the priests and not the Levites. Indeed, the narrative of the ark being carried in Joshua 3:6 and II Samuel 15:25 corroborates this thesis. (The Ramban explains that this does not contradict the Biblical command, because the priests are also descendants of Kehot.) The reason the mitzvah was fulfilled by the Levites while the Jews journeyed through the desert is because there were not enough priests to carry the ark at that time.</i> Since David forgot and had it transported on a wagon, there was an outbreak [of Divine anger] at Uzzah.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">As the Bible relates, II Samuel, ch. 6, God vented His anger for the transgression on Uzzah, causing his death.</i> Instead, it is a mitzvah to carry it on one's shoulders, as [Numbers 7:9] states: "For the holy task is their obligation.

Chapter 3

The descendants of Levi were singled out for service in the Sanctuary, as [Deuteronomy 10:8] states: "At that time, God separated the tribe of Levi."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Hilchot Shemitah VeYovel</i> 13:12 which states:<br>Why did the Levites not receive a portion in the inheritance of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and in the spoils of war like their brethren? Because they were set aside to serve God and minister unto Him and to instruct people at large in His just paths and righteous judgments, as [Deuteronomy 33:10] states: "They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Torah to Israel." Therefore they were set apart from the ways of the world.<br></i> It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 23) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 394) include this mitzvah in their reckoning of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> for the Levites to be free and prepared for the service of the Sanctuary, whether they desire to do so or not,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifri</i> to the prooftext quoted states that they can be compelled to do so against their will.</i> as [Numbers 18:23] states: "And the Levite shall perform the service of the tent of meeting."

Their service was to guard the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>, ch. 8, which describes the guarding of the Temple.</i> Among [the Levities], there were gate-keepers<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See I Chronicles 9:17-26 which lists the Levites who served this function. The guards would serve as watchmen and not perform any physical work. The gatekeepers performed physical activities, opening the gates, closing them, and locking them.</i> who would open the gates of the Temple and close its doors. And there were singers who would accompany the sacrifices with song each day. [The latter concept is derived from the exegesis of Deuteronomy 18:7]: "And he shall serve in the name of God, his Lord, as all of his Levite brethren." Which service involves [invoking] the name of God? I would say: song.<br>When were songs recited? At the time that the wine libations<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i>, loc. cit., associates the wine libations with song, stating: "Song is recited only over wine." See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 6:5.</i> [accompanying] all the communal burnt offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the daily offerings and the special offerings brought on Sabbaths, Rashei Chadashim, and holidays.</i> and the peace offerings brought on Shavuous,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As a prooftext for this concept, <i>Arachin</i> 11b cites Numbers 10:10: "And you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over peace offerings."

A Levite who is in an acute state of mourning<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a close relative died that day (<i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 2:9).</i> is permitted to perform his service and sing.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to a priest who may not offer a sacrifice while in such a state (<i>Ibid.</i>:6).</i> There should never be less than twelve Levites<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 13b explains that there were at least twelve musical instruments playing each day.

The songs were sung vocally without musical instruments, for the fundamental dimension of the song is vocalization. Others would stand on [the <i>duchan</i>] and play melodies with musical instruments: some of them were Levites and some of them were Israelites of distinguished lineage, fit to marry into the priesthood. For only a person of distinguished lineage was allowed to ascend to the <i>duchan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, the fact that a person had served on the <i>duchan</i> is a sign of his lineage.</i> The people who play musical instruments are not included in the number of the twelve singers [required].
On what instruments would they play? On lyres, flutes, harps, trumpets, and a cymbal.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 2:3), the Rambam describes these instruments at length.</i> There should not be less than two lyres, nor more than six. There should not be less than two flutes, nor more than twelve. There should not be less than two trumpets, nor more than one hundred and twenty.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, II Chronicles 5:12 speaks of 120 trumpeters.</i> There should not be less than nine harps and there is no upper limit. There should only be one cymbal.
On all the days of the festivals and on the <i>Rashei Chadashim</i>, the priests would sound the trumpets while the sacrifice was being offered and the Levites would recite songs, as [Numbers 10:10] states: "On the day of your celebration, on your festivals, and at the beginning of your months, you shall sound the trumpets."<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The preceding verse speaks of sounding the trumpets as an outcry of distress. This mitzvah is described in <i>Hilchot Ta'aniot</i>, ch. 1. In his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 59), the Rambam writes that the two soundings of the shofar are considered as a single mitzvah.</i><br>Each trumpet was made from a block of silver.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 10:2 speaks of beating out the silver and forming trumpets in that manner.</i> If it was made from scraps of silver, it is acceptable.

Twelve days a year, the flute would be sounded before the altar:<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., on these days, the Levites would sing the Hallel and be accompanied by the flutes alone. On the other days of the year, they would be accompanied by the other instruments (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> During the slaughter of the first Paschal sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">On the 14th of Nissan.</i> and during the second Paschal sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., on <i>Pesach Sheni</i>, on the 14th of Iyar.

A Levite may not enter the Temple Courtyard to perform his service until he studied for five years beforehand. [This concept is derived as follows. Numbers 8:24] states: "This is [the edict] with regard to the Levites: From the age of 25..." and [<i>ibid.</i> 4:30] states: "From the age of 30...." How can [this apparent contradiction be resolved]? They study for five years and they do not enter the service until they fully mature and attain manhood [as <i>ibid.</i>:19] states: "Each man to his service."<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As evident from Chapter 5, Halachah 15, the attainment of manhood mentioned here apparently refers to reaching the age of Bar Mitzvah. Hence the commentaries question the Rambam's statements, for they apparently contradict his statement made previously, that a Levite must be 30 to begin his service. The Radbaz and Rav Yosef Corcus explain that the obligation to be 30 applied only when the Sanctuary was being transported. (Just as the disqualification at age 50 applied only in the era when the Sanctuary was transported [see the following halachah], so too, it is reasonable to postulate that the obligation to be 30 applied only then.) In other eras, all that was necessary was that the Levite study the necessary laws for five years.</i>
The Torah's statement [Numbers 8:25]: "At the age of 50, he will turn back from the ranks of the workers [of the Sanctuary]," applied only in the era when the Sanctuary was carried from place to place. It is not an [ongoing] mitzvah for future generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot,</i>, General Principle 3, which mentions this issue.</i> For future generations, a Levite is not disqualified because of age or because of physical blemishes,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As a priest is (see <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i>, ch. 6).</i> only due to a change in voice,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 24a states that the Levites on the <i>duchan</i> must sing in a manner that their voices sound like one voice. If the voice of a particular Levite becomes spoiled and he is no longer capable of singing in this manner, he is unfit to perform this service.</i> i.e., if his voice spoils because of his advanced age, he is disqualified from serving in the Temple. It appears to me that he is disqualified only from serving as a singer, but he could become one of the doorkeepers.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, even in the era when the Sanctuary was transported, an elderly person was disqualified only from carrying it. He could serve as a watchman or a singer even then (<i>Har HaMoriah</i>).</i>
Samuel the Seer and King David divided the Levites into 24 watches.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 27a derives this concept from I Chronicles 9:22.</i> Each week, a different watch would serve [in the Temple]. The head of the watch would divide all the men of the watch into different "clans."

[This prohibition implies] that they should not draw close to the service [of the Sanctuary], but they may touch [the sacred utensils].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from the law mentioned in <i>Hilchot Mitamei Mishkav UMoshav</i> 11:11 that when the table for the Showbread was displayed to the people, they were warned not to touch it lest it become impure. One can infer that there is no difficulty in touching it per se, only in making it impure (<i>Har HaMoriah</i>).<br>The commentaries have noted that Numbers 4:15 specifically mentions that the Levites should not touch the sacred utensils and that doing so was punishable by death. It is, however, possible to explain that this stringency only applied during the time the Sanctuary was transported through the desert and not in subsequent generations.</i>
Just as the Levites were warned not to perform the service of the priests,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in the previous halachah.</i> so too, the priests are warned not to perform the work of the Levites, as [the above verse] states: "Also they,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Levites.</i> also you [shall not die]."<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The priests.</i> Similarly, the Levites themselves were warned that each one should not perform the task incumbent on a colleague.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative mitzvah 72) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 389) include the prohibition against performing service designated for someone else in their reckoning of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> Thus a singer should not assist<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's ruling, because according to <i>Arichin</i> 11b, the source for the Rambam's ruling, it would appear that someone who merely renders assistance is not liable for violating a Scriptural commandment.</i> a door-keeper, nor a door-keeper a singer, as [<i>ibid.</i> 4:49] states: "Every man, according to his service and his burden."

Chapter 4

The priests were set aside from the Levites as a whole [to perform] the sacrificial service, as [I Chronicles 23:13] states: "And Aaron was set apart to sanctify him as holy of holies." It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 32) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 269) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to distinguish the priests, make them holy, and prepare them for the sacrifices, as [Leviticus 21:8] states: "And you shall sanctify him because he offers the food of your God."
It is necessary for every Jewish person to show them much honor and to give them priority for every matter of holiness, to begin [reading] the Torah first,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to receive the first <i>aliyah</i> in the public reading of the Torah. In the Talmudic era (and so is the practice in some communities today), the person receiving the <i>aliyah</i> would himself read from the Torah.</i> to recite the blessings first,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to recite the blessing <i>HaMotzi</i> and to lead the Grace (Rashi, <i>Gittin</i> 59b).</i> and to take a desirable portion first.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 5:8), the Rambam emphasizes that this applies only when there are no sages present whose knowledge surpasses that of the priest. If such sages are present, they are given priority.</i>
Moses divided the priests into eight watches: four from Elazar and four from Itamar. This continued until [the days of] Samuel the prophet. At that time, he and King David divided them into 24 watches.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">More particularly, Samuel divided them into 16 watches and David, into 24 (<i>Ta'anit</i> 27a).</i> For each watch, there was one who served as the leader. A watch would ascend to Jerusalem to serve for the entire week. They would switch on the Sabbath day. The previous watch would depart and the one which follows would enter.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The changing of the watches was marked by the division of the showbread. The entering watch would receive six loaves and the departing watch, six loaves. See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 4:12.</i> [This cycle would continue] until its completion and then they would start again.
It is a positive commandment for all the watches to share equal status<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 36) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 509) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>There is, however, a difference between the definition of the mitzvah here and that of <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. In that source, the Rambam describes the mitzvah as creating the watches, while here he defines it as allowing all of the watches to serve during the festivals.</i> during the pilgrimage festivals. Any one of the priests who comes during the pilgrimage festivals and desires to serve [in the Temple] may serve and receive a portion [of the sacrifices]. We do not tell him: "Go and [wait] until your watch [receives its turn]," as [Deuteronomy 18:6] states: "When the Levite<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">All the commentaries agree that this verse is referring to a priest, who is a descendant of the tribe of Levi. See the conclusion of Halachah 6.</i> will come from one of your cities... [to the place that God will choose, he shall serve..."].
In which context does the above apply? With regard to the sacrifices of the festivals,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this refers both to the communal offerings required to be offered on the festivals and the individual offerings which people would bring as part of their pilgrimage obligations.</i> the division of the showbread,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 4:12.</i> and the two loaves [offered on] Shavuot.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i> 8:11.</i> Vowed offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A pledge to bring a particular type of sacrifice (see <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:2).</i> freewill offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">A pledge to bring a designated animal as a sacrifice (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and the daily offerings are offered only by the watch that serves at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although all the priests had license to come and serve in the Temple during the pilgrimage festivals, there was also one watch which was designated to serve at that time, and that watch was entrusted with offering these sacrifices.</i> [This applies] even during the pilgrimage festivals, as [<i>ibid.</i>:8] states: "Portion for portion shall they eat, except for what was transacted by the ancestors." The implication is that they will partake "portion for portion" of the communal offerings, but not of the other sacrifices. For these were already divided by their ancestors and established for each watch in its week.
Similarly, the service involved with the showbread is performed by the watch whose turn is established. The service involved with the two breads [of Shavuos] is performed by all the watches.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between the two is that the showbread is not offered because of the festival (but is instead, an ongoing obligation for every Sabbath), while the two loaves are (Radbaz).</i><br>How do we know that [the verse cited above] is speaking only about the festivals?

Similarly, when a priest has a sacrifice [of his own], he may come to the Temple and offer it on any day that he desires,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if it is not the time when his watch was designated to serve.</i> as [that verse] states: "He shall come at any [impulse] of his heart's desires and serve."

The Radbaz explains that the Rambam's intent is that a priest with physical blemishes should receive the meat. The hide, however, belongs to the priests who offered it.</i>
If the sacrifice belonged to the High Priest and he was in a state of acute mourning,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">His mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter, or wife died that day.</i> he may give it to any priest he desires.

The head of every watch divides his watch into clans<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz implies that the division was a creative one and that each week, the head of the watch would make a division according to his perception of the needs of the Temple service for that week.</i> so that [the priests] in each clan will serve on one of the days of the week, one on one day, another on the next, and another on the next. Each of the clans had a head who was appointed over it.
A High Priest is appointed<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">By the High Court of 71 judges as stated in Halachah 15.</i> [to serve as] the head of all of the priests. He is anointed with the anointing oil<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Described in Chapter 1, in particular, Halchot 7 and 9.</i> and clothed in the garments of the High Priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The eight garments described in Chapter 8, Halachot 1-2. An ordinary priest wears four priestly garments and the High Priest, eight.</i> as [Leviticus 21:10] states: "And the priest who was elevated over his brethren, over whose head was poured [the anointment oil]...." If there is no anointment oil,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As was the case in the latter years of the First Temple and throughout the Second Temple period (see Chapter 1, Halachah 8).</i> he is initiated into office merely by [wearing] the garments of the High Priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>marbeh begadim</i>, literally, "increased [his] garments," is used to described this initiation, because he is garbed with the eight garments of the High Priest as opposed to the four of an ordinary priest.</i> as [the above verse] states: "...over whose head was poured [the anointment oil] and who was initiated to wear the garments." [Implied is that] just as he is initiated with the anointment oil, so too, he is initiated with the garments [of the High Priesthood].
How is he initiated with the garments? He puts on the eight garments [of the High Priest] and [later] removes them and does so again on the morrow for seven days, as [Exodus 29:30] states: "The priest from his sons who serves in his stead shall put them on for seven days." Just as he puts on the clothes for seven consecutive days, so too, he is anointed with the oil for seven consecutive days.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that the paradigm for this was set by the initiation of Aaron in the High Priesthood at the time of the dedication of the Sanctuary. Although Aaron was anointed on the first day, Moses served as a High Priest for the first seven days (Radbaz).</i> If he performed service before he was initiated by wearing the clothes for all seven days or before he was anointed for all seven days, his service is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is that the initial preference is for him not to perform service. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the obligation to be initiated for seven days before serving applies only with regard to the Yom Kippur service, but not with regard to other matters.</i> Since he was initiated or anointed once, he is a High Priest with regard to all matters.
There is no difference in [the laws pertaining to] a High Priest who was anointed with the anointment oil and [those applying to] one who was initiated by wearing the garments of the High Priest except [the obligation] for the High Priest to bring a bull [as a sacrifice] if he inadvertently violated one of the mitzvot for which a sin offering is required, as [Leviticus 4:3] states: "If the anointed priest<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Thus including only a High Priest who was anointed.</i> will sin...."<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i>, ch. 15, for a description of the details of this sacrifice.</i> With regard to other matters, they are identical.
A High Priest should be appointed only by the court of 71 judges.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 16a derives this from the advice Yisro gives to Moses (Exodus 18:22 : "Any great matter (<i>hadavar hagadol</i>) will be brought to you." Implied is that matters that involve <i>gadlus</i> (greatness) - including the appointment of the <i>kohen gadol</i> (the High Priest) - should be judged by a court with authority equal to that of Moses, i.e., the <i>Sanhedrin</i> of 71 judges.</i> He should be anointed only during the day, as [<i>ibid.</i> 6:13] states: "On the day of his anointment...." Similarly, if he was initiated merely by wearing the priestly garments, the initiation should only take place during the day. Two High Priests should not be initiated together.
We also appoint a priest who will serve the High Priest like a viceroy, he is called the <i>segen</i> and he is also called "the appointed one." He should stand at the right hand of the High Priest at all times.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachot 4-5, 13.</i> This honor is given to him.

In addition, <i>katikolin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">A Greek term meaning "general officer."</i> are appointed to serve the <i>segen</i> as the <i>segen</i> serves the High Priest. There should be no less than two of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 5:2), the Rambam states that there should never be less than two people appointed to take care of communal matters.</i> No less than seven <i>amerkalin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Horiot</i> 13a interprets this as a composite of two Aramaic terms meaning "appointed over all."

In <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 8:5, the Rambam states that the keys to the Sanctuary were entrusted to the elders of the clan. Perhaps the intent is that the elders of the clan were in fact the <i>amerkalin</i> (<i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>). Based on the following halachah, that would seem unlikely (<i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i>). See also Chapter 7, Halachah 3, which speaks about a priest appointed to lock the gates of the Temple. Perhaps the intent is that the keys belonged to the <i>amerkalin</i> and each night, they would entrust them.</i> If one desires to open [the courtyard], he cannot until all the <i>amerkalin</i> gather and open it.
Treasurers are appointed under the <i>amerkalin</i>. There should be no less than three.

And after it was entombed, there were no longer any anointed High Priests. And yet, the passage in <i>Horiot</i> appears to imply that they were contemporaries.<br>The Ritba offers a resolution, explaining that, in the era of the First Temple, if a High Priest that was anointed was forced to be absent from the Temple for an extended period, e.g., he became ill or was taken captive, a substitute was appointed to serve as a High Priest in his place. He was not anointed, because there may never be two anointed High Priests at the same time, but instead, was initiated in his office by wearing the garments of the High Priesthood.</i> One installed by wearing the garments who is prepared to serve receives precedence over an anointed [High Priest] disqualified because of a seminal emission.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">A priest who experiences a seminal emission becomes impure and is therefore disqualified from offering sacrifices or performing any other service in the Temple until he regains ritual purity.</i> One disqualified because of a seminal emission receives precedence over one disqualified because of a physical blemish.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">For the one disqualified because of a seminal emission is fit for service after he becomes pure, while a blemished priest will never become fit.

The commentaries suggest emending the text here to follow that reading, because the fear of God is the very foundation of the spiritual heritage of the Jewish people. Anyone who lacks that quality can never be a competent leader, as the Rambam states there: "[However,] under no circumstance should a person who lacks the fear of God be appointed to any position in Israel, even though he possesses much knowledge."</i> or in the fear of God, even if he is not comparable in wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In the above source, the Rambam states: "He should be granted his father's position and given instruction." In that vein, <i>Ketubot</i> 103b describes how Rabbi Yehudah <i>Hanasi</i> instructed that his son Gamliel be given his position, even though his knowledge was not as great as his father's.<br>If, however, a son is not comparable to his father in the fear of heaven, he should not be given his position at all. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites the interpretation of Leviticus 16:32 which describes the High Priest as one "who was anointed to fill the place of his ancestor." <i>Torat Kohanim (Tzav)</i> comments: "Should he be anointed even though he does not 'fill the place' [i.e., does not equal the level of his] ancestors? No, the Torah states 'fill the place.' If he is not equal to his father, the position should be granted to someone else."</i> For [Deuteronomy 17:20] states with regard to a king: "He and his descendants in the midst of Israel."

This applies with regard to any office amidst the Jewish people.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sifri, Shoftim</i>.<br>This law has been a matter of controversy throughout the years. In regard to positions of communal authority, almost all authorities accept this concept. However, controversies have frequently arisen over the inheritance of Rabbinical positions. Here, the Rambam's decision has frequently been challenged.<br>Maharshdam (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsa, n. 85) states that a city must seek out the most capable Rav possible without regard to inheritance. Similarly, the <i>Terumat HaDeshen</i> (<i>Pesakim</i> 128) states "Torah cannot be inherited."<br>However, many prominent authorities (<i>Rivash,</i> Responsa 271, Ramah, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 245, <i>Maharit Algazi, Simchat Yom Tov</i> 6) have explained that this law applies even in regard to rabbinical positions.<br>The difficulties in deciding the question may be seen in the <i>Chatam Sofer's</i> lack of certainty regarding it. In his Responsa (<i>Orach Chayim</i>, Responsum 12), he at first espouses the opinion that rabbinical positions should not be handed down from father to son. However, later (Responsum 13), he reversed himself and granted the son his father's position by inheritance.<br>In practice, most Rabbis have reached the opinion that if the son is a capable Rabbi, though less qualified than another who seeks the position, his father's position should be awarded to him. However, if the community sees the son as incapable of filling his father's position at all, it may be given to another person.</i> If one acquires it, he acquires it for himself and for his descendants.
The position of being the priest anointed to lead the nation in war is not transferred to one's son.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz maintains that this ruling has to do with the unique function this priest serves. Since he leads the nation in war, it is a life or death question and the most capable person is chosen whether he is the heir or not.<br>In a responsum (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 12), the <i>Chatam Sofer</i> takes the opposite perspective, explaining the distinction between this and other positions which are inherited as follows: The kingship and other similar positions are appointments associated with leadership. Hence if the heir is fundamentally capable, he inherits his father's position. The priest who leads the nation in war, by contrast, is an appointment based on holiness. That is not transferred by inheritance. Indeed, the High Priesthood would not be transferred by inheritance were there not a specific verse commanding us to do so.</i> Instead, the son is like all other priests. If he is anointed as the leader in war, he is anointed.

Chapter 5

The High Priest must surpass all of his priestly brethren in beauty, power, wealth, wisdom, and appearance.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Yosef Corcus explains that "beauty" refers to the attractiveness of his facial features, "appearance," to the comeliness of his physical form. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Yoma</i> 1:3), the Rambam adds that the High Priest must surpass his brethren in the fear of God.</i> If he does not have wealth of his own, all of his priestly brethren should give him according to their financial capacity until he is wealthier than all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:10 describes the High Priest as "the priest greater than his brethren." <i>Yoma</i> 18a offers two interpretations of that phrase: a) The High Priest must be greater than his brethren in all qualities that are significant to human interaction; b) his greatness must come "from (the prefix <i>mei</i> translated as "than" can also mean "from") his brethren"; they must grant him his wealth. The Rambam does not see the two interpretations as contradictory and combines them both in this halachah.</i>
None of the above is an absolute requirement;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Har HaMoriah</i> derives this from the fact that, by and large, the High Priests of the Second Temple period lacked the quality of wisdom which is the most important of all attributes.

If he was, nonetheless, initiated, his initiation is valid.
The High Priest must conduct himself with dignity. He should not act frivolously with the people at large.

There was a chamber prepared for him in the Sanctuary which was called: "The Chamber of the High Priest."<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:17, the Rambam notes that this chamber was also called the Chamber of Wood and the Chamber of the <i>Parhedrin</i>.

This, however, is not the halachic meaning of the commandment. Instead, as explained in <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 2, the halachic meaning is that he should not depart in the middle of his service.</i> and to go to his private home only at night or for an hour or two during the day. His home should be in Jerusalem and he should never depart from there.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This could also be understood from the above command, for according to the Rambam, there are times when the entire city of Jerusalem is referred to as "the Sanctuary."</i>
A High Priest may act as a judge and he is judged.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this is not considered as an affront to his honor.</i> Testimony may be delivered against him.

Implied is that matters that involve <i>gadlus</i> (great importance) - for example, a case involving the very life of the <i>kohen gadol</i> (the High Priest) - should be judged by a court with authority equal to that of Moses, i.e., the <i>Sanhedrin</i> of 71 judges. As mentioned in Chapter 4, Halachah 23, cases involving a transgression punishable by lashes are judged by a court of three.</i>
If he knows testimony, he is not obligated to deliver it, even in the High Court.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, an ordinary person is obligated to deliver any testimony that he knows (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 1:1).</i> For going to testify does not enhance his honor.

We already explained in the fifth book<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Kedushah, Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>, Chapter 1. Halachah 1 of that chapter mentions the prohibition against marrying a widow and Halachah 13, the mitzvah to marry a virgin. These concepts are also mentioned in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:7-8.</i> that [the High Priest] is forbidden [to marry] a widow and commanded to marry a virgin. He may not have two wives. If he marries two, he may not carry out the service on the fast [of Yom Kippur] until he divorces one.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 13a derives this concept from the exegesis of Leviticus 16:5 which states: "And he will atone... for his household." "His household" is interpreted as referring to his wife and the term is written in the singular, implying one wife and not two.<br>In his gloss to <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 1:13, the Ra'avad notes that II Chronicles 24:3 speaks of Yehoyeda the High Priest and the marriage of two women, seemingly contradicting the Rambam's ruling. The Ra'avad interprets the verse as stating that Yehoyeda married the women himself. (Similarly, Rav Moshe HaCohen and others question the Rambam's ruling.) <i>Rambam LeAm</i>, however, advances the interpretation that the verse is stating that Yehoyeda had Yoash marry the women.</i><br>He may perform <i>chalitzah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">If a man's brother dies childless, there is a mitzvah for him to marry his brother's widow. This is referred to as <i>yibbum</i>. If he does not desire to marry the widow, he must perform a ritual act called <i>chalitzah</i> that gives her the right to remarry. The Rambam is emphasizing the contrast between a High Priest and a king. A king does not perform <i>chalitzah</i> because such an act would be a compromise to his honor. And since he does not perform <i>chalitzah</i>, he is also not entitled to perform <i>yibbum</i>. Nor does his wife undergo <i>yibbum</i> for she is not allowed to marry anyone else (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 2:3). None of these restrictions apply with regard to a High Priest.</i> and [either] <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibbum</i> are performed with his wife.

When the High Priest enters the Sanctuary<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the outer chamber of the Temple building, not the Holy of Holies. This is evident from the fact that he is wearing the <i>ephod</i> and on Yom Kippur, he enters the Holy of Holies wearing only the four garments of an ordinary priest.</i> to prostrate himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Prostrating oneself in the Temple was considered one of the elements of the Temple service.

It is necessary to hold these jewels because the Torah commanded that the breastplate never move away from the <i>ephod</i>.</i> of the <i>ephod</i>. He enters the Sanctuary and prostrates himself. When the <i>segen</i> hears the sound of the feet of the High Priest as he departs,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The movement of the High Priest created noise, because there were bells on the bottom of his cloak.</i> he lifts up the curtain.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the curtain over the opening to the Entrance Hall.

On any day he desires, he may offer the incense offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, the task of bringing the incense offering was rotated among the priests and one who offered it once would not offer it again (<i>Yoma</i> 26a). Nevertheless, the High Priest had the option of offering it whenever he desired.</i> He receives the first portion of any sacrifice offered in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if he did not offer the sacrifice himself.</i> What is implied? If he desires, he may say: "This sin offering is mine" or "This guilt offering is mine."<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, the sacrifices are divided equally into portions for all the priests. The High Priest, however, could claim any sacrifice or portion of a sacrifice (see <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 10:18).</i> He does not seek to be chosen for service by lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">As the other priests are (see <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i>, ch. 4).</i> Instead, whenever he desires to offer a sacrifice, he may offer [any sacrifice] he desires.

When the High Priest desired to offer a sacrifice, he would ascend the ramp with the <i>segen</i> on his right. When he reached the midpoint of the ramp, the <i>segen</i> would hold him by the right hand and help him up. The priest who would carry the head of the burnt offering would extend the limbs [he is carrying]<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the head, he would carry the right leg of the animal (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 6:11).</i> to [the High Priest] and [the High Priest] would lean upon them<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">A person bringing a sacrifice would lean on the sacrifice as the Rambam mentions in the following halachah and describes in <i>ibid.</i> 3:6-16.

Similarly, all of the other limbs would be extended to him. All of those carrying the limbs would give the limbs they were carrying to the first priest and he would give them to the High Priest. He would lean upon them and toss them to the fire. If he desired to merely lean upon them and have another priest toss them to the fire, he may.<br>There is no concept of leaning on individual limbs except when the High Priest [offers a sacrifice].

As soon as a priest matures and attains majority,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when he reaches the age of thirteen and manifests signs of physical maturity.</i> he is fit to serve in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For he is obligated - and thus entitled to - perform all the mitzvot including the service in the Temple.</i> Nevertheless, his priestly brethren would not allow him to serve in the Temple until he reached the age of 20.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">At which time, he can be expected to be more mature and less likely to commit an error that would disqualify a sacrifice.</i> He should not enter the Temple Courtyard to perform service for the first time except during a time when the Levites are chanting songs.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the passage from <i>Arachin</i> 13b which is the Rambam's source is speaking about a Levite and not a priest. The Radbaz agrees that the Ra'avad's view appears more likely from the context, but since the passage speaks about <i>avodah</i> - a term which usually refers to the service of offering the sacrifices - there is room for the Rambam's understanding.</i>
A priest does not perform Temple service - nor does a High Priest perform Temple service - until he brings [a meal offering of] a tenth of an <i>ephah</i> from his own possessions and offer it himself, as [Leviticus 6:13] states: "This is the sacrifice of Aaron and his descendants<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">By mentioning Aaron, the verse indicates that this offering is brought by a High Priest. By mentioning his descendants, it indicates that it is also brought by an ordinary priest.</i> which they will offer to God on the day that he will be anointed."<br>If one performs any of the Temple service before he brings [this meal offering] or if a High Priest serves as a High Priest before he brings [this meal offering], his service is acceptable.
If a priest who had never performed Temple service before is appointed as the High Priest, he should bring [a meal offering of] a tenth of an <i>ephah</i> and offer it himself as is the training for every ordinary priest at the outset. Afterwards, he offers a second [such meal offering] as the training of a High Priest. And then he offers a third [such meal offering] which is the <i>chavitin</i> offering of the High Priest which he offers every day, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 3:18 and onward.</i> The manner in which all three are offered is identical.

Chapter 6

It is impossible for the sacrifice of a person to be offered without him standing in attendance. [Now,] the communal offerings are the sacrifices of the entire Jewish people, but it is impossible for the entire Jewish people to stand in the Temple Courtyard at the time they are being offered. Therefore, the prophets of the first era<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel and David (<i>Ta'anit</i> 27a).</i> ordained that there be selective upright and sin-fearing Jews who should serve as the agents of the entire Jewish people<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 4:2), the Rambam writes: " Their intent and their goal was involvement in Divine service and prayer. They were not occupied with their own concerns. Their minds and their thought were on the sacrifices."</i> to stand [and observe the offering of] the sacrifices. They were called "the men of the <i>maamad</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma'amad</i> literally means "standing," because they would stand over the sacrifice or stand in prayer, as stated in Halachah 5. The term also has the connotation of "status" and "dignified position."</i><br>They divided them into 24 <i>ma'amadot</i>, equaling the number of watches of the priests and Levites. Over each of the watches was one who was appointed as [the supervisor] of them all. He was called the head of the <i>ma'amad</i>.
Each week, the members of the <i>ma'amad</i> of that week would gather together. Those [living] in Jerusalem or close to it would enter the Temple with the priestly and Levitical watch of that week. When [the week of] their <i>ma'amad</i> arrived, those members of the <i>ma'amad</i> who [lived] in distant places would gather in the synagogues of their locale.
What would those who gather together - both in Jerusalem and in the synagogues - do? They would fast on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of their week. They would not fast on Friday out of respect for the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">So that they would have the energy to make their Sabbath preparations.</i> and not on Sunday, so they would not make a transition from the pleasure of the Sabbath to a fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This would weaken them exceedingly (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
On every day of the week that was their <i>ma'amad</i>, they would recite four prayer services: the morning service, the afternoon service, the <i>neilah</i> service,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Neilah</i> means "closing." <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 1:7 states that the Men of the Great Assembly ordained "a prayer after the afternoon service [to be recited] close to sunset on fast days only to increase supplication and pleading due to the fast. This is called the <i>neilah</i> service, as if to say the gates of heaven are being closed." Since the men of the <i>ma'amad</i> were observing an ordained fast, they would recite this service as well.</i> and another prayer service between the morning service and the afternoon service which was additional [and unique] for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs and maintains that there was not an extra service ordained especially for the men of the <i>ma'amad</i>. If the Mishnah spoke of <i>Musaf</i>, the additional service, in this context, the intent was a day like Rosh Chodesh when <i>Musaf</i> would be recited by the entire Jewish people.<br>The Radbaz supports the Rambam's opinion, explaining that during this prayer service they would pray that the sacrifices be accepted and that Jews in situations of danger be saved.</i> In the <i>ma'amad</i>, the priests bless the people three times, in the morning service, in this additional service, and in the <i>neilah</i> service.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They would not bless the people in the afternoon service, because generally, it was suspected that a priest might be intoxicated in the afternoon and it is improper to bless the people in such a state. Hence, our Sages forbade the recitation of the priestly blessing in the afternoon service at all times. They allowed it to be recited in the <i>Neilah</i> service, because the <i>neilah</i> service is only recited on a fast day. In later generations, it became customary to recite the priestly blessing (or in the Ashkenazic community, the passage <i>Eloheinu V'Elohei Avoseinu</i>) in the afternoon service, because at present, it is customary to recite the afternoon service late on a fast day. Hence, it resembles the <i>neilah</i> service and will not be confused with an ordinary afternoon service. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Taanit</i> 4:1), <i>Hilchot Nesiat Kapayim</i> 14:1-2.</i><br>They would have three men read from the Torah twice a day: in the morning service and in the second service that they would add.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs here as well and states that there is no extra service and, hence, no extra Torah reading, except on a day when <i>Musaf</i> is recited.</i> In the afternoon service, they would not read the Torah. Instead, they would recite [the passages] by heart as one recites the <i>Shema</i>. They would not gather for the afternoon service on Friday, for they were busy [with their preparations] for the Sabbath.
Their gathering together for each of these prayers of these four services and their standing in prayer, supplication, and petition and reading the Torah is called a <i>ma'amad</i>.
What would they read [from the Torah]? The narrative of creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2), the Rambam explains that this subject was chosen, because the ultimate fulfillment of existence is the service of sacrificial worship, as implied by <i>Ta'anit</i> 27b: "Were it not for the sacrifices, the heavens and the earth would not be maintained."</i> On the first day, they would read: "In the beginning," "Let there be a firmament;"<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">On each day, they would read the passage associated with that and the following day of creation.</i> On the second day, "Let there be a firmament" and "Let [the waters] be gathered;" on the third day, "Let [the waters] be gathered" and "Let there be luminaries;" on the fourth day, "Let there be luminaries" and "Let the waters teem;" on the fifth day, "Let the waters teem" and "Let the earth produce;" on the sixth day, "Let the earth produce" and "[The heavens and the earth] were completed."
A large passage<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., three <i>aliyot</i> were given out for each reading. If the passage was large - i.e., it contained eight verses - two <i>aliyot</i> were given in it and the third <i>aliyah</i> was given for the second passage that accompanied it.</i> would be read by two men, a small passage, by one. The two passages that were read in the morning would be read during this second service from a scroll. They would then be read again during the afternoon service by heart.
During the eight days of Chanukah, the men of the <i>ma'amad</i> would not carry out a <i>ma'amad</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., read from the Torah or recite the readings by heart [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>:4)].</i> in the morning service.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since they would recite the <i>Hallel</i> prayers that day. As <i>Taanit</i> 4:4 states: Whenever <i>Hallel</i> was recited [and the <i>Musaf</i> service was not recited (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah)], there was no <i>ma'amad</i>. The rationale is that since the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> took time, no further obligations were imposed on the men of the <i>ma'amad</i>.</i> On any day when there was a <i>Musaf</i> sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., on the intermediate days of the festivals and on Rosh Chodesh.</i> there was not a <i>ma'amad</i> during their second service, nor in the afternoon service,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For they were occupied with the sacrifice of the <i>Musaf</i> service.</i> only during the morning and <i>neilah</i> services. On any day when there was a sacrifice of wood,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachah.</i> there was not a <i>ma'amad</i> during the <i>neilah</i> service, only during the morning, second, and afternoon services.
What was a sacrifice of wood? Certain families had a fixed time on which they would go out to the forests and bring wood for the arrangement [on the altar].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>:5), the Rambam refers to Nechemiah 10:35 which speaks of casting lots for the wood offering.

On that day, in addition to the wood, they would bring other sacrifices, as the Rambam continues to explain.</i> On the day designated for this family to bring their sacrifices, they would bring voluntary burnt offerings. This was called the sacrifice of the wood. It was like a festival for these families and they were forbidden to have eulogies delivered, fast, and perform work on that day. This was a custom.
Even a private individual who gave wood or logs for the arrangement [of the altar]<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For bringing wood is considered equivalent to bringing a sacrifice and the day on which a person brings a sacrifice is considered as his private festival.</i> is forbidden to have eulogies delivered, fast, and perform work on that day. This was a custom.
The men of the <i>ma'amad</i> are forbidden to have their hair cut and to launder [their clothes] throughout the week [they serve in the Temple]. On Thursday,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">And certainly on Friday (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>).</i> they were permitted in honor of the Sabbath. Why were they forbidden to have their hair cut and to launder [their clothes]? So that they would not enter their <i>ma'amad</i> while they were unkept.

There were fifteen officers in the Temple and similarly, an officer would always be appointed over these fifteen matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shekalim</i> 5:1 mentions officers for these fifteen positions.

Each one of these officers has many men under his command in order to arrange the task over which he is appointed.<br>The one [appointed] to supervise the times: He and his men watch the times. When the time comes for a sacrifice to be offered,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Actually, the announcement would be made slightly before the time for the sacrifice.

The one [appointed] to supervise the singers: Each day, he would chose singers to stand on the <i>duchan</i> to sing melodies. At his command, [the trumpets] would be sounded for the sacrifices.

Whoever would bring his sacrifices to the Temple would give the money for the wine libations to the officer in charge of the seals.

Every thirty days, a price for the wine and the flour is established with the officer in charge of the wine libations.

Chapter 8

There are three types of priestly garments: the garments of an ordinary priest, [the High Priest's] golden garments and his white garments. An ordinary priest has four garments: a tunic, leggings, a hat, and a sash. They are all made from white linen with six-fold threads.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes to the previous chapter, the Radbaz explains that this is implied by the very Hebrew term used for linen <i>sheish</i>, for that term also means "six." See Halachah 14.</i>The sash<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah (Exodus 39:29  mentions the use of woolen fabrics only with regard to the sash of the High Priest, but through the process of Biblical exegesis, our Sages (<i>Yoma</i> 12b) also derived that the sash of an ordinary priest also contains these fabrics.</i> alone was embroidered with wool.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Although the combination of these fabrics violates the prohibition against <i>shaatnez</i> (see <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i>, ch. 12), the positive commandment of wearing the Priestly Garments overrides the negative commandment of <i>shaatnez</i>. Nevertheless, this applies only when it is a mitzvah to wear them, i.e., when involved in the Temple service. Otherwise, it is forbidden to wear them (<i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 10:3).</i>
The golden garments are the garments of the High Priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam continues to explain, these garments were not all golden. Nevertheless, they are called golden because certain garments were golden.</i> There were eight garments: The four of an ordinary priest, the cloak, the <i>ephod</i>, the breastplate, and the forehead plate. The sash of the High Priest was embroidered<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 28:39.</i> and was made in a similar manner as that of the ordinary priest. Similarly, the turban [the Torah] mentions with regard to Aaron<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 28:4.</i> corresponds to the hat mentioned with regard to his sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.:</i>40.</i> [The difference is that the] turban of the High Priest is worn like fabric swathed around a hernia. The hat of the ordinary priest, by contrast, is worn like an ordinary hat;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites the Ramban who states that the headgear of both the ordinary priests and the High Priests were turbans. This is also indicated by Halachah 18 which speaks of their length. The turban of the High Priest, however, was round, while those of the ordinary priests were cone-shaped like hats. Other authorities (Rashi and the Ra'avad) differ and maintain that the ordinary priests wore hats and not turbans.</i> hence, its name.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to this point as well, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites the Ramban who states that the letters <i>kuf</i> and <i>gimmel</i> can be interchanged. Thus <i>migba'at</i> parallels <i>mikva'at</i> that relates to the word <i>kova</i>, hat.</i>
The white garments are the four garments that the High Priests would wear on Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">More particularly, they are the garments that he would wear when he performed the service unique to Yom Kippur. For he would also wear his golden garments on that day and carry out the service that was also peformed on other days while wearing them. See <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 2:1.</i> They are: a tunic, leggings, a sash, and a turban. They are all white, their threads are six-fold, and they are made from linen alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even the sash was made from linen alone. On this day, it was not of <i>sha'tnez</i>.</i> The High Priests had two other tunics for Yom Kippur: one he would wear in the morning<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">To perform the sacrificial service of Yom Kippur.</i> and one he would wear in the evening.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">To remove from the Holy of Holies the ladle that had carried the incense.</i> Both of them cost 30 <i>maneh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>maneh</i> is 100 silver pieces. Thus these were very expensive garments, made of fine fabric. The commentaries note that <i>Yoma</i> 35a states that the garments the High Priest would wear in the morning were more valuable than those he would wear in the evening and question why the Rambam does not mention this point. See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Yoma</i> 3:7) which states that the only difference between the two was their cut.</i> They were purchased with communal funds.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., funds from <i>terumat halishkah</i>, the Temple treasury collected to purchase the communal sacrifices and all their needs. See Halachah 7 and <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 4:2.</i> If he wished to add to their value, he must add from his own funds. He would consecrate the additional money and then use it to have the tunic made.
It is a mitzvah for the priestly garments to be new, attractive, and to hang low like the garments of the men of stature, as [implied by Exodus 28:2 which states that they must be made]: "for honor and for beauty." If they were soiled,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on Rashi's commentary to <i>Zevachim</i> 18b.</i> torn,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have drawn attention to an apparent contradiction in the Rambam's words, for in <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 1:14, he rules that, after the fact, when a priest performs service in torn garments, although he is liable to die at the hand of heaven, his service is acceptable. Among the resolutions offered is that here, the Rambam is speaking about clothes that remain torn. Hence, it is as if he is no longer wearing that garment. In <i>Hilchot Bi'at Hamikdash</i>, by contrast, he is speaking about torn garments that were mended. As the Radbaz explains (in his gloss there), the Rambam is speaking about a tear like the tear made when one rends his garments in mourning which can be mended. Here, he is speaking about a garment that was torn in many places.</i> longer than his appropriate measure,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they should reach slightly above the ground, extending until above the priest's heel (Halachah 17). If they drag along the ground, they are disqualified. That is the intent of the phrase "too long" mentioned later (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> shorter than his appropriate measure, hoisted up by the sash,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It is as if the material hoisted up by the sash was cut off (<i>Zevachim</i> 18b).</i> and a priest performed service while wearing them, his service is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">It is as if he performed the service without wearing priestly garments at all.</i> If they were worn-out or they were too long and he hoisted them with the sash so that they would be appropriate to his measure, his service is valid.
Whenever any of the priestly garments become soiled, they are not bleached or laundered. Instead, they are left to be used for wicks and he should wear new ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For there should be no expressions of poverty in a place of wealth (<i>Zevachim</i> 88b).</i> When the garments of the High Priest<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the golden garments.</i> become worn out, they should be entombed.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Although this is not stated explicitly, it is deduced from a comparison to the white garments (<i>Yoma</i> 12b).</i> The white garments which the High Priest wears on the day of the fast should not be worn a second time at all. Instead, they are entombed in the place where he removes them, as [Leviticus 16:23] states: "And he shall leave them there." It is forbidden to benefit from them.
They would make wicks from the leggings and the sashes of the ordinary priests that wore out.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">These were not used for the <i>Menorah</i>. The rationale is that since the sash contains wool, it will not serve as an effective wick (see <i>Shabbat</i> 20b-21a). And it is improper to use the leggings for that purpose since the priest wore them on his lower body (<i>Tifferet Yisrael, Sukkah</i> 5:3).</i> They were used to kindle lamps in the Temple for the rejoicing that accompanied the water libation.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Lulav</i> where this rejoicing is described. Significantly, however, there the Rambam does not connect the rejoining with the water libation.</i> The tunics of the ordinary priests<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> asks why the Rambam does not mention the hats of the ordinary priests. He offers two possible resolutions: a) their fabric was thin and not suitable for wicks at all;<br>b) they were in fact used for the <i>Menorah</i>.</i> that wore out were used to make wicks for the <i>Menorah</i> which lit continually.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the lamps for the water libation rejoicing which took place only during the Sukkot holiday.</i>
All of the priestly garments come from communal funds. When one individual donates one of the priestly garments, he may donate it to the community and then it is permitted to be used. Similarly, the sacrificial vessels and the wood for the altar arrangement that an individual donated to the community are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., generally, we think of the community purchasing these items by using funds from the Temple treasury. If, however, an individual donates these substances to the Temple treasury they also become communal property and then can be used for whatever purpose the community desires.</i> Even all the communal sacrifices which an individual donates from his own resources to the community are acceptable, provided he gives them to the community.
They would make many sets<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a set with four garments: leggings, a tunic, a sash, and a hat.</i> of clothes for ordinary priests. There were 96 lockers in the Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:6), the Rambam speaks of 24 lockers. <i>Rambam LeAm</i> suggests that each watch had one large locker which in turn had four compartments.</i> in which to place the clothes, four lockers for each watch. The name of each watch was written on the lockers and they were all closed. When the men of the watch began their priestly service on the Sabbath, they would open their lockers throughout their week and take their garments. When they departed, they would return the clothes to their lockers and close them.
Why did they make four lockers for each watch? So that the garments would not be intermingled.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Having the garments sorted individually made it easier for the priests to put on the garments in the proper order: first, the leggings, then, the tunic, the sash, and the hat [see Chapter 10, Halachah 1; see also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 5:3)].</i> Instead, all of the leggings were [stored] in one locker on which was written: Leggings. Similarly, the sashes were [stored] in one locker on which was written: Sash. Similarly, the hats and the tunics each had their own locker.
The High Priest would leave his golden garments in his chamber<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Chamber of the High Priest. See Chapter 5, Halachah 7.<br><i>Har Hamoriah</i> writes that since the Talmud does not mention that there was a locker for the High Priest's garments, we can assume there was none and that he would leave them in his chamber.</i> at night or when he left the Temple.
It is permitted to derive benefit from the priestly garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Yoma</i> 69a, suggests that as an initial preference, a priest should not benefit from them. In practice, however, that is not possible, because "the Torah was not given to the ministering angels" and it is impossible for the priests to remove the priestly garments immediately after their Temple service was completed (<i>Kiddushin</i> 54b). Hence they were consecrated with the stipulation that the priests would derive personal benefit from them.</i> Therefore [the priests] wear them on the day of their Temple service even when they are not performing service with the exception of the sash, because it is <i>shaatnez</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A prohibited mixture of fabrics. During the Temple service, however, it may be worn, because then it is a mitzvah to do so and the observance of a positive mitzvah supersedes the observance of a prohibition. The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that the sash may be worn throughout the day, as long as the priest is in the Temple.<br>Rav Yosef Corcus mentions that the <i>ephod</i> and the breastplate of the High Priest also involved a forbidden mixture of fabrics. He explains, however, that according to the Rambam, the prohibition against mixed fabrics does not apply to them, because they are not worn to provide the body with warmth, and if a garment is worn for a purpose other than that, this prohibition does not apply (<i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 10:19).</i>
It is, however, forbidden for an ordinary priest to wear it except during his service. The [clothes] the priests wear for their service are of wool and linen alone.
Whenever the Torah uses the word <i>sheish</i> or <i>bad</i>, it is referring to flax, i.e., linen. Whenever the term <i>techeilet</i> is used, it refers to wool which is dyed sky-blue, i.e., lighter<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Tuma'at Tzara'at</i> 1:4 where the Rambam defines <i>patuch</i> as a color mixed with white. See also <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 2:1.</i> than dark blue. The term <i>argaman</i> refers to wool that is dyed red.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">There are some who interpret the term as referring to a purplish dye. Others explain that it is mixture of several dyes of thread. See Ra'avad and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i> And <i>tola'at sheni</i> refers to wool dyed with a gnat.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Parah Adumah</i> 3:2 where the Rambam writes that this dye is produced from a seed that has a small gnat in it that produces a scarlet color.</i>
Whenever the Torah uses the term <i>sheish</i> or "spun <i>sheish</i>," it is necessary that the strand be sixfold.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one strand made up of six thinner threads.</i> Where the term <i>bad</i> is used, it is valid, if one strand alone is used. [Even in such situations,] the most desirable manner of performing the mitzvah is that it be sixfold. Whenever the term <i>meshizar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Often translated as twisted.</i> is used alone, the intent is a thread that is eightfold.
Whenever the Torah uses the term "a work of embroidery," the intent is that the design which is woven will be seen on one side of the fabric. When it uses the term "a work of craft," the intent is that the design will be seen on both sides of the fabric, front and back.
How are the clothes made? The tunic - whether of the High Priest or an ordinary priest - was made with a boxlike knit. The knit had sequences of squares as is the structure of an animal's maw,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 3:1). The boxes were indented slightly, like small pockets.</i> in the manner which weavers make firm garments. Its sleeve was woven separately and then sown to the body of the tunic.
The length of the tunic extended until slightly above the heel.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For as mentioned in Halachah 4, the priests' garments should be fit to their measure, neither too long or too short. Compare to the description of the clothes of Torah scholars in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 5:9.</i> The length of the sleeve extended until his wrist and its width was the width of his hand.
The leggings - whether of the High Priest or an ordinary priest - extend from the loins until the thighs, i.e., from above the navel, close to the heart, until the end of the thigh, i.e., until the knee. They had straps.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">To tighten them around the priest's waist.</i> They did not have a special feature for the anus, nor for the male organ. Instead, they would surround the body like a pouch.
The turban - whether of an ordinary priest or a High Priest - was sixteen cubits long.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Halachah 2, according to the Rambam, the difference was the manner in which they wrapped the turbans. The actual cloth was the same.</i> The sash was about three fingerbreadths<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">A fingerbreadth is about 2 cm according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>.</i> wide and 32 cubits long. [The priest would] wrap it around himself, winding after winding. The priestly garments were not sown, rather they woven, as [Exodus 39:22] states: "weavers' craft."

Chapter 9

How is the forehead plate made? We make a plate of gold two fingerbreadths<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A fingerbreadth is about 2 cm according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>. There is no measure according to Scriptural Law. The Rabbis chose a measure of two fingerbreadths, because this is the ordinary width of a High Priest's forehead.</i> wide that extends [over the forehead of the High Priest] from one ear to the other. Upon it is written, קדש לה'ה<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">"Sanctified unto God."</i> in two lines, קדש on the lower line and לה'ה on the upper line.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The standard published text of <i>Sukkah</i> 5a states that God's name should be on the upper line and קדש on the lower line. Apparently, the Rambam's text of the <i>Gemara</i> followed a different version. Alternatively, the Rambam favored the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 4:1) which follows the version stated. There it is explained that although the wording is opposite that of the verse, it is like a king (God's name) sitting on his throne (the word "sanctified").</i> If [the words] were written on one line it was valid. There were times when they were written on one line.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 63b and <i>Sukkah</i> 5a quote Rabbi Eliezar bar Yossi as saying: "I saw it in Rome (where it had been taken after the Temple's destruction) and the words קדש לה'ה were written in one line."<br><i>Likutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 26, p. 200ff., explains that the fact that despite Rabbi Eliezar's testimony, the halachah is that the words should be written in two lines indicates that our Sages had received orally the tradition that this was the acceptable way of preparing the forehead plate. Accordingly, we must say that the reason the second view is accepted is not because of Rabbi Eliezar's testimony, but because there was an oral tradition that it was acceptable.</i>
The letters would project outward. How was this done? [A craftsman] would engrave the letters on the back of the plate<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 39:30 states: "They engraved on it writing, [like that of] a signet ring." Now the letters of a signet ring project outward and so it was required that the letters of the forehead plate project outward. On the other hand, since the verse mentions writing, the letters could not be made using a mold (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>; this rebuts the Ra'avad's objection). See <i>Gittin</i> 20a.</i> while it was pressed to beeswax<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Beeswax was used so that it would be firm enough to support the gold and prevent it from being pierced, but flexible enough to allow it to be shaped.</i> until they project.<br>It had holes on each of its ends. There was a strand of sky-blue wool below it that ran from hole to hole so that it could be tied with this strand at the nape [of the neck].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad (following the line of thinking found in Rashi's commentary to the Torah) states that there was a third hole in the center of the forehead plate and a strand extending from it over the High Priest's head. This would prevent the plate from slipping down. The Rambam (and his view is supported by the Ramban in his commentary to the Torah) maintains that only two holes were made. Apparently, the plate was held in place by the pressure generated by tying it tightly.</i>
The cloak was made entirely of sky-blue colored wool.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Exodus 39:22.</i> Its strands were twelve-fold. Its opening was woven, and that is where its weave began.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>ibid.</i> 28:32 states: "Its opening for the head shall be folded over within it. Its opening shall have a border of weaver's work."</i> It did not have an opening for his arms.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's source for this statement. In his commentary to the Torah, the Ramban also questions the Rambam's view. The Radbaz explains that were it to have had an opening for the High Priest's arms, there would have been no difference between it and the tunic.</i> Instead, it was divided into two flaps from below the throat and downward like all cloaks.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It did not surround the High Priest on all sides, but instead hung down over the front and back of his body, with openings on either side. Here also, the Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's understanding and the Ramban supports it.<br>According to the Rambam's conception, the cloak bore somewhat of a resemblance to the garments worn today as a <i>tallit kattan</i> (except that it was much longer than those garment). Indeed, for that reason, the Radbaz questions why there was no obligation to attach <i>tzitzit</i> to it. He explains that since the neck portion of the garment did not extend over the High Priests' shoulders, it is not considered as a four-cornered garment.</i> It is joined only directly below the throat.<br>One who tears the border of the opening of the cloak is liable for lashes, as [Exodus 28:32] states: "It shall not be torn."<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 88) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 101) includes this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> This applies to all the priestly garments. One who tears them with a destructive intent is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he tears them with an intent to mend the article, no prohibition is involved (Radbaz).</i>
He should then bring sky-blue wool, red wool, and scarlet wool, the strands of each of these spun eight-fold. [This is necessary,] because [Exodus 39:24] states that [the pomegrantes on the cloak's] hem [should be made from strands that are] "twisted."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">And as stated in Chapter 8, Halachah 14, that term implies a strand made up of eight threads.</i>Thus there are twenty four threads used for the hem of the cloak.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Eight threads from each type of fabric.</i> They should be fashioned into shapes resembling pomegranates whose mouths are not open<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Pomegranates have a crown-like bud on their top and these spheres would not.</i>and hung from the cloak. He brings 72 cups with 72 clappers that are made entirely of gold and suspends them from the hems, 36 from the hem of one flap and 36 from the hem of the other flap.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 28:33-34.</i> The cup with the clapper hanging in it are together called a bell. From the hems on both sides of [the flaps of the cloak are suspended series of] bells and pomegranates, bells and pomegranates.
The gold that is woven in the <i>ephod</i> and the breastplate which is mentioned in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:5, 15; 39:2, 8.</i> was made in the following manner. A strand of pure gold was taken and placed together with six strands of sky-blue wool and [then] the seven strands were spun as one. He would do the same with one strand of gold and six of red wool, with one strand [of gold] with six of scarlet wool, and with one strand of gold with six of linen. Thus there would be four strands of gold and there would be a total of 28 strands.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., four times seven.</i><br>[This is reflected by Exodus 39:3]: "And they hammered out thin sheets of gold [and cut strands] to fashion into the sky-blue wool, into the red wool, into the scarlet wool, and into the linen." This teaches that there was a strand of gold woven in them.
How was the breastplate made? He would weave a garment that was a work of craft<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The design embroidered on it could be seen from both sides.</i> from gold, sky-blue wool, red wool, scarlet, linen, with 28 strands, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous halachah.</i> It is a cubit long and <i>zeret</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Half a cubit.</i> wide and it should be folded into two.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Note the comments of the Radbaz who infers that according to the Rambam, the breastplate would be woven while elongated and then folded.

Four golden rings are made on the four corners of the breastplate. In the two upper rings from which the breastplate is suspended, two golden cords are placed.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 28:22-24.

Although it follows the simple meaning of the verse, there is a difference of opinion concerning this matter in <i>Sotah</i> 36a-b and the Rambam's view does not follow either of the opinions mentioned there. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, offers a resolution that enables the Rambam's understanding to conform to the Talmud's text.</i> Joseph's name would be written as יהוסף.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 81:1 writes Joseph's name in this manner.

Afterwards, he places the ends of the cords of the breastplate in the upper rings that are on the shoulders of the <i>ephod</i> and he should place the two strands of sky-blue wool that are on the hem of the breastplate<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 8.</i> into the rings that are above the belt of the <i>ephod</i>.

The Radbaz explains that the belt is to be positioned below the breastplate on the same level as its top. The breastplate should lie on the High Priest's heart. Nevertheless, he also explains that the Rambam's wording has to be clarified, because as stated in the following chapter (Halachot 1-2), the sash is tied over the High Priest's heart. The Radbaz therefore suggests that the sash was tied over the upper portion of the heart and the belt of the <i>ephod</i> slightly lower.</i> below the breastplate. The two shoulders of the <i>ephod</i> lie on his two shoulders. The two cords of gold extend down from his shoulders on either side from the shoulders of <i>ephod</i> to the rings of the breastplate. The two strands of sky-blue wool are tied below his elbows from the two lower rings of the breastplate to the two lower rings of the shoulders of the <i>ephod</i> which are above the belt.

Chapter 10

What is the order in which the priestly garments should be put on? [The priest] should put on the leggings first,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">From Leviticus 6:2, one might presume that the tunic is put on first, because it states: "And the priest shall put his fitted [tunic] and he shall put on linen leggings." Nevertheless, through the process of Biblical exegesis, <i>Yoma</i> 23b derives that nothing should be put on before the leggings.</i> tying them above his navel, over his loins. Afterwards, he puts on the tunic and then puts on the sash at elbow height. He should wind it fold after fold<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The sash was 32 cubits long, so that it will obviously be wound around him several times.</i> until it ends and then tie it.
With regard to the sash, [where it should be placed can be understood from] the received tradition. [Ezekiel 44:18] states: "They shall not gird themselves <i>bayeza</i>, [interpreted<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">By <i>Zevachim</i> 18b.</i> to mean] "in a place where one perspires."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a place like the armpits or loins where flesh covers flesh leading to perspiration.</i> Yonason, the son of Uziel,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A renowned student of the Sage Hillel, who translated the Tanach into Aramaic.</i> received the same tradition from the prophets<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Megilah</i> 3a which ascribes this translation to the prophets Chaggai, Zechariah, and Malachi who accompanied the Jews back from the Babylonian exile to Jerusalem.</i> and translated the phrase: "They will gird themselves over the heart."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">At elbow height.</i><br>Afterwards, he should arrange the headpiece as a hat.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 2. The order in which the ordinary priests put on the priestly garments is taken from Leviticus 8:13.</i>
After the High Priest girds himself with the sash,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he puts on the first three garments in the same manner as an ordinary priest does.</i> he puts on the cloak, and on the cloak, the <i>ephod</i> and the breastplate. He girds himself with the belt of the <i>ephod</i> over the cloak, below the breastplate. Therefore [the cloak] is called "the cloak of the <i>ephod</i>,"<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 28:31.</i> the cloak that is girded closed with the <i>ephod</i>.<br>Afterwards, he winds the headgear like a turban. He ties the forehead plate [behind his head,] above the turban.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed inclusion is necessary, because in front of his head, the turban was above the forehead plate, as the Rambam proceeds to state. The order in which the High Priest put on his priestly garments is taken from Leviticus 8:7-9.</i> His hair was visible between the forehead plate and the turban and it is in that place that he would wear his <i>tefillin</i> between the forehead plate and the turban.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 6.</i>
It is a positive commandment to make these garments and for the priests to serve in them,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 33) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 99) includes this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. The wording in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> implies that the fundamental mitzvah is for the priests to wear these garments for their Temple service. Making the garments is merely a preparatory phase that enables that mitzvah to be fulfilled.</i> as [Exodus 28:2] states: "And you shall make holy garments,"<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the garments of the High Priest.</i> and [<i>ibid.</i> 29:8] states: "And drew near his sons and dress them in tunics."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the clothes of an ordinary priest.</i><br>When a High Priest serves with less than these eight garments or an ordinary priest serves with less than these four garments, he is called lacking garments. His service is invalid and he is liable for death at the hand of Heaven, like a non-priest who serves. [This is indicated by <i>ibid.</i>:9 which states:] "And you shall gird them with a sash... and their priesthood shall be for them...." [Implied is that] when their garments are upon them, their priesthood is upon them. [Conversely,] if their garments are not upon them, they are like non-priests, concerning whom [Numbers 1:51] states: "A non-priest who draws close [to the service of the Sanctuary] shall die."<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 9:1.</i>
Just like a priest who is lacking garments is liable to die and invalidates the service he performs, so too, one who wears extra garments<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 2:1), it appears that wearing any extra garment, not only an extra priestly garment, causes one to be liable.</i> - e.g., he wears two tunics, two sashes, or an ordinary priest who wears the garments of the High Priest and performs service - profanes his service and is liable for death at the hand of Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">We see this concept in several other contexts. When there is an extra entity, it is as if it and the entity that is required to be present is lacking. See <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 6:2.</i>
It is said with regard to the priestly garments:<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is not quoting a verse exactly. Similar phrase exist in Leviticus 6:3 and 16:4.</i> "on his flesh and he shall wear them." [Implied is that] nothing should intervene between his flesh and the garments. Even if there is one thread, earth, or a dead louse between his flesh and the [priestly] garment, it is considered an intervening substance and his service is invalid. Therefore a priest cannot serve [in the Temple wearing] his arm <i>tefillin</i>, because they intervene. The head <i>tefillin</i>, by contrast, do not intervene<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 3.</i> and if he desires to wear them at the time of his Temple service, he may.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">One can infer that he is not obligated to wear <i>tefillin</i>. We apply the principle: One who is occupied in the observance of a mitzvah - the priestly service - is exempt from another mitzvah, wearing <i>tefillin</i>.<br>The <i>tefillin</i> are not considered as an extra garment, because <i>tefillin</i> are not considered a garment (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
[A priest] must be careful at the time that he puts on [the priestly garments] that there be no dust, nor a louse - even if it is alive - between his flesh and the garment. Nor should air enter between his flesh and his garment during the time of service so that the garment will become distant from his flesh. He should not place his hand in his bosom under his tunic. He should not remove his hair from the garment, nor should there be a strand hanging loose from the garment. [Although] one these factors occurs, his service is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 19a questions whether these situations are acceptable and does not arrive at a conclusion. Accordingly, the Rambam rules that as an initial preference, one should be concerned with these matters, but the difficulty is not great enough to disqualify the service. For unless the Torah or our Sages explicitly ruled that a sacrifice is unacceptable, one cannot bring another one in its place for it is possible that one will be committing the transgression of slaughtering an ordinary animal in the Temple Courtyard (see <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 2:3). The slaughter of the animal might be placed in that category, because one is bringing it as a sacrifice under the conception that he is obligated to do so, when in fact that might not be so.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that one may not bring a sacrifice and make a conditional stipulation: "If the previous sacrifice was unacceptable, may this be considered as my obligation and if the previous sacrifice was acceptable, this is a freewill offering." There are some sacrifices - e.g., sin offerings, guilt offerings, and communal offerings - where such a stipulation cannot be made. Hence, our Sages enforced uniformity and prevented conditional offerings in these instances.</i>
[The following rules apply if a priest] wrapped a cloth on his flesh in a place [untouched by the priestly] garments, e.g., he wrapped it on his finger or on his heel. If it is three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The minimum size of a garment (see <i>Hilchot Keilim</i> 22:12; 23:7; <i>et al</i>).</i> it is considered as an intervening substance and it invalidates [the service]. If it is smaller than that, it is not considered as an intervening substance.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">It is too small to be considered as entity of consequence.</i><br>A small belt, since it is considered as an independent garment, invalidates [one's service] even if it is not three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths in area.
When the finger of a priest is wounded, he is permitted to tie a reed or a cloth that is not three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths around it on the Sabbath and perform his service.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is not tying a permanent not, there is no prohibition against tying. Nor is there a prohibition against performing an act of healing on the Sabbath (as is prohibited in certain instances), because such prohibitions were not applied in the Temple.</i> If he intends to release blood, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For this is a transgression of the Sabbath laws and it does not aid the Temple service (Rashi, <i>Eruvin</i> 103b).</i> [Leniency is granted,] provided the reed or the cloth does not intervene between his flesh and a sacred utensil<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 5:17.</i> at the time of service.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance, even if the article is not significant, an interposition invalidates the service. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, claiming that it is a contradiction to his ruling in the previous halachah. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's position, explaining that in the previous halachah, the garment was not considered a garment because of its size. Nevertheless, that does not mean that it is not considered an interposition. As long as it intervenes, it disqualifies service regardless of its size.</i>
In the Second Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 31a relates that the Sages sought to purchase the stones for the High Priest's breastplate in the era of the Second Temple.</i> they made the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Tumim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes to <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 4:1, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam considers the term <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tumim</i> as referring to the stones of the High Priest's breastplate. See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sotah</i> 9:20. The Ra'avad and others differ and interpret it as referring to the script of mystic names of God that were placed in the folds of breastplate.</i> to complete the eight garments [of the High Priest]<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For the stones were an integral part of the structure of the breastplate.</i> even though inquiry was not made of them. Why was inquiry not made of them? Because the Holy Spirit<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The spirit of prophecy.</i> was not vested there.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 21b explains that this is one of the five differences between the holiness of the First Temple and that of the Second Temple.</i> And whenever a priest does not speak with the Holy Spirit and the Divine Presence does not rest there, inquiry is not made.
How was inquiry made?<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the era of the First Temple.</i> The [High] priest would stand facing the Ark. The person making inquiry was behind him, facing the [High] Priest's back. The inquirer would ask: "Should I go up [to war] or not?" He would not ask in a loud voice, nor would he merely think about the matter in his heart. Instead, [he would speak] in a low voice, like someone praying to himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As in the classic example of Chanah's prayer (I Samuel 1:13 , which is accepted as the paradigm for our <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> prayers.</i> Immediately, the Holy Spirit will enclothe the [High] Priest. He will look at the breastplate and with the spirit of prophecy see "Go up" or "Do not go up" written in letters emerging from the breastplate toward his face. The [High] Priest would then answer [the inquirer], telling him: "Go up" or "Do not go up."
Two matters should not be asked about at once. If they are, one replies only to the first. Inquiry should not be made [of the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tumim</i>] by an ordinary person, only by a king, the court, or one who the community at large requires. [This is derived from Numbers 27:21:] "Before Elazar the priest shall he stand... [he and all the children of Israel with him, and the entire congregation]." "He" refers to the king;<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">For the verse is referring to Joshua whose position was that of a king.</i> "all the children of Israel" to the priest anointed to lead the people in war,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a person upon whom the future of the entire Jewish people depended.</i> or someone whom the people need to make inquiry for them; and "all the congregation" refers to the High Court.
The statements found in the words of the prophets<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See I Samuel 22:18.</i> that the priests would wear an <i>ephod</i> of linen does not mean that they were High Priests. For the High Priest's <i>ephod</i> was not of linen [alone].<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, it also contained sky-blue wool, scarlet wool, red wool, as related in Chapter 9, Halachah 9.</i> For the Levites would also wear such a garment, for the prophet Samuel was a Levite, and [I Samuel 2:18] describes him as "a youth, girded with a linen <i>ephod</i>." Instead, this <i>ephod</i> was worn by the students of the prophets<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 7:4-5 with regard to the preparations a person would make for the spirit of prophecy to rest upon him.</i> and those who were fit to have the Holy Spirit rest upon them to make it known that such a person reached a rung equivalent to that of the High Priest who speaks with the Holy Spirit via the medium of the <i>ephod</i> and the breastplate.<br>Blessed be the Merciful One Who grants assistance.
