There are three types of priestly garments. 1) the garments of an ordinary priest, 2) [the High Priest's] golden garments and 3) [the High Priest's] white garments. The garments of an ordinary priest are four: 1) a tunic, 2) leggings, 3) a hat, and 4) a sash. These four types [of garments] are all made from white linen and are sewn with six-fold threads. The sash alone was embroidered with wool.
The golden garments are the garments of the High Priest, and they are eight garments: The four of an ordinary priest, 5) the cloak, 6) the ephod, 7) the breastplate, and 8) the forehead plate. The sash of the High Priest was embroidered and was made in a similar manner as that of the ordinary priest. [Similarly,] the hat [that the Torah mentions] with regard to Aaron corresponds to the hat mentioned with regard to his sons. [The difference is that] the hat of the High Priest is worn like fabric swathed around a hernia (turban), and the hat of an ordinary priest is worn like an ordinary hat. Therefore, it is called 'migba'at.'
