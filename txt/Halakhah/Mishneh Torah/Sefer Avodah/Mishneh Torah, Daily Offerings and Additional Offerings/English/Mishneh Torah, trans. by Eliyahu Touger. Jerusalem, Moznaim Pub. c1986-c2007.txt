Mishneh Torah, Daily Offerings and Additional Offerings



Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment to offer two lambs as burnt-offerings every day.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 39) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 401) count this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. The Ramban (at the conclusion to his <i>Hosafos</i> to the negative commandments) argues that they should be considered as two separate mitzvot.</i> They are called the continuous offering. One [should be brought] in the morning and one in the afternoon as [Numbers 28:3] states: "Two each day, a continuous offering."
When is the time at which they should be slaughtered? The morning one should be slaughtered before sunrise,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For "the eager hurry [to perform] mitzvot" (<i>Pesachim</i> 4a).</i> when the entire eastern horizon becomes illuminated.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when the rays of the sun are already visible, but the orb of the sun has not appeared.</i> Once there was a pressing situation for the community in [the era of] the Second Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ediot</i> 6:1, based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 1:4), the Rambam explains that once during the Greek occupation of the Holy Land, the Temple was besieged. Each day, the priests would exchange two baskets of gold coins for two lambs. One day, however, the Greeks refused to make the exchange. The people were forlorn. Later that morning, they miraculously found two lambs in the Chamber of the Lambs and R. Yuda bar Bava ruled that the morning sacrifice could be offered if the fourth hour of the day had not passed.</i> and they offered the daily morning sacrifice at four hours after daybreak.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz derives two points from the Rambam's statements: a) only in a pressing situation may the offering of the sacrifice be delayed until after daybreak; b) even in a pressing situation, the sacrifice may not be offered after four hours of the day have passed.</i>
[The lamb for] the continuous offering of the afternoon should be slaughtered when the shadows have been extended<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">At noon, the sun is directly overhead and does not cast a shadow. By 12:30, the sun will have already passed to the western portion of the sky and will thus cast a shadow to the east.</i> and it is obvious to all that they have been extended.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the sacrifice could have been offered directly after noon. Nevertheless, since the time of noon is not obvious to everyone, it was delayed slightly.</i> This is from six and a half hours of the day until the day's end. Every day, they would not slaughter it until eight and a half hours of the day and they would offer it at nine and a half hours.<br>Why would they delay [its slaughter] for two hours after the beginning of the time? Because of the sacrifices of individuals and those of the community.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to allow all of the other sacrifices to be offered, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> For it is forbidden to offer any sacrifice before the continuous offering of the morning and no sacrifice is offered after the continuous sacrifice of the afternoon<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz asks: Why isn't its sacrifice delayed any longer? He responds that the Sages did not desire for there to be any time pressure at all regarding its offering. Also, they wanted - at least partially - to fulfill the charge (<i>Pesachim</i> 4a): "The eager hurry [to perform] mitzvot."</i> with the exception of the Paschal sacrifice. [That leniency was granted, because] it is impossible for all of Israel to offer their Paschal sacrifices in two hours.
The Paschal sacrifice is slaughtered only after the continuous offering of the afternoon.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 1:4 for more details.</i> Similarly, those individuals requiring atonement<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i>, ch. 1, this term refers to certain individuals - a <i>zav</i>, a <i>zavah</i>, a person afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i>, and a woman after childbirth - who are not permitted to partake of sacrifices until they offer certain sacrifices.</i> may offer their atonement offerings after the continuous offering of the afternoon on the fourteenth [of Nisan] so that they will be ritually pure and [and able] to partake of their Paschal offerings in the evening.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This leniency is granted because a person who does not offer the Paschal sacrifices is liable for <i>karet</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 59a).</i>
When the day before Pesach falls during the week or on the Sabbath, the Afternoon Sacrifice would be slaughtered after seven and a half hours and offered after eight and a half hours so that [the people] would have time to slaughter their Paschal sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For every member of the Jewish people would have to partake of a Paschal sacrifice. Thus there would be a multitude of animals to slaughter and have their blood offered.</i> If the day before Pesach falls on Friday, [the Afternoon Sacrifice] would be slaughtered at six and a half hours, the beginning of the time allotted for it and offered at seven and a half hours, so that they would have ample time to roast [their sacrifices] before the commencement of the Sabath.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">At all other times, the Paschal sacrifices could be roasted at night. Hence, as long as they were slaughtered before nightfall, there was no difficulty. The roasting of the Paschal sacrifices did not, however, supersede the prohibition against cooking on the Sabbath. Hence, the slaughter had to be performed earlier so that they could be roasted on time.</i>
Even though [no sacrificial animals] are slaughtered after the continuous offering of the afternoon,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the division of the halachot in the authentic manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. A printing error appears to have crept into the standard published text.</i> any entity that is fit to be offered on the altar's pyre is offered the entire day. And the limbs of the burnt-offerings and the <i>eimorim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The fats and inner organs of the animal that are offered on the altar.</i> may be offered until midnight, as we explained in [<i>Hilchot] Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 4:2, this is a Rabbinic safeguard.</i><br>The limbs and the <i>eimorim</i> - whether from the continuous offerings or from other sacrifices - that were not consumed [by the fire], may be turned over<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">So that they will be consumed by the fires faster and more completely.</i> throughout the entire night until the morning,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Although our Sages decreed that the limbs not be offered on the altar after midnight as mentioned above, if they were offered before midnight, they may be turned over the entire night.</i> as [Leviticus 6:2] states: "The entire night until the morning."
[The offering of] the limbs of the continuous offering on the altar's pyre [at night] supersedes [the prohibitions of] ritual impurity,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., communal sacrifices may be offered in a state of ritual impurity. If the offering itself was offered in this manner, the limbs may be offered in this manner at night.</i> but does not supersede the Sabbath [prohibitions]. Instead, all of the limbs of the continuous offerings offered on Friday are offered on the altar's pyre on Friday alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., during the day and not during the night.</i> For the initial [offering] of the continuous offering supersedes the Sabbath [prohibitions],<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an animal sacrificed as a communal offering may be slaughtered and offered on the altar on the Sabbath.</i> but its concluding aspects<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The offering of the limbs and fats which were not offered on the pyre on Friday.</i> do not.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If there was no opportunity to offer the fats and the limbs on Friday, they should be brought up to the top of the altar on Friday night, but not offered on the pyre. On the top of the altar, they are not disqualified because of the passage of the night and they should be offered on Saturday night (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i> in the name of the Ritba).</i> The fats of [the communal sacrifices offered on] the Sabbath are offered on a festival, at night, if the festival falls on Saturday night. [These fats] may not, however, be offered on the night of Yom Kippur [if it falls on Saturday night].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">According to the fixed calendar followed at present, Yom Kippur can never fall on a Saturday night. Moreover, even when the new moon was sanctified based on the testimony of witnesses, an effort was made not to have Yom Kippur fall directly after the Sabbath (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 20a). Nevertheless, it is possible for the two holy days to follow in succession. See <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 8:10.</i> [These concepts are derived from Numbers 28:10 which] states: "The burnt-offering of a Sabbath on its Sabbath." [This excludes the offering of] a burnt-offering of a Sabbath on another Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">And Yom Kippur is also called "a Sabbath."</i> Nor may the burnt-offering of a weekday be offered on a festival.
When the fourteenth [of Nisan] falls on Sabbath, the fats of the Paschal sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Which is offered on the Sabbath.</i> may be offered on the night of the festival,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., on Saturday night which is the first night of the festival.</i> for they are considered as the fats of the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even though they were not offered because of the Sabbath, since their blood was offered on the Sabbath, the offering of their fats supersedes the festival prohibitions (Radbaz).</i>
There never should be less than six lambs that have been inspected<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">To make sure that they are free of physical blemishes [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 2:5)].</i> in the Chamber of the Lambs.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This was one of the sub-chambers in the Chamber of the Hearth (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:10).</i> They should be prepared four days before their sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam writes that the source for this practice was the Paschal sacrifice brought by the Jews in Egypt. They were commanded to take the lambs four days before they were offered.</i> Even though they would be inspected beforehand, they would not slaughter the continuous offering until they inspect it again, before its slaughter by the light of the torches.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The torches were necessary, because the offering was slaughtered before daybreak and more light was necessary for a careful inspection.</i> It was given water to drink from a golden cup<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This was a sign of the wealth and prosperity of the Jewish people, as appropriate for the Temple [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 3:4)].</i> so that it would be easier to skin.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that the rationale the Rambam gives here is different from that which he initially gave in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Beitzah</i> 5:6). Afterwards, he emended that text to include the rationale mentioned here (Rav Kappach's notes to that mishnah).</i>
The continuous offering of the afternoon is offered in the same manner as the continuous offering of the morning. Everything follows the regimen for the offering of the burnt offering, as written in [<i>Hilchot] Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Chapters 6 and 9.</i> The lamb was not bound before its slaughter so as not to copy the practice of the heretics.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Tamid</i> 31b, states that this refers to pagan idolaters who would bind all four feet of their sacrifices.</i> Instead, they would hold its forefeet and its hindfeet by hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tamid</i> 31b states that the sacrifice would be bound like the binding of Isaac the son of Abraham. Although some commentaries explain that this means that one of the animals forefeet and one of its hindfeet would be bound, the Rambam does not accept that interpretation and maintains that none of the legs were bound. the <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> (<i>Tamid</i> 4:1) brings support for this interpretation, noting that our Sages state that the priest who would offer the limbs on the altar would hold them during the slaughter. Thus each of the limbs was held by a different priest.</i> It would be held in the following manner: Its head would be to the south and its face to the west.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In this way, if it defecated, its rear would not be facing the altar or the Temple Building.</i>
The continuous offering of the morning would be slaughtered in the northwest corner of the butchering area,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The area on the northern side of the Temple Courtyard where the sacrificial animals were slaughtered and cut up. See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:13-14.</i> on the second ring,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">There were rings implanted into the floor of the Temple Courtyard into which were inserted the legs of the sacrificial animals to hold them in place during the slaughter. See <i>ibid.</i>:14; the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 4:1). Others maintain that the animal's head was inserted into the rings.</i> and that of the afternoon would be slaughtered in the northeast corner on the second ring. [In this way,] they would be opposite the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The sun rises in the east. Hence if the sacrifice was slaughtered on the eastern corner in the morning, it is possible that the wall of the Temple Courtyard would block its rays. Conversely, since it sets in the west, the afternoon sacrifice was slaughtered in the east so that the sun's rays would not be blocked.</i> The Received Tradition states that [these sacrificial animals] should be slaughtered opposite the sun.
If they erred and inadvertently - or even intentionally - failed to offer the continuous offering of the morning, that of the afternoon should be offered.<br>When does the above apply? After the altar has been dedicated. If, however, it is a new altar on which no sacrifices have been offered, the continuous offering of the afternoon should not be offered on it first. For the altar for burnt-offerings should be dedicated solely by [sacrificing] the continuous offering of the morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast to the Golden Altar, as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 1.</i>

Chapter 2

It is a positive commandment for there to be fire continuously burning on the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 29) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 132) count this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.<br>The Radbaz explains that this mitzvah has four components: a) to have a fire continuously burning on the altar; b) to bring ordinary fire with each sacrifice; c) to arrange the array of wood on the altar; and d) to offer two logs with the continuous offering. Although these different actions are each associated with a separate verse, since they all share one objective: to have fire burn on the altar, they are considered as one mitzvah.</i> as [Leviticus 6:6] states: "A continuous fire shall burn on the altar."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There was a special pyre kept burning on the altar for this purpose, as stated in Halachah 4.</i> Although a fire descended from heaven,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As Leviticus 9:24 states: "And fire emerged from before God and it... consumed the burnt-offering." This fire remained on the altar throughout the entire existence of the Sanctuary. <i>Yoma</i> 21b relates that in the First and Second Temples, fire also descended from heaven and burned on the altar.</i> it is a mitzvah to bring from ordinary fire, as [<i>ibid.</i> 1:7] states: "And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall place fire on the altar."
In the morning, the wood was arranged.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 5, which states that the priest who would remove the ashes from the altar would prepare the arrangement of wood and he would bring the logs together with the daily offering.</i> They would prepare a large array of fire at the top of the altar, as [<i>ibid.</i> 6:5] states: "And the priest shall burn on it wood each morning."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 26b derives this concept from a different prooftext. It is questionable why the Rambam deviates from that source, since by doing so, he is forced to derive two different concepts from the same verse.</i> Similarly, it is a mitzvah to bring two logs of wood<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 7:3 states that the logs used for the offering were "a cubit long and a cubit wide. Their thickness was like that of the leveling rod for an overflowing <i>se'ah</i>."</i> [to the altar] together with the continuous offering of the morning, besides the wood of the arrangement. [This is also intimated by the same verse.]<br>Similarly, two logs of wood were added together with the continuous offering of the afternoon, as [implied by <i>ibid.</i> 1:7]: "And they shall arrange wood on the fire." According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sifra</i> to the above verse; <i>Yoma</i> 26b.</i> it was taught that the verse is speaking about the continuous offering of the afternoon.
The two logs brought in the afternoon are brought up [to the altar] by two priests, each one holding one log in his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz maintains that the priest who would bring the logs in the morning (see note 4) would also bring a log in the afternoon and he would invite a friend to join him and bring the other log.</i> This is derived from the fact that the term "and they shall arrange" used by the above prooftext is plural. Those of the morning, by contrast, are brought by one priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For the term used in that prooftext is singular.</i>
Three arrays of fire would be prepared on the top of the altar each day:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom Kippurim</i> 4:5.</i> The first was the large arrangement upon which were offered the continuous offering and the other sacrifices. The second was a small [arrangement] to its side from which fire was taken in a fire-pan to offer the incense offering each day.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 5.</i> The third was not associated with any other purpose except to fulfill the mitzvah of burning fire, as [<i>ibid.</i> 6:6] states: "A continuous fire shall burn."<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 1.</i>
According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 45a.</i> it was derived that [<i>ibid.</i>:2] which states: "On the pyre, on the altar" - refers to the large arrangement. "The fire of the altar shall burn upon it" [<i>ibid.</i>] - refers to the second arrangement for the incense offering. And "The fire of the altar shall burn upon it" [<i>ibid.</i>:5] - refers to the third arrangement for the maintenance of the fire. The limbs and the fats that were not consumed during the evening are placed on the side of the large arrangement.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when the altar was arranged in the morning, these limbs and fats were placed there until the large arrangement could be prepared and kindled.</i>
One who extinguished the fire of the altar is liable for lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 81) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 133) count this prohibition as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i>:6] states:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">We have cited this reference because it is the one the Rambam refers to in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i> Others cite Leviticus 6:5. And in his commentary on the Torah, Rashi states that there are two negative commandments involved.</i> "It shall not be extinguished." Even one coal - even if it was removed from the altar - if one extinguishes it, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that the fire of the altar as a whole continues to burn.</i> If, however, one extinguishes the fire of a fire-pan<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 4.</i> or the fire designated to kindle the <i>Menorah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 13.</i> that was kindled on the altar, even if he extinguishes it on the top of the altar, he is exempt. [The rationale is that] this fire has been allocated for another mitzvah and it is no longer called "the fire of the altar."
When one arrays the wood of the large arrangement, he should arrange it on the eastern portion of the altar. It should be made [in a manner that makes it apparent]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 2:4).</i> that he began to arrange it from the east. There should be open space between the logs<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">So that there would be enough air for the fire to burn effectively (Radbaz).</i> and the ends of the inner logs should touch the ashes that are in the center of the altar. It is called the ash-heap.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 13. From the Rambam's statements here and in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>op. cit.</i>:2), it would appear that the top surface of the altar was flat and the name <i>tapuach</i> (literally, "bulging") was given because of the ash-pile made there. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that there was a bulge in the center of the surface of the altar itself. See also the Meiri in his commentary to <i>Tamid</i> who maintains that the term refers to a concave curve on the altar's surface. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's interpretation.</i>
After the large arrangement is arrayed, logs of high-quality fig wood<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 7:3.</i> are selected and a second arrangement is made for [the fire for] the incense offering near the southwest corner,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the corner closest to both the Temple Building and the ramp.</i> four cubits to the north of the corner.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For in this way, he will be fulfilling the directive of Leviticus 16:12: "And he shall take... flaming coals from the altar, before God." <i>Yoma</i> 45b explains that this refers to the outer altar which has a portion that is "before God," opposite the Holy of Holies. The second arrangement of fire was arrayed exactly in this position. Although the above verse speaks about the incense offering of Yom Kippur, our Sages also applied the concept to the incense offering brought each day.</i> It would contain five <i>se'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>se'ah</i> is slightly more than 8 liter in contemporary measure according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>. Other commentaries consider it larger.</i> of coals. On the Sabbath, it would contain about eight <i>se'ah</i> of coals, because on every Sabbath, the two bowls of frankincense from the showbread<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 11; Chapter 6, Halachah 11.</i> would be offered on it.
The third arrangement for the sake of the maintenance of the fire can be made on any place on the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Har HaMoriah</i> states that this can be inferred from the fact that our Sages did not mention any specific place for this arrangement.</i><br>The fire should be kindled on [the altar]. One should not kindle the fire on the ground and bring it up to the altar. Instead, it should be kindled on the altar itself, as [implied by] the verse: "The fire of the altar shall burn." This<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., its description as "the fire <i>of the altar</i>. The Radbaz notes that <i>Yoma</i> 45b derives this concept from a different verse and explains that this is a characteristic practice of the Rambam in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: to interpret the Torah's verses according to their simple meaning even though different interpretations are offered in prior Rabbinic sources.</i> teaches that the kindling should be on the altar itself.
It is a positive commandment to remove the ashes from the altar each day,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 30) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 131) count this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.</i> as [Leviticus 6:3] states: "And he shall remove the ashes." This is one of the services performed by the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">It may not be performed by an Israelite (see <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 9:8).</i><br>The priestly garments<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">All four priestly garments, even though only two are mentioned explicitly in the Torah in this context [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 5:3)].</i> [worn] when removing the ashes<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to other commentaries, according to the Rambam, these clothes are worn when removing the ashes from the altar and not when taking them out of the Temple Courtyard, for, as he states in Halachah 15, taking them out of the Temple Courtyard is not considered as priestly service.</i> should be less valuable than those [worn] when performing the other aspects of Temple service, as [<i>ibid.</i>] continues: "He shall remove his garments and put on other garments and remove the ashes." The term "other" does not imply ordinary<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., garments that have not been consecrated.</i> garments, but rather [priestly garments] that are less valuable than the first. [The rationale is that]<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains that the reason they prepared clothes of lesser value is not because they did not wish to undertake the expense, because in the Temple, no such considerations were made. As our Sages state (<i>Tamid</i> 3:4), "Poverty is inappropriate in a place of wealth."</i> it is not proper conduct to serve a cup [of wine] to one's master in the same clothes as one cooked food for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Removing the ashes is comparable to cooking food, for both are acts of preparation. Serving wine and offering sacrifices are also analogous, for both involving presenting something.</i>
When should the ashes be removed from the altar each day? At dawn.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The time when the first rays of the sun become visible on the eastern horizon. According to the various opinions, this is between 72 minutes and two hours before sunrise.</i> On the festivals, it should be carried out from the beginning of the middle third of the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since there are many sacrifices offered during the festivals, all of the activity in the Temple is begun earlier so that there will be ample opportunity.</i> And on Yom Kippur, from midnight.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">On Yom Kippur, all of the elements of the Temple service were performed by the High Priest. Lest he become tired, the different elements of the Temple service were spaced out as far as possible. Hence, this activity was performed earlier in the night.</i>
How are [the ashes] removed? [The priest] who merited<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachot 1-5, for a description of the process in which this priest was chosen.</i> to remove the ashes would immerse [in the <i>mikveh</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 5:4 and <i>Tamid</i> 26a, it appears that the intent is that a person who enters the lottery for the right to remove the ashes would immerse beforehand. See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 5:9.</i> and put on the clothes for the removal of the ashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 4, Halachah 1, states that the priests would come to the lottery wearing their priestly garments. Thus the one who was chosen would remove his ordinary priestly garments and put on the garments for the removal of the ashes.</i> He would sanctify his hands and feet [from the basin].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam writes in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 1:4), a priest should not approach the altar for any aspect of the Temple service, without first sanctifying himself, as implied by Exodus 30:20.

Chapter 3

It is a positive commandment to offer the incense<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the description of the way in which the incense offering was prepared in <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i>, ch. 2.</i> offering<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 28) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 103) count this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.

Significantly, the Ramban (<i>Hosafot</i> to the negative commandments) maintains that the morning incense offering and the afternoon one should be considered as separate mitzvot.</i> on the Golden Altar<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See the description of the Golden Altar in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 3:17.</i> in the Sanctuary, twice each day, in the morning and in the afternoon, as [Exodus 30:7] states: "And Aaron shall burn on it the incense of fragrant spices."<br>If one did not offer it in the morning, he should offer it in the afternoon even if [the omission] was intentional.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 4:4), the Rambam writes that it was rare that the priests willfully omitted offering the incense offering, because offering it brought blessings for prosperity.</i> The Golden Altar may be dedicated only with the incense offering of the afternoon.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast to the daily offering (Chapter 1, Halachah 12).</i>
How much [incense] was offered every day?

When the incense is offered in the Sanctuary every day,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that this phrase is making a distinction between the incense offering brought each day and that brought on Yom Kippur.

See <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom Kippurim</i> 4:2.</i> all of the people depart from the Sanctuary and from [the area] between the Entrance Hall and the altar.

What is the order of the offering of the incense offering each day?

Hence rather than damage a golden one, the Sages took the financial needs of the Jewish people into consideration and did not require that a golden one be used each day.</i> If a <i>kab</i> or less of the coals have become scattered [on the ground],<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since the golden fire-pan was smaller than the silver one, it was natural that this would occur (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> he should sweep them into the channel [for the outflow].<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 2:11, there was a channel for outflow that ran through the Temple Courtyard. The priest would sweep the coals there [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>)]. The Radbaz questions why the priest would be allowed to intentionally extinguish the coals. Perhaps his question can be answered on the basis of <i>Hilchot Tuma'at Ochalin</i> 8:9 which states that these coals no longer have any holiness.</i> On the Sabbath, he should cover them with the <i>pisachter</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains that in his Targum (Exodus 27:3 , Onkelos uses the term <i>pisachter</i> for the Hebrew <i>sir</i>, meaning "pot."</i> If more than a <i>kab</i> become scattered, he should collect more with the fire-pan.
The <i>pisachter</i> would serve three functions: It was used to cover coals and a [dead] crawling animal on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 3:20.</i> and it was used to remove the ashes from the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 13.</i>
[The priest] who removed the ashes from the inner altar<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tamid</i> 6:1 states that he would be accompanied by the priest who would clean the <i>Menorah.</i> The Rambam does not mention this point, because it is not germane to the discussion at hand.</i> would proceed before them, he would take the <i>teni</i> that contained the ashes from the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Which he had left previously in the Temple Sanctuary, as stated in Halachah 4.</i> prostrate himself<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As appropriate for one who completed his Temple service and depart.</i> and depart. [The priest] holding the fire pan would array the coals on the surface of the inner altar, spreading them out with the bottom of the fire-pan. [He would then] prostrate himself and depart.<br>The one holding the <i>kaf</i> would remove the <i>bezech</i> from the <i>kaf</i> and give it to a friend or relative.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., thus four priests would enter: a) one to clean the altar; b) one to place the coal on it; c) one to pour incense into the hands of the priest who would offer it; and d) one to offer the incense on the coals (Radbaz).</i> He checks if some of the incense spilled out [from the <i>bezech</i>] into the <i>kaf</i>. His friend or relative places the incense that spilled and that which is in the <i>bezech</i> in his hands. [He then] prostrates himself and departs.
The one who offers the incense is warned:<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Chapter 4, Halachah 7, the incense offering would be given to a priest who never offered it previously.

Otherwise, he will have to lean over the altar while the incense is burning and he could be burned in this manner.</i> He begins to pour the incense on the fire gently, like one who sifts flour until it is spread over the entire fire.
The priest who offers the incense does not offer it until the overseer<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Yoma</i> 28a) maintains that this term refers to the <i>segen</i>, the High Priest's assistant. <i>Tosafot</i> maintains that it refers to the priest who apportions the Temple service by lottery.

If the High Priest is the one offering the incense, the overseer says: "My sir, High Priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as expression of deference.</i> offer the incense."

The kindling of the lamps supersedes [the prohibitions of forbidden labor] on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Although kindling light is usually forbidden on the Sabbath, in this instance it is permitted.</i> and [the restrictions of] ritual impurity,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">If the majority of priests or sacred utensils are impure, the <i>Menorah</i> may still be kindled.</i> as do the [other] sacrifices that [are offered at] a fixed time,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 4:10.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i>:20] states: "To raise up a continuously [burning] lamp."

In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 9:3), however, the Rambam writes that a medium sized wick was used at all times. The Radbaz explains that position, stating that if some oil was left over, it was not significant, for the Temple sacrifices should be offered in a spirit of wealth and prosperity.</i> The <i>Menorah</i> may be dedicated only with the kindling of the seven lamps in the afternoon.
What is meant by the expression "the removal of the ashes of the <i>Menorah</i>"?<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Me'ilah</i> 3:4) where the Rambam writes that <i>deshen</i> means "ash" and the remainder of the wicks and the coals produced are considered as ash.</i> Every lamp that has burnt out should have its wick and its [remaining] oil removed and it should be cleaned. The priest should place another wick and other oil in it, using the half <i>log</i> measure.

Kindling the lamps is what is meant by the term <i>hatavah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Other authorities interpret <i>hatavah</i> as referring to the cleaning of the lamps. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 3:9), the Rambam explains that this term means "the cleaning of the lamps, rekindling what was extinguished, and changing their wicks." See also <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 3:7 where it appears that the Rambam interprets this term as meaning cleaning and preparing the <i>Menorah</i>.<br>As the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions, many other commentaries follow the approach of Rashba (Responsa 79 and 309) who maintains that the term <i>hatavah</i> means only the cleaning and preparing of the <i>Menachot</i>. This difference of opinion regarding the definition of this term is dependent on a larger issue. Were all the lamps kindled in the morning or not? As mentioned in Halachah 10, the Rambam maintains that they were. The Rashba and those who follow his approach differ. Accordingly, they differ in their interpretation of Exodus 30:7 "when he performs <i>hatavah</i> for the lamps, he shall offer the incense." According to the Rambam, this refers to the kindling of the lamps, while according to the Rashba, this refers only to cleaning them.<br>Exodus 30:8 uses a different term for kindling the lamps at night (as the Rashba states in support of his approach). Perhaps <i>hatavah</i> can refer only to the rekindling of the lamps in the morning as indicated by the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah cited above. See the gloss of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.</i> When one discovers a lamp that has not been extinguished, he should restore it.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., add oil so that it will burn until nightfall.</i>
When the western lamp<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 3:8, the Rambam maintains that the <i>Menorah</i> was positioned from north to south.

Using the rules of Biblical exegesis, our Sages explain that the verse can be interpreted. Whenever a continuous fire will burn - and the <i>Menorah</i> is also referred to as a continuous fire - it shall be kindled from the altar.<br>The Ra'avad differs with this ruling and maintains that when possible, even the western lamp should be kindled from the other lamps of the <i>Menorah</i>. Only when there is no alternative, it should be kindled from the altar. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, give support for the Rambam's view.</i> When any of the other lamps are extinguished, by contrast, they may be rekindled from each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, as stated in the following halachah, it is desirable to do so rather than use another candle.</i>
How are [the lamps of the <i>Menorah</i>] kindled? One should pull its wick out<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">With tweezers.

All of the substances that are forbidden to be used as wicks on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:5.

Chapter 4

All of these services that were performed [in the Temple] every day were performed on the basis of a lottery.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the offering of the communal offerings. The priests to offer individual sacrifices were not chosen on the basis of a lottery (Rashi, <i>Yoma</i> 26b). See also the gloss of the <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> to Halachah 9 which discusses this issue.<br><i>Yoma</i> 22a explains that the lotteries were initiated, because originally the priests would race to carry out the Temple functions. Once as the priests were running up the ramp, one pushed another and he fell and broke his leg. When the Sages realized that danger could result, they instituted these lotteries.</i> How would they conduct themselves? All of the priests of the clan of that day<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i>, ch. 4, which explains that the priests were divided into 24 watches. Each watch would serve in the Temple for one week at a time. Each of those watches were divided into seven clans which would carry out the services for that particular day.</i> enter the Chamber of Hewn Stone<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A large chamber on the northern side of the Temple Courtyard. See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:17. This chamber was chosen because a portion of it is outside the Temple Courtyard and it was in that portion the priests would stand. The rationale is that, as will be explained, the hat of one of the priests would be removed and it is inappropriate to stand bareheaded in the Temple Courtyard even briefly.</i> after dawn,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The first glowing of the sun's rays, well before sunrise. At this time, the dust was removed from the altar, as stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 11. See also Chapter 6, Halachah 1.</i> while garbed in the priestly garments. The [priest] appointed [to supervise] the lotteries [stands] with them and they stand in a semicircle. The supervisor takes a hat from one of the priests and returns it to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Immediately, so that the priest would not be bareheaded.</i> This is the person from whom they will begin to count and thus determine the lottery, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 3.</i>
The men [selected to perform] the services proceed to them. The remainder of the priests are taken to the attendants who remove the sacred garments from them, leaving them only with the leggings<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For reasons of modesty.</i> until they put on their ordinary garments. They then remove the sacred leggings. The attendants then return the garments to the lockers.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 8:8-9.</i>
How would the lottery be carried out? [The priests] would stand in a semicircle. They would decide on a number, e.g., 80, 100, 1000, or any other number that they would choose. Afterwards, the supervisor says: "Stick out your fingers" and they stick out one or two fingers.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Yoma</i> 2:1), the Rambam writes that a priest would stick out one finger if he was weak or several if he was healthy.</i> If one would stick out three, the three are counted.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Yoma, loc. cit.</i>, is different from that of most other authorities with regard to this point. See the gloss of the Radbaz who elaborates on this matter.</i> A thumb should not be stuck out in the Temple because of the deceivers. For a thumb is small and it is easy to stick out and then bend over.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">And thus he could manipulate the counting to favor himself [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>). Here also, the Rambam's interpretation differs from that of other authorities.</i> If one sticks out a thumb, it is not counted.<br>The supervisor begins counting from [the priest] who was identified by the removal of his hat. They count on their fingers<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Proceeding to the right along the semicircle.</i> and then repeat<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Counting each finger a second time.</i> until they reach the number they agreed upon. The person upon whose finger the counting was completed is the one who is chosen in the first lottery for the Temple service.
Why do they count the number they have agreed upon by the fingers they stuck out instead of counting the people themselves? Because it is forbidden to count Jews<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Even for a mitzvah (<i>Yoma</i> 22b).</i> except via another entity, as [I Samuel 15:4] states: "And he counted them with lambs."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Saul's census of the army before entering into battle against Amalek. Conversely, we find that when David took a census and actually counted people, a severe plague resulted.</i>
Four lotteries were carried out each day in the morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the afternoon, see Halachah 8.</i> The first lottery was for who would remove the ashes from the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As described in Chapter 2, Halachah 12.</i> The lottery was conducted and the one who merited was chosen to remove the ashes. He also arranges the wood on the altar, and he brings the two logs of wood to the altar, and brings in a fire-pan full of flaming [coals]<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz elaborates in questioning the Rambam's ruling, for it appears to run contrary to the statements of <i>Yoma</i> 25b-26a. Indeed, he maintains that there is a printing error in the text and that this phrase should be included in the following halachah. Others, however, explain that it appears that there is support for the Rambam's position based on the Mishnayot of <i>Tamid</i> 5:5, 6:2.</i> from the outer altar to the golden altar to offer the incense upon it.
Thirteen [priests] are chosen in the second lottery<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>Yoma</i> 26b relates, on Sabbaths and festivals even more priests are selected in this lottery. As indicated by Chapter 6, Halachah 1, according to the Rambam, the first two lotteries were conducted in direct proximity to each other.</i> according to the order in which they stand.<br>What is implied? The supervisor tells them to stick out their fingers and counts as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 3.</i> The one who is chosen first by lottery slaughters the continuous offering of the morning. The second priest standing next to him<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">On his right.</i> receives the blood of the continuous offering and he casts it [on the altar]. The third, [who stands] next to the second, removes the ashes from the inner altar, the altar of the incense offering. The fourth on his side removes the ashes from the <i>Menorah</i> and kindles the lamps. The fifth brings up the head of the continuous offering and its [right] hindleg to the ramp.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>, ch. 6, for details concerning how the offering was divided into portions and brought to the altar.</i> The sixth brings up the two forefeet. The seventh brings up the tail and the [left] hindleg. The eighth brings up the breast and the neck. The ninth brings up the two flanks. The tenth brings up the inner organs. The eleventh brings up the flour for the additional offerings. The twelfth brings up the <i>chavitin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 18; <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 13:4, 6:16.</i> and the thirteenth brings up the wine of the additional offerings.
For the third lottery, the supervisor announces to all the members of the clan of that day: "Whoever has never brought an incense offering<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The laws that apply had they all brought an incense offering once are mentioned in the following halachah.</i> should come and enter the lottery."<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Bringing the incense offering was a medium to drawn down Divine blessings for prosperity. Hence the opportunity is given to priests who had never brought that offering previously (<i>Yoma</i> 26a).</i> The one chosen first in this lottery merited to offer the incense offering.
For the fourth lottery, all the priests gathered.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in contrast to the previous lottery where those who had brought the incense offering previously did not participate (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> The lottery is held to know who will bring the limbs up from the ramp to the altar. The lottery was held and the one who was chosen<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one priest would bring up all the limbs (<i>Tosafot, Yoma</i> 26a).</i> merited.<br>A different lottery was not held for the continuous offering of the afternoon. Instead, all of the priests who were chosen to perform any of the tasks in the morning should also perform them in the afternoon.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that although the wood for the altar was brought by two priests in the afternoon as opposed to the one in the morning, there was no need for a second lottery. Instead, the priest who was selected in the morning would bring one of his friends to assist him in the afternoon.</i> An exception was the incense offering. Another lottery was made for [the right to offer] it in the afternoon. All those who never brought an incense offering from that clan could come and enter the lottery. If they had all offered incense previously, they are all able to enter the third lottery in the morning and the one who was selected in the morning offers the incense in the afternoon as well.
On the Sabbath, when [besides] the continuous offerings, the additional offerings and the two bowls of frankincense were offered, how would they conduct themselves?<br>In the morning, the lottery was held among the men of clan of the watch that was leaving.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., completes their week of Temple service. For the watches changed after the offering of the sacrifices on the morning of the Sabbath (<i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:3).</i> They would offer the continuous offering of the morning and the two sheep brought as burnt-offerings for the additional offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 41) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 402) count the offering of the two sheep as the additional offering of the Sabbath as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.</i> The ones selected to perform the tasks for the continuous offering of the morning would [perform those tasks] for the two sheep [brought as] additional offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This conclusion is reached from the fact that the Talmud does not speak of a separate lottery for the additional offerings.</i> The watch that enters<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., begins their week of Temple service.</i> on the Sabbath would conduct other lotteries for the continuous offering of the afternoon. Both watches would [participate in] the division of the showbread.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As described in Halachah 12.</i>
The [show]bread is not eaten until the two bowls of frankincense are offered on the pyre. The frankincense requires salt like the other sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Issurei HaMizbeiach</i> 5:11-13; <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 16:14.</i>
These two bowls are offered after the additional offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6, Halachah 11.</i> Two priests offer these two bowls.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">They are the fourteenth and fifteenth priests in the second lottery (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i> in the name of the Ritbah). The Radbaz maintains that these priests came from the watch that entered the Temple service that week.</i>
How is the showbread divided on the Sabbaths of the year in general? The watch that enters receives six loaves and the watch that leaves receives six loaves. Those that enter divide [the bread] among themselves in the north, for they are prepared to carry out the Temple service.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This is the portion of the Temple Courtyard where the communal sacrifices are slaughtered. Dividing the bread there distinguishes them as the watch that will perform the service in the Temple that week [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:6)].</i> Those who depart divide it in the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This would show that they have completed their service (<i>Sukkah</i> 56b).</i><br>When the holiday of one of the three pilgrimage festivals<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the first and last days of Pesach and Sukkot and the holiday of Shavuot.</i> falls on the Sabbath or on Sabbath in the midst of the holiday,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., during <i>Chol HaMoed</i>.</i> all of the watches share equally in the division<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the division of the bread itself, but not to the division of the tasks involved in offering it. Those are performed only by the priests of the watch who serve in the Temple that week (<i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:6).</i> of the showbread.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>:4-5 which explains the derivation of this concept.</i> Similarly, if the first holiday of a festival falls on Sunday, all of the watches share equally in the division of the showbread on the day preceding the festival which is the Sabbath because they came early to the Temple service.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, they were given the right to share in the division of the showbread to motivate them to come early.</i><br>Similarly, if the final day of the festival falls on Friday, all of the watches share equally in the division of the showbread on the Sabbath which is the day following the festival. This practice is an ordinance of our Sages [who instituted it] so that the priests should delay [their departure from Jerusalem so that they share] in the division of the showbread.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statements, explaining that since the festival ended on the day before the Sabbath, the priests had no choice but to stay. The Radbaz explains that it is possible that the priests will be staying in the surroundings of Jerusalem, but will not come to the Temple Mount. Giving them a share in the showbread would encourage them to come to the Temple Mount.</i> [In this way,] if one of the members of the watch [of the coming week] would be delayed and not come [on time], another priest will be found [to take his place].
If there is one day intervening between the Sabbath and the festival, e.g., the first day of the festival fell on Monday or the last day fell on Thursday, or Shavuot fell on Monday or Thursday, the watch whose time was fixed that week receives ten loaves and the watch which enters receives two.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This applies if the last day of the holiday fell on Thursday. Conversely, if the first day fell on Monday, few priests will come, so the watch which departs receives ten loaves and the watch which comes two. See the Rambam' Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:6).</i> The rationale is that only one day is left for them to serve alone,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For the priests of all the watches will come to serve during the festival.</i> either Friday or Sunday, and they are indolent and only a few come [to the Temple].<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and Rashi have a different understanding of the passage from <i>Sukkah</i>. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offer support for the Rambam's view.</i>
The High Priest always receives from each watch, half of the loaves that they receive, as [implied by Leviticus 24:9]: "And it shall be for Aaron and his sons," i.e., half for Aaron and half for his sons. A High Priest never receives a portion of a loaf, because that is not respectful.

Chapter 5

It is a positive commandment to arrange the showbread on the [golden] table before God in the Sanctuary, every Sabbath day,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 27) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 97) count this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. Significantly, in his listing of the mitzvot at the beginning of the section, the Rambam defines the mitzvah as making the showbread. See also the notes of the Ra'avad to the Rambam's listing of the mitzvot at the beginning of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, where he questions why placing the incense on the breads and partaking of the breads, are not considered as separate mitzvot.</i> as [Leviticus 24:8] states: "On the Sabbath day, on the Sabbath day, the priest shall arrange it."
It is clearly evident from the Torah that there were twelve loaves. Each loaf required two <i>esronim</i> [of flour]. [The loaves] were arranged in two sets, six loaves in each set, one loaf on the other. There were three rods<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the description of the table and its utensils in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 3:13-15.</i> of gold placed between the loaves so that the wind could blow through them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in this way, the loaves were lifted up so that air could pass through them. The rods were hollow for this purpose (<i>Menachot</i> 97a).<br>The commentaries note that there was an ongoing miracle with regard to the showbread and it remained fresh from week to week (<i>Yoma</i> 21b). Nevertheless, the Torah advises us to take this precaution, because one should not rely on a miracle.</i> Each set was supported by two side-frames. At the side of each set,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a space of two handbreadths was left in the center of the table for this purpose.</i> there is placed a vessel containing a handful of frankincense, as [<i>ibid.</i>:7] states: "And you shall place pure frankincense next to<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that although, generally, the word <i>al</i> is translated as "on," it can also mean "next to," as in the term <i>elev</i>, "Next to it" (Numbers 2:20 .</i> the arrangement." This vessel is called a <i>bezech</i> (dish).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 2:2), the Rambam notes that <i>bezech</i> is Onkelos' translation of the Hebrew <i>kaposav</i>.</i> Thus there were two handfuls of frankincense in two dishes. These dishes had flat bases so that they could be placed on the table.
The two sets of showbread are fundamental necessities for each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if one had only one set, it should not be offered.</i> [Similarly,] the two dishes [of frankincense] are fundamental necessities for each other and the sets and the dishes are necessities for each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if there is anything lacking in either the breads or the frankincense, nothing should be offered.</i> The [golden] table should not be dedicated except by placing the showbread on it on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">One should wait until the Sabbath, because the prooftext cited above states: "On the Sabbath day, on the Sabbath day, the priest shall arrange it."</i><br>From one Sabbath to another, the bread that was placed on the table on the previous Sabbath is removed and new bread is arranged there. The bread that is removed is the bread that is divided between the two watches - that which enters and that which departs<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachot 12-13.</i> - and the High Priest<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i> 14.</i> and they partake of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 2:2), he writes that the showbread may be eaten only on the Sabbath on which it was removed from the table. Nevertheless, when Yom Kippur falls on the Sabbath, they are eaten on Saturday night.</i>
How are the sets of the showbread arranged? Four priests enter [the Sanctuary], two are holding the two sets<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's wording here, it appears that the breads were already folded over (as stated in Halachah 9) and placed one on top of the other. See also Halachah 11.</i> [of bread]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Each holding one.</i> and two, the two dishes [of frankincense].

The priests that enter<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., who bring in the new showbread.</i> stand in the north,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The table itself was on the north side of the Sanctuary, extending lengthwise from east to west.</i> facing the south and those that depart<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., who remove the showbread from the previous week.</i> stand in the south, facing the north. These remove [the showbread from the previous week] and these place down [the new breads]. One should be within a handbreadth of another,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., immediately after removing one, the other should be placed down.</i> for [Exodus 25:30] states: "[You shall place showbread] before Me continually."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there should be no time when there is not bread on the table.</i>

How is the showbread prepared? 24 <i>se'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The minimum size the contemporary authorities give for a <i>se'ah</i> is approximately 8.5 liters.</i> of wheat that is fit [to be made into flour] for meal-offerings are brought.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 7:4 with regard to the special stringencies taken with regard to the preparation of the grain for such offerings.</i> [The kernels] are struck<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 6:5) the Ramban interprets this as striking the wheat powerfully with one's hand so that the dust will be removed from them.</i> and tread upon<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Crushing them with his feet to crack the shells (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> like the other kernels of wheat for the meal offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Which are struck 300 times and tread upon 500 times (<i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach, loc. cit.</i>).</i> They are then ground and sifted with eleven sifters to produce 24 <i>esronim</i> of fine flour.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This was of course a far smaller measure than the 24 <i>se'ah</i>. The remainder of the flour had to be redeemed and then it could be used for ordinary purposes.

These measures were mentioned only as [the optimum manner] for the mitzvah.
The kneading and the fashioning [of the loaves] was performed outside [the Temple Courtyard, but] they are baked in the Courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 11:2), the Rambam writes that it is permitted to knead the loaves outside the Temple Courtyard, but that it is not permitted to bake them outside. He states that the rationale for this distinction was not mentioned in the Talmud.</i> like the other meal-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:21-23. The intent is that the other meal-offerings are baked in the Temple Courtyard. They are, however, also kneaded in the Temple Courtyard. See <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i> They should be kneaded one by one<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 94a derives this from the exegesis of Leviticus 24:5: "Each loaf will be two <i>esronim</i>." Implied is that each loaf is treated individually.</i> and baked two by two.
They had three molds of gold for them:<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the <i>ka'arot</i> mentioned in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 3:14.</i> one in which the loaf was placed while it was dough, the second in which it was baked,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, Rashi in his gloss to Exodus 25:29 states that the loaves were baked in iron molds.</i> and the third in which it was placed when it was removed from the oven so that its [form] would not be impaired.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since the loaves were thin, it is possible that their shape would be impaired.</i>
All of these loaves were rectangular, as [Exodus 35:13] states: <i>Lechem Hapanim</i>, [literally,] "the bread of faces," i.e., it had many surfaces.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commetary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 11:4), the Rambam writes that each loaf had six surfaces: two on either side, one from the front and one from the bottom. This follows the opinion (<i>Menachot</i> 94b) that the showbread was like an open drawer. See the diagram accompanying <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 3:14.</i> The length of each loaf was ten handbreadths,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">A handbreadth is 8 centimeters in contemporary measure according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>.</i> its width, five handbreadths, and its height, seven fingerbreadths.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">A fingerbreadth is 2 centimeters in contemporary measure according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>.</i> The length of the table was twelve handbreadths and its width, six handbreadths. [The priest] should place the length of the loaf across the width of the table. Thus the loaf would extend an extra two handbreadths at either side. He should fold up the portions that extend [beyond the table] on either side,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Menachot</i> 94a) states that the loaves were baked while folded over. When the breads folded over some of the dough would jut out. That dough was left there as support for the sides. <i>Menachot</i> 96a refers to these as <i>karanot</i>, "corners."<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 11:4), the Rambam writes that the height of the bread was four fingerbreadths. In order that there be no contradiction between those statements and the statements here, <i>Minchat Yehudah</i> suggests that the bread itself was four fingerbreadths high. Together with these <i>karanot</i>, the height was seven fingerbreadths. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, suggests that the bread was much thinner.</i> leaving space in the middle [of the loaf] between the two ends.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Hence producing the form "like an open drawer."<br>All of the above follows the popular conception of the form of the showbread as it is usually depicted and as is explained by the Ralbag quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. The Radbaz, however, maintains that this is not the Rambam's intent. Instead, the simple meaning of his words is that the breads were baked as elongated rectangles and folded over only when they were put on the table itself. The folds lay on top of the bread rather than standing perpendicular to it. This form could still be considered "as an open drawer," because of the space between the two folds.</i> Similarly, he should place one loaf on another loaf until he arranged six loaves. Similarly, on the other side, he should make a second arrangement of six loaves.
The baking of the showbread does not supersede [the prohibitions of forbidden labor]<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Baking is one of the labors forbidden on the Sabbath. Although the performance of the Temple service generally supersedes the Sabbath prohibitions, an exception is made in this instance, because the bread could be baked before the Sabbath and it would not spoil due to the passage of one day (<i>Menachot</i> 97a).</i> on the Sabbath and festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Although it is permitted to bake on the festivals, that leniency is granted only with regard to bread to be eaten that day and the showbread would not be eaten until more than a week afterwards [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 11:9)].</i> Instead, on Friday, it was baked<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question why the showbread was not disqualified even though it remained overnight on Friday, for any article that had been placed in a sacred utensil is disqualified if it remains overnight. <i>Minchat Yehudah</i> explains that just as the bread is not disqualified while it is left on the golden table on the altar, it is similarly not disqualified when it is left on the marble table in the Entrance Hall (see <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 3:16).</i> and it was arranged on the following day. If the two days of Rosh HaShanah fell on Thursday and Friday,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">We are speaking about the era when the Temple existed and then Rosh HaShanah was observed for only one day. Nevertheless, there was a possibility that there would be no witnesses who saw the new moon. In such a situation, the people would regard the 30th of Elul as holy regardless and not perform any work on it. If witnesses came, it was declared as Rosh HaShanah. If they would not come, the following day was declared as Rosh HaShanah, as explained in <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 5:8. Taking that possibility into mind, the priests would bake the showbread on Wednesday.</i> it would be baked on Wednesday.
Neither the arrangement of the rods [between the breads], nor their removal, supersedes the Sabbath prohibitions.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Menachot</i> 97a) explains that by placing the rods between the breads, one looks like he is building. <i>Tosafot</i> explains that the problem is that the rods are <i>muktzeh</i>, articles forbidden to be moved on the Sabbath.</i> Instead, on Friday, [a priest] would enter, remove them, and place them along the table's length. And on Sunday, [another priest] would enter and insert them between the loaves.
If one arranged the bread as commanded, but did not place with it the bowls of frankincense until the next day<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of placing them on the table together with the bread, as stated in Halachah 4.</i> and on the following Sabbath he offered [the contents of] the bowls [of frankincense] on the pyres,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The key to the understanding of this and the following halachah is that for the breads to be acceptable, they and the frankincense must have been placed on the table before the conclusion of the Sabbath, remain there for an entire week, and thus be on the table from the beginning of the next Sabbath.</i> the bread is disqualified<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Because the bread is not acceptable until the frankincense was offered properly and in this instance, it was not, because it was never on the table at the conclusion of the Sabbath.<br>The Radbaz (see also Rashi, <i>Menachot</i> 100a) explains that in this instance, it is not acceptable to leave the bread and the frankincense on the altar for another week, for the bread was arranged in the proper manner and hence, becomes disqualified if left on the table beyond the following Sabbath. In this instance, it is not possible to leave the bread on the table, because it was not arranged together with the frankincense (Radbaz to Halachah 14).</i> and is not sanctified.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore the prohibitions of <i>notar, piggul</i> and consuming the bread in a state of ritual impurity are not relevant to it [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 11:8)].</i> Similarly, if he arranged the bread and the bowls on Sunday and offered [the contents of] the bowls on the pyre after the following Sabbath, the bread is not sanctified and is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For the frankincense should be offered on the Sabbath.

The standard published text has a different - and somewhat difficult to understand - version. See the glosses of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> which discuss this point. According to our version, the intent is that since the frankincense should not have been offered on this Sabbath (but on the next, as stated in the following halachah), the bread is disqualified.</i>
What should be done with the bread and the bowls [of frankincense] that were arranged after the Sabbath? They should be left on the table until the Sabbath day passes while they are arranged.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if they were placed on the table on Sunday, new showbread should not be prepared that week. Instead, the bread and the frankincense should be left on the table over the next Sabbath and should not be removed until the next Sabbath.<br>The Radbaz questions: Seemingly, since they were not arranged in the proper manner, the arrangement should not be acceptable. He explains that since they were placed down properly, when the time comes, retroactively, their having been arranged is considered effective.</i> Afterwards, he should offer [the contents of] the bowls [of frankincense] on the Sabbath that followed the Sabbath that passed after they were arranged. [This does not present a difficulty,] because even if the showbread and the bowls [of frankincense] were on the table for several weeks, this does not present a problem.
If one arranged the bread and the bowls [of frankincense] on the Sabbath as required<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">They became sanctified, because they were arranged in the proper manner (Radbaz).</i> and offered [the contents of] the bowls [of frankincense] after the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., during the week; thus doing so in an improper manner.</i>- whether after this Sabbath or the following Sabbath - the bread is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Because the frankincense which enables it to be permitted to be eaten was offered in an improper manner.</i> Its status is that of sacred articles that have been disqualified in which instance the prohibitions of <i>notar, piggul</i> and consuming the bread in a state of ritual impurity<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 17:1; 18:9-10, 13, for an explanation of these prohibitions.</i> apply, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Chazon Ish</i> states that the text should be amended to read "is not liable for" and cites as support <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 18:16 which states: "Whenever sacrificial food is permitted because [of the performance of] a particular act, one is not liable for the violation any of the prohibitions against partaking of <i>piggul, notar</i>, or impure sacrificial food unless the act which permits partaking of the food was performed according to law." This approach is not, however, accepted by all authorities.</i>
[The following rules apply if] one of the loaves became broken. If it was broken before the bread was removed from the table, the bread is disqualified,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 12b derives this concept from the fact that, with regard to all twelve loaves, Leviticus 24:9 states: "It is of the most sacred order of holiness." By referring to all twelve loaves as a single collective, the Torah implies that they are granted this status only when they are all whole.</i> and the [the contents of] the bowls [of frankincense] should not be offered on the pyre because of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Because that offering is made only when the breads are fit. The Radbaz explains that the situation is comparable to that of a meal offering whose substance was reduced before a handful of flour was offered on the altar. In such a situation, the entire offering is disqualified.</i> If it was broken after the bread was removed, the bread is disqualified,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">And should not be eaten.

If the time to remove the bread<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The beginning of the seventh hour on the Sabbath afternoon.</i> arrived, it is as if the breads were removed. [Even] if a bread became broken, the [the contents of] the bowls should be offered although the arrangement [of the breads] has not been taken apart.<br>If one of the arrangements became impure - whether before [the frankincense] was offered or afterwards - or one of the bowls [of frankincense] became impure, the entities that are impure are impure and those that are pure are pure.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the frankincense should be offered and the priests should partake of the loaves.</i>

The entire night is acceptable for reaping [the barley for] the <i>omer</i>. If it was reaped during the day, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 72a states that the Sages that maintain that it is acceptable to harvest the barley for the offering during the day do not accept the view that this barley may be harvested on the Sabbath.

Nevertheless, since the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 1:8, <i>Megilah</i> 2:7) does not see the two as contradictory, it is possible for the Rambam to accept both rulings.</i>
The mitzvah is to bring it from standing grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For this offering with the phrase: "When the sickle is first put to the standing grain."</i> If [appropriate standing grain] was not found, it should be brought from the sheaves.
The mitzvah is [to harvest grain] that is fresh.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For Leviticus 23:14 uses the term <i>karmel</i> which has the connotation of fresh grain.</i> If [such grain] was not found, it may be brought from dried grain.
Their practice was to bring [the <i>omer</i>] from fields to the south [of Jerusalem].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from the southern slopes of the mountains on the outskirts of Jerusalem which had greater exposure to the sun (<i>Tosafot, Menachot</i> 85a).</i> They would leave one half of the field fallow<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Plowing it, but not sowing it [see the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 8:2)].</i> and sow the other half one year.

The prohibition is, however, an outgrowth of a positive commandment and is not considered as a negative commandment. See Halachah 21.</i><br>To what does the above apply? To a harvest from which the <i>omer</i> offering could be brought. [A field located] in parched land in a valley, by contrast, may be reaped before [the reaping of] the <i>omer</i>, because it is not fit to bring [the <i>omer</i> offering] from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 6:12. Since this grain is not of high quality, the offerings should not be brought from it. It must be emphasized that this is only an <i>a priori</i> consideration. After the fact, such a meal-offering is acceptable.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 10:2), the Rambam explains why this leniency is granted. The prooftext cited above states: "You shall reap your harvest and you shall bring the <i>omer</i>, the first of your harvest." From the first portion of the verse, it appears that the harvest should precede the <i>omer</i>, but the second portion states that the <i>omer</i> is "the first of the harvest." The Oral Tradition resolves the difficulty by teaching: "From the place where you may bring the <i>omer</i>, you may not harvest, but from a place where that offering may not be brought, you may harvest."</i> [Even such grain] should not, however, be collected in a grain heap.
When grain grew its roots<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis explain that it takes fourteen days between the time when seedlings trees are planted and when they took root. One may assume that it takes less time for grain to root.</i> before [the reaping of] the <i>omer</i>, [reaping] the <i>omer</i> causes it to be permitted. If not, it is forbidden to harvest it, just as it is forbidden to partake of it until the <i>omer</i> is harvested next [year].
When grain has not completed the final third of its growth,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">At this stage, it has not reached a state fit to serve as food for humans. Hence the prohibition mentioned above does not apply. Our translation is dependent on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 10:8).</i> it may be reaped [even if it had not grown roots before the reaping of the <i>omer</i>] to feed it to an animal. [Grain] may be reaped so it does not ruin trees. [Similarly,] it may be reaped to clear a place for an assembly of mourning or an assembly of study. For [the prooftext] states "your harvest." [Implied is that the restrictions] do not [apply] to harvests associated with a mitzvah.
Even though it is permitted to reap, one should not bind [the stalks of barley] as sheaves<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Larger bindings collected from several smaller bundles (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> as the reapers do. Instead, he should leave them as small bundles.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam does allow the stalks to be tied in contrast to Rashi's view (<i>Menachot</i> 71a).</i>
We already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 5:9.</i> that meal-offerings, the meal-offerings for the additional offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This also includes the wine for the libations (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and first fruits,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The first-fruits are not mentioned in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach, loc. cit.</i></i> may not be brought from new grain before the bringing of the <i>omer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Because the <i>omer</i> must be "the first of your harvest" as mentioned above.</i> If one brought them, the offering is invalid. [Similarly, these offerings] should not be brought before bringing the two loaves [on Shavuot], but if one brought them, the offering is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 5:10, the two loaves are described by Leviticus 23:17 as "the first fruits unto God." Hence, no other grain offerings should be offered before them. Nevertheless, since this grain is acceptable for a private individual, after the fact, the offering is still acceptable.</i>
Anyone who offers a meal-offering from new grain should recite the blessing <i>Shehechiyanu</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is the first meal-offering to be brought from new grain, it warrants a blessing. The Rambam is interpreting <i>Menachot</i> 75b differently than Rashi.</i>
When grain was sown after the offering of the <i>omer</i> and harvested after the <i>omer</i> was offered the following year, there is an unresolved doubt:<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages discussed the issue in <i>Menachot</i> 68b and did not arrive at a resolution.</i> May meal-offerings be brought from it as an initial preference, before the two loaves are brought [on Shavuot], because the two loaves and the <i>omer</i> had been brought while this grain [was growing],<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the two loaves of the previous year and the <i>omer</i> of the present year.</i> or perhaps [meal-offerings] should not be brought from it until after bringing the two loaves, after the <i>omer</i> of the same year were brought.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Yosef Corcus states that if one does bring a meal-offering from such grain, after the fact, he is not required to bring a second one. See also the conclusion of the following halachah.</i>
Similarly, if grain was growing in the ground and its leaves began to form or they began to blossom at the time of the bringing of the two loaves,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., without the grain having become rooted in the ground. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions how is it possible for the leaves of a plant to grow without it taking root. He explains that this refers to a situation where the seeds were sprouted in water which could produce leaves before roots.</i> there is an unresolved question if the blossoming or the formation of leaves is considered equivalent to [the grain] taking root, and it is permitted to bring meal-offerings from it, or it is not considered as equivalent to it having taken root. Therefore one should not bring [such offerings]. If one did, [we assume that] they were accepted.
One who reaps grain before the harvest of the <i>omer</i> is not liable for lashes<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">For the violation of a negative Scriptural commandment is not involved. The Radbaz maintains that one is, however, liable for stripes for rebellious conduct.</i> and [the grain] he reaps is fit to be used.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Both as food and for a meal-offering (Rav Yosef Corcus). Needless to say, one must wait until the <i>omer</i> or the two loaves are offered.</i>
It is a positive commandment to count<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Verbalizing the reckoning of each day (see Radbaz).</i> seven complete weeks<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 161) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 306) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> from the day the <i>omer</i> is brought, as [Leviticus 23:15] states: "And from the day after the Sabbath, you shall count... seven weeks." It is a mitzvah to count the days together with the weeks, as [<i>ibid.</i>:15] states: "You shall count 50 days."<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, the Rambam emphasizes that these are not two separate commandments. In some Ashkenazic communities, the custom is to count each night and, at the end of a week, to count the passage of the week. The Sephardic custom is to mention the days and the weeks each night when counting.</i><br>One should count at the inception of the [new] day. Therefore one counts at night,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">For by including the night, the weeks will be "complete," without any lack (<i>Menachot</i> 66a).</i> [beginning] from the night of the sixteenth of Nisan.
When one forgot and did not count at night, he should count during the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">It appears that according to the Rambam, after the fact, by counting during the day, one fulfills the mitzvah just as one does by counting at night. Rabbenu Asher does not accept this view. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 489:7) states that if one did not count during the night, he should not recite a blessing while counting during the day.</i> One should count only when standing.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">For in its reference to this mitzvah, Deuteronomy 16:9 mentions "standing grain," which our Rabbis interpret as an allusion to fulfill the mitzvah while standing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> If one counted while sitting, he fulfilled his obligation.
This mitzvah is incumbent on every Jewish male<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the mitzvah of counting is not entrusted to the court as is the mitzvah of counting the Jubilee, but rather is a personal responsibility for every individual (Radbaz).</i> in every place<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in both <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the Diaspora.</i> and at all times.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even after the destruction of the Temple. There are Ashkenazic authorities who differ and maintain that according to Scriptural Law, the mitzvah is dependent on the harvest of the <i>omer</i>. Hence in the present era, our observance only possesses the status of a Rabbinic commandment. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 489:2 writes that although primacy should be given to this view, there is no difference in practice between the two approaches.</i> Women and servants are absolved from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">As is true with regard to all other mitzvot associated with a specific time.</i>
Each night, the [following] blessing should be recited before counting:<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">As one does before fulfilling any other positive commandment (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the counting of the <i>omer</i>." If one counted without reciting the blessing, he fulfills his obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">For the failure to recite a blessing does not nullify the mitzvah (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and should not recite the blessing afterwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Even if one counted accidentally, one should not count afterwards with a blessing. Therefore if one's friend asks what day of the <i>omer</i> it is, one should answer "Yesterday was such and such" [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 489:4)].</i>

Chapter 8

The fiftieth day of the counting of the <i>omer</i> is the holiday of Shavuot.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., unlike other holidays, the celebration of Shavuot is not associated with a specific date of the month, but is instead dependent on the counting of the <i>omer</i>. In the era of the Temple, when the calendar was established based on the sighting of the moon, it was possible for the holiday to be celebrated on the fifth, sixth, or the seventh of the month. See <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 3:12.</i> It is also called <i>Atzeret</i>. On this day, an additional offering is brought like the one brought on Rosh Chodesh:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 45) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 404) include offering the additional offering of Shavuot as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> Two bulls, one ram, and seven sheep. All are burnt-offerings. A goat is brought as a sin-offering. These are the addition offerings that are mentioned in the Book of Numbers.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:27-30.</i> They are the additional offering associated with the day.<br>Also, besides the additional offering of this day, a meal-offering is brought from new grain: two loaves. Together with the loaves are offered a bull, two rams, and seven sheep. All are burnt-offerings. A goat is brought as a sin-offering and two sheep are brought as peace-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 46) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 307) include offering these loaves and these sacrifices as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> These are the addition offerings that are mentioned in the Book of Leviticus.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 23:16-19. The Rambam is following the opinion of Rabbi Akiva (<i>Menachot</i> 45b) who sees the two as two different sets of offerings.</i><br>Thus on this day, besides [the two lambs brought as] continuous offerings, there are offered three bulls, three rams, and fourteen sheep - a total of 20 animals - as burnt offerings and two goats as sin-offerings which are eaten and two sheep as peace-offerings which are eaten.
These two loaves may be brought only from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and from freshly-harvested grain,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For Leviticus 23:16 describes this as "a new meal-offering," i.e., a meal-offering from grain harvested in the present year.</i> as [indicated by Leviticus 23:17]: "From your dwelling places,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> bring bread that will be waved...." If freshly-harvested grain cannot be found, one may bring from that which had been stored away.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of the Rambam's words is "from the attic." To support such a ruling, <i>Menachot</i> 83b explains that the expression "a new meal-offering" can be interpreted to mean that after these two loaves are brought, meal-offerings can be brought from new grain.</i>
If wheat kernels descended from the clouds,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., miraculously, without there being a logical explanation for their descent (see <i>Tosafot, Menachot</i> 69b).</i> there is an unresolved doubt whether they are considered as coming from "your dwelling places."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from a simple perspective, the phrase "from your dwelling places," comes to exclude the Diaspora. Hence one might think grain from the clouds would be acceptable. Nevertheless, grain from the clouds also does not come "from your dwelling places." Hence there is room to say that it is excluded (<i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i>).</i> Hence, [as an initial preference, the two loaves] should not be brought [from such grain]. After the fact, [the offering] is acceptable.<br>How are [the two loaves] brought? Three <i>se'ah</i> of wheat from new grain are brought. [The kernels] are struck and tread upon as [is done] for all the meal offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 6, and <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 7:4.</i> They should be ground into fine flour [to produce] two <i>esronim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes to Chapter 7, Halachah 12, an <i>isaron</i> is one tenth of an <i>ephah</i> and an <i>ephah</i> is three <i>se'ah</i>. Thus an <i>isaron</i> is approximately 2.4 liters in contemporary measure according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>.<br>The priests would be endeavoring to get one fifth of the original amount of grain. Since the kernels of grain are still somewhat underdeveloped, for this is an early stage in the harvest, there will not be as much fine flour and much sifting will be required to produce the desired quantity.</i> that are sifted with twelve sifters. The remainder is redeemed and [afterwards] may be eaten by any person. <i>Challah</i> must be separated from [that grain], but it is exempt from the tithes, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 12; <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 3:25; <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 6:3.</i>
The two loaves that come from new grain must each come from an <i>isaron</i> produced from a <i>se'ah</i> and a half [of kernels]. They are sifted with twelve sifters. For the showbread that comes from grain that was grown for a full season, it is sufficient to use eleven sifters and an <i>isaron</i> is produced from every <i>se'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the grain has had more time to grow, the kernels of wheat have matured more, and there is more fine flour in each kernel. Hence, there is no need to sift them so thoroughly and more fine flour is produced per <i>se'ah</i>.</i> The <i>omer</i> which comes from fresh barley does not come from choice grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Because at the beginning of the harvest such grain does not exist.</i> [Hence it requires] three <i>se'ah</i> and thirteen sifters.
In all these instances, if one added to the number of <i>se'ah</i> used or subtracted from them,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The same law applies if the grain was sifted less (see Chapter 5, Halachah 6).</i> [the offering] is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">He must, however, use the required amount of <i>esronim</i> for each offering (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
The two <i>esronim</i> are taken and each one is kneaded into dough individually and baked individually.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishneh (<i>Menachot</i> 11:1), the Rambam states that this practice has its roots in the Oral Tradition transmitted by Moses from Sinai.</i>
The dough for them is made and they are shaped outside [the Temple Courtyard].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>:2), the Rambam notes that the Talmud does not explain why the two loaves were not prepared in the Temple Courtyard.</i> They are, however, baked inside [the Courtyard] like all the meal-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:23.</i>
Preparing these loaves does not supersede [the prohibitions against forbidden labor on] the festivals and needless to say, not [those of the] Sabbath. Instead, they are baked on the day preceding the festival. For [Exodus 12:16 which permits cooking and baking on the festivals states]: "It alone may be done for yourselves." [Implied is an exclusion:] "For yourselves and not for the Most High.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the priests do partake of these two loaves, the purpose of their preparation is not to serve as food, but to be an offering unto God.</i>
If the day before the festival is the Sabbath, they should be baked on Friday and eaten on the third day after they were baked which is the festival.<br>It is explicitly stated in the Torah that they should be leavened bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Leviticus 23:17. Aside from one of the types of breads offered together with the thanksgiving offering, all of the meal-offerings were unleavened bread.</i> How were they prepared? One would bring yeast from another place and place it into the <i>isaron</i> measure. He would then fill that measure with fine flour and let it leaven with that yeast.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 9:18 with regard to the leavening of one of the types of bread used for the thanksgiving offering.</i>
They were rectangular.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam derived this concept from the showbread. See also <i>Tosefta, Menachot</i> 11:1.</i> The length of each loaf is seven handbreadths and their width was four handbreadths. Their height was four fingerbreadths.
How is the bread waved together with the two sheep brought as peace offerings?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 9, Halachah 9, the two loaves should be offered before the sheep that accompany them.</i> Two sheep are brought and they should be waved while they are still alive, as [Leviticus 23:20] states: "And [the priest] shall wave them...." If one waved each of them individually, the obligation is fulfilled. Afterwards, they are slaughtered and skinned.<br>The breast and the thigh from both of them are taken and placed aside the two loaves. [A priest] should place both of his hands below them and wave them all as a single entity,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 61a derives this from the description of the guilt offering and the <i>log</i> of oil that accompanies it.</i> in the eastern portion of the Temple Courtyard, in the place where all the waving [of offerings] is performed.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 12; <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 9:6.</i> One should bring them back and forth [to each of the four directions] and up and down.

The remainder of the meat is eaten by the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the meat, and apparently also the bread, may not be eaten until the <i>eimorim</i> were offered on the altar.</i> With regard to the two loaves: the High Priest receives one of them<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As in the instance of the showbread where half the loaves are given to the High Prist (Chapter 4, Halachah 14; <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and the other is divided among all the priestly watches.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For the priests of all the watches are able to offer the sacrifices of the festivals and share in their division (see <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:4-5). As the Radbaz emphasizes, this division is followed even though each of the priests will receive only a miniscule portion.</i> They both may be eaten for the entire day and half the night like the meat of the sacrifices of the most sacred order.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 10:8, this is a Rabbinic safeguard. According to Scriptural Law, the sacrifices may be eaten until dawn. Even though they are peace offerings, since they are communal sacrifices, they are considered sacrifices of the most holy order and the time during which they may be eaten is regulated accordingly (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
[The following laws apply if] one slaughtered the two sheep for four loaves: If [the priest performing the service] said:<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz emphasizes that if the priest does not make such a statement explicitly, the breads are not sanctified.</i> "Let two of the four become sanctified," he should remove two of the four, and wave them.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">And they are acceptable for the offering.</i> The remainder should be redeemed inside the Temple Courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For if they were redeemed outside the Temple, they would be disqualified (<i>Menachot</i> 47b). Rav Yosef Corcus explains that although one is forbidden to bring ordinary food into the Temple Courtyard, in this instance, one is not bringing the bread into the Temple Courtyard, The loaves are redeemed while they are located there. Afterwards, they are removed.</i> and eaten outside like other ordinary [bread]. If he did not make such a stipulation, the bread does not become sanctified.
If he slaughtered four sheep for two loaves, they should take away two of them and dash their blood on the altar with the intent that they not be for this offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In such an instance, the sacrifices are not disqualified, but they are not considered as fulfilling the obligation of the given offering. Hence they are no longer associated with the two loaves. If, however, the blood of the first two sheep was offered with the proper intent, the later two are disqualified, before they were slaughtered. For this reason, the option mentioned by the Rambam is preferable (<i>Menachot</i> 48a). That passage asks: Should one slaughter a sacrifice without the proper intent, because there is a redeeming factor by doing so? It explains that there is no transgression involved in slaughtering a sacrifice without the proper intent. Hence in this situation, it is the most desired alternative.</i> He should then wave the remaining two together with the two loaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">And they are acceptable.</i>
The two breads are each indispensable requirements for the offering of each other<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">One is not acceptable without the other and should not be brought (<i>Menachot</i> 27a).</i> and the two sheep are each indispensable requirements for the offering of each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">One is not acceptable without the other and should not be brought (<i>Menachot</i> 27a).</i> If one of them died, fled, or became <i>treifah</i>, a partner should be taken for the second.

The <i>Or Sameach</i> suggests (and his suggestion is borne out by some manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>) amending the text to read "If one was slaughtered without the proper intent, (i.e., and thus disqualified,) a partner should be taken for the other."</i>
The two loaves are indispensable requirements for the offering of the sheep,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">If there are no loaves, the sheep should not be offered.</i> but the two sheep are not indispensable requirements for the offering of the loaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">And even if there are no sheep, the loaves should be offered [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 4:3)].</i> [Nevertheless,] if [the loaves] were waved together with the sheep, they are indispensable requirements for their being offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For waving them together establishes interdependence (see <i>Menachot</i> 46b). The Ra'avad states that the matter is left unresolved by the Talmud and hence, questions the Rambam's ruling.

How should the two loaves be brought when they are brought without the sheep?

The continuous offerings are not indispensable requirements for the additional offerings, nor are the additional offerings indispensable requirements for the continuous offerings, nor are the additional offerings indispensable requirements for each other, nor is the entire amount of burnt offerings an indispensable requirement.<br>What is implied?

If only one is available, that one should be brought. Similarly that passage speaks of offering "six sheep... that one's hand will come by," though the Torah speaks of seven. Implied is that if seven are not available, six should be brought. And if six are not available, whatever animals "that one's hand will come by" should be offered.</i> [This applies] whether on Rosh Chodesh or on the festivals or Sabbaths. There is no obligation to offer the other animals on the following day or at any other time. Instead, whenever the date for a communal sacrifice passes without it being offered, [the obligation to offer] the sacrifice is nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 1:7.</i><br>If there were only two sheep to be found, and thus if they would be offered for the additional offering of the day, there would not be any for the continuous offering on the next day, the options are of equal weight.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The continuous offerings have the advantage of being offered more frequently, but the additional offerings are on a higher level of holiness. See also Chapter 9, Halachah 2.</i> If they were offered for the additional offering of that day, the offering [is acceptable]. If it was desired that they be left to be offered on the following day, they should be left.

Chapter 9

On the first day of Tishrei,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Which is Rosh HaShanah. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 47) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 312) include the offering of these sacrifices as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> for the additional offering of the day,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Although at present - and as explained in <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 5:8, even at times in the Talmudic era - Rosh HaShanah was observed for two days, sacrifices were offered only on the day consecrated as the first of Tishrei.</i> we offer a bull, a ram, seven sheep, all as burnt-offerings, and a goat as a sin-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 29:1-5.</i> This is the additional offering of the day aside from the additional offering of Rosh Chodesh that is offered on every Rosh Chodesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 1.</i> Therefore [if that date] fell on the Sabbath, three additional offerings were brought: the additional offering of the Sabbath, the additional offering of Rosh Chodesh, and the additional offering of that date.
What is the order in which they were offered? First they would offer the additional offering of the Sabbath, then the additional offering of the new month, and then the additional offering of the festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Rosh HaShanah.</i> [The rationale is that any offering brought] more frequently than another takes precedence over the other one.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 89a derives this from the fact that Numbers 28:23 refers to the "the morning offering that is the continuous offering." The latter phrase teaches that it is given precedence because it is a continuous offering, brought every day.</i> Similarly, if [an offering] is on a higher level of holiness than another one, it takes precedence over it.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For example, as stated in Halachah 5, since it brings about atonement, the blood of a sin-offering is considered as on a higher level of holiness than the blood of a burnt-offering. Hence, it is given precedence.</i> If one has a choice of [an offering that] is brought more frequently and one which is on a higher level of holiness, one may award precedence to whichever one desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 90b debates which of the two should be given precedence without resolving the matter. Hence, it is left to an individual's choice (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
If one transgressed and slaughtered [an animal for an offering that was] not [brought] more frequently, or one which was on a lower level of holiness first, one should offer it [on the altar]<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Lest its blood coagulate before the other animal was offered.</i> and then slaughter the one [brought] more frequently, or one which was on a higher level of holiness.
If the two [animals]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">One from a sacrifice offered more frequently and one from a sacrifice offered less frequently or one on a higher level of holiness and one on a lower level.</i> were slaughtered at the same time,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">More precisely, whenever the animal from the more frequent or holier offering was slaughtered before the blood of the other was sprinkled on the altar (see Radbaz).</i> one should stir the blood [of the one that is less frequent or less holy] until the blood of the one that is more frequent or holier is sprinkled [on the altar].
The blood of a sin-offering is given precedence<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this and the following instance exemplify the principle that an offering that is holier than another receives precedence over it.</i> over the blood of a burnt-offering, because the blood of a sin-offering brings atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">While a burnt-offering, by contrast, is considered merely as a present to God (<i>Zevachim</i> 7b).</i> [The offering of] the limbs of a burnt-offering take precedence over offering the fats and organs of a sin-offering, because a burnt-offering is consumed entirely by fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">And hence is considered as holier.</i><br>[If one must choose] between the blood of a sin-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes to the following halachah, this is speaking about a situation where both animals were already slaughtered.</i> or the limbs of a burnt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since each has a positive quality, neither is considered as holier than the other.</i> one may give precedence to whichever one desires. Similarly, [if one must choose] between the blood of a burnt-offering and the fat and organs of a sin-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In this situation, neither possesses a distinctive positive quality in and of itself. Instead, the blood of the burnt-offering is secondary to its limbs and the fats and organs of the sin-offering are secondary to its blood.</i> or the blood of a burnt-offering and the blood of a guilt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 89b states that the blood of a guilt-offering is not on the same level of holiness as that of a sin-offering. According to the Rambam's version, there is an unresolved question which is holier, its blood or that of a burnt-offering (Radbaz).</i> one may give precedence to whichever one desires.
A sin-offering takes precedence over a burnt-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Yosef Corcus understands this as referring to the slaughter of the sin-offering. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> ask: Since we know that a sin-offering receives precedence, why was it necessary to state previously that the blood of a sin-offering is given precedence? They explain that the previous halachah is speaking about a situation when both animals were already slaughtered and the question is which blood should be given precedence.</i> Even a sin-offering of a fowl takes precedence over a burnt-offering of an animal, as [Leviticus 5:8 which] states: "[who shall offer] the sin offering first." This is a general principal teaching that every sin-offering takes precedence over the burnt-offering that accompanies it. Similarly, when setting aside [animals for sacrifices], one should set aside the animal to be offered as a sin-offering and then the one to be offered as a burnt-offering.
This does not apply with regard to the sacrifices of the holiday [of Sukkot].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachot 3-4, where these offerings are described.</i> They are sacrificed in the order that they are mentioned in the Torah, for [Numbers 29:33] states: "according to their ordinance."<br>What is implied?

Our Sages understood that as implying that it is given precedence. Moreover, they maintain that it is logical to assume that the High Priest's offering should be given precedence, for he is the one who offers the bull on behalf of the community. Hence first he should atone for himself and then, offer atonement for the community.</i> The latter sacrifice takes precedence over the bull [offered to atone] for the worship of false deities.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">When the community violates a transgression involving the worship of false deities due to an erroneous ruling by the High Court, each tribe must bring a burnt-offering of a bull and a sin-offering of a goat (<i>Hilchot Shegagot, loc. cit.</i>).

Even though the bull is a burnt-offering and the goat is a sin-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And sin-offerings should be given precedence, as stated in the preceding halachah.</i> [the bull is given precedence], for this is the order of the verses in the Torah.<br>The goat brought [to atone for] idolatry takes precedence over the goat brought by a king,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:4, when a king sins and inadvertently performs a transgression punishable by <i>karet</i> other than idolatry, he must bring a goat as a sin-offering.</i> for the king is one individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">While the goat brought to atone for idolatry is brought on behalf of a tribe as a whole.</i> The goat brought by a king takes precedence over the she-goat brought by an ordinary individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As a sin-offering. <i>Hilchot Shegagot, loc. cit.,</i> states that an ordinary individual who performs a transgression punishable by <i>karet</i> must bring either a she-goat or a ewe as a sin-offering.

Even the sin-offering of a fowl brought by a woman after childbirth<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This offering is singled out, because it is not brought to atone for any particular transgression (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> takes precedence over the sheep she brings.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As related in <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 1:2, after childbirth, in order to be able to partake of sacrificial foods, a woman must bring a dove or turtle-dove as a sin-offering, and a sheep as a burnt-offering.

They were pierced with two small holes like two small nostrils. The hole for [the cup] of water was thinner than that for the wine so that the water would conclude flowing together with the wine.
They would tell [the priest] who would pour the water libation: "Lift up your hands,"<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">So that it would be obvious that he is pouring the water in the altar's cups (Rav Yosef Corcus).</i> because once [a priest] poured [the water] on his feet,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than on the altar.</i> and the entire nation stoned him with their <i>esrogim</i>.

Were it to be held in a sacred vessel, it would be possible that the priests would sanctify their hands with it. Thus they would perform that rite with water that was not consecrated or would use up the water and prevent it from being used for the libation (Rav Kappach's notes to that mishnah).

On every day of the Sukkot festival, a separate song<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in addition to the song recited for the daily sacrifice.

(Psalm 50).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This psalm warns of coming to the Temple to celebrate and offer sacrifices without first repenting (Rashi, <i>Sukkah, op. cit.</i>).</i> On the third, they would say: "Who will stand up for me against the wicked?..."

We have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:3-4.</i> that there are a total of 24 priestly watches and they all serve with equal rights during the festivals. On the holiday of Sukkot, each watch would offer [only] one bull, one ram, or a goat as a sin-offering. With regard to the sheep, however, [there was a difference]. There were watches which would offer two sheep and there were watches that would offer one.<br>What is implied? On the first day of the festival of Sukkot, there are thirteen bulls, two rams, and a goat. Every watch [that receives an animal to offer] would offer one of these animals. Thus there remain fourteen sheep for eight watches. Six watches offer two sheep and two watches offer one.<br>On the second day, there are twelve bulls,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Because the number of bulls are being reduced by one each day. See Halachot 3-4 above.</i> two rams, and a goat. Every watch [that receives an animal to offer] would offer one of these animals. Thus there remain fourteen sheep for nine watches. Five watches offer two sheep and four watches offer one.<br>On the third day, there are eleven bulls, two rams, and a goat. Every watch [that receives an animal to offer] would offer one of these animals. Thus there remain fourteen sheep for ten watches. Four watches offer two sheep and six watches offer one.<br>On the fourth day, there are ten bulls, two rams, and a goat. Every watch [that receives an animal to offer] would offer one of these animals. Thus there remain fourteen sheep for eleven watches. Three watches offer two sheep and eight watches offer one.<br>On the fifth day, there are nine bulls, two rams, and a goat. Every watch [that receives an animal to offer] would offer one of these animals. Thus there remain fourteen sheep for twelve watches. Two watches offer two sheep and ten watches offer one.<br>On the sixth day, there are eight bulls, two rams, and a goat. Every watch [that receives an animal to offer] would offer one of these animals. Thus there remain fourteen sheep for thirteen watches. One watch offers two sheep and twelve watches offer one.<br>On the seventh day, there are seven bulls, two rams, a goat, and fourteen sheep, [an amount of animals] equivalent to the number of watches. Each watch offers one animal.
Whichever watch offered a bull one day did not offer a bull the next day. Instead, they would rotate. On the eighth day,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">When there are far fewer sacrifices, as stated in Halachah 5.</i> they allot them through a lottery<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz infers from this that no lotteries were conducted during the prior seven days.

One opinion in <i>Sukkot</i> 55b maintains that on Shemini Atzeret, the lottery to offer the bull should be held only between these two watches. The Rambam accepts the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi which maintains that all the watches are included in this lottery.</i> as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:3-4.</i>
When the first day of the festival of Sukkot fell on the Sabbath, there would be 61 <i>esronim</i> of accompanying meal-offerings from the additional offerings and the continuous offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">According to the guidelines established in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 2:4, for the additional offerings of Sukkot, the thirteen bulls required a total of 39 <i>esronim</i>, the two rams, a total of 4 <i>esronim</i>, and the fourteen sheep, a total of 14 <i>esronim</i>, a total of 57 <i>esronim</i>. In addition, two <i>esronim</i> were brought for the additional offering of the Sabbath, and two <i>esronim</i> for the continuous offerings.</i> They would not be mixed together.
The accompanying meal-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This includes the wine and the oil as well as the meal, as indicated by the concluding halachot of the chapter.</i> are never mixed together.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, if the meal-offerings for two types of animals become intermingled before they are mixed together with their oil, they are disqualified [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 9:4)].</i> Instead, the accompanying offerings of bulls [are prepared and offered] separately, those of rams separately, and those of sheep separately.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for the separation is that the ratio of oil to meal is different for the offerings of sheep and bulls.</i> [This applies] both with regard to communal offerings and individual offerings.
All of the fats of the sacrifices [that are to be offered on the altar] - whether from communal sacrifices or from individual sacrifices - should not be mixed with each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifra</i> derives this concept from Leviticus 3:11 which states "And he shall offer it on the pyre," using a singular form.</i> Instead, the fats and the organs of each sacrifice are offered on the altar's pyre separately. If, however, they become mixed together, they may be offered all as one.
If the meal-offerings of the accompanying offerings become intermingled after each type<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., those of bulls, those of sheep, and those of rams.</i> was mixed with oil separately,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">As required by Halachah 15.</i> they are acceptable.
Since the meal-offerings were mixed together and their oil and meal have become intermingled, it is permissible to mix their wine [libations] together as an initial preference. Similarly, if the meal-offerings of the accompanying offerings were already offered, each one separately, it is permissible to mix their wine [libations] together.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for the restriction against mixing their wine libations is only to prevent their meal-offerings from being intermingled. Once the meal-offerings have been offered, there is no longer any need for that constraint (<i>Menachot</i> 89b). They may be mixed as an initial preference [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>)]. See Halachah 20.</i>
When the wine-libations of the accompanying offerings are mixed together, it is permissible to mix a wine libation of a sacrifice offered on the previous day with one offered on the present day<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 2:12, the wine libations may be brought several days after the sacrifice was offered.</i> or those of an individual offering with those of a communal offering.<br>When one mixes together [wine libations], he may mix the wine libations of the accompanying offerings of bulls with those of the accompanying offerings of rams, or those of the accompanying offerings of sheep with others of the accompanying offerings of sheep. One should not, however, mix the wine libations of the accompanying offerings of sheep with those of bulls or rams.
As an initial preference, one should not mix wine [libations] unless the meal-offerings have been mixed together or they have been offered, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 18.</i>
