Mishneh Torah, The Chosen Temple



Chapter 1

<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam introduces each book of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> by quoting a verse from the Bible. In this case, the verse chosen does more than introduce the text to follow. It also emphasizes that we are commanded to "seek out the welfare of Jerusalem" and study the laws of the Temple's construction.</i> It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 20) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 95) include this as one of 613 mitzvot. The mitzvah is incumbent on the Jewish community as a whole and must be undertaken by the nation as a collective entity. See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:1 which speaks of "Israel being commanded to fulfill three mitzvot upon entering [the Promised] Land."</i> to construct a House for God,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">There are two ways to understand this mitzvah:<br>a) to build the Temple,<br>b) to ensure that the Temple be built; the mitzvah is not fulfilled until that objective is accomplished.<br>The question is whether the command is to perform an activity or to see that an objective is completed. In his commentary on the Torah (Exodus 35:10 , the Rogachover Gaon favors the latter explanation and explains a number of possible practical differences between these abstract concepts. Among them:<br>a) Must a blessing be recited before taking part in the construction of the Temple? If the mitzvah is the actual building, a blessing would be required. However, if the mitzvah is to ensure that the Temple be completed, no blessing is necessary.<br>b) Can a gentile participate in the building of the Temple? If the actual construction is the mitzvah, it would be improper for a gentile to participate. However, if the mitzvah is dependent on the completion of the objective, the construction of the Temple, there is no difference if a gentile's efforts also aided in the fulfillment of this goal.<br>c) If the Temple descends from heaven - as some maintain the Third Temple will - will it be considered as if the mitzvah has been fulfilled (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 18, p. 418).<br>From the Rambam' wording (Halachah 12 and elsewhere), it appears that he views the mitzvah as the activity of building.</i> prepared for sacrifices to be offered within.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is the subject of much commentary. In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>(<i>loc. cit.</i>) the Rambam describes the mitzvah to build a Sanctuary as : "the command... to make a house for service where sacrifices will be offered."<br>In contrast, the Ramban (Nachmanides) views the construction of the Temple as a command with a self-contained objective. Thus, he writes in his commentary to the Torah (Exodus 25:2 : "[God's] essential desire in the Sanctuary was the [construction of] a resting place for the <i>Shechinah</i>."<br>Some commentaries explain the disagreement between these giants simply: According to the Rambam, the Temple was built to allow for sacrifices to be offered, while the Ramban views the revelation of the <i>Shechinah</i> as the Temple's purpose.<br>However, this interpretation can not be accepted because:<br>a) the Torah itself specifically refers to the Temple as (Deuteronomy 12:5 : "The place which God has chosen to cause His Name to dwell there," emphasizing the revelation of Godliness.<br>b) when describing the mitzvah to build a Sanctuary, the Rambam himself writes that we are commanded "to construct a house for God," stressing that the main element of the Temple was the revelation of Godliness. It is after that statement, that he declares that the House must be "prepared for sacrifices to be offered within."<br>Therefore, it must be assumed that both sages recognized the two differing elements, and the debate between them involves the question of determining which aspect is more important. The Ramban considered the fundamental goal the revelation of Godliness and viewed man's service as a means toward that end. On the other hand, the Rambam saw man's service as the ultimate objective. However, that service could only be complete when carried out in a place where Godliness is revealed (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 4, p. 1346, Vol. 11, p. 116, Vol. 24, p. 84).</i> We [must] celebrate there three times a year,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The pilgrimage festivals; Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. On these festivals, each Jew was obligated to come to the Temple and present himself before God. In particular, the term "celebrate" refers to bringing the festive peace-offerings (see <i>Hilchot Chagigah</i> 1:1).</i> as [Exodus 25:8] states: "And you shall make Me a sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Even though this verse specifically refers to the construction of the sanctuary in the desert, the construction of the later sanctuaries and the building of the Temple were also implicit in that command (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>In <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> (1:1), the Rambam writes "Israel was commanded to fulfill three mitzvot upon its entry into <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>: to appoint a king..., to annihilate the seed of Amalek.., and to build [God's] Chosen House as it is said: "You shall seek out His dwelling and come there." The commentaries offer different explanations why the Rambam quotes a different verse in either place.</i>"<br>The sanctuary constructed by Moses is already described in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In the Book of Exodus, Chapters 25-40.</i> It was only temporary,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">And was replaced by other structures, as described in the following Halachah.</i> as [Deuteronomy 12:9] states: "For at present, you have not come unto [the resting place and the inheritance]."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Commenting on this verse, Zevachim 119a declares: "'the resting place' - this is Shiloh, [for Shiloh was also merely a temporary resting place for the Divine Presence]; 'the inheritance' - this is Jerusalem." (Just as an inheritance reflects an everlasting chain, so too, the Divine Presence will always remain in Jerusalem.)</i>
After [the Jews] entered The Land [of Israel],<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In the year 2488 after creation.</i> they erected the Sanctuary in Gilgal during the fourteen years in which they conquered and divided [the land].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The conquest of the Land took seven years, and the division took another seven years (<i>Zevachim</i> 118b).</i> From there, they came to Shiloh,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In the year 2502, built a house of stone and spread the curtains of the Sanctuary over it. It did not have a roof. The Talmud (ibid.) explains:<br>I Samuel 1:24 declares: "And she brought him to the House of God, Shiloh" implying that the Ark was enclosed with a permanent structure. Another verse (Psalms 78:60  states: "He has forsaken the tabernacle of Shiloh" from which it can be inferred that it was a tent-like structure resembling the Sanctuary in the desert. How can the two verses be reconciled?<br>There was no roof. Though there was a structure of stone, the curtains [of the Sanctuary] were spread over it.<br></i> built a house of stone, and spread the curtains of the Sanctuary over it. It did not have a roof. The sanctuary of Shiloh stood for 369 years. When Eli died, it was destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the year 2871, when the Philistines captured the Holy Ark and slew Eli's two sons.<br>The Sanctuary of Shiloh had a greater degree of holiness than the structure which preceded it and those that followed immediately thereafter. The <i>Sifri</i> states that the verse (Deuteronomy 12:5 : "The place which God has chosen to cause His name to dwell there" refers to "Shiloh and the Temple."<br>The uniqueness of Shiloh is further emphasized by the fact that while it stood, the Jews were forbidden to offer sacrifices in any other place. While the Ark was in Gilgal, and similarly, in Nov and Givon, the Jews were allowed to bring their individual sacrifices wherever they desired. However, during all the years the Sanctuary was in Shiloh, no sacrifices could be offered in any other location.</i><br>[Afterwards,] they came to Nov<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">When the Philistines returned the ark after the seven months of its captivity, they brought it to Kiryat Yearim (I Samuel, Chapters 6-7). During this time, a Sanctuary was constructed in Nov and afterwards, in Givon, to provide the Jews with a place for centralized worship. However, the ark was not kept there out of fear that it might again be captured by the Philistines (Meiri, <i>Megillah</i>, 9b).</i> and built a sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Of stone. Though the Rambam in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) states that the Jews erected the Sanctuary that had stood in the desert in Nov, here he appears to follow the view mentioned by Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 38 a,b) which states that a stone structure was erected there. Similarly, <i>Sotah</i> 9a states that the sanctuary's structure was entombed when the Jews entered <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The Sanctuary of Nov stood for 44 years (<i>Seder HaDorot</i>).</i> When Samuel died, it was destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">By King Saul.</i> And they came to Givon<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">On the outskirts of Jerusalem (see II Samuel, ch. 6). The Sanctuary stood there for approximately 13 years.</i> and built a sanctuary. From Givon, they came to the eternal structure [in Jerusalem].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In the year 2928, as described in the beginning of I Kings.</i> The days [the sanctuary stood] in Nov and Givon were 57 years.
Once the Temple was built in Jerusalem, it became forbidden to build a sanctuary for God or to offer sacrifices in any other place.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbonot</i> 18:3 which describes this prohibition. <i>Zevachim</i> 112b states: "When they came to Jerusalem [and erected the Temple], it became forbidden [to sacrifice in] the High Places and permission [to sacrifice] there was never granted [again]."<br>That prohibition was derived from the following verses (Deuteronomy 12:5-6):<br>Only at the place where the Lord, your God, shall choose to cause His Name to dwell, may you seek Him at his dwelling...There, you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices.<br>The preceding verses described how the pagans had sacrificed "upon the high mountains, upon the hills, under every lofty tree." In contrast, the service of God had to be centralized in one place alone, "the place which the Lord, your God shall choose to cause His Name to dwell." Nevertheless, until an abode for the <i>Shechinah</i> was constructed, there was no prohibition against sacrificing anywhere in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>As mentioned above, this prohibition was in effect during the time of the Sanctuary of Shiloh. After Shiloh was destroyed, there were no restrictions until the Temple was built. However, once the <i>Shechinah</i> was revealed on Mount Moriah, the Jews were never allowed to offer their sacrifices at any other place.<br>Although Shiloh and the Temple were both considered "the place God chose...," there is a difference between the two. God's choice of Shiloh was for the benefit of the Jewish people. He wanted to offer them a centralized place of worship. However, the physical place of the Sanctuary did not itself become holy for all time.<br>In contrast, God chose Jerusalem as an eternal resting place for the <i>Shechinah</i>. The Divine Presence united with the place itself. After Shiloh was destroyed, no vestige of its former holiness remained. However, Mount Moriah remains "the gate to heaven" even after the Temple has been destroyed. Hence, permission was never granted to sacrifice in other places. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, p. 80-85.</i><br>There is no Sanctuary for all generations<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The above prohibition extends beyond the offering of sacrifices and includes the actual construction of a sanctuary. <i>Megillah</i> 10a records the construction of such a sanctuary in Alexandria by Ono, the son of Shimon HaTzaddik.</i> except in Jerusalem and [specifically,] on Mt. Moriah,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The root of the name Moriah is the word <i>hora'ah</i>, meaning instruction. The Temple was the seat of the Sanhedrin, Israel's highest court and the source of instruction for the entire Jewish nation. Others associate it with the word <i>yirah</i>, meaning "fear," for from this mountain, the fear of God radiated forth.</i> as [I Chronicles 22:1] states: "And David declared: 'This is the House of the Lord, God, and this is the altar for the burnt offerings of Israel.'<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains in Chapter 2, in addition to God's choice of the site for the Temple at large, He also specifically chose the site of the Altar.<br>To emphasize this concept, the verse quoted by the Rambam contains two clauses. The first clause describes the choice of the Temple's site and the second, the choice of the site of the Altar.</i> and [Psalms 132:14] states: "This is My resting place forever."<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam views these verses as more than a statement of Jerusalem's uniqueness. They also exclude the possibility of constructing other sanctuaries.</i>
The [design of the] structure built by [King] Solomon is described explicitly in [the Book of] Kings.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings, chapter 6.</i> [In contrast, the design of] the Messianic Temple, though mentioned in [the Book of] Ezekiel, is not explicit or explained. Thus, the people [in the time] of Ezra built the Second Temple according to the structure of Solomon, [including] certain aspects which are explicitly stated in Ezekiel.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries on the tractate of <i>Middot</i> contrast Ezekiel's vision and the structure of the Second Temple in <i>mishnayot</i> 2:5, 3:1, 4:2.</i>
The followings elements are essential when constructing this House:<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. if they are lacking, we have not fulfilled the mitzvah of constructing a Sanctuary.</i><br>a) the Sanctuary,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The holy chamber containing the Golden Altar, the <i>Menorah</i>, and the table for the Showbread.</i><br>b) the Holy of Holies,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The inner chamber containing the Holy Ark.</i><br>c) preceding the Sanctuary, there should be a place called the Entrance Hall.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a structure positioned before the Sanctuary.<br>The commentaries note that, in general, an equivalent to each of the structures of the Temple existed in the Sanctuary of the desert. Based on this principle, they question which structure in the Sanctuary corresponded to the Entrance Hall.</i><br>The three [together] are called the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Though the three represent various levels of holiness, they are on one rung of sanctity when compared to other areas (<i>Zevachim</i> 2a).<br>The commentaries note that Jeremiah  7:4  states: "Trust not in lying words which say: 'The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord... ' The threefold repetition alludes to the fact that the three chambers mentioned above share an equal measure of holiness.</i><br>[In addition,] we must make another partition around the Temple, set off from it [slightly], resembling the curtains surrounding the courtyard of the [sanctuary in the] desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As described in Exodus, chapter 27.</i> Everything encompassed by this partition is similar to the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting and is called the Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that the root of the Hebrew term <i>azarah</i> is the word <i>ezra</i> meaning "help." In the Temple Courtyard, the Jewish people call to God and He responds, granting them assistance.</i><br>The entire area is referred to as the <i>Mikdash</i>.
The following utensils are required for the Sanctuary:<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the explanation to Halachah 1, the Rambam considers the purpose of the construction of the Temple the erection of "a house ...to offer sacrifices within." In this context, he views the fashioning of the Temple's utensils as an integral part of the mitzvah of building a sanctuary - for without them the sacrifices could not be offered. Thus, when enumerating the mitzvot, he considers the fashioning of the Sanctuary's utensils as part of the mitzvah to construct the Sanctuary and not as separate mitzvot in their own right.<br>As mentioned above, the Ramban, Nachmanides, disputes the Rambam's view and considers the revelation of Godliness as the primary intent of the Sanctuary's construction. He also disagrees with the Rambam in regard to the fashioning of the utensils and considers them as separate independent commands. See <i>Hasagot Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, Positive command 33.<br>There is a practicable application of the above concept. The Sanctuary could only be constructed during the daytime, (see Halachah 17). If the fashioning of the Sanctuary's utensils is to be considered as part of the mitzvah of constructing the Temple, that ruling may apply to them as well (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 21, p. 255).</i><br>a) an altar for the burnt offering and other sacrifices;<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah also refers to the outer altar as "the altar of the burnt offering" (Exodus 30:28, 35:16) for that was the most frequent sacrifice, offered twice daily.</i><br>b) a ramp to ascend to the altar. It was positioned before the Entrance Hall to the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 17.</i><br>c) a wash basin<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">A large basin, with 12 taps. (<i>Yoma</i> 37a)</i> with a pedestal where the priests would sanctify their hands and feet for the (Temple) service.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Before taking part in any aspect of the Temple service, the priests had to wash their hands and feet. See <i>Hilchot Biat HaMikdash</i> 5:1.</i> It was positioned between the Entrance Hall and the altar, to the left when entering the Sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The entrance to the Sanctuary was from the east, facing the Holy of Holies which was in the west.</i><br>d) the altar for the incense offering,<br>e) the <i>Menorah</i>, and<br>f) the table [for the showbread].<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">These sacred objects are discussed in detail in Chapter Two.</i><br>The [latter] three were placed within the Sanctuary, before the Holy of Holies.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 26:35.<br>The commentaries have asked why the Rambam does not consider the ark as one of the essential vessels of the Sanctuary. The commentary to Chapter 4, Halachah 1, addresses that issue.</i>
The <i>Menorah</i> was in the south, to the left as one entered. The Table was to the right.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Menorah</i> was the source of spiritual inspiration, the Table of material wealth. Because of the position of these objects, our Sages declared (<i>Bava Batra</i> 25b): He who desires to become wise should face south (while praying). He who desires to become wealthy should face north.</i> The Showbread was placed upon it. Both of them were close to the Holy of Holies on the outside. The incense altar was positioned between these two, towards the outside.<br>Divisions are to be made within the Temple Courtyard to [indicate] the point to which the Israelites may proceed;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Middot</i> 2:6. There were steps dividing between the area set aside for Israelites and the area set aside for priests. An Israelite was not permitted to proceed beyond these steps, except:<br>a) to perform <i>semichah</i>, the placing of hands on an animal brought as a sacrifice. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>, ch. 3.<br>b) to recite confessional prayers, <i>Vidui</i>.<br>c) to slaughter an animal brought as a sacrifice,<br>d) to perform <i>Tenufah</i>, the waving of the peace offerings (<i>Kellim</i> 1:8. See also Chapter 7, Halachah 19, <i>Tifferet Yisrael, Middot</i> 2:6.)</i> the point to which the priests, [who were not able to participate in the Temple service,] may proceed.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 20.</i><br>[Also,] within it, we must build structures for the various necessities of the Sanctuary. These structures were called chambers.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5, Halachah 17.</i>
When we build the Temple and the courtyard, we must use large stones. If stones cannot be found, we may build with bricks.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">On the verse (Exodus 20:22 : "If you shall build an altar of stone...," the <i>Mechilta</i> comments: "If you desire [to build it from] stone, you may. If you desire from bricks, you may."</i><br>We may not split the stones used for the building on the Temple Mount.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the altar, the Torah declares (ibid.): "Do not build it out of hewn stone. By lifting your sword against it, you will have profaned it." The Sages (<i>Middot</i> 3:4) explained that iron shortens man's life, and the altar prolongs it. Therefore, iron should not be used to build the Temple. As above, the Rambam draws a parallel between the altar and the entire sanctuary.<br><i>Sotah</i> 48b quotes the two abovementioned verses and records a debate among the Sages how to resolve the apparent contradiction between them. The Rambam quotes the opinion of Rabbi Nechemiah who resolves the discrepancy by explaining that the stones were hewn outside the Temple premises and then, brought in.<br>In contrast, Rabbi Yehudah explained that King Solomon employed a unique wormlike creature, the <i>Shamir</i>, which had the power to eat through stone. The Temple's builders drew lines on the stone and then placed the <i>Shamir</i> upon them. The tiny creature ate through the rock, leaving the stones finely hewn without using iron.<br>According to most opinions, when the First Temple was destroyed, this unique species was lost, and it was impossible to build the Second Temple in this miraculous manner. Nevertheless, the stones were not hewn on the Temple Mount itself.</i> Rather, we must split and chisel them outside, and [afterwards,] bring them in,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, at least, "in the House," on the Temple premises, no iron tool was used.</i> as it is said (I Kings 5:31 : "And they brought great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the House with hewn stone." Furthermore, it is said (<i>ibid.</i> 6:7): "Neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron was heard in the House while it was being built."
We must not build with any wood protruding at all,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tamid</i> 28b relates that this prohibition was enacted as a safeguard for the Scriptural commandment (Deuteronomy 16:21 : "Do not plant an <i>Asherah</i> or any other tree near the altar that you shall make for the Lord." Though that prohibition only refers to a tree that grows in the ground and not to wood used for building purposes, the Sages instituted this measure as a "fence around the Torah."<br>Wood could be used for the substructure of the building. Indeed, I Kings 6:10 relates how Solomon used cedar trees for that purpose. However, they could not be used for the exterior surface of the building.</i> only stone, bricks, or cement.<br>[Similarly,] we must not make wooden chambers in the courtyard. Rather, [they were made] of stone or of brick. <sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to this Halachah, noting that there were wooden structures on the Temple Mount. The High Priest's chamber was lined with wood. In addition, wooden balconies were built in the Women Courtyard on Sukkot to allow the women to observe the <i>Simchat Beit Hashoevah</i> celebrations. Thus, he concludes that the prohibition against building with any protruding wood applies only within within the Temple courtyard, from the area set off for the priests and beyond, and not elsewhere on the Temple Mount. Only that region could be described as "near the altar [of God]." Rav Yosef Corcus explains that the wooden balconies were not permanent structures. Hence, they were permitted.</i>
Costly stones were laid on the floor of the entire courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See the verse from I Kings quoted in Halachah 8.<br>The Torah (Leviticus 26:1 , commands, "Do not make a stone pavement in your land to bow down upon it." The commentaries explain that this prohibition was ordained so that the Jews would refrain from making a copy of the Temple services outside of Jerusalem.<br>Nevertheless, according to strict Torah law, it was not necessary to lay a stone floor for the Temple courtyard. <i>Zevachim</i> 24a relates that in preparation for the construction of the Temple, King David sanctified the very ground of the Temple Courtyard.</i><br>Stones which were uprooted [from their fixture] are invalidated, even though they remained in place, since they were impaired. [Thus,] a priest is forbidden to stand upon them during the [Temple] service until they become fixed in the ground [again.]<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages explained that it was not respectful to take part in the Temple services while standing on such a stone. Nevertheless, if a priest disobeyed this prohibition and did stand on such a stone, his service was not invalidated.<br>The logic of that decision can be explained as follows: There is a principle in Jewish law that a particular substance is not considered as interposing between one object and another if it and the object beneath it are of the same type. Thus, since the stone and the earth below it are considered to be of the same substance, the stone is not considered an interruption. Since, as mentioned above, the ground itself was sanctified by King David, the priest's service is not invalidated.</i>
The most preferable way to fulfill the mitzvah is by strengthening the building and raising it [to the utmost degree] within the potential of the community, as [implied by Ezra 9:9]: "to exalt the House of our Lord."<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 11a interprets this verse in a very literal sense, explaining that a synagogue must be the tallest building in a city.</i><br>They must make it beautiful and attractive according to their potential.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Herod slaughtered many Sages. <i>Bava Batra</i> 4a explains that the Sages advised him to expiate a certain measure of his sin by rebuilding the Temple and making it attractive. The Talmud declares: "Whoever has not seen Herod's building has not seen an attractive building in his life."</i> If possible, it is a mitzvah to plate it with gold and to magnify all of its aspects.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, <i>Pesachim</i> 57a relates that the Temple was covered with gold plates the thickness of a golden coin.</i>
We must not build the Temple at night, as [Numbers 9:15] states: "on the day in which the Sanctuary was raised up." [Our Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sh'vuot</i> 15b.</i> interpret this phrase as implying:] We may raise it up by day and not by night.<br>We must be involved with its building from dawn until the appearance of the stars.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, employees are not obligated to begin their work until the sun appears. However, in this case, due to the importance of their task, the workers were obligated to begin earlier. See Nechemiah 4:15; <i>Berachot</i> 2b.</i><br>Everyone is obligated to build and to assist both personally and financially;<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Thus there are two obligations: a) the actual building of the Temple, b) assisting in the work and supporting it financially.</i> [both] men and women,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">In particular, there is a difference in the obligations incumbent on men and women. Women are not obligated to fulfill most mitzvot which have a specific time limitation. The construction of the Temple also possesses a specific time restriction. As mentioned above, it may only by built by day and not by night. Therefore, women are not obligated to carry out the actual construction. However, in regard to the second aspect mentioned above, rendering personal and financial assistance, women are obligated as well as men.</i> as in the [construction of the] Sanctuary in the desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Note Exodus 35:22 and 25, which relate the role played by women in constructing the Sanctuary. Commenting on the first of those verses, Rashi states that the women displayed greater generosity than the men.</i> [Nevertheless,] children are not to be interrupted from their [Torah] studies.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Commenting on this law, <i>Shabbat</i> 119b declares: "The world is only maintained [through the merit] of the voice of school children [studying Torah]."</i><br>The construction of the Temple does not supersede the [observance of the] festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 6a states: "The construction of the Sanctuary does not supersede the observance of the Sabbath, as it is written (Leviticus 19:30 : Observe My Sabbaths and revere My Sanctuaries, i.e., the Sabbath is of primary importance, even in regard to the Sanctuary. The festivals are also called Sabbaths by the Torah, cf. Leviticus 23:24 and 39. Hence, the same ruling applies to them.<br>Though the construction of the Temple is forbidden on the Sabbaths and festivals, sacrifices may be offered on these days even though prohibited labors are involved in this service.<br>This apparent discrepancy can be explained as follows: Once the Temple is constructed and complete, the holiness of its service supersedes the Sabbath prohibitions. Nevertheless, while the Temple is being constructed, those prohibitions must be observed in order to establish the sacred nature of the place.</i>

Damaged or split stones from the Temple and the Courtyard are invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam stated a measure: "to the extent that a nail passing over it will become caught in it" for disqualifying stones to be used in the Altar. However, in the present Halachah, he does not mention a measure for the cracks or splits which may disqualify a stone after it has been used for the Temple. Thus, a question arises: Does the previous measure apply in this case as well, or was no measure mentioned, because even the slightest crack would disqualify the stone?<br>This question can be resolved as follows: In Halachah 17, the Rambam states that a person "who destroys a single stone from the Altar, any part of the Temple building, or [the floor of the Temple Courtyard]," violates a negative command, "as it is said (Deuteronomy 12:3-4): 'And you shall destroy their altars...Do not do so to the Lord, your God.

Thus, one's manner of ascent could be considered a sign of respect or disrespect to the Altar. In contrast, the steps leading to the Temple building have a lower level of sanctity (as obvious from Halachah 5). Thus, the way in which one approached is not as significant.

If the nation is poor, it is permissible to make them of tin.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 28b relates that when the Greeks controlled the Temple, they defiled all its utensils.

Chapter 2

The Altar is [to be constructed] in a very precise location,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As emphasized by the various events mentioned in this and the following halachot.<br>The location of the Altar within the Temple Courtyard is discussed in Chapter 5, Halachot 12-16.</i> which may never be changed,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In this context, we can understand the Rambam's choice of words, when describing the achievements of the Mashiach (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 11:1): "He will build the Sanctuary in its place." There, he does not state "its precise location," for although the Messianic Temple in its entirety will also be built on Mt. Moriah, certain aspects of it will not correspond exactly to the Temples. Nevertheless, even then, the Altar in particular will be positioned in precisely the same location as before.</i> as it is said (II Chronicles 22:1 : "This is the Altar for the burnt offerings of Israel."<br>Isaac was prepared as a sacrifice on the Temple's [future] site, as it is said (Genesis 22:2 : "Go to the land of Moriah,"<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer</i> relates that the altar which Abraham constructed on Mt. Moriah had twelve stones. Later, when Jacob journeyed to Charan (Genesis, ch. 28), he slept on Mt. Moriah and "took from the stones of the place and put them at his head." The stones he collected were the twelve used by Abraham. God fused them all into a single stone and the unified rock was embedded in the very foundation of the earth. That stone was referred to as <i>Even HaShtiah</i>, (see also Chapter 4, Halachah 1) "the foundation stone." It was located in the Holy of Holies.<br>Thus, Abraham's altar was apparently not built on the site of the altar to be built by his descendants, but rather, at the ultimate location of the Holy of Holies. However, this difficulty can be resolved. Jacob "took from the stones," and moved them from their original place, the Altar's future site, to a different location, that of the Holy of Holies.</i> and in Chronicles (II 3:1), it is said: "Then, Solomon began to build the House of the Lord in Jerusalem, on Mt. Moriah, where [the Lord] appeared to David, his father, in the place that David had prepared,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Though David was not allowed to build the Temple, he purchased the site, constructed an altar, and offered sacrifices there.<br><i>Zevachim</i> 62a relates that David used prophetic vision in choosing the site of the altar.

According to a second view, he saw the ashes of Isaac.</i> in the threshing floor of Ornan, the Jebusite."
It is universally accepted<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that this phrase refers to the Gentiles. Even they recognized the holiness of the Altar's site.<br>The fact that the Gentiles were aware that the site of the Altar is holy is Halachically relevant. The pagans living in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> before its conquest by the Jewish people were so idolatrous that our Sages declared: "Wherever you see a lofty mountain ...or a leafy tree, know that idols were worshipped there." Since the Temple Mount was also a high mountain, surely it would have been considered an appropriate place for pagan rites.<br>However, since the holiness of the Altar's site was universally accepted, even the Gentiles did not profane its sanctity with idol worship.</i> that the place on which David and Solomon built the Altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">David and Solomon did not build the same Altar. Rather, David chose the site as the future location of the Temple, and constructed an Altar and offered sacrifices. Later, when Solomon built the Temple, he erected a new Altar at the same site.</i> the threshing floor of Ornan, is the location where Abraham built the Altar on which he prepared Isaac for sacrifice.<br>Noah built [an altar] on that location when he left the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 8:20.</i> It was also [the place] of the Altar on which Cain and Abel brought sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i> 4:3-5.</i> [Similarly,] Adam, the first man, offered a sacrifice there and was created at that very spot,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam entitled this collection of Halachot, <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>, the Laws of God's Chosen House, implying that God did not select Mount Moriah as the Temple site because of its inherent holiness, but because of His own choice and desire. That choice was clearly expressed in the previous Halachah which states: "the place of the Altar is extremely exact... as it is said: 'This is the altar for the burnt offerings of Israel.'<br>As such, it can be explained that the Rambam does not recount the various historical events mentioned in this Halachah just to bring further proof of the holiness of the Altar's site. That is unnecessary. Rather, he wanted to demonstrate that many righteous men were aware of the uniqueness of the Altar's site through prophetic vision, and for this reason, they made efforts to offer their sacrifices there.<br>Why does the Rambam relate all these historical events? As he clearly states in his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, his goal is not to summarize the Talmud's teachings regarding a particular subject, but to describe how to carry out the various mitzvot. These historical facts do not seem to facilitate his objective.<br>The need for these additions may be explained by comparison to the Rambam's decisions regarding the right to the monarchy. In that context, the Rambam writes that although God chose David and his descendants as kings and endowed them with the monarchy forever, there was a Halachic legitimacy to the establishment of the Kingdom of Israel (the ten tribes). Since the first king, Jereboam, was appointed by a prophet, his regal power must be recognized. (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:7,8).<br>It could be inferred that a similar ruling might apply in regard to the altar: i.e. the Altar on Mount Moriah would remain holy forever, however, another altar of similar status could also be established. In order to eliminate that presumption, the Rambam presents a number of examples, illustrating that throughout the generations, from the time of Adam, the prophets had tried to bring sacrifices on this site alone. These efforts clearly imply that there is not, nor will there be, another place with a similar degree of holiness (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 19, p.140-7).</i> as our Sages said: "Man was created from the place where he [would find] atonement."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is somewhat problematic. Though the Rambam's statements have a basis in the Midrash (<i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 14:8), according to <i>Sanhedrin</i> 38b, Adam appears to have been created in the Garden of Eden, a considerable distance from this location. Generally, when a conflict arises between sources, the decision is based upon the Babylonian Talmud. Hence, one might ask why the Rambam favored the other sources in this case.</i>
The dimensions of the Altar must be very precise. Its design has been passed down from one to another [over the course of the generations].<br>The altar built by the exiles [returning from Babylon] was constructed according to the design of the Altar to be built in the Messianic age.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Its dimensions differed from the altar built by King Solomon in the First Temple. As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4, the fundamental design of the Second Temple resembled that of Solomon's Temple. However, certain aspects were altered to conform with Ezekiel's vision of the Messianic Temple. The dimensions and design of the altar are mentioned in Ezekiel 43:13-17 and were followed by the exiles when they returned to Jerusalem.</i> We may not increase or reduce its dimensions.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Halachah 17, the Altar is acceptable even if its dimensions are not exact. Nevertheless, as an initial preference, an attempt must be made to conform exactly to the plan mentioned below.</i>
Three prophets returned to [<i>Eretz Yisrael</i>] with the people:<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Chaggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</i> one attested to the site of the Altar;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For, as mentioned in Halachah 1, the Altar's site must be precise.</i> the second, to its dimensions;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Note the previous halachah.</i> and the third attested to [the Halachah permitting] all sacrifices to be offered on that Altar, even though the Temple itself was not [built] there [yet].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are taken from <i>Zevachim</i> 62a. However, the terminology in that source regarding Malachi's testimony is different. According to the Talmud, the prophet stated that "all the sacrifices may be offered, even though the Temple was not [built];" and the Rambam adds the phrase "on that Altar."<br>Later commentaries have explained the significance of that addition, based on the following episode. In the Middle Ages, the Sage, Rabbi Chayim (according to other sources, Rabbi Yechiel) of Paris made <i>Aliyah</i> and settled in Jerusalem. He wanted to offer sacrifices on the Temple Mount. In analyzing this account, the <i>Chatam Sofer</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 336) explained that this must have referred to the Pascal sacrifice, which could be offered in a state of ritual impurity and yet, did not have to be purchased with communal funds.<br>Among the reasons the commentaries have given why such a sacrifice could not be offered is that we are lacking an Altar with its proper size and dimensions. In contrast, the exiles who returned from Babylon were allowed to offer sacrifices on the altar built according to the prophets' directives.</i>
The Altar constructed by Moses, and, [similarly,] that built by Solomon, and that erected by the [returning] exiles, and that to be built [in the Messianic age] are all ten cubits high.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 43:13 and commentaries.</i> Though the Torah states [Exodus 27:1]: "Its height will be three cubits," [that refers to] the surface on which the wood for the sacrifices was arranged.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Zevachim</i> 59b, which records a dispute among the Sages concerning the height of Moses' (and hence, all subsequent) Altar(s).<br>Among the proofs brought for the opinion accepted by the Rambam are the following:<br>a) an analogy drawn between the sacrificial altar and the incense altar. Just as the latter's height was twice its length, so, too, the height of the sacrificial altar (10 cubits) was twice its length (5 cubits).<br>b) The height of Moses' Altar had to equal that of the Sanctuary that accompanied the Jews in the desert, which was 10 cubits high.</i><br>The length and breadth of the Altar built by the [returning] exiles and, similarly, the one to be built in the Messianic Age, is 32 cubits by 32 cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This measurement refers to the dimensions of the Altar's base and not to its upper surface, as explained in the following Halachah.</i>
The 10 cubits of the Altar's height [were not measured in a consistent manner.]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kellim</i> 17:10 relates that a cubit used in building was generally six handbreadths long. In contrast, the cubit used to measure utensils was five handbreadths long.

There is a debate among the Rabbis regarding the equivalent of this amount in modern measurements.

There were two holes in the southwest corner [of the Altar's base],<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The blood from the sacrifices was either poured on the south or the west side of the Altar, depending on the nature of the offering. These holes were positioned in the southwest corner to facilitate drainage. (See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Middot</i> 3:2.)</i> resembling two thin nostrils.

Rather, the wall on the right side was slanted slightly, so that the ramp would cover the base and the surrounding ledge, which together protruded two cubits beyond the edge of the Altar itself.<br>The phrase "its length" does not refer to the length of the ramp's surface, (the hypotenuse of the triangle), but the space it occupied on the ground, as well as the two additional cubits with which it overlapped the base and the surrounding ledge. The actual length of the ramp's surface was slightly longer.</i><br>There was a small space<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Larger than the hair's breadth mentioned in the following halachah.</i> between the ramp and the Altar so that the limbs [of the sacrifices] would have to be tossed to reach the Altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The wood piles upon which the Altar's fire were to be kindled were arranged on the south side of the Altar, so that the priests would be able to ascend the ramp and place the sacrificial limbs directly on those pyres. However, the ramp did not reach the edge of the Altar. The priests were thus prevented from placing the limbs directly on the fire and were required to toss them.<br><i>Zevachim</i> 62b explains the necessity to toss the limbs, as follows: The Torah draws an analogy between the flesh of an offering and its blood, as it is written (Deuteronomy 12:27 : "You shall sacrifice your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood." The blood must be tossed on the Altar, as it is written (Leviticus 1:5 : "And they shall toss the blood on the Altar." Hence, the limbs must also reach the pyre in that fashion.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 6:4.</i><br>The height of the ramp was nine cubits minus a sixth of a cubit. It equaled that of [the surface on which the wood for the sacrifices] was arranged.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 7, the cubit measurement for the base had only five handbreadths. Thus, the Altar's - and consequently, the ramp's - height was eight and five-sixths cubits, when calculated in cubits of six handbreadths.<br>The Rambam's phrasing at the beginning of the Halachah, "[covering] one cubit of the base and one cubit of the surrounding ledge" requires clarification, because the base itself did not run under the ramp. However, the space for it was left vacant.<br>See the accompanying diagram for a depiction of the concepts mentioned in this Halachah.</i>
Two small ramps extended from it. One led to the base,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This small ramp was placed on the west side of the altar, the side closest to the Temple building.

When the priests circled the Altar to sprinkle the blood of the sin offering on the Altar's horns, they ascended using this ramp.<br>The above follows the opinion expressed by Rashi (<i>Zevachim, loc. cit.</i>). Some other authorities maintain that both smaller ramps were situated on the west side of the Altar. Though the Rambam does not state his opinion explicitly, from his description of the sacrificial proceedings (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>: 6:20, 7:10), it appears that he accepts the first opinion.</i> They were set off from the Altar by a hair's breadth.<br>There was an aperture on the west side<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The aperture was placed there because sin-offerings were offered on the southwest corner of the Altar (Rashi, Pesachim 34a).<br>It appears that this aperture was located on the wall of the ramp, and not on its upper surface (<i>Tifferet Yisrael</i>).</i> of the ramp, a cubit by a cubit. It was called the <i>Rivuvah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">13Rav Ovadiah of Bartinura explains that this word means "hollow place."<br>The Ra'avad explains that there were two openings: one called the aperture, and the second, the <i>Rivuvah</i>. His opinion is not accepted by most authorities, as explained in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i> There, fowl that had been disqualified for use as sin offerings would be placed until their form decomposed, at which time they could be taken out to be burnt.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, a sin-offering that is disqualified for use must be removed from the Altar and burned immediately. However, if there are no severe factors to invalidate the sacrifice, it would appear disrespectful to dispose of the sacrifice in that manner. Rather, the sacrifice is left overnight - an act which obligates a sacrifice to be removed and burnt - and disposed of the next morning (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>.).<br>A woman who gave birth was obligated to bring a bird as a sin offering. Hence, it was a very common sacrifice. The <i>Rivuvah</i> was constructed to store the birds which had become disqualified. It thus prevented confusion between those birds which were disqualified, and those which were fit to be sacrificed (<i>Tifferet Yisrael</i>).</i>
Two tables were [placed] on the left side of the ramp:<br>One of marble, on which the limbs [of the sacrifices to be offered on the Altar] were placed,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The communal sacrifices were brought directly from the slaughtering area to the top of the Altar by a number of priests. Thus, there was no need to set aside a place for the limbs to be placed. However, sometimes private sacrifices were offered by only one priest, who could not possibly carry all the limbs at one time. This table was useful on such occasions.<br>Though generally an effort was made to use precious metals in the Temple, this table was made of marble. The sages feared that a metal table would conduct heat and cause the sacrificial meat to spoil. Marble is better for this purpose, since it is a very poor conductor of heat. See <i>Shekalim</i> 6:4, and <i>Tamid</i> 31b.</i> and<br>One of silver, on which sacrificial vessels were placed.
When we build the Altar, it must be made as one solid block, resembling a pillar. No empty cavity may be left at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">In the sanctuary of the desert, the Altar was a hollow structure filled with earth (Exodus 27:8, <i>Mechilta</i>). However, such a structure was not acceptable for the Temple.</i><br>We must bring whole stones, both large and small.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachot 14-16.</i> Then we must create a liquid with lime, pitch, and molten lead, and pour it [over the stones] into a large mold of its dimensions.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the following halachah, the Altar must be entirely square, yet we were forbidden to cut or file it to size.

The mixture of stones, lime, pitch, and molten lead was poured into it. Then, the mold for the second level, the surrounding ledge, was placed down. This mold was 30 cubits by 30 cubits and five cubits high. After the mixture was poured into it, the mold for the Altar's upper surface was brought. That mold, 28 cubits by 28 cubits, was three cubits high. Once it was filled, four molds, each a cubit by a cubit and one cubit high, were placed in each corner for the horns.<br>The measures mentioned above were all rounded off. As mentioned in Halachot 6-7, additional handbreadths must be added or subtracted for all these measures.</i><br>We must place a block of wood or stone in the southeast corner of the structure, equal to the measure of [the missing portion of the Altar's] base.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 10.</i> Similarly, [blocks] must be placed in each horn until the building is completed.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">For the horns must be hollow, as mentioned in Halachah 8.</i> Then, the blocks may be removed from the structure, thus leaving the southeast corner without a base, and the horns, hollow.
The four horns, the base, and a square shape are absolute requirements for the Altar. Any Altar which lacks [either] a horn, a base, a ramp, or a square shape, is unfit for use, for these four are absolute requirements.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding these four elements, the Torah uses the expression <i>hamizbeiach</i>, the Altar, implying that the Altar can only be called an Altar if it possesses these elements. If even one is lacking, the Altar is incomplete (Rashi, <i>Zevachim</i>, 62a):<br>In regard to the horns, it is written (Leviticus 4:18 : "the horns of the Altar."<br>In regard to the base, it is written (<i>ibid.</i>:34): "to the base of the Altar."<br>In regard to the ramp, it is written (<i>ibid.</i> 6:7): "to the face of the Altar." This phrase refers to the ramp, for it faces the Altar and allows access to it.<br>In regard to the Altar's square shape, it is written (Exodus 27:1 : "The Altar shall be square."</i><br>However, the measures of length, width, and height, are not absolute requirements,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 3.</i> provided they are not less than a cubit by a cubit [in area,] and three cubits high.

The design of the <i>Menorah</i> is explicitly [stated] in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 25:31-40.

The position of the ornaments in the <i>Menorah's</i> shaft is described in Halachah 10.</i> [Exodus 25:34] states: "The <i>Menorah</i> shall have four embossed goblets, together with its bulbs and its flowers."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Torah refers to the plural form for these ornaments, yet it does not specify a number, two bulbs and two flowers are required.</i> A third flower was close to the <i>Menorah's</i> base, as [Numbers 8:4] states: "to its base, to its flower."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Although this flower was not mentioned in the description of the <i>Menorah's</i> construction in Exodus, the <i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i> and all the commentaries include it in their design.</i>
The [<i>Menorah</i>] had three feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah does not mention feet in its description of the <i>Menorah's</i> construction. Their presence is recorded in the Talmud (<i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i>), but no specific number of feet is mentioned. Nevertheless, all major commentaries have described the <i>Menorah</i> as having three feet. It must be noted that Josephus' description of the <i>Menorah</i> and the depiction of the <i>Menorah</i> on the Arch of Titus both lack feet. However, there are other inconsistencies in those sources.</i><br>Six [diagonal]<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam implies that the branches of the <i>Menorah</i> extended diagonally from its central shaft. He depicts the <i>Menorah's</i> branches in this way in the drawings he added to his commentary on the Mishnah. See Rav Kapach's edition.<br>Similarly, the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham, writes in his commentary on the Torah (Exodus 25:32 : "The six branches of the <i>Menorah</i> extended upward as straight lines, as depicted by my father, of blessed memory, and not as depicted by others."<br>Other commentaries, including Rashi (Exodus 25:32  agree with the Rambam on this matter. It is thus difficult to comprehend why most popular portrayals of the <i>Menorah</i> show its branches as semicircles. That form was, indeed, used on the Arch of Titus, but, as mentioned above, there were other imprecisions in that monument. Furthermore, there is no reason to favor the portrayal of the <i>Menorah</i> made by a Gentile to celebrate Jerusalem's downfall over the description offered by our Torah leaders.</i> branches extended from three other bulbs in the [central] shaft of the <i>Menorah</i>, three [branches] on one side and three on the other.<br>Each branch had three goblets, a bulb, and a flower. They were all embossed<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, the verse requiring embossment (<i>ibid.</i>:34) reads: "The <i>Menorah</i> had four goblets embossed with bulbs and flowers." <i>Yoma</i> 52a lists five verses in the Torah for which the Sages were unsure of the proper interpretation. This is one of them. The Sages did not know whether the adjective "embossed" described the goblets mentioned before it or the bulbs and flowers mentioned afterwards.<br>Because of this quandary, the Rambam decided that all three ornaments were to be embossed. Nothing would be lost by employing this technique to fashion certain ornaments, even though the Torah did not require them to be made in this manner. However, if one ornament was not embossed, a direct command of the Torah might not have been fulfilled (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Corcus).</i> by beating them [in a manner that their surface] resembled [tiny] almonds.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i>, op. cit.), the Rambam writes: "The word <i>meshukadim</i> ("embossed") means 'a craft of almonds' (<i>shikeidim</i>). This technique is popular among coppersmiths. They beat a sheet with a hammer until its [surface appears to be] covered with almonds."<br>The accompanying diagram is a copy of the depiction of the <i>Menorah</i> by the Rambam which accompanies his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i>
Thus, the total number of goblets was 22;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Three on each branch, bringing the total to 18, and four on the central shaft.

He shall make it with a talent of pure gold; all these vessels."<br>The Hebrew word <i>keilim</i>, translated as "vessels," may also be translated as "utensils." Thus, one might conclude that the <i>Menorah's</i> utensils must also be fashioned by hammering out the same block of gold and hence, are to be permanent parts of the <i>Menorah</i>. Indeed, Nachmanides appears to have understood the meaning of the verses in that manner. However, <i>Menachot</i> 88b explains that here the term <i>keilim</i> refers only to the lamps, and not to the other utensils.</i><br>The verse does not state: "its lamps shall be of pure gold," for the lamps<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The receptacles in which the oil and wicks were placed.</i> were permanently fixed in the <i>Menorah</i>, and were included in the talent [of gold from which the <i>Menorah</i> was fashioned].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot, op. cit.</i> records that this statement was the subject of a debate among the Sages.

This applies whether [the <i>Menorah</i> was made] of gold or of other metals.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast with the goblets, bulbs, and flowers in Halachah 4.</i><br>All the lamps were [permanently] affixed to the branches.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam ruled that the lamps were an integral part of the <i>Menorah</i>. Thus, a unique process was employed in their kindling. It was deemed disrespectful to kindle the <i>Menorah</i> from fire that was not sacred. The lamp of the central shaft was to be lit only from the fire of the Altar. All other lamps would be kindled from it or from each other. Since the lamps themselves were permanently affixed in the <i>Menorah</i>, the priests kindled them by extending their wicks with the tweezers until they reached a lamp that was burning. They would then light the wicks and return them to their own lamps. (<i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 3:13-14).<br>It was necessary that every lamp be on a separate branch. If two lamps were made on the same branch, the <i>Menorah</i> was invalid.</i>
The six lamps affixed in the six branches extending out from the <i>Menorah</i> all faced the central lamp which was above the [central] shaft of the <i>Menorah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 8:2 commands: "When you kindle the lamps, the seven lamps shall shine towards the center of the <i>Menorah</i>."<br>Rav Yehudah HaChassid explained that according to the Rambam, the lamps themselves were fashioned so that the wicks would face in that direction. The side of the lamps facing the center shaft slanted inward. The diagrams drawn by the Rambam published in Rav Kapach's edition verify this opinion.</i> The central lamp faced the Holy of Holies and was called the western lamp.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This lamp was not positioned any further westward than the others. Nevertheless, it was given that name because it faced the Holy of Holies, which was situated in the west. The Rambam's decision follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezar ben Shimon, who maintains that the <i>Menorah's</i> lamps spread across the width of the Sanctuary. Accordingly, there is no one lamp whose position clearly identified it as "the western lamp."<br><i>Menachot</i> also mentions that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi did not accept this opinion and maintained that the <i>Menorah</i> was positioned along the length of the Sanctuary, from east to west. Thus, there was one lamp that was "westernmost."<br>Halachah is usually based on Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi's opinion. Nevertheless, the Rambam favored Rabbi Eliezer's opinion, because there is a verse from the Torah that appears to support it. Leviticus 24:3 states: "Aharon shall prepare [the lights] continuously before the Lord," implying that before kindling the <i>Menorah</i>, it was necessary to prepare the wick to point "before the Lord" (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). This difference of opinion was preserved over the generations and many later authorities accepted the view that the lamps of the <i>Menorah</i> extended from east to west.<br><i>Shabbat</i> 22a relates that the western lamp was "testimony to the entire world that the <i>Shechinah</i> rests in Israel." Each day, the western lamp was the first lamp kindled. Exactly the same measure of oil was placed in it as in the other lamps, yet it was always the last to burn out. Nevertheless, after the spiritual level of the Jewish people declined, this miracle did not always occur (<i>Yoma</i> 39a).</i>
The goblets resembled Alexandrine chalices. They had wide mouths and narrow bases.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Kapach's publication of the Rambam's drawing of the <i>Menorah</i> shows the goblets in an inverted position. Note also the drawing accompanying Halachah 2.<br>Rabbenu Bachai (Exodus 25:31  explains the symbolism of the inverted position. A goblet serves two functions: it enables the collection of liquids, and offers the opportunity of pouring the liquids where desired. Thus, the goblets are symbolic of the Heavenly spheres, which receive influence from Heavenly sources and convey it to our lowly world.<br>The main purpose of the <i>Menorah</i> was to shed light on the world. This intent was expressed in the design of the Temple itself. Though generally, windows are built slanting inward, King Solomon's Temple windows slanted outwards (I Kings 6:4 , so that the <i>Menorah's</i> light would spread to the world at large.<br>Similarly, the inverted position of the goblets in the <i>Menorah</i> emphasizes that the <i>Menorah</i> was intended to disseminate spiritual influence throughout our world. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 21, p. 164.</i> The bulbs were like the apples of Keros which are slightly elongated, [resembling] eggs with both ends rounded.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam also emphasize that the bulbs were not entirely round.<br>Rabbenu Bachai explained that the bulbs symbolized boundless spiritual pleasure.</i> The flowers resemble the flowers of a column.

If so, <i>Tosefot's</i> question mentioned above becomes even more difficult. A possible solution is offered by the <i>Tzurat HaBayit</i>, which explains that the branches did not extend from the bulbs themselves, but from the <i>Menorah's</i> central shaft. Thus, the length of the bulb and the branches, and similarly, the bulb, goblet, and flower, could both be one handbreath. However, as mentioned above, the Rambam's diagram of the <i>Menorah</i> depicts the branches as extending out from the bulbs.<br>See Rashi (<i>Menachot</i> 28b which states that in this handbreadth, the goblet, flower, and bulbs projected from different sides of the <i>Menorah</i>.</i><br>An empty handbreadth,<br>A handbreadth with a bulb and two branches extending outward from it, one to one side and one to the other, extending outward and ascending until they reached the full height of the <i>Menorah</i>,<br>An empty handbreadth,<br>A handbreadth with a bulb and two branches extending outward from it, one to one side and one to the other, extending outward and ascending, until they reached the full height of the <i>Menorah</i>,<br>and two empty handbreadths<br>[Thus,] three handbreadths remained, with three goblets, a bulb, and a flower.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">One might ask: Why does the Rambam omit mention of the <i>Menorah's</i> lamps?

The 28 rods mentioned above [were used as follows]: The first loaf was placed on the Table itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">As explained above, the purpose of the rods was to allow air to pass between the loaves and to preserve their freshness. Thus, one might suggest that rods be placed under the bottom most loaves for that same reason. However, the surface of the Table itself was gold, and thus remained cool. Hence, no other measures were necessary.</i> Three rods were placed between the first and the second loaves. Similarly, three rods were placed between each [of the following] loaves.

The major differences refer to the definition of the <i>Kasot</i>, the side frames. Rashi, <i>Tosafot</i> and the Rashbam each have slightly different concepts of the sideframes. However, all three explanations depict the sideframes as sturdy structures which supported the rods. The latter, in turn, supported the weight of the loaves. Thus, these commentaries interpret the word <i>mifutzalin</i> used by the Mishnah to mean that they possess grooves or holes. The rods were inserted through these grooves or holes, and were able to support the loaves.<br>As explained in brief in the above Halachot, and at length in Chapter 5 of Rambam's <i>Hilchot Temidim U'Musafim</i>, the twelve Showbreads were stacked on top of each other, their weight being supported only by the Table itself and the rods. According to his conception, the side frames were thin Y-shaped rods which were intended to keep the arrangements straight and to support them from the sides. However, they did not bear any of the weight of the loaves.<br>There are two advantages to the explanation offered by the Rambam:<br>a) According to the Rambam, the term <i>mifultzalin</i> used by the Mishnah is interpreted more precisely.<br>b) According to the other explanations, it is difficult to comprehend why only two rods were used for the uppermost row. Since the loaves did not rest upon each other and their weight was borne by the side frames as well, there is no difference between the top row and the others?<br>In contrast, according to the Rambam, there is no difficulty. Since the rods bore the weight of the loaves themselves, and the uppermost rods had to support a lesser weight, their number could be reduced.<br>See the accompanying diagram which depicts the Table according to the Rambam's description.</i>
There were two tables in the Entrance Hall, near the entrance to the Temple building.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, these tables are depicted as being positioned apart from each other, one at either side of the entrance.</i> One was made of marble.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shekalim</i> 6:3) asks why this table was not made of silver. It explains that since the loaves were placed on the Table while they were hot, their heat would raise the temperature of the silver. This could cause mold to grow on the loaves.</i> The Showbread was placed upon it before it was brought in.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The Showbread had to be baked before the Sabbath. However, it was not placed on the Table in the Sanctuary until the Sabbath morning sacrifices were offered.

Were the water to remain in the washbasin overnight, it would become invalid for future use. The Sages felt that it was not fitting to discard a large amount of water every day after it had become sacred, and they tried to devise means of avoiding that difficulty.<br><i>Yoma</i> 37a and <i>Zevachim</i> 20a explain that each night the washbasin was lowered into a natural reservoir of water by a pulley-operated crane. <i>Tamid</i> 3:8, explains that the crane was very noisy and it was possible to hear the cranking of its gears as far away as Jericho. Its water was not invalid overnight, and the water it contained when it was lifted up again in the morning, could be used for the Temple service.<br>Based on the sections of the Talmud mentioned above, the Ra'avad questions the Rambam's description of the washbasin and its mechanism. With the statement, "[The mechanism] was not sacred and thus, the water remaining in it did not become invalid," the Rambam seems to imply that the mechanism itself contained water, but the water did not become disqualified, because the mechanism, unlike the washbasin itself, was not a sacred vessel. This would seem to contradict the Talmudic passages which describe the mechanism as a crane.<br>This difficulty is further magnified by the fact that in <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 5:14, the Rambam himself writes that each night, the washbasin was submerged in a natural reservoir of water and raised again the next morning.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains the Rambam's statements as follows: These Talmudic passages use the expression <i>muchani</i> to refer to the mechanism. Though that expression can be rendered as a pulley-operated crane, as above, it can also be explained as a circular reservoir for water, into which the washbasin was placed. This explanation resolves the contradiction between the Rambam and the Talmud. However, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> is also puzzled by the seeming contradiction in the Rambam's own words.<br>The <i>Tosefot Yom Tov</i> (<i>Tamid</i> 1:4) quotes the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 3:8). It explains that the "mechanism" was a vessel of water which would be raised each morning and submerged each evening by a pulley-operated crane. It would be placed over the washbasin to keep it filled with water.<br>The <i>Tzurat Habayit</i> maintains that throughout the ages, various techniques were devised to solve the problem of the water which remained overnight in the washbasin. The Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 10:14) relates that pulley-operated cranes were used to draw water during the days of the prophets. Thus, it was likely that a similar technique was employed for the washbasin. Since ben Katin lived in the later years of the Second Temple, it is likely to suppose that his mechanism was more sophisticated.</i>

The Rambam explains that although the stones were embedded in the breastplate in the Second Temple as well, they lacked the spiritual dimension that they had possessed in the First Temple.</i> [In the Second Temple,] they only made them to fulfill the requirement of eight garments for the High Priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These garments are described in Exodus, Chapter 28, and in <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i>, ch. 8.</i> Thus, the High Priest would not lack one of the required garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad does not accept the Rambam's statements concerning the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i>. He interprets the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i> as being mystical names of God engraved on the breastplate, rather than the stones themselves.<br>In his <i>Chiddushim</i>, Rav Yaakov Emden questions the reason for including this Halachah: "On the surface, there is apparently no practical relevance to these matters in our behavior....The Rambam generally does not include aspects which have neither Halachic nor ethical significance in this text." Why then is it important for us to know whether or not the ark was entombed and where it was entombed?<br>Rav Emden then explains the question he posed, based on the Rambam's statements in Chapter 6. There, the Rambam stated that after the exile, the sanctity of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was nullified regarding the laws of the Sabbatical year, the tithes, and certain other agricultural rulings. However, the holiness of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount always remained intact because:<br>The holiness of the Temple and Jerusalem comes about because of the <i>Shechinah</i>, and the <i>Shechinah</i> can never be nullified. Behold, God declared (Leviticus 27:31 : "I shall destroy your Sanctuaries." and the Sages commented (<i>Megillah</i> 28a): "Even though they are destroyed, their holiness remains intact. "<br>The <i>Shechinah's</i> resting place was the Ark. Therefore, had the Ark not been "entombed...in deep, maze-like vaults," on the Temple Mount, the sanctity of that site would also have been nullified. See also <i>Chatam Sofer, Chullin</i> 7a.<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (Vol. 21, p. 156-160) also discusses the same question. It explains that the Ark is a fundamental element of the Temple and the Temple building cannot be complete without it.<br>Therefore, from the very beginning of the Temple's construction, the Ark had two locations:<br>a) the place for the ark in the Holy of Holies,<br>b) the hidden vault where the Ark would be kept in the event of the Temple's destruction.<br>On this basis, we can see the Sanctuary built by Moses, the two Temples in Jerusalem, and the Messianic Temple, as unified by one essential bond. Since the same Ark was present in all previous structures and they will be revealed again in the Messianic age, all four buildings share the same essence.</i>
The First Temple had a one-cubit thick wall which separated the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states in the conclusion of the halachah, a divider was necessary between the sanctity of the Holy of Holies and the Sanctuary. In the Tabernacle in the desert, a curtain, the <i>parochet</i>, alone served this function. In the First Temple, a wall was also built in addition to the curtain.</i> When the Second Temple was constructed, they were unsure whether the width of that wall was included in the measure of the Sanctuary or the Holy of Holies.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 6:2 states: "And the length of the Temple Solomon built was 60 cubits." The narrative continues (<i>ibid.</i>:17, 20): "The Sanctuary was 40 cubits long...and the space for the ark was 20 cubits long." Since the combined length of both chambers was only 60 cubits, the width of the wall had to be included in the measure of one of the chambers. However, it was not clear from which chamber it should be built (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Kelayim</i> 8:4; see also <i>Yoma</i> 52a for a slightly different explanation).</i> Therefore, the Holy of Holies was made a full twenty cubits long, and the Sanctuary a full forty cubits long, and one additional cubit was left between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Marginita D'Rabbi Meir</i> asks why the builders of the Second Temple were willing to add an extra cubit between the two chambers, when they hesitated to increase the width of the dividing wall. In resolution, it is explained that originally the eastern wall built by Solomon was seven cubits thick, while in the Second Temple, it was only six cubits thick. Thus, there was no change in the total length of the Temple building.</i><br>They did not build a wall in the Second Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 3a,b explains that they did not build a wall because the Second Temple was higher than the First. The First Temple was only 30 cubits high. The Second Temple was 100 cubits high. A wall only a cubit thick would not be sturdy if built to such a height. Nevertheless, the width of the wall was not increased, because its original width was established by <i>Ruach HaKodesh</i>, Divine revelation. Thus, they returned to the pattern established in the Sanctuary of Moses and utilized curtains as dividers.</i> Rather, they hung two curtains, one from the side of the Sanctuary and one from the side of the Holy of Holies, with a cubit between them<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 52b relates that the external curtain had an opening on the south and the inner curtain had an opening on the north.

Thus, based on the possibility that the wall of the First Temple was included within the 20 cubits of the Holy of Holies, an additional cubit would have been included in this sacred area if only one curtain was used. From this perspective, the inner curtain had to be a distinct entity, marking the beginning of the most sacred chamber.<br>Conversely, based on the view that the wall had been included in the measure of the Sanctuary and that the wall and the Holy of Holies encompassed 21 cubits, a thick curtain would have been unnecessary, since the outer curtain was located where the division was required to be made.</i> However, in the First Temple, there was only one curtain,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the expression "First Temple" refers to the Sanctuary, for the First Temple itself had a wall rather than a curtain. However, Rav Yaakov Emden disputes this issue, quoting <i>Yoma</i> 54a which brings a number of <i>Aggadot</i> concerning the Ark and the curtain in the First Temple. The Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Middot</i> 4:7) specifically states that there was a curtain in addition to the wall in the First Temple.</i> as [Exodus 26:33] states: "The curtain will divide for you [between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.]"
The Temple building constructed by the exiles [returning from Babylon] was one hundred cubits long, one hundred cubits wide, and one hundred cubits high. The measurement of its height can be described as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The source for the Rambam's statements is <i>Middot</i> 4:6.</i><br>They built a solid base six cubits high resembling a foundation for it;<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah states that this base was embedded in the ground. In contrast, Rabbenu Shemaya explains that the base actually stood above the ground.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the addition of the word "resembling" in this halachah might imply that the Rambam changed his mind and adopted an interpretation similar to that of Rabbenu Shemaya.<br><i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> objects to the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, explaining that it would be inappropriate to include the measure of this base in the height of the Temple. He also explains that in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam adopted a different perspective. He thus, defines the base as an extension of the steps leading to the Entrance Hall. These steps were six cubits high, the height of the base.<br><i>Tzurat HaBayit</i> relates that there was a functional aspect to the base, and explains that it contained the lowest floor of the cells mentioned in Halachah 10.</i><br>the Sanctuary, 40 cubits high;<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Although the total height of Solomon's Sanctuary was 30 cubits, the returning exiles built the Second Temple higher, basing their decision on Haggai 2:9: "The glory of this later house will be greater than that of the former."</i><br>an ornate ceiling, one cubit high;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah indicates that builders made designs of cement and stone in the ceiling.

From the west to the east,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from the far end of the Temple to its entrance.</i> there were 100 cubits as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are based on the Mishnah, <i>Middot</i> 4:7. However, his interpretation of the Mishnah varies from the literal meaning.<br>The Mishnah relates all the measurements from the wall of the Entrance Hall, the easternmost point of the Temple building, until the end of the Holy of Holies. Afterwards, it continues: "The wall of the Temple was six [cubits], the cell was six [cubits], and the wall of the cell was five [cubits]."<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Middot</i> 4:3), the Rambam explains that unlike the northern, southern, and eastern external walls of the Temple, the two walls mentioned in the above Mishnah were not solid. Rather, each wall mentioned by the Mishnah refers to two walls, each a cubit thick, with a vacant space in between. Thus, there were really four walls, with three vacant spaces between. The vacant spaces are called cells, <i>ta'im</i>, in Hebrew and discussed in Halachah 10. In particular, the measurements of these vacant spaces are slightly different, as the Rambam explains.</i><br>There were four walls, one within the other, with three vacant spaces between them:<br>Between the western wall and the wall inside of it, five cubits,<br>Between the second and third walls, six cubits,<br>Between the third and fourth walls, six cubits.<br>These measurements include the width of the wall and the space between it and the following wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, the width of all these walls was one cubit.</i><br>The length of the Holy of Holies was 20 cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The length of the Holy of Holies and the Sanctuary was the same in the Second Temple and in the First.

Lion of God), the city where David encamped... '<br>Rabbenu Shimshon, the Ra'avad and others explain that the Temple building had a T shape. The Entrance Hall and its adjoining chambers were 100 cubits wide. However, the Entrance Hall was only eleven cubits long. The remaining 89 cubits of the Temple's length were only 70 cubits in width. The Mishnah states, "from north to south there were 70 cubits" and lists the division of that area. Afterwards, it concludes: "The Entrance Hall extended fifteen cubits to the north and fifteen cubits to the south..." implying, according to these authorities, that there were two measurements of the Temple's width, one including the Entrance Hall and one without it.<br>In contrast, the Rambam conceived of the Temple as being shaped like a trapezoid. See the accompanying drawing taken from his Commentary to the Mishnah. See also Halachah 9.<br>At its easternmost point, the Entrance Hall, it was 100 cubits wide. However, that width was slightly diminished as one proceeded westward, so that it would be "lion-shaped." His opinion is reinforced by the opening statement of Mishnah 4:6, which declares: "The Temple was 100 cubits by 100 cubits and 100 cubits tall," implying that it was shaped like a cube, except for the slight reduction of its width towards the rear.</i><br>The Sanctuary had six walls, one within the other, with five vacant places between them:<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The abovementioned Mishnah reads:<br>The wall of the winding stairwell, five; the winding stairwell, three; the wall of the cell, five; the cell, six; the wall of the Sanctuary, six; the [Sanctuary's] enclosed area, twenty; the wall of the Sanctuary, six; the cell, six; the wall of the cell, six; the drainage chamber, three; and the [outer] wall, five.<br>Again, the Rambam explains that the walls mentioned by the Mishnah were not solid, but rather, each was a cubit thick, with a hollow space in between. The Mishnah can be understood in terms of the Rambam's words according to the clauses that follow:</i><br>Between the outer wall and the second [wall], there were five cubits;<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the "winding stairwell" mentioned by the Mishnah on the north side and the "drainage chamber" on the south side.</i><br>Between the second and the third, three cubits;<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This clause explains why the Rambam does not define "the walls" as solid structures.

A wicket is a small gateway. The Sanctuary had two wickets on the sides of the great gate in the middle, one on the north and one on the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam's diagrams and Rav Kapach's notes to the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, the two wickets are placed at the entrance to the spaces between the fourth and fifth walls (counting from the outside) on the north and south sides respectively (see the diagram accompanying Halachah 4). This area is referred to as "the cell" in the abovementioned Mishnah.</i><br>No one ever entered through the southern [wicket]. Explicit [reference] to this [is made] by [in the Book of] Ezekiel [44:2]: "This gate will be closed. It will not be opened."<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues: "because the Lord, God of Israel enters through it." The <i>Midrash Tanchumah</i> explains that this is an expression of God's humility. Rather than enter through the "great gate," God chooses to approach the Sanctuary through the modest wicket.</i><br>[Every morning, the priests] would enter [through the wicket] on the north and proceed between the two walls until reaching an opening to the Sanctuary on the left. [From there], they would enter the Temple, proceed to the great gate, and open it.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah quotes <i>Middot</i> 4:2 and explains the manner in which the gates to the Sanctuary were opened each morning. Rather than open them from the front, the priests came in through the Entrance Hall, turned to the right, and entered through the wicket. They continued walking between the walls until reaching an opening from which they could enter the Sanctuary.<br>According to a diagram that accompanies Rav Kapach's edition of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, the entrance to the Sanctuary was approximately in the center of the Sanctuary.</i>
The great gate<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The term "great gate" is used because of the importance of its position, leading into the Sanctuary, and not because of the gate's size. We find a similar example in Deuteronomy 1:7 which describes the Euphrates as "the great river," though it is not physically large compared to other major rivers. The commentaries explain that this appellation was used because of its unique importance in marking the eastern boundary of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> (<i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i>).</i> was ten cubits wide and twenty cubits high.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This was the standard size of the gates in the Temple (<i>Middot</i> 2:3).</i> It had four doors: two to the inner [chamber,] and two to the outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel's vision of the Temple (41:23-24) explicitly describes "two doors to the Temple and to the Sanctuary... two doors for each [set of] doors."</i> The outer gates opened into the doorway, covering the breadth of the walls.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Since this passage was six cubits long, the doors, each only five cubits wide, could not cover the walls entirely.

The opening to the Entrance Hall was forty cubits high and twenty [cubits] wide.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This was the largest gateway of the entire Temple complex.</i> It did not have gates.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that this gateway, the entrance to the Temple, was always open.

The <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> notes this apparent contradiction and explains that these beams were embedded into the wall and were thus, not "protruding."</i> The bottom [beam] extended beyond the entrance, one cubit on either side. Each of the five [beams] extended one cubit on either side of the [beam] below it. Thus, the uppermost beam was thirty cubits [long].<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The entrance was twenty cubits wide and the five beams each extended one cubit on each side.

As stated above, the Rambam conceived of the Temple building as a trapezoid. The wings of the Entrance Hall continued to the rear of the building, and the wall surrounding them was the Temple's most external wall. If so, it would seem that the balconies mentioned here should have extended out from that wall and not from the wall of the winding stairwell.</i> The lowest balcony was five [cubits long.] The pavement above it was six cubits long. The middle projection was six cubits, and the pavement above it seven cubits. The upper balcony was seven cubits, as it is said (I Kings 6:6 : "The lowest balcony...."<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">A projection served as a roof for the lower balcony, and above it was another balcony having the same length as the projection.

Rashi and the Ra'avad explain that the verses and the Mishnah mentioned above refer to the cells mentioned in Halachot 4, 5, and 10. According to those commentaries, there were no balconies at all. The <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> mentions the Rambam's opinion. However, the diagrams drawn by the Rambam himself and accompanying his Commentary to the Mishnah (as published in Rav Kapach's edition) were not at his disposal. Hence, there may be some imprecision in his interpretation of the Rambam's words.<br>To understand the Rambam, we must return to the original sources. However, even that is not easy, since most available translations and even most commentaries in Hebrew follow Rashi's view.<br>The following is a rendition of the verses in Kings, according to the Rambam:<br>And on the walls of the House, he constructed a side-structure surrounding the walls of the House, the Sanctuary, and the Holy of Holies. He made projections around [the House]. The lowest structure was five cubits wide; the middle one, six cubits wide, and the third, seven cubits wide. He placed structures diminishing in size for the House, surrounding it on its exterior, so that [the people] will not take hold of the House.<br>The Mishnah interprets those verses as follows:<br>The lowest [balcony] was five [cubits wide - as mentioned in the verse]. There was a projection of six cubits [the projection mentioned in the verse.] The middle one was six cubits, and there was an additional projection of seven cubits. The upper one was seven cubits wide.<br>The Rambam's diagrams show a straight outer wall of the Temple, and balconies which diminish in length on their outer side (in contrast to the explanation offered by the <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i>).<br>The balconies in the Rambam's drawings were built as a protective measure, to insure that the priests show proper respect for the Temple and do not lean against its walls.</i><br>Similarly, [there were projections] from bottom to top, around the wall of the Entrance Hall. The [pattern] was as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">These projections also are the subject of a difference in opinion between Rashi and the Rambam. The source for the debate is the interpretation of <i>Middot</i> 3:6 which states:<br>There were 22 cubits between the Entrance Hall and the Altar. There were twelve steps there. Each step was half a cubit high and one cubit wide.<br>A cubit, a cubit; and a protrusion of three; a cubit, a cubit, and a protrusion of three; on the highest level, a cubit, a cubit, and a protrusion of four.<br>Rashi interprets the entire mishnah as referring to the steps leading to the Entrance Hall. In order to fill the space between the Altar and the Entrance Hall, platforms were inserted into the steps. Thus, there were three empty cubits before the first step, a step, a step, and a platform of three, etc. until one reached the Entrance Hall.<br>Rav Kapach's translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah sees the mishnah as referring to two separate subjects, the steps which had been mentioned previously and protrusions which he describes as follows:<br>Afterwards, [the mishnah] states that the wall of the Entrance Hall was built in the following pattern. A cubit long portion of the wall was left vacant as all the other walls...Above it there was a structure protruding from the wall, three cubits high... called a projection. Similarly, the entire height [of the wall] ...had one cubit of [vacant] wall space, a projection of three cubits... until the uppermost projection, which was four cubits high.<br>Note the accompanying drawing copied from Rav Kapach's edition of the Commentary to the Mishnah. Rather than picture the front wall of the Temple as a flat structure, the Rambam depicts it as being covered with these projections.</i><br>one vacant cubit,<br>a projection of three cubits,<br>one vacant cubit, and then,<br>a projection of three cubits.<br>This pattern was followed until the top [of the wall.] Thus, the projections surrounded the walls.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">All four walls of the Temple were covered with projections to prevent the priests from leaning against them.</i> Each projection<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Extending out from the front facade.</i> was three cubits wide until the top [of the wall], and between each projection was a [vacant] cubit. The uppermost projection was four cubits wide.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">See the accompanying diagram for an artist's conception of the Temple's front facade.</i>
All the vacant spaces between the walls are called cells.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the commentary on Halachot 4 and 5, the Rambam has a different conception of the cells than the other commentaries.<br><i>Middot</i> 4:3 states:<br>There were 38 cells: five in the north, five in the south, and eight in the west. In the north and in the south, there were five above five, with five above them. In the west, there were three above three, with two above them.<br><i>Middot</i> 4:7 states:<br>The wall of the winding stairwell, five; the winding stairwell, three; the wall of the cell, five; the cell, six; the wall of the Sanctuary, six; the [Sanctuary's] enclosed area, twenty; the wall of the Sanctuary, six; the cell, six; the wall of the cell, six; the drainage chamber, three; and the [outer] wall, five.<br>Rashi and the Ra'avad explain the two mishnayot simply: The chamber referred to as "the cell" in mishnah 4:7 was, in fact, divided lengthwise into five cells on the northern and southern sides of the Temple, with three cells on the western side. All the other specific dimensions mentioned by the mishnah can thus be understood without any difficulty.<br>In contrast, the Rambam explains that the walls mentioned in the mishnah 4:7 were not solid, but rather, double walls, each a cubit in thickness, and with a hollow space in between. The five cells mentioned in 4:3 thus, refer to the five vacant spaces between the walls. These spaces extended the entire length of the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies on the northern and southern sides, and the three cells extended to the three vacant spaces between the walls on the western side.<br>Note the accompanying drawings copied from Rav Kapach's edition of the Commentary to the Mishnah. The three divisions must be seen as being placed one on top of the other.</i> Thus, five cells surrounded the Sanctuary on the north, five on the south, and three on the west.<br>There were three levels [of cells,] one level above the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The lowest level was six cubits high, equal to the height of the Temple's base. The other two levels were each twenty cubits high. As the Rambam states in Halachah 12, the roof of the cells was on the same level as the upper storey of the Sanctuary.</i> Thus, there were fifteen cells on the south; five above five, with five above them. Similarly, in the north, there were fifteen cells.<br>There were eight cells in the west; three above three, with two above them on one level.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The addition of the words "on one level" is necessary. Since the pattern of cells differed in the west, one might think that rather than have only three levels as in the north and south, the mishnah's words "two above them" could be interpreted as follows: There were four levels of cells, the latter two each possessing one cell. With this addition, the Rambam prevents this misconception from arising.</i> Thus, there were a total of 38 cells.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">They were used for storage.</i>
Each cell had three entrances: one to the cell on the right, another to the cell on the left,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The source for this Halachah is <i>Middot</i> 4:7. The Rambam's interpretation again differs from that of Rashi.<br>Rashi would interpret right and left as lengthwise in the row of cells.

The Rambam cannot contradict an explicit mishnah, yet his interpretation of the mishnah's text is by no means straightforward.<br>According to the Rambam, this cell is positioned above the cell called "the winding stairwell."

It does not refer to the Sanctuary itself, but to the Entrance Hall. Nevertheless, the latter can also be called the Sanctuary as evidenced by the Rambam's statements in Chapter 1, Halachah 5.<br>Furthermore, there is an additional problem: The mishnah appeared to intend to single out this cell by the fact that it had five entrances. However, according to the Rambam's interpretation, the cell with the wicket also possessed five entrances: One to the Sanctuary, one to the Entrance Hall, one to the cell above it, one to the cell below it, and one to the cell on its right.</i>

Chapter 5

Mount Moriah, the Temple Mount, measured 500 cubits by 500 cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries, basing themselves on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i> 2:5), explain that this figure was derived as follows:<br>Exodus 27:18 states: 'The length of the courtyard shall be 100 cubits and its width, 50 by 50.' This verse can obviously not be understood literally, for area has only two coordinates. Hence, the Sages explained that rather than refer to the courtyard of the Tabernacle, the verse describes a measure related to the future Sanctuaries. The Temple Mount measured a total of 50 x 100 x 50 cubits in area, i.e., a total of 250,000 sq. cubits.<br>The <i>Piskei Tosafot</i> (<i>Middot</i> 5) relate that the total area of the Temple Mount was greater than 250,000 sq. cubits. However, only the latter figure was consecrated.</i> It was surrounded by a wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">With the exception of the wall on the eastern side, the walls on all sides were very high. We know that their gates were 20 cubits high and the walls themselves were even higher. In modern terms, that would mean at least 10 meters (32.5 feet high).</i> [The earth beneath it was hollowed out to prevent contracting ritual impurity] due to <i>Tumat Ohel.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tumat Ohel</i> refers to ritual impurity contracted by being under the same tent or structure as a corpse. Even thought the corpse is buried, ritual impurity can be contracted unless there is a vacant space between the corpse and the earth above it. To prevent the possibility of impurity from a grave under the Temple courtyard, the entire earth below was hollowed out. See <i>Parah</i> 3:3.</i> Arches above arches were built underneath [for support].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Though the Mishnah (<i>Parah, loc. cit.</i>) states that the earth beneath the Temple was hollowed out, it does not mention the construction of arches. However, since the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>:6) states that arches supported the ramp leading from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives, we may assume that a similar technique was used in the instance (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary to Chapter 1, Halachah 13.</i> It was entirely covered,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">With the exception of the Temple Courtyard.</i> one colonnade inside another.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 13a) explains that this roof was built to protect the visitors to the Temple fom rain.</i>
Five gates led to the [Temple Mount]: One from the west,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Middot</i> 1:3 relates that this gate was called <i>Kaiphonus.</i> The <i>Shiltei Giborim</i> explains that this means 'garden' in Greek. The name was given because a rose was planted outside this gate.</i> one from the east,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This gate was called the Gate of Shushan, and the image of the city of Shushan was engraved upon it. This was done at the command of King Cyrus of Persia, who gave permission for the Temple to be rebuilt.</i> one from the north,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It was called the <i>Tadi</i> gate, meaning 'hiddenness.' This gate was used when someone was forced to leave the Temple, but he did not want to publicize the circumstances (<i>Middot</i> 1:9, 2:2). Its construction differed from that of the other gates. Rather than have an ordinary lintel, it had two stones leaning against each other (<i>ibid.</i>:3).</i> and two from the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These were the gates most frequently used to enter the Temple Mount. They were named after the prophetess Chuldah. In the time of the First Temple, she stood before these gates and urged the people to repent.<br>The tractate <i>Sofrim</i> 19:12 relates that there were two additional gates to the Temple Mount: one for mourners and one for grooms. The Jewish people would sit between these two gates waiting to console the mourners and join in the celebration of the grooms. The <i>Kaftor ViPerach</i> states that these gates were on the east, to the north of the gate of Shushan. They were called the 'gates of mercy.' Today, the term is used to refer to the two gates on the east side of the Temple Mount, which can be seen from the Mount of Olives and are permanently shut.</i> Each gate was 10 cubits [wide] and twenty cubits high.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This was the standard size of the gates in the Temple complex.</i> [Each gate] had doors.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the gateway to the Entrance Hall, which had no doors.</i>
Further within, a latticework partition,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Made of wooden shafts arranged in a crisscross pattern.</i> 10 handbreadths high, surrounded it on all sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher explains that this structure was constructed to allow the articles to be carried on the Sabbath. Therefore, it was made 10 handbreadths high. The Temple Mount was surrounded by a wall and, therefore, could not be considered a public domain. Nonetheless, its size exceeded the limits placed by the Sages, and without this partition, there would have been a Rabbinic prohibition against carrying on the Sabbath.<br>The <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> (<i>Middot</i> 2:3) objects to this reasoning, explaining that the Rabbinic prohibitions regarding the Sabbath were generally relaxed within the Temple premises. Instead, he offers the hypothesis that this partition served to delineate the point beyond which gentiles were not allowed to proceed.</i><br>The <i>Chayl</i> [a rampart] ten cubits high, was located further inside this partition.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Middot</i> 2:3 states: 'The <i>Chayl</i>, ten cubits.' In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Middot</i> 1:4), the Rambam describes the <i>Chayl</i> as a rampart. He, therefore, interprets this statement as referring to its height. In contrast, Rav Ovadiah of Bartinura does not define the <i>Chayl</i> as a wall. Rather, he refers to it as an empty space, 10 cubits wide.</i> It is referred to in the [Book of] Lamentations [2:6]: 'The wall and the rampart mourned.' [This wall] refers to the wall surrounding the Temple Courtyard.
Further inward, beyond the <i>chayl</i>, was the Temple Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In this halachah, the Rambam does not mention the Women's Courtyard (See Halachah 7), because he intends to list the dividers which circumscribe an area of the Temple Mount on all four sides. The Women's Courtyard had the same dimensions as the Temple Courtyard on the north and south. Hence, it was not mentioned in this place.</i> The Temple Courtyard was 187 [cubits] long and 135 [cubits] wide.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 12 and where the Rambam details the space allocation of the Temple Courtyard.</i><br>It had seven gates.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This statement raises a number of problems: Three mishnayot in the tractate of <i>Middot</i> mention the number of gates to the Temple Courtyard:<br>Mishnah 1:1 states: "The Levites [stood guard] in twenty one places: five at the five gates of the Temple Courtyard...."<br>Mishnah 1:4 states: "There were seven gates to the Temple Courtyard...."<br>Mishnah 2:6 states: "Thirteen prostrations were carried out there. Abba Yossi ben Chanan declared: [These were instituted] because of the thirteen gates...<br>It is difficult to conceive that the Mishnah would contradict itself within the same tractate. The apparent discrepancies can be explained as follows: The Sages do not disagree about the number of entrances to the Temple Courtyard. They did, however, debate the question of which entrance met the legal criteria for a gate. Guards were required to stand watch over every entrance that was considered a gate.<br>Similarly, although a person who is ritually impure may not enter the Temple premises, it is not clear whether he would be obligated to bring a sin offering if he came in through an entrance which is not considered a gate. See Chapter 8, Halachah 8, and <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 18, p.212-217.</i> Three were on its north side, close to the west,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">These gates were:<br>a) the gate of the spark.

See Halachah 10.</i> and three were on the south side, close to the west. One [gate] in the east was positioned in the center, [directly] opposite the Holy of Holies.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Gate of Nicanor. It was most commonally used to enter the Temple Courtyard. The notes to the following halachah offers an explanation of that name.</i>
Each gate was ten cubits wide and twenty cubits high.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This was the standard size of the gates on the Temple Mount.</i> Each one had gold-plated doors,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachot 11 and 19.</i> except for the eastern gate which was plated with bronze that resembled gold. This was called the Upper Gate.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the beginning of Chapter 6, the Temple was built on an incline and had steps leading from the Women's Courtyard to the gate of Nicanor. Hence, the gate leading to the Women's Courtyard was referred to as the lower gate, and the gate of Nicanor, the Upper Gate. See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 7, Mishnah 6.</i> It was [also called] the gate of Nicanor.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In honor of the noble person who donated its doors.<br><i>Yoma</i> 38a relates that Nicanor journeyed to Alexandria to ask the skilled bronzeworkers there to fashion these gates. When the gates were finished, he set sail with them to return to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>At sea, a violent storm almost capsized the vessel. After other measures failed, the crew members decided to jettison some of the ship's cargo to reduce its weight. Immediately, they tossed one of the heavy bronzed gates to the waves.<br>The danger did not cease, and the crew wanted to cast the second gate overboard as well. Hearing this, Nicanor protested and declared that he would have to be thrown into the sea before the gate. Directly after he made that statement, the storm subsided and the ship was able to proceed.<br>Throughout the remainder of the journey, Nicanor was overcome with remorse. Why, he thought, hadn't he defended the first gate as well? How great was his joy when the ship docked at Acre and the gate emerged from under its hull.<br>When the financial situation of the Jewish people improved, they replaced all the Temple's bronze gates with gold-covered gates. Nevertheless, they allowed Nicanor's gates to remain in memory of the miracles which occurred. The Sages declared: "Their bronze shined like gold."</i>
The Temple Courtyard was not situated directly in the center of the Temple Mount. Rather, it was set off further from the southern [wall] of the Temple Mount than from [the wall of] any other direction.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above (Halachah 2), the main entrance to the Temple Mount was on the South. Therefore, more space was left in this direction, and more Temple functions were carried out on that side.</i> It was closer to the western [wall] than to [the wall of] any other direction.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In deference to the Holy of Holies, no mundane business was carried on behind it. Hence, less space was left there than in the other directions.<br>According to most opinions, the Wailing Wall at which we worship today, is the western wall which surrounded the Temple Mount (<i>Kaftor Viperach</i>).</i> There was a greater distance between it and the northern [wall] than between it and the western [wall].

For what purpose were they used?<br>The southeastern chamber<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The chamber to the left upon entering the Women's Courtyard.</i> was [called] the Chamber of the Nazirites.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:18 commands: "The Nazirite shall shave off the crown of hair on his head before the Tent of Meeting.

If so, how could two structures be consecrated?<br>This difficulty can be resolved as follows: The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:4) states that chambers which are built on ground that was not consecrated, but which open up to the Temple Courtyard, are considered as consecrated. Should they open up to the outside, they are not sacred. According to the Rambam's diagram, the two southern chambers of the Chamber of the Hearth faced the Temple Courtyard, while the two northern chambers faced the <i>chayl</i>.

This determination is significant in regard to three matters:<br>a) Sacrifices of the highest holy order of sanctity must be eaten within the Temple Courtyard.<br>b) Sacrifices of lesser degree of sanctity must be slaughtered within the Temple Courtyard.<br>c) Entry to the Temple Courtyard is forbidden when ritually impure.<br>See the Rambam's Commentary to <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:8.</i> If [their roofs] were on the same level as the earth of the Courtyard, their inner space is not consecrated,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">And does not share the sanctity of the Courtyard.</i> but their roofs are consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">And shares that level of holiness.</i><br>If they are not on the same level [as the Courtyard], their roofs are also not consecrated, for the roofs and the upper floors [of the structures in the Temple Courtyard] were not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 86a explains that an exception to the latter principle was made regarding the upper storey of the Temple building itself.<br>I Chronicles 28:11 states: "Then David gave Solomon his son the design of the Entrance Hall, its houses, its treasure stores, its upper storeys, its inner chambers, and the place for the ark," implying that the upper storey shared the same level of holiness as the remainder of the Temple building.</i><br>Therefore, sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Sin offerings, guilt offerings, and communal peace offerings.</i> may not be eaten on these roofs,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:6 requires the guilt offering to be eaten "in a sacred place," i.e. within the Temple courtyard.

In the Temple, that phrase refers to the Temple Courtyard. The same ruling applies to other sacrifices of similar status (<i>Zevachim</i> 55a).</i>
[Regarding the chambers] which were built on unconsecrated ground, but were open to consecrated ground:<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Among the chambers included in this category were those on the southern side of the Chamber of the Hearth. Though the latter was positioned outside the Temple Courtyard, these chambers were open to it. See Chapter 5, Halachah 10.</i> Their inner space was considered consecrated when eating sacrifices of the most holy order.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 56a explains that these chambers are by nature unconsecrated. However, the Torah made an exception in regard to the consumption of these sacrifices.</i> However, the sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity were not slaughtered there. [Similarly,] a person who enters while ritually impure is not required [to bring a sin offering].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Though there is no Scriptural prohibition against entering these chambers while ritually impure, the Sages forbade such an act.</i><br>The roofs [of these chambers] are considered as unconsecrated ground in all respects.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">There is not even a Rabbinic prohibition against one who is ritually impure ascending to them.</i>
The underground passageways which open to the Temple Courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, many underground passageways were constructed on the Temple Mount.</i> are consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">And all the laws applying to the Courtyard apply to them.</i> Those that open to the Temple Mount [outside the Courtyard] are not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, a ritually impure individual may enter them, as described in Chapter 5, Halachah 11.</i><br>The windows<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the apertures in the wall.</i> and the width<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the upper surface.</i> of the wall are considered within [the Courtyard] in regard to partaking of the sacrifices of the most holy order and [entering while] ritually impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> question these statements. <i>Pesachim</i> 86a states that the wall's upper surface is only considered an extension of the Courtyard when it is on the same level as the Courtyard (as the roofs of the chambers mentioned in Halachah 7.) If the wall is higher than the Courtyard, it is not considered consecrated.<br>The following explanation may be offered for the decision rendered by the Rambam: Rashi (<i>Pesachim, loc. cit.</i>) relates that the <i>chayl</i> was the major wall around the inner Temple complex and the wall of the Courtyard itself was not high. Since the Temple was built on an incline, it was possible that the latter wall would be on the same level as the floor of the Courtyard, even though the Courtyard wall was raised above the ground in front of it.<br>However, the Rambam himself definitely cannot accept such an interpretation. He already stated (Chapter 5, Halachah 3) that the <i>chayl</i> was only 10 cubits high. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that it would be the major wall surrounding the inner Temple complex. That likelihood is further reduced by the fact that the <i>chayl</i> was set off from the Temple Courtyard by a considerable distance, especially on the northern and southern sides. See also <i>Tosefot Yom Tov</i>, <i>Middot</i> 2:3.<br>The above three halachot also apply to the city of Jerusalem as a whole. As stated above, the sacrifices of the most holy order could only be eaten within the Temple Courtyard. Similarly, a limitation was placed on where the sacrifices of lesser sanctity could be eaten. One could only partake of those offerings within the confines of the city of Jerusalem, and the definition of the city's limits were therefore of consequence. The particular decisions regarding the Courtyard's chambers, underground passageways, and upper surfaces of the wall, refer to the counterparts of these structures at the city's outer wall.</i>
If the <i>Sanhedrin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This decision can only be made by the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the court of 71 judges who were seated in the Chamber of Hewn Stone.</i> desires to add to [the city limits of] Jerusalem<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">And thus, extend the area in which sacrifices of lesser sanctity may be eaten.</i> or the Temple Courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">And thus, extend the area to which the three mitzvot mentioned in the notes to Halachah 7 apply.</i> they may.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Zevachim</i> 33a) explains that since the design for the Temple was conveyed by <i>Ruach HaKodesh</i>, Divine inspiration, even the <i>Sanhedrin</i> could not add to the limits of the Courtyard unless they could find a verse in the <i>Tanach</i> to support their decision.<br>The passage cited in <i>Zevachim</i> and similarly, <i>Sukkot</i> 51b, reinforce the position of the <i>Tosafot</i>. However, the <i>Yeriot Shlomo</i> and other commentaries question whether the Rambam accepts that principle</i> They may extend the Temple Courtyard to any place they desire on the Temple Mount.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Or Sameiach</i> cites allusions from the Tanach which appear to limit the size of the Courtyard to the Temple Mount.

We may not expand [the limits] of the city [of Jerusalem] or of the Temple Courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains, the construction of the Temple and the establishment of its limits must conform to the pattern followed in the construction of the <i>Shechinah's</i> first resting place, the Sanctuary in the desert.

Since these requirements were set on the basis of the pattern followed when dedicating the Sanctuary, the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i> should not be required for dedicating future Sanctuaries.<br>Among the answers given to that question are that until Aharon's installation as High Priest, Moses served in that capacity and wore al the priestly garments (Ritbah).</i> and the <i>Sanhedrin</i> of 71 judges,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities maintain that the <i>Sanhedrin</i> was established before the Sanctuary was built.

Nevertheless, Moses' participation is considered equivalent to that of the <i>Sanhedrin</i>.</i> as [Exodus 25:9] states: "According to all that I show you, [the design of the Sanctuary]...so shall you make it." [The latter phrase was interpreted by our sages to mean that the same conditions should apply in] future generations.<br>[The presence of a king is required] because Moses, our teacher, was a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that Deuteronomy 33:5: "And he was a king in Yeshurun," refers to Moses.</i>
How do we extend [the limits of] the city?<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The entire procession described by the Rambam is described in detail in <i>Sh'vuot</i> 15a-16a.<br>The source for these practices is the description of the dedication of Jerusalem in Nechemiah 12:27-44. There, it is related that:<br>At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought Levites...to bring them to Jerusalem to carry out the dedication with joy and thanksgiving, with songs, with cymbals, with harps, and with lyres....Then, I asked the princes of Judah to ascend the wall, and I brought up the greater portion of two thanksgiving offerings....They ascended to the wall by the stairs of the city of David....They offered great sacrifices that day, for God had made them rejoice with great joy....and the joy of Jerusalem was heard from far away.<br></i> The <i>Sanhedrin</i> must offer two thanksgiving offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">A thanksgiving offering includes three elements: the leavened breads, an animal which is sacrificed and loaves of unleavened bread.<br><i>Sh'vuot, loc. cit.</i>, explains that the leavened breads were chosen because Nechemiah's description of Jerusalem's dedication relates that he "brought up the greater portion of two thanksgiving offerings." That phrase alludes to the leavened breads of the thanksgiving offerings which rose, and thus, were more substantial than the unleavened breads.</i> [Then, two priests]<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed addition was made on the basis of Rashi's commentary, <i>Sh'vuot</i> 16b.</i> take the leavened breads from these offerings [and proceed]. The <i>Sanhedrin</i> would follow the thanksgiving offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sh'vuot, loc. cit.</i> relates that the leaders of the people, the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, followed the thanksgiving offerings when Ezra and Nechemiah dedicated the city of Jerusalem.<br>This halachah is taken from the Mishnah, <i>Sh'vuot</i> 2:2. Many versions of that mishnah, including the one quoted in the Talmud, add the phrase: "And all of Israel followed after them." However, the Rambam's version of the text omits that phrase. Hence, it is also not included in this halachah.</i> The thanksgiving offerings [would not proceed together, but] one would follow the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, in Nechemiah's narrative, the two offerings were separated.</i><br>They would stand on each and every corner and every single stone in Jerusalem, [playing] harps, lyres, and cymbals, and reciting [Psalms 30]: "I exalt you, Lord, for You have uplifted me...."<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 30 is called "the song of the dedication of the House." Hence, it is appropriate for this occasion.<br><i>Sh'vuot, loc. cit.</i>, also relates that other Psalms, including 3, 91, and 100, were recited.</i><br>[They would proceed] until reaching the end of the place [which they desired to] consecrate. There, they would stand and eat one of the two thanksgiving offerings. The other was burnt. A prophet would determine which was eaten and which was burnt.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This procedure was carried out at Nechemiah's dedication of Jerusalem. The prophets Chaggai, Zechariah, and Malachi participated in that dedication, and advised Nechemiah of the procedure to follow.</i>
Similarly, [if the Sages desire] to extend the [limits of the] courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">There is no record of this practice ever being carried out. Rather, the Temple Courtyard remained the same size from the time it was dedicated by Ezra.</i> they must consecrate it with the remaining portion of the meal offering. Just as the thanksgiving offering, which must be eaten inside Jerusalem consecrates it, so, too, the remaining portion of the meal offering, which may only be eaten inside the Temple Courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:1-3 states: "When a man offers a meal offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour....the priest shall burn the memorial part of it on the Altar....and the remnant of the meal offering shall be Aharon's and his sons. It is of the sacrifices of the highest order of holiness." Hence it must be eaten in the Temple Courtyard.</i> consecrates it. It is to be eaten at the end of the space which they desire to consecrate.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Ri Migash, the Rambam's teacher, commenting on <i>Sh'vuot, loc. cit.</i>, emphasizes that eating the offerings are not merely signs that the consecration of the city or the Courtyard had been carried out, but rather, the consecration becomes effective by eating of these offerings. The Rambam's statements here appear to be based on that principle.</i>
Any place which was not [consecrated] with all the above [elements] and according to the above procedure is not thoroughly consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The expression used "not thoroughly consecrated" is somewhat problematic. The Maharit explains that this expression can be understood within the context of the Mishnah's statements (<i>Sh'vuot, loc. cit.</i>): "[In regard to] any place [in the Temple Courtyard] which was not consecrated with all of these [i.e., a king, a prophet, etc.], one who enters [while ritually impure] is not liable [for a sin offering]."<br>Generally, throughout the Talmud, such an expression implies that though a sin offering is not required, the act is forbidden. Similarly, in this context, a consecration which lacks all the elements listed previously in the Mishnah is not totally effective. Therefore, entering the portion of the Courtyard consecrated in this manner does not obligate an impure individual to bring a sacrifice. Nevertheless, there is a Rabbinic prohibition against entering that area.</i> Though Ezra offered two thanksgiving offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">As described in the passage from Nechemiah quoted above</i> [to dedicate the city,] he merely carried out a testimonial act. The Sanctuary was not consecrated through his deeds, for neither a King nor the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 1.</i> were present there.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Although the dedication procedure carried out by Ezra and Nechemiah was merely a testimonial act, having no Halachic significance, we are forced to say that the testimonial was carried out in precise detail as if the city was actually being consecrated. Therefore, the description of their procedure can demonstrate the process necessary to actually dedicate the city.</i><br>[If so,] how was [the Second Temple] consecrated?<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Since all sacrifices were offered there, we must conclude that it was indeed consecrated.</i> With the first consecration performed by Solomon, for he consecrated the Temple Courtyard and Jerusalem, for that time and for eternity.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">This concept is the subject of a debate in the Talmud (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 16a, <i>Makkot</i> 19a, <i>Megillah</i> 10a) and is discussed by the Rambam in the following two halachot.</i>
Therefore, we may offer all the sacrifices [on the Temple site], even though the Temple itself is not built.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">See the commentary to Chapter 2, Halachah 4 which explains that the exiles who returned from Babylon built an Altar before they completed the construction of the Second Temple. The prophets assured them that "all sacrifices could be offered on that Altar, even though the Temple itself was not [built] there [yet.]" The construction of the Temple took another twenty two years to complete.<br>Even in later generations, our spiritual leaders have desired to offer sacrifices on the Temple Mount. In the Middle Ages, the Sage, Rabbi Chayim (according to other sources, Rabbi Yechiel) of Paris made <i>Aliyah</i> and settled in Jerusalem. He was prepared to offer sacrifices on the Temple site and refrained from doing so only after his colleagues explained that sacrifices could not be offered because they were unaware of the proper location, size, and dimensions of the Altar.</i> Similarly, sacrifices of the most holy order can be eaten in the entire [area of the] Courtyard, even though it is in ruin and not surrounded by a divider.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Twenty two years passed between the time that the exiles return to Jerusalem and the completion of the Second Temple. During that time, all the sacrifices were offered and eaten even though the walls of the Temple and the Courtyard were not built.</i><br>We may also eat sacrifices of lesser sanctity and <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i><sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The second tithe. After the first tithe was separated, a second tithe also had to be set aside. In four years out of the seven year agricultural cycle, <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> was brought to Jerusalem and eaten there. See Deuteronomy<i>:22-26,</i> Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni.</i> throughout Jerusalem,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is extremely problematic. In <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:1, the Rambam himself writes that "<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> is only eaten in Jerusalem while the Temple is standing." Though some authorities have explained that the statement in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> refers to the time when the Altar is standing, there is no indication in the Rambam's words to that effect. Furthermore, there are other inconsistencies between the Rambam's statements here and in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i>.<br>Even according to the Rambam's statements here, we are now prohibited from eating <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> in Jerusalem. We are all ritually impure, and <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> must be eaten in a state of ritual purity.</i> even though [it is not surrounded by] a wall, for through its original consecration, it was consecrated for that time and for eternity.
<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><b>In the previous halachot, the Rambam stated that the sanctity of the Temple Mount and Jerusalem would remain for eternity, because of the initial consecration by David and Solomon. Thus, when Ezra rededicated Jerusalem, as described in the Book of Nechemiah, his act was merely testimonial in nature. There was no need to reconsecrate the Temple, because its original holiness had never been nullified.</b><br>This seemingly contradicts the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer Zeraim</i>, the portion of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> which deals with the agricultural laws to be observed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There, the Rambam states that the original consecration of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was nullified after the Babylonian conquest. When Ezra returned from Babylon, he reconsecrated the Land, causing the various agricultural laws to be in effect again, though only <i>M'd'Rabbanen</i>, according to Rabbinic decree.<br>The portion he consecrated was considerably smaller than the original boundaries of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Nevertheless, his consecration remained in effect even after the Gentiles' subsequent conquests. Indeed, on the basis of that consecration, these agricultural laws must be observed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> today.<br>To resolve that contradiction, the Rambam explains that the "consecration" of Jerusalem and of the Temple differs from the "consecration" of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as a whole. Jerusalem and the Temple were consecrated by the revelation of the <i>Shechinah</i> in the Temple. That Divine act can never be nullified by man's deeds. In contrast, the consecration of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as a whole was brought about by the Jewish people. It can thus be nullified by the Gentiles.</i> Why do I say that the original consecration sanctified the Temple and Jerusalem for eternity,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">As stated above in Halachot 14 and 15.</i> while in regard to the consecration of the remainder of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, in the context of the Sabbatical year, tithes, and other similar [agricultural] laws, [the original consecration] did not sanctify it for eternity?<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> (1:5), the Rambam states:<br>Every [place] which those ascending from Egypt took possession of was consecrated in the initial consecration. When [the Jewish people] were exiled, that sanctity was nullified.

The Sages declared:<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megillah</i> 28a.</i> "Even though they have been devastated, their sanctity remains."<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Support for this statement can be brought from God's response to King Solomon, II Chronicles 7:15: "For now, I have chosen and sanctified this house, that My Name be there for eternity, and My eyes and My heart will be there forever."<br>Similarly, <i>Sh'vuot</i> 16b states that the Temple was consecrated forever.<br>Nevertheless, that statement is not accepted by all Halachic authorities. Both Rashi and the <i>Tosafot</i> interpret the Talmud's statements in <i>Sh'vuot</i> in a manner which indicates that they do not accept its simple meaning.<br>Similarly, commenting on this and the above halachot, the Ra'avad writes:<br>This is [the Rambam's] opinion. I am not aware of his source... According to the opinion in the Talmud which states that it was not originally consecrated for eternity, no differentiation was made between the Temple, Jerusalem, and the remainder of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>...<br>Even R. Yossi who maintains that the second consecration consecrated the land for eternity made that statement only in regard to the remainder of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and not in regard to the Temple and Jerusalem.<br>Ezra knew that ultimately [the status] of the Temple and Jerusalem would ultimately change and that they would be eternally consecrated by God's glory [in the Messianic age]. Hence, he did not consecrate it when consecrating the remainder of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>The above was revealed to me, [as it is said:] "The secrets of God [are conveyed] to those who fear Him."<br></i><br>In contrast, the [original] obligation to keep the laws of the Sabbatical year and tithes on the Land stemmed from the fact that it was conquered by the [Jewish people, as a] community.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, lands that were conquered by only a certain portion of the Jewish community, for example, Syria, were not bound by these laws.</i> Therefore, when the land was taken from their hands [by the Babylonians,] their [original] conquest was nullified. Thus, according to Torah law, the land was freed from the obligations of the Sabbatical year and of tithes because it was no longer <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">After the Babylonians conquered <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and exiled the people, the sanctity of the land was nullified. There was no obligation to keep any of the agricultural laws that apply in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> during the seventy years of the Babylonian exile.</i><br>When Ezra returned [to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>] and consecrated it, it was not sanctified by means of conquest, but rather through <i>Chazzakah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chazzakah</i> is a manifestation of ownership. It is accepted by Torah law as one of the certain formal acts of contract which acknowledge the transfer of property from one person to another.</i> Therefore, every place which was repossessed by the [exiles returning from] Babylon and consecrated when Ezra consecrated [the land] the second time, is sacred today.<br>Thus, as explained in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i>, it is necessary to keep the laws of the Sabbatical years and the tithes [on this land] even though it was taken from [the Jewish people in later years].<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishnah</i> finds these statements difficult to accept because of the following questions:<br>a) On what basis is <i>Chazzakah</i> considered a more effective means of acquisition than conquest?<br>b) After the initial conquest of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the Jewish people manifested their ownership over it and thus, effected a <i>Chazzakah</i>. If so, why is Ezra's <i>Chazzakah</i>, which was not preceded by conquest, more effective than the <i>Chazzakah</i> which followed the original conquest? Why should the conquest detract from the consecration of the land?<br>These questions can be explained as follows: The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 5:1) interprets Genesis 15:18: "I have given this land to your seed to mean that from Abraham's time onward <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> became the property of the Jewish people. Though the land was still possessed by the Canaanites, the Jews were already its legal owners. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 119b.<br>Despite this claim of ownership, the sanctity of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> came about only after the Jewish people entered the land, after the redemption from Egypt. At that time, they were commanded to conquer the land and take it forcefully from the Gentiles (See Numbers 32:29, Deuteronomy 3:21, etc.) Since God made the consecration of the land dependent on its conquest by Israel, it follows that conquest by a Gentile nation can nullify that holiness.<br>In contrast, Ezra was not commanded to reconquer <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, but to settle it. In this instance, God made the sanctity of the land dependent on the Jewish people manifesting their ownership over the land which had been given to them as an eternal inheritance. Since <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> remains our land, regardless of how many times it has been conquered by Gentiles, the sanctity effected by that manifestation of ownership is also eternal.

The entire land of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is more sanctified than all other lands. How is its holiness expressed?<br>The <i>Omer</i> offering, the two loaves (offered on Shavuot), and the first fruits must be brought from its [territory] and cannot be brought from other lands.
<i>Eretz Yisrael</i> has ten gradations of holiness, each higher than the preceding level. The cities which are surrounded by a wall are holier than the rest of the Land.<br>[How is this holiness expressed?]<br>Those afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i> are sent out of [these cities].<br>A corpse cannot be buried inside them until the entire city or its seven chosen representatives agree.<br>If a corpse has been taken outside a city, it should not be returned, even though all of the inhabitants are willing.<br>If the inhabitants of a city desire to disinter [a corpse] and remove it from the country, they may. The graves [of any individual] may be disinterred except for those of a king or of a prophet.<br>[The following rules apply in the case of a grave which was originally placed outside a city. Afterwards, the city grew in size to the point where] it surrounded the grave on all four sides, or merely on two sides which faced each other. If [originally,] there was more than 50 cubits between the grave and the city on either side, [the corpse] cannot be disinterred from the grave until every inhabitant of the city agrees. If a smaller distance [had originally been left,] it may be removed.
Jerusalem is holier than other walled cities. We must eat the sacrifices of lesser sanctity and the second tithes within its walls.<br>[Because of this holiness], the following [restrictions] were enacted in regard to Jerusalem:<br>No corpse is left within [its boundaries] overnight.<br>Human bones may not be transported within it.<br>Homes cannot be rented within it.<br>A resident alien may not be given the opportunity to settle in the city.<br>No graves may remain within [its boundaries] except for the graves of the House of David and the grave of Chuldah, the prophetess, which were there from the days of the first prophets.<br>We should not plant gardens or orchards within the city.

No trees may be maintained within it, except for a rose garden which was there from the days of the first prophets.<br>We may not maintain a garbage dump there, because of creeping animals.<br>We may not [build] balconies or protrusions extending into the public domain because of <i>Tumat Ohel</i>.<br>We may not create furnaces within it because of the smoke.<br>We may not raise chickens within it, because they may cause ritually pure articles [to become impure]. Similarly, a priest may not raise chickens throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, because they cause ritually pure articles [to become impure].<br>A house in the city which is sold is never designated as the permanent property of the buyer.<br>A house in the city is never designated as leprous.<br>It cannot be judged as an "apostate city."<br>An <i>Eglah Arufah</i> is never brought from it.<br>[The latter four statements apply] because [Jerusalem] was never divided among the tribes.
The Temple Mount is holier than [the city of Jerusalem]. <i>Zavim, Zavot, Niddot</i>, and women who have given birth may not enter there. [However,] a corpse may be brought into the Temple Mount and one has contracted ritual impurity from a corpse may definitely enter there.
The <i>chayl</i> is holier than the Temple Mount. Gentiles and those who contracted impurity through contact with a corpse or engaging in sexual relations with a <i>Niddah</i> may not enter there.
The Women's Courtyard is holier than the <i>chayl</i>.

According to Torah law, such a person may enter the camp of the Levites.

Thus, with this terminology, the Mishnah (<i>Kelim, loc. cit.</i>, and the Rambam are referring to a priest involved in the Temple service.<br>The above statement can be compared with <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 2:2, where the Rambam writes:<br>All the priests were warned not to enter the Sanctuary or the Holy of Holies except when involved in the Temple service as [Leviticus 16:2] states: "Let him not enter the Sanctuary at all times, [to] the chamber of the <i>Parochet</i>." ["The Sanctuary"] refers to the Holy of Holies, "the chamber of the <i>Parochet</i>," to the entire Temple building.<br></i>
The chamber of the Holy of Holies is holier than it.

Chapter 8

There is a positive mitzvah to guard the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam (<i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, positive commandment 22) and the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 388) list this as one of the 613 commandments.</i> [This mitzvah applies] even though there is no fear of enemies or thieves, for the guarding [of the Temple] is an expression of respect for it. A palace with guards is [much more impressive] than a palace without guards.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions another reason for guarding the Temple: to prevent those who are forbidden to enter from entering.<br>The place where both the Mishnah and the Rambam describe the watch which the priests and the Levites kept over the Temple has aroused the attention of the commentaries: The Mishnah repeats its description of the watch in two places: at the beginning of the tractate of <i>Tamid</i>, which relates the order of the priests' service, and the beginning of the tractate of <i>Middot</i>, which defines the structure of the Temple. The Rambam describes this mitzvah in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>, which describes the construction of the Temple, but not the details of the priests' service.<br>On this basis, the commentaries explain, we can understand two dimensions implicit in this mitzvah:<br>a) The priests' responsibility to prevent those forbidden to enter from entering; and<br>b) The responsibility incumbent on the entire Jewish people to construct and maintain the Temple in the most fitting manner.<br>Since the presence of guards enhances the glory of the Sanctuary, the mitzvah of guarding the Sanctuary can be seen as an aspect of its very structure. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 13, p. 56-65.</i>
The mitzvah of guarding [the Temple] applies throughout the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary to <i>Tamid</i>, the Ra'avad states that the priests and Levites also stood watch during the day. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> mentions that view, explaining that the Rambam explained that the reason for the priestly watch was to show deference to the Temple during the day as well. Just as a palace of an earthly king is guarded both at day and at night, so too, it is proper to keep watch over the Temple in this manner.<br>Nevertheless, the <i>Tifferet Yisrael</i> (<i>Middot</i> 1:1) explains that since the priests were involved in the Temple service throughout the entire day, that in itself is a clear sign of honor and respect to the Temple, and no further measures were necessary.<br>This view is supported by the commentary of the Rabbenu Asher at the beginning of the tractate of <i>Tamid</i>. He explains that the reason for keeping watch over the Temple was to have our attention focused on it at all times. That purpose is surely accomplished by the Temple service, and hence, watchmen are not required then.<br>Accordingly, it appears that the watch would be maintained until the service in the Temple began, with the removal of the Altar's ashes at dawn. Thus, we can understand the last halachah of this chapter, which deals with the preparation of the Sanctuary for the service of the following day, as describing the final aspects of the nightly watch. See <i>Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.</i></i><br>The priests and Levites shall serve as guards,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The places where the priests and Levites kept watch are described in Halachot 4-9.</i> as [Numbers 18:2] states: "And you and your sons [shall be] before the tent of the testimony,"<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This verse begins: "And the Lord said to Aaron," thus, indicating the responsibility of Aaron and his sons, the priests, to keep watch over the Sanctuary.</i> i.e., you shall keep watch over it. Also, [<i>ibid.</i> 18:4] states: "And they [the Levites] shall watch over the Tent of Meeting,"<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Indicating that the Levites were also charged with that responsibility.</i> and [<i>ibid.</i> 3:38] states: "And Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A Levite.</i> Aharon, and his sons<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Priests.</i> shall camp before the Sanctuary towards the east, and they will be the guardians of the holy watch."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, this verse indicates that the task was shared by the Priests and Levites together (<i>Tamid</i> 26a).<br>It must be noted that, in order to emphasize the concept he wishes to communicate, the Rambam does not quote the latter verse exactly.</i>
Anyone who nullifies this watch transgress a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">(<i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 67) and the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 391) list this as one of the 613 commandments.</i> as [Numbers 18:5] states: "And you shall take care to keep the Holy Watch." Any form of the verb, <i>shemar</i>, "take care," implies a warning against transgressing a negative command.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Menachot</i> 36b.</i><br>Thus, guarding [the Temple fulfills] a positive command and nullifying its watch [represents the violation of] a negative command.
The mitzvah of guarding [the Temple] is [as follows:] The priests stood guard from the inside and the Levites from the outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">According to the simple meaning "inside" and "outside" refer to the Temple Courtyard. The Levites stood guard outside the Courtyard and the priests, inside. However, the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> renders "inside" as within a building, and "outside" as in the open.</i> 24 groups of guards stood watch over it continuously, each night, in 24 [different] places.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tamid</i> 27a explains the derivation of this practice as I Chronicles  26:17-18), which states:<br>To the east there were six Levites, to the north, four..., to the south, four..., towards Assupin, two and two. At Parber to the west, there were four at the winding stairway and two at the Parber.<br>Thus, there were a total of twenty-four guard positions. Even though this verse describes the watch over the Sanctuary constructed in David's time, and not the Temple itself, the same basic pattern was followed in the later structure.</i> The priests stood guard in three places<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As described in the following three Halachot.<br>Although the above verse specifically mentions Levites, the priests are sometimes (e.g., Ezekiel 44:15  referred to as Levites (<i>Tamid, loc. cit.</i>).<br><i>Tamid</i> 26a offers two different explanations why the priests would be placed in three different positions. The first explains that the command to keep watch over the Sanctuary was originally given to Aharon and his sons, a total of three individuals.

There, the Rambam writes that the roofs and upper floors of the structures in the Temple Courtyard were not consecrated. This is very significant, for were they to have been consecrated, it would have been forbidden for the priests to sit or lie there, as stated in Chapter 7, Halachah 6.</i> The young priests kept watch there.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Tamid</i> 27a, the term, "young priests," refers to youth who were too young to participate in the Temple services. According to the Ra'avad, these youth were not even thirteen years of age.<br>The <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> rejects that opinion, declaring that this Mitzvah would not be entrusted to children that young. He explains that until the age of twenty, priests were not granted the opportunity to take part in the Temple services. Thus, the "young priests" were youth below that age, but past majority. See also the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i>.</i><br>The Chamber of the Hearth was a large, domed structure,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachot 10 and 11.</i> surrounded [on the inside] with projections of stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, half of the Chamber of the Hearth was considered consecrated, while half was not.

Each served in the Temple for a week, and then another watch was given a chance to serve. There was a set pattern of rotation.<br>Within these watches, there were further subdivisions. Each weekly watch was broken down into six daily watches for each day of the week.

This change is made on the basis of <i>Middot</i> 1:9, which states that the keys to the Temple Courtyard were kept on a special ring in the Chamber of the Hearth.</i>
The priests on watch did not sleep<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's statements, it appears that the priests would be permitted to sleep while on guard duty. This is difficult to accept, for the following reasons:<br>a) The purpose for posting guards around the Temple was to show respect. That objective is not fulfilled by sleeping.<br>b) Halachah 10, which quotes <i>Middot</i> 1:2, states that the guards would be punished for sleeping while on duty. Although the Rambam and the Mishnah specifically mention "Levites," it is reasonable to assume that term was used because the majority of the guards were Levites.<br>For these reasons, the <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> explains that all of the guards were not required to remain awake the entire night. Rather, at any particular time, there would be one or two guards awake at each station and the others were permitted to sleep.</i> in the priestly garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the four priestly garments which an ordinary priest was required to wear while serving in the Temple.</i> Instead, they folded them, placed them at their heads,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The priests could not place their priestly garments under their heads to serve as pillows, for they were forbidden to derive benefit from them. See <i>Yoma</i> 69a.<br>In his commentary to <i>Tamid</i>, Chapter 1, Mishnah 1, the Rambam explains that this prohibition was instituted because the priestly garments contained <i>Sha'atnez</i>, a mixture of linen and wool. Hence, though a priest was permitted to use them during the Temple service, once that service was concluded, he was forbidden to do so. See also the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i> and wore their own clothes.<br>They slept on the ground. It is customary for all those who stand watch over the courtyards of kings not to sleep on beds.

An overseer was appointed over all the watches of guards.

Although there is no evidence that the Rambam accepts this view, a comparison with the following halachah indicates this possibility.</i> If a guard did not stand before him and greet him: "Peace be unto you, officer of the Temple Mount," he would assume that he was sleeping, and would strike him with his staff.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 7, Halachah 2, states that it was forbidden to enter the Temple Mount with a staff. Nevertheless, an exception was made to allow "the officer of the Temple Mount" to perform his task (<i>Yeriot Shlomo</i>).</i> He was even granted permission to burn [a sleeping guard's] clothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Although generally, one may not destroy things of value (<i>bal tashchit</i>), an exception is made in this case to allow the Temple to be guarded properly.<br>The "officer of the Temple Mount" could be authorized to destroy private property on the basis of the principle: <i>Hefker Beit Din, Hefker</i>, i.e., a Jewish court may forfeit a person's ownership over an article (Rabbenu Asher, Commentary to <i>Middot</i> 1:1).<br>The <i>Ezrat Kohanim</i> does not accept this explanation because the prohibition against destroying things of value applies even in regard to ownerless articles.<br>Another possible explanation is that this step is taken for the watchmen's own good. A father or a teacher is allowed to hit a student to shape his character. Similarly, in this instance, "the officer of the Temple Mount" was entitled to burn a watchman's clothing so that he will perform his task more effectively (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 18, p.465).</i><br>Thus, it was commonly said in Jerusalem: "What is the noise in the Temple Courtyard [at night]? It must be the voice of a Levite being beaten and his clothes burned because he slept on his watch."<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the commentary to Halachah 6, there is a debate among the Rabbis if the priests were allowed to sleep on their watch or not. Rav Ovadiah of Bartinura (<i>Shekalim</i> 5:1) states that both priests and Levites would be beaten for sleeping. However, the <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> argues that this punishment was only administered to Levites.<br>It would appear that the Rambam subscribes to the latter view. In <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> (7:4), he writes: "The officer of the Temple Mount walked around, [checking on] the Levites..."</i>

It would appear more appropriate to mention them in <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i>, where the laws governing the daily service in the Temple are described. Indeed, we find that these laws are repeated there.<br>The reason is based on the explanation of Halachah 1. There, the Rambam states that the watch kept over the Temple was an act of deference, enhancing the glory of the Temple. Thus, maintaining that the watch is part of the responsibility of the entire Jewish people to construct and maintain the Temple in the most fitting manner.<br>A similar principle can be explained in regard to this inspection of the Courtyard. Over and above the need for checking to see that all the sacred utensils were in there appropriate positions, this inspection was an act of deference and honor which enhanced the importance of the Temple (Likkutei Sichot, Vol. 18, p. 244-249).</i>

The Rambam states (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:27) that all Rabbinic prohibitions of this nature were suspended in the Temple.<br>Among the explanations offered are: Since it was possible to use candles which were lit before the Sabbath, there is no need to violate even a Rabbinic prohibition. Alternatively, this inspection was carried out in preparation for the service of the entire day to follow and, as above, it was an act of deference to the Temple. Therefore, to emphasize the holiness of the Temple, it was proper that it be carried out without violating any prohibition whatsoever.<br>The structure of the final chapter of <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> can be explained homiletically: It begins with the obligation to guard the Temple at night, and concludes with the preparations for the Temple services at dawn.<br>As mentioned above (Halachah 2), the commentaries explain that the mitzvah of guarding the Temple was instituted so that the Temple would be prominent in our minds at all times. Thus, during the day, there was no necessity to stand guard, for that purpose was accomplished by the Temple service. However, at night, when there was no service, we were required to keep a watch around the Temple.<br>The period of exile is often described as night and the advent of the Messianic era, as dawn. By guarding the Temple at night, and studying the laws of its construction during the exile, we will merit the coming of the dawn, the coming of Mashiach.<br>A similar idea can be seen in the last halachah, which deals with the priests' procedure on the Sabbath. The Sabbath is described as <i>me'ein olam haba'ah</i>, a microcosm of the world to come, and the time of the coming of the <i>Mashiach</i>. On the Sabbath, in the Messianic age, the preparations for the Temple service will be carried out with the light kindled on the Sabbath eve, representing the present age - and before the coming of the Mashiach. Our service at present generates spiritual light. We will use that light to prepare for the sacrifices to be offered in the Third Temple.<br>May we merit the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of the Temple speedily, and in our days. 47Then, shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and former years 48 (Malachi 3:4 .</i>
