Mishneh Torah, The Chosen Temple



Chapter 1



Chapter 2

The altar is in a very precise location, which may never be changed, as it is said "This is the altar for the burnt offerings of Israel." (Divre HaYamim II 22:1) Yitzchak was prepared as a sacrifice on the Temple's site, as it said "Go to the land of Moriah," (Bereshit 22:2) and in Divre HaYamim II 3:1, it is said: "Then, Shelomo began to build the House of the Lord in Jerusalem, on Mt. Moriah, where the Lord appeared to David, his father, in the place that David had prepared, in the threshing floor of Ornan, the Jebusite."
It is universally accepted that the place on which David and Shlomo built the altar, the threshing floor of Ornan, is the location where Avraham built the altar on which he prepared Yitzchak for sacrifice. Noach built on that location when he left the ark. It was also the altar on which Cain and Abel brought sacrifices. Adam, the first man, offered a sacrifice there and was created at that very spot, as our Sages said: "Man was created from the place where he would find atonement."
