Mishneh Torah, Sacrifices Rendered Unfit



Chapter 1

All persons disqualified from performing sacrificial service<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A non-priest or a priest who was disqualified for various reasons. See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 9:15 for a detailed list of such individuals.</i> may slaughter sacrificial animals, even sacrifices of the most sacred order, as an initial preference,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The wording of <i>Zevachim</i> 3:1 (the source for this ruling) could be interpreted as implying that the slaughter is acceptable only after the fact. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (based on <i>Zevachim</i> 31b), the Rambam explains that this restriction applies only to a person who is ritually impure.</i> with the exception of a person who is ritually impure, who may not slaughter as an initial preference. Even though he stands outside the Temple Courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">And thus does not violate the prohibition against entering the Temple Courtyard while ritually impure (see <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 3:6).</i> and inserts his hands and slaughters in the Courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Where the sacrificial animals must be slaughtered. As stated in <i>ibid.</i> 3:18, it is forbidden for an impure person to insert his hand into the Temple Courtyard according to Rabbinic Law. Nevertheless, this person was willing to transgress. Significantly, in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) the Rambam offers an interpretation that does not require that the person transgress: he slaughtered with a long knife.</i> [he was restricted]. This a decree, lest he touch the [sacrificial] meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance he would make the sacrifice impure and disqualify it. That is forbidden.</i>
If [an impure person] transgressed and slaughtered [a sacrificial animal], the sacrifice is acceptable. Similarly, with regard to the bull [brought by] the High Priest on Yom Kippur even though [Leviticus 16:11] states: "And Aaron... shall slaughter [the bull],"<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Seemingly, implying that the slaughter must be performed by a High Priest. Nevertheless, Aaron's name is explicitly associated with the verb <i>vihikriv,</i> "and he shall offer." According to the Rambam, the verse should be interpreted as meaning that the offering of the bull must be performed by the High Priest, not necessarily its slaughter.</i> if a non-priest slaughtered it, it is acceptable. Even a red heifer that was slaughtered by a non-priest is acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, as an initial preference, the slaughter should be performed by a priest (<i>Hilchot Parah Adumah</i> 3:2; 4:17).</i> for there is no slaughter by a non-priest that invalidates [a sacrifice].
When a person slaughters sacrificial animals, but does not have the intent to slaughter them, but instead, is merely busying himself [thoughtlessly], they are disqualified. [He must] have the intent to slaughter them.
One should not slaughter the heads of two sacrificial animals at the same time.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., using a long knife so that the two are slaughtered with the same movements of the knife.</i> If one slaughtered [in this manner], the sacrifices are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after the fact. This applies only with regard to sacrificial animals. Ordinary animals may be sacrificed in this manner as an initial preference. See <i>Chullin</i> 29a.</i>
Two people may slaughter a sacrificial animal together, just as they may slaughter an ordinary animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 2:10.</i>
A minor may not slaughter sacrificial animals even if an adult is standing over him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Such slaughter is acceptable for ordinary animals after the fact (<i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 4:5).</i> [The rationale is that the slaughter of] sacrificial animals requires concentrated intent and a minor does not have such a potential. Even when [a minor's] deeds indicate that he is acting with intention, [he is] not considered [to have acted] with intention if that will produce a leniency,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is a principle applicable in many different contexts of Jewish Law, e.g., <i>Hilchot Tuma'at Ochalin</i> 3:10, 14:2; <i>Hilchot Keilim</i> 2:1.</i> only if it will produce a stringency.<br>What is implied? If [an animal to be sacrificed as] a burnt-offering was standing in the southern [portion of the Temple Courtyard] and a minor led it and brought it to the north where he slaughtered it - thus his actions indicate that he intended to slaughter a sacred animal<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For burnt-offerings may only be slaughtered in the northern portion of the Temple Courtyard (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:2-3). Thus he obviously had the intent to slaughter the animal as a burnt offering.</i> - [the sacrifice] is still disqualified.
When sacrifices of the most sacred order were slaughtered in the southern [portion of the Temple Courtyard] or their blood was received there, they are disqualified.
If one was standing in the southern [portion of the Temple Courtyard], but he extended his hands into the northern portion and slaughtered [a sacrifice of the most sacred order], his slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 48b interprets Leviticus 1:11 as implying that what is significant is the place where the animal is standing and not where the slaughterer is standing.</i>
If, [by contrast, a priest] was standing in the southern [portion of the Temple Courtyard], but he extended his hands into the northern portion and received the blood [of such a sacrificial animal], his receiving of the blood is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim, op. cit.</i>, interprets the above verse as implying that with regard to the receiving of the blood, what is important is where the person performing that act is standing.</i>
If he brings his head and the majority of his body into the northern [portion of the Temple Courtyard], it is considered as if he was standing there.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This reflects a general principle of Torah Law: the majority of a person's body is considered as his entire body (Rav Yosef Corcus).</i>
If one slaughtered [such an animal] in the northern portion [of the Temple Courtyard] and then in the convulsive movements that accompanied its death, it moved to the southern portion or even if [a priest] took it to the southern portion, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For the slaughter was performed in the appropriate place.</i> If after these convulsive movements took it to the southern portion and then it returned to the northern portion and its blood was received there, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that between the slaughter and the receiving of the blood, it entered the southern portion of the courtyard does not disqualify it.</i><br>Similarly, if [animals to be slaughtered as] sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity were inside [the Temple Courtyard]<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Where it is required that they be slaughtered (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:4).</i> and one was standing outside the Temple Courtyard and inserted his hand inside and slaughtered it, his slaughter is acceptable.
If, [while standing outside the Temple Courtyard, a priest] inserted his hand inside and received the blood, the receiving of the blood is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For the blood must be received in the Temple Courtyard.</i> Even if [the entire body of the priest] performing the service was inside [the Temple Courtyard], and his locks of hair<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is necessary, because we are speaking of a portion of the person's body and not his garments. See Ezekiel 8:3 for a similar usage.</i> were outside, his service is unacceptable, for [when describing the priests' service in the Temple, Leviticus 10:9] states: "When you come to the Tent of Meeting."<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, <i>Zevachim</i> 26a, the source for this law, uses a different prooftext. Some commentaries have suggested that perhaps a printing error crept into the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i> Implied is that one must enter in his entirety.
If in the convulsive movements that accompanied its death, [such an] animal moved out of [the Courtyard] after its blood was received,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is that if an animal moved out of the Temple Courtyard before its blood was received, it is disqualified.</i> it is acceptable. For even if the organs and fats to be offered on the altar, and the meat of sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, were taken outside [the Courtyard] before [the blood] was presented [on the altar], the sacrifice is acceptable, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 32-33 of this chapter.</i>
If the entire body of [such an] animal was inside the Temple Courtyard and its foot was outside and it was slaughtered, the sacrifice is unacceptable. For [when speaking of bringing the sacrifices, Leviticus 17:5] states: "And they shall be brought to God." Implied is that they should be entirely within [the Courtyard].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 18:15.</i>
If one slaughtered [a sacrificial animal]<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">From the sacrifices of the most sacred order.</i> while it was located entirely in [the Temple Courtyard], and afterwards, it moved one of its feet outside, he should cut off the meat until he reaches the bone,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">He should not, however, cut off the bone, because that would render the animal as blemished before the reception of the blood and thus disqualify it (see <i>Zevachim</i> 26a and commentaries).</i> and afterwards, the blood should be received. If he received the blood and afterwards, cut off the meat, it is disqualified because of the fat of the meat that is outside [the Temple Courtyard].<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by <i>Zevachim, op. cit.</i>, the problem is not because of the blood from the meat that was outside the Temple Courtyard, because our Sages made a distinction between the blood that flows from the animal at the time of ritual slaughter and the blood that remains within its body (see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 6:4). Nevertheless, the fat from the portion of the animal that is outside the Temple Courtyard becomes mixed with its blood. This blood could also be part of the blood which is received, causing that blood to be disqualified (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that sacrificial animals of the highest degree of sanctity become disqualified when they are removed from the Temple Courtyard whether before the blood was presented on the altar or afterwards. Moreover, even if the meat is cut off as the Rambam suggests, the animal will become ritually impure, because there is an unresolved doubt whether our Sages decreed that any animal that is removed from the Temple Courtyard becomes ritually impure. Hence, because of the doubt, we should rule stringently (see <i>Pesachim</i> 85a). The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and Rav Yosef Corcus resolve the Rambam's ruling.</i><br>With regard to sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, there is no need to cut off [the meat]. Instead, he should bring its foot back inside [the Temple Courtyard], and receive the blood. For [even] if meat from sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity were taken out [of the Temple Courtyard] before their blood was cast [on the altar], [the sacrifice] is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Provided of course that the animal was returned to the Temple Courtyard, and the blood received there. Even if a portion of the animal was outside the Courtyard, as long as the blood was received inside the Temple Courtyard, the sacrifice is not disqualified. Nevertheless, the portion that was outside the Temple Courtyard is forbidden to be eaten (see Halachah 32).<br>The Ra'avad states that after the blood was cast on the altar, the meat may be taken out of the Temple Courtyard. Rav Yosef Corcus states that this is obvious, because the meat of sacrifices of a less degree of sanctity may be eaten throughout the city of Jerusalem (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 11:5-6).</i>
If one hung the animal [above the earth] and slaughtered it in the free space of the Temple Courtyard, it is unacceptable, for [Leviticus 1:11] speaks [of slaughtering animals] "on the flank of the altar," implying that one must slaughter on the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Zevachim</i> 26a, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this halachah as referring only to sacrifices of the most sacred order. (This is reflected also in the prooftext which refers to such a sacrifice.) Sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, by contrast, may be slaughtered if they are hoisted in the air, as long as they are within the space above the Temple Courtyard.</i>
If the [sacrificial] animal was on the ground, but [the slaughterer] was hanging in the air and he slaughtered the animal while hanging, this disqualifies sacrifices of the most sacred order. Sacrifices of lesser sanctity, by contrast, are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Zevachim, op. cit.</i>, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> - and his objections are also seconded by Rav Yosef Corcus - suggests emending the text of this halachah. As stated in Halachah 19, there is a difficulty in receiving the blood of a sacrifice while hanging in the air, because this is not befitting to the Temple service. Nevertheless, slaughtering an animal is not a formal part of the Temple service (and hence can be performed by a non-priest). Therefore there is no difficulty in performing it while hoisted in the air. And as stated in Halachah 20, the open space of the Temple Courtyard is considered as the Temple Courtyard, so it is as if the slaughterer is standing in the Temple Courtyard.</i>
If one slit the lesser portion of the organs that must be slit for ritual slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The windpipe and the gullet.</i> outside [the Temple Courtyard],<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For an animal to be sacrificed as a sacrifice of a lesser degree of sanctity.</i> and one completed the slaughter inside or one slit the lesser portion of the organs<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Of an animal to be slaughtered as a sacrifice of the most sacred order.</i> in the southern portion of [the Temple Courtyard], and completed the slaughter in the north, they are unacceptable. For ritual slaughter is considered as one continuous, integral act from the beginning to its completion.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 4:13 for another application of this principle.</i>
If one was hung and received the blood from the neck of a [sacrificial] animal<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This applies both with regard to sacrifices of the most sacred order and those of a lesser degree of sanctity.</i> that is located on the ground, [the act] is unacceptable, because this is not the manner of Temple service.
If one was standing in the Temple Courtyard and hung a receptacle over his arm and received the blood in the air, or lifted the animal and thus received the blood in the air, [the act] is acceptable, for the open space above the place is considered as the space itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the animal's blood is considered to have been received in the Temple Courtyard.</i>
If one placed one receptacle within a second receptacle and received the blood, [the act] is acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">It is considered as if one was holding the receptacle in which the blood was received in one's hands.</i> one substance is not considered as an interposing substance for another substance of the same type.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle, applying in several areas of Torah Law (e.g., <i>Hilchot Shofar Sukkah ViLulav</i> 1:5; 7:12).</i> If one placed fibers inside the receptacle and received the blood, [the act] is acceptable, because the fibers are porous and thus the blood descends into the receptacle and there is no interference. If, however, one does this while taking a handful of flour from a meal offering and took the handful with the fibers, it is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The difference is that the blood will flow through the fibers, but the flour will not.</i>
Receiving the blood [of a sacrificial animal], bringing it to the altar, casting it on the altar and bringing the limbs [of a sacrificial animal] to the ramp, are all tasks<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are considered integral parts of the process of offering a sacrifice and therefore require a priest's involvement.</i> that are only acceptable if performed by a priest who is fit to perform service, as we explained with regard to taking the handful of flour from a meal offering<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:23; 13:12.</i> or snipping of the head of a fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that this refer to <i>ibid.</i>, ch. 6. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> states that he does not understand where in that chapter there is an allusion to the need for a priest to perform that service.</i>
Bringing [blood or limbs] to the altar in a way other than walking is not considered as bringing them. Therefore if a priest<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The standard published text states <i>kohen gadol</i>. Translating that term as "the High Priest" would not be appropriate in the present context. Some have suggested that the intent is a large priest, but most consider it a printing error. However, see Likkutei Sichos, Vol. 7, p. 205, where an explanation is given that justifies the wording <i>kohen gadol</i>.</i> receives the blood [and while] standing in that place, casts it on the altar, the sacrifice is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the blood was cast on the appropriate place.</i>
If [the priest] received [the blood] with his right hand and then transferred [the receptacle in which he received] it to his left hand, he should return it to his right hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">And continue the service with it. If he received the blood while holding the receptacle with his left hand, the sacrifice is disqualified.</i> If he received [the blood] with an ordinary utensil, the sacrifice is disqualified. If he received it in a sacred receptacle and transferred it to an ordinary receptacle, he should return it to a sacred receptacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">He may then continue the service; the sacrifice is not disqualified.</i>
If [the blood] spilled out of the receptacle on to the floor [of the Temple Courtyard, the sacrifice] is acceptable if one gathers up [the blood].<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Since initially it was received in the proper manner, the fact that it spilled is not considered significant.</i> If, however, it spilled out from the neck of the [sacrificial] animal to the floor, and then was collected and placed in a sacred receptacle, the sacrifice is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since initially, it was not received in the proper manner.</i>
If some of the blood from the neck of the [sacrificial] animal was spilled on the ground and not collected, but [a priest] received the remainder from the neck of the animal, [the sacrifice] is acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">For, after the fact, it is not necessary to receive all of the animal's blood (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). This is, however, the initial preference (see <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 4:8).</i> provided the blood that was received is [the animal's] lifeblood<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 6:3, the Rambam defines this term as "blood that flows out [from the animal] when it is slaughtered, killed, or decapitated as long as it is tinted red." See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Keritot</i> 5:1).</i> and not blood concentrated [in the limbs]<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Blood that flows slowly after the majority of the animal's blood has already been discharged. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> or the blood of the skin.
If any of the individuals who are unacceptable to perform Temple service<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">A non-priest or a priest who was disqualified. See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 9:15.</i> receive the blood [of a sacrificial animal], bring the blood to the altar, or cast it on the altar as required by law,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Once sacrificial blood has been cast on the altar as required by law, the blood remaining in the receptacle is considered merely as remnants and it is no longer able to be used to fulfill the service associated with this sacrifice.<br>One might object because, from Halachah 28, it appears that a person who is unfit to carry out Temple service does not cause the remainder of the blood to be considered as remnants. Hence, in the situation at hand, it would appear that if there is sufficient blood left in the receptacle, the sacrifice should not be disqualified. A distinction can however be made between Halachah 28 which speaks about blood that remains in the body of the sacrificial animal and this situation where the blood is remaining in the receptacle from which other blood was taken (<i>Tosafot, Zevachim</i> 92a). If the blood was not cast on the altar as required by law, the sacrifice is not disqualified and it is acceptable if that service is performed properly by an acceptable priest (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> the sacrifice is disqualified. If [a priest] who is acceptable for such service receives the blood and gives it to one who is unacceptable, but the latter does not walk with it, but instead stands in his place, he should return it to the acceptable [priest].<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Who should then bring it to the altar. The fact that the person who was unacceptable held it does not disqualify the sacrifice.</i> If, however, the unacceptable person carried it [toward the altar] and then returned it to the acceptable [priest] who carried it [to the altar] or the acceptable priest carried it [to the altar] and then gave it to the unacceptable one who carried it, since it was carried by the unacceptable person, whether at the beginning or the end, the sacrifice is disqualified, because this matter cannot be corrected.
[The following laws apply if] the blood was received by an unacceptable person. If any of [the animal's] lifeblood remains, an acceptable [priest] should receive the blood, bring it [to the altar], and cast [it upon it]. [The rationale is that] individuals who are unacceptable for Temple service do not cause the remainder of the blood to be considered as remnants.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">With which the service may not be performed.</i><br>An exception is one who is impure. Since he is fit to carry out Temple service when a sacrifice is brought in a state of impurity as explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 4:10.</i> he causes [the blood to be considered as] remnants. What is implied? If an impure [priest] received<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that the intent is that the impure priest received the blood and cast it on the altar. Receiving the blood alone does not disqualify the animal. He bases his interpretation on <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i>3:2-3 where this concept is stated explicitly. In this manner, he resolves the Ra'avad's objections to the Rambam's ruling.</i> the blood [of a sacrificial animal] even if an acceptable [priest] received [the animal's] lifeblood afterwards and cast it [upon the altar], the sacrifice is disqualified. For [the blood] received by the acceptable [priest] afterwards is considered as remnants and is of no consequence.
When even the slightest substance is taken from one of the [sacrificial] animal's limbs<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in a manner which would cause the animal to be disqualified as physically blemished. See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i>, ch. 7, for a list of such blemishes.</i> after it was slaughtered, but before its blood was cast upon the altar, it is disqualified. Even if one [merely] mutilated the ear of an animal before [its blood] was received, it is as if [its blood] was not received. [This is derived from Leviticus 16:14 which] states: "And he shall take from the blood of the bull." [Implied is that] it must be entirely whole at the time [the blood] is received. If one received [the blood] of an imperfect [animal] and cast it upon the altar, [the sacrifice] is unacceptable.
If, however, its substance was reduced after [its blood] was received,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Note the gloss of Rabbi Akiva Eiger who maintains that it is possible that it be necessary also to bring the blood to the altar while the animal is whole.</i> before it was cast [on the altar], even if the meat was lost before the blood was cast [on the altar] or it was consumed by fire, he should cast the blood [on the altar] as long as an olive-sized portion of the meat or the organs and fats to be offered on the altar's pyre remain.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">An olive-sized portion is considered significant. If even that small a portion of the meat can be eaten or the organs and fats can be offered on the altar, the purpose of the sacrifice will be consummated. Hence, it is appropriate to cast the blood on the altar.</i> If not even that remains,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The remnants are not considered as significant.</i> he should not cast the blood. With regard to a burnt-offering, even if half an olive-sized portion from the meat and half an olive-sized portion of the organs and fats [remain, he should cast the blood], because the entire [animal] is [offered on the altar's] pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the fat and the meat can be combined.</i>
If less than an olive-sized portion [of a burnt-offering remains], [the blood] should not be cast [on the altar]. If it is cast [upon it], the sacrifice is not received with favor [Above].<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The sacrifice is disqualified and if the person was bringing it to fulfill an obligation, he must bring another one.</i> If the meat<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">And the organs and fat to be offered on the altar.</i> is disqualified before [the blood] is cast on the altar or it was taken out of the Temple Courtyard, the blood should not be cast. If, however, it was cast, the sacrifice is received with favor [Above].<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, casting the blood on the altar is sufficient to cause the sacrifice to be considered acceptable. See also the following halachah.</i>
When the meat of sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity was taken out of the Temple Courtyard before the blood was cast [on the altar], even though the blood was cast [upon the altar] while the meat was outside, the sacrifice is acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the organs and the fats should be offered on the altar and the person bringing the sacrifice is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.</i> because ultimately, the meat will be taken outside [the Temple Courtyard].<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">For sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity may be eaten throughout the city of Jerusalem.</i><br>Casting [the blood on the altar] is effective with regard to [the obligation to have the sacrificial meat] which was taken out [of the Temple Courtyard] burnt,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, when a sacrifice was disqualified, it would have to be burnt immediately. If, however, it was disqualified because of a difficulty with the casting of the blood or because the owners were disqualified, it should be kept until its form decomposes and then it is burnt (Rashi, <i>Me'ilah</i> 7b-8a).</i> but not to have it permitted to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., casting the blood of sacrifices of a lesser degree enables the meat of the animal to be eaten. This applies, however, only when the animal was in the Temple Courtyard at the time the blood was cast on the altar. If not, the sacrifice is acceptable, but the meat may not be eaten (Rav Yosef Corcus). The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (see also Ra'avad) offers a different interpretation, saying the intent could be sacrificial meat taken out of the city of Jerusalem.</i>
Similarly, when the organs and fats to be offered on the altar from sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity were taken out [of the Temple Courtyard] before their blood [was cast on the altar] and the blood was cast [on the altar] when they were outside, the sacrifice was not disqualified. If they were returned [to the Temple Courtyard], they should be offered on the altar's pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, questioning why these organs and fats should be offered on the altar's pyre. The Rambam's maintains that since the prohibition of <i>me'ilah</i> and the prohibitions mentioned in this halachah apply, the sacrifice is not disqualified. Hence, there is no reason why these organs and fats should not be offered (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>Rav Yosef Corcus avoids this difference of opinion by explaining that this is referring to an instance where the organs and the fats were returned to the Temple Courtyard before the blood was cast upon the altar.

Nevertheless, the reason for this distinction is evident from the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i>: the Paschal sacrifice is offered solely that it be eaten, while with regard to other sacrifices there is a positive dimension to the offering of the fats and organs on the altar even if the sacrifice is not eaten.</i> Similarly, when fats and organs to be offered on the altar's pyre or the limbs of a burnt-offering became impure and they were [nonetheless]<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The initial preference is that they should not be offered on the altar.</i> offered on the altar, the High Priest's forehead plate arouses [God's] favor, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 4:7.</i> With regard to any of the communal sacrifices, [even if] all of the meat and fats became impure, the blood should be cast [upon the altar].<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, it is the High Priest's forehead plate that arouses the positive spiritual influences that cause the sacrifice to be accepted. In contrast to individual sacrifices, however, with regard to communal sacrifices, one should cast the blood on the altar as an initial preference even though both the fats and the meat have been disqualified, for the restrictions against ritual impurity are superseded by the obligation to offer communal sacrifices (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>; Rav Yosef Corcus).</i>

Chapter 2

[With regard to the presentation of] the blood from any of the sacrifices on the outer altar: as long as one makes one presentation of blood, atonement is generated.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Although there is a desired manner in which the blood from every sacrifice should be offered on the altar, that is merely the desired manner of fulfilling the mitzvah. After the fact, even one presentation of blood is sufficient.</i> Even with regard to a sin-offering, one presentation is of fundamental importance.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Yosef Corcus explains that the Rambam's intent is that even if the priest did not present the blood of the sin-offering on the corners of the altar at all as required, but rather poured it on the wall of the altar, it is sufficient to bring atonement.</i> Making the remaining [three of] the four [required] presentations is [merely] the optimum manner of fulfilling the mitzvah, as [implied by Deuteronomy 12:27]: "The blood of your sacrifices shall you pour on the altar."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that rather than use the method of exegesis stated in <i>Zevachim</i> 37b, the Rambam quotes a different prooftext. This follows a pattern demonstrated in several other places in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> where the Rambam derives a concept from the apparent meaning of Biblical verses even though the traditional Rabbinic approach is to derive the idea from other sources.</i> [One can infer that one] pouring of blood on the altar is of fundamental importance.
Whenever [a priest] poured [blood] over the altar when he should have cast it upon it,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Casting blood on the altar refers to a situation where a priest stands slightly removed from the altar and casts the blood upon it powerfully. The blood of the burnt offerings, peace offerings, and guilt offerings are presented on the altar in this manner. Pouring the blood on the altar refers to a situation where the priest stands next to the altar and pours the blood gently upon it. The blood of firstborn offerings, tithe offerings, and Paschal sacrifices are presented in this manner.</i> the obligation is fulfilled, as [implied by the verse:] "The blood of your sacrifices shall you pour."
With regard to all of the blood presented on the inner altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the bull and the goat offered on Yom Kippur and the other sin-offerings which are burnt rather than eaten that are mentioned in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 1:5. See <i>ibid.</i> 5:11 for a description of the manner in which the sacrifice was offered.</i> if one of the presentations is lacking, the sacrifice does not bring atonement. Instead, all of them are integral for the atonement, for Scripture was precise with regard to their number, as [Leviticus 4:7, 17; 16:14] states: "seven times."
If the owner died after one of the presentations of the blood of a sin-offering was made, the remainder of the presentations should be made after his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If the owner of a sin-offering dies before even one presentation of the blood was made, the blood should not be presented (see Chapter 4, Halachah 1). If, however, one presentation was made, the sacrifice is fundamentally acceptable, as stated in Halachah 1. Hence the remainder of the presentations should also be made.</i>
If, however, he made one presentation during the day, he should not make the [remaining] three at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For the blood is disqualified at sunset (<i>Zevachim</i> 56a) and hence should not be presented upon the altar. Hence, even though the sacrifice is acceptable, the remaining presentations should not be made.</i>
If one made one [of the presentations of blood required to be made on] the inner altar on [that altar] and made the remainder on the outer [altar], he is liable for [<i>karet</i>] for offering [a sacrifice] outside its appropriate place.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 19:13.</i>
If [a priest] was sprinkling [the blood of a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah uses the term <i>haza'ah</i>, "sprinkling," with regard to the sin-offering of a fowl and the sin-offerings whose blood is offered on the inner altar.</i> on the altar] and his hand was cut off before the blood reached the space above the altar, the sprinkling of the blood is not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For at the time the sprinkling is completed, the priest who performed it was no longer acceptable for Temple service, because of his physical blemish. Even though the blemish did not occur until after the priest completed his activity, the time when the blood reached the altar is most significant. See <i>Zevachim</i> 15a.</i>
If one changed [the order] of corners<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on authoritative manuscripts and early printings. The standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> uses a different version.</i> [of the altar on which the blood was presented when bringing] a sin-offering - whether for a sin-offering [whose blood] is offered on the inner altar<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:12, 14, for a description of the presentation of the blood for these sacrifices.</i> or a sin-offering [whose blood] is offered on the outer altar<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>:10 for a description of the presentation of the blood for these sacrifices.</i> - [the sacrifice] is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Based on Halachah 10, it appears that the intent in this and the following halachah is that the meat of the sacrifice is unacceptable and may not be eaten. Nevertheless, the sacrifice itself is acceptable, since its blood has reached the altar.</i> If, however, [the order of the presentation of the blood] for other sacrifices is changed, [the sacrifices] are acceptable.
If [the priest] presented the blood beyond the corner of the altar - whether for a sin-offering or for another offering and whether for the inner altar or for the outer altar - [the sacrifice] is unacceptable.
When blood that according to [the Torah's] command should have been presented above the midpoint of the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 2:9, there was a scarlet band dividing the upper half of the altar from the lower half.

Rav Yosef Corcus explains that since the ramp is considered as equivalent to the altar in several contexts (see <i>Menachot</i> 57b; <i>Zevachim</i> 87a), after the fact, presenting the blood on it is considered equivalent to presenting it on the altar itself.</i><br>[in all these instances,] the meat of the sacrifice is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since the blood was not offered in its proper place, in this context, it is as if the sacrifice was disqualified and the meat cannot be eaten.

The rationale is that since the blood reached the altar, atonement is granted and another sacrifice is not required.</i> Nevertheless, the owners of the sacrifices receive atonement because of it, for its blood has reached the altar. Although it did not reach the proper place, it is as if it reached its [proper] place with regard to atonement.<br>When does the above apply? When the person casting [the blood] is acceptable for Temple service. If, however, a person fit for Temple service received [the blood] and gave it to a person who is unacceptable and that unacceptable person presented [blood] that should have been presented above [the midpoint] of the altar below its midpoint, [blood] that should have been presented [on the] outer [altar] was presented inside [the Temple Sanctuary], [blood] that should have been presented inside [the Temple Sanctuary] was presented[on the] outer [altar], or one presented [the blood] on the ramp in a place that is not opposite the foundation [of the altar],<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam does not mention all the instances that were mentioned in the first clause, they are all included in this ruling.</i> the meat of the sacrifice is not disqualified if [any of the sacrificial animal's] blood of life remains.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since the casting of the blood is disqualified entirely because the person sprinkling it was unacceptable, it is as if it was not performed at all.

[The following rules apply when] the blood of sacrificial animals becomes mixed between two types of blood<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Blood from two sacrificial animals were mixed into the same cup.</i> or between two cups of blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The blood from two sacrificial animals was collected in separate cups, but it was forgotten in which cup the blood of each sacrificial animal was contained.</i> If [the blood of sacrifices that require] one presentation [of blood] was mixed with [the blood of others that require] one presentation [of blood],<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., the blood of a firstborn offering with the blood of a tithe offering or of a Paschal sacrifice.

Once he departs, he has departed.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the blood of this sacrifice will later be sprinkled in the Sanctuary as well, at the present time, the sprinklings should have been completed in the Holy of Holies. Since that was not done, taking the blood out disqualifies it.<br>The Ra'avad (and similarly, Rashi in his commentary to <i>Zevachim</i> 82b-83a) has a different understanding of the passage on which the Rambam's ruling was based and hence, objects. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offers grounds to justify the Rambam's understanding.</i><br>Similarly, if he completed the sprinklings in the Holy of Holies, then brought the blood into the Sanctuary and made some of the sprinklings [required there], then took [the blood] out of the Sanctuary and afterwards returned it, he should not complete the sprinklings in the Sanctuary. [The rationale is that] since the blood was taken out of its place, it became disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The same rationale applies here as in the previous clause. Rav Yosef Corcus questions why the Rambam rules that the blood has been disqualified. Seemingly, since <i>Zevachim</i> 83a leaves this as an unresolved question, the Rambam should not rule that it is definitely disqualified. He explains that although one of the Sages considered it an unresolved issue, when the entire passage is considered, it would appear that it is not acceptable.</i>
If the blood of an [ordinary] sin-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">That should be offered on the outer altar.</i> was received in two cups and one of them was taken outside, the one that remained inside is acceptable and the sprinklings may be performed.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For as long as a portion of the blood of a sin-offering is offered in the appropriate manner, it is acceptable. Although the blood that was taken out is disqualified, it does not disqualify the blood that remains.</i> If, [by contrast,] one [of the cups] was taken into the Sanctuary and sprinkled there, even the one left outside is disqualified, as [implied by the prooftext] : "whose blood has been brought in," i.e., even if only a portion of its blood was brought in to the Sanctuary to bring about atonement, it is disqualified.
[The following rules apply when] the blood of an [ordinary] sin-offering was taken into [the Sanctuary] to achieve atonement, but nothing was done and instead, he took it out without sprinkling it inside. If he brought it in unknowingly, [the blood] remains acceptable and should be sprinkled outside, for nothing to achieve atonement was done in the Sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is that if it was sprinkled inside, even unknowingly, it is disqualified.</i> If he brought it in intentionally, it is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Even if it was not sprinkled inside. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and Rav Yosef Corcus note that this ruling appears to contradict <i>Zevachim</i> 36a. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> concludes that although the Rambam's ruling can be reconciled with the passage, the resolution still leaves certain points that require explanation.</i>
If the sin-offering itself was brought into the Sanctuary,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Even after the animal was slaughtered and before its blood was received (<i>Zevachim</i> 92b).</i> it is acceptable, because [the prooftext] mentions "whose blood was brought in," [i.e., it is the blood] and not the meat [that disqualifies it].
When a sin-offering of a fowl moved in its death throes and entered the Sanctuary, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This law is mentioned because of the contrast to the law that follows. The prooftext above speaks of a sacrifice being disqualified because its blood was "brought into" the Temple Sanctuary. In this instance, the fowl was not brought in, but rather entered on its own.</i>
If the blood of a sin-offering of a fowl was taken into the Sanctuary in its neck,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the fowl was slaughtered, but the neck was held upright instead of allowing the blood to flow out into a receptacle.</i> there is an unresolved doubt whether its neck is considered a receptacle [which would disqualify the sacrifice].<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For when the blood of a sin-offering is brought into the Temple sanctuary in a utensil, it is disqualified, as stated in Halachah 13.</i>
If the blood of a sin-offering of a fowl<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to a parallel situation concerning a sin-offering of an animal, see Chapter 1, Halachah 25.</i> was spilled<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Unto the floor of the Temple Courtyard.</i> and then collected,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Into a receptacle. The blood of a fowl should be squeezed from the neck of the animal unto the altar directly as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 7:6. The question is whether collecting the blood in a receptacle disqualifies the sacrifice or not, i.e., when the Torah stated that the blood of a sin-offering of a fowl should be presented directly on the altar was that granting permission (but not negating, presenting it from a receptacle) or stating that it must be presented in this manner (see <i>Zevachim</i> 92b).</i> there is an unresolved question: Does the receptacle disqualify the blood or not? Therefore the fowl should be burnt<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that this also applies to the situation mentioned in Halachah 19.</i> like all the sin-offerings of fowl concerning which there are unresolved doubts. <sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 10.</i>
When [a priest] received the blood of a sin-offering in four cups and made one presentation [on the altar] from each cup, the remainder of all four cups is poured on the altar's base, as [Leviticus 4:30] states: "And all of its blood shall be poured [on the base of the altar]." If he made all four presentations from one cup, the remnants of that cup should be poured on the altar's base and the other cups poured in the drainage canal.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Since they were set aside as separate entities, but blood was not presented on the altar from them, they are not considered as the remnants of the blood presented and hence should not be poured on the altar's base. <i>Yoma</i> 57b derives this from the fact that Leviticus 4:30 states: "Its blood should be poured on the altar's base," implying that there are times when all of its blood is not poured there.</i>
When blood falls into water or into ordinary blood,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., blood from an animal that was not offered as a sacrifice.</i> it should not be sprinkled on the altar. If it was sprinkled, it is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if it has the appearance of blood. For every drop of blood that falls into the mixture is nullified as it falls in. Thus it is considered as if there is never a majority of blood (<i>Zevachim</i> 77b).</i> When water fell into blood in a receptacle, if it has the appearance of blood, it is acceptable. If wine or ordinary blood fell into it, we make an assessment [as follows]: Were it to have been water would there have been enough to nullify the blood in the receptacle to the extent that it would no longer have the appearance of blood, he should not sprinkle from [the mixture]. If there would not have been enough to nullify its appearance, he should sprinkle from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">See parallels to the above in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 14:6; <i>Hilchot Metamei Mishkav UMoshav</i> 2:6.</i>
When the blood of sacrificial animals becomes mixed with the blood of animals that are disqualified from the altar or with the blood of sacrificial animals that were disqualified because of unsatisfactory ritual slaughter, the entire mixture should be poured into the drainage canal.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the instances mentioned in the previous halachah, in this instance even if the amount of the unacceptable blood is not sufficient to nullify the acceptable blood, the sacrifice is disqualified. Among the explanations given for the distinction is that the previous halachah describes mixtures that were made with ordinary blood and it is uncommon for ordinary blood to be found in the Temple Courtyard. Hence there was no need for a Rabbinic decree to serve as a safeguard. This halachah, by contrast, speaks of mixtures that could frequently occur in the Temple. Hence lest the mixture also be permitted even when the unacceptable blood could nullify the ordinary blood, our Sages were strict and disqualified all mixtures (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Even if all the cups [of blood] were offered aside from one, it should be poured into the drainage canal and all of those offerings are unacceptable.<br>If the [life-]blood [of a sacrificial animal] became mixed with blood concentrated [in the limbs],<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Blood that flows slowly after the majority of the animal's blood has already been discharged. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> [the mixture] should be poured into the drainage canal.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, our Rabbis saw the need for a safeguard, because this is a common situation (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> If, [however,] one did not ask and presented [the blood on the altar], [the sacrifice] is acceptable.
If one cast the organs and fats offered on the altar, the limbs of burnt-offerings, the handfuls [of meal offered on the altar], the frankincense, or the meal-offerings that are to be burnt on the [altar's] pyre after they were consecrated in a sacred utensil, whether by hand<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Yosef Corcus notes that the Rambam's ruling here directly contradicts his ruling in Chapter 11, Halachah 6, which states that a handful of meal that is presented on the altar by hand is disqualified. He states that although the Rambam's ruling can be resolved with difficulty, the explanations appear forced.</i> or with a utensil, whether with one's right hand or with one's left hand, they are acceptable.
When wine or water was poured [on the altar as a libation] with a bowl, the <i>hin</i> measure,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This was one of the measures that were used in the Temple, as stated in <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 1:17-18.</i> or another sacred utensil, it is acceptable. If they were poured with an ordinary vessel or by hand, they are unacceptable.
When one arranged the limbs [of a burnt-offering] or the handful [of meal from a meal-offering] and then arranged the logs for the altar's pyre above them<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of placing them above the logs.</i> or arranged them at the side of the limbs, there is an unresolved doubt whether this is considered as the typical way of having them consumed by fire or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">More precisely, it is obviously not the ordinary way of offering these substances. The question is whether the departure from the norm is great enough to disqualify them or not.</i> Therefore as an initial preference, one should not offer them in this manner, but if one did, it is acceptable.

Chapter 3

When sacrifices of the most sacred order were slaughtered on the top of the altar, it is as if they were slaughtered in the northern [portion of the Temple Courtyard],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:2, sacrifices of the most sacred order must be sacrificed in the northern portion of the Temple Courtyard. Now, the altar is located in the southern portion. Nevertheless, based on the prooftext the Rambam cites, <i>Zevachim</i> 85a derives that it is acceptable to slaughter these sacrificial animals on the top of the altar.</i> as [Exodus 20:21] states: "You shall slaughter upon it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The altar.</i> your burnt-offerings and your peace-offerings." This teaches that the entire altar is an appropriate place for the slaughter of burnt-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is acceptable for burnt-offerings, our Sages assumed that it was also acceptable for other sacrifices of the most-sacred order.</i> and peace-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Peace-offerings are sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity which may be sacrificed anywhere in the Temple Courtyard (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:4). Nevertheless, it is necessary to state that they may be sacrificed on the top of the altar, because one might think that since there is ample space to sacrifice them, they would have to be sacrificed on the ground (<i>Zevachim, loc. cit.; Gittin</i> 67a).</i>
When a burnt-offering was slaughtered on the top of the altar or it was slaughtered below [on the ground of the Temple Courtyard] and then brought up to the top of the altar, it should be skinned and cut into portions in that place. The inner organs should be taken down and washed below<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For it is not respectful to clean out the wastes on the top of the altar.</i> and then brought back [to the top of the altar]. The skin should be taken down and given to the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:19.</i>
Similarly, when [other] sacrifices that had been slaughtered were brought up to the altar, they should be skinned and cut into portions in that place. The inner organs should be taken down and washed below and then brought back [to the top of the altar]. The skin and the meat should be taken down and given to the owners. The remainder [of the sacrifice] should be offered on the altar's pyre.<br>Why shouldn't he bring down the entire [carcass] instead of skinning it and cutting it up on the top of the altar? Because anything that is fit to be offered on the pyre<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to an entity like the carcass of a sacrifice which in its present state is not fit to be offered on the altar, but is not lacking any great tasks like slaughter.</i> if it was brought up to the top of the altar should not be taken down,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This general principle (stated in <i>Zevachim</i> 9:1) is the subject of discussion in the following halachot.</i> as [indicated by <i>ibid.</i> 29:36]: "Everything that touches the altar shall be sanctified."<br>Does [the above principle apply] even when [the entity brought to the top of the altar] is not fit [to be offered on the altar's pyre]? It is taught [Leviticus 6:2] "It is the burnt-offering on the pyre." Just as the burnt-offering is fit to be consumed by the altar's pyre should not be taken down once it was taken up [to the altar], so too, any entity that is fit for the altar's pyre<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">But only an article that is fit to be consumed by the fires.</i> if it is brought up, it should not be brought down.
When [an animal to be sacrificed as] a burnt-offering is brought up to the top of the altar while alive, it should be brought down, because it is not yet fit [to be consumed by the altar's pyre].
Similarly, a handful of meal from a meal-offering that was not consecrated in a sacred vessel<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Unless a meal offering is consecrated in a sacred vessel, it is unacceptable.</i> and all entities that are forbidden to be offered on the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Animals forbidden to be sacrificed, e.g., one that was worshipped, one that is <i>treifah</i>, or one which killed a person or the like. See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:11.<br>The commentaries question why the Rambam does not mention animals with disqualifying physical blemishes. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 9:3) he rules that even if they were brought to the top of the altar, they should be brought down. And if the Rambam changed his mind, it would have been appropriate to say so explicitly. Nevertheless, it is possible to explain that such animals are also included in the general category of "entities forbidden to be offered on the altar," as stated in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach, loc. cit.</i>.</i>should be taken down from the altar even if they were brought up, because from the outset, they were not fit [to be offered on the pyre].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The leniency that every entity brought up to the altar should be offered upon it applies only to entities that were disqualified after having been fit to be offered upon it. As our Sages taught (<i>Zevachim</i> 84a; see Halachah 8) whenever an entity was disqualified in the Temple, if it was brought to the top of the altar, it should be offered. In this instance, these substances were never fit to be offered on the altar's pyre.</i>
Similarly, when a consecrated animal was slaughtered at night, its blood was spilled, or its [blood]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This addition is obvious from a comparison to the following halachah.</i> was taken out of the Temple Courtyard, if it was taken up [to the altar's top], it should be taken down.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it was disqualified in the Temple, nevertheless, it was disqualified before the time its meat and/or fats and organs were to be offered on the altar's pyre (see <i>Zevachim</i> 84a,b).</i>
[Different rules apply] if, by contrast, sacrificial animals were left overnight - whether their blood, their meat, or their fats and organs were left overnight;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Once blood is left past sunset, it is disqualified (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 4:1) and if the meat of a burnt-offering is left overnight, it is disqualified (<i>ibid.</i>:2). Nevertheless, since the meat of a peace-offering is acceptable if left overnight, this is not a serious enough disqualifying factor to prevent these entities from being offered on the altar's pyre (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>a sacrificial animal was taken out of the Temple Courtyard;<br>it became impure or disqualified because of a disqualifying thought concerning the time [it was to be eaten] or the place [it was to be eaten];<br>it was sacrificed for the sake of a different offering;<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapters 13-18 with regard to these factors.</i><br>impure [priests] received its blood and cast it on the altar; [this is significant] since they are fit to perform Temple service when a sacrifice is brought in a state of impurity;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 4:10-12.</i><br>when the blood was presented in an improper place;<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, after the fact, in many instances, the sacrifice is acceptable, as stated in Chapter 2.</i><br>or sacrifices of the most sacred order were slaughtered in the southern portion of the Temple Courtyard or their blood was received there.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than in the north as required (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:2).</i><br>Although in all of these situations, [the sacrifices] are disqualified, if [the meat, fats, and/or organs] were brought to the top of the altar, they should not be taken down.
[This is the general principle:] Whenever an entity is disqualified in the Temple Courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on Rashi's commentary, <i>Zevachim</i> 84a.</i> the holiness [of the altar] accepts it.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">After the fact, as stated above.</i> Just as when these entities were brought up, they should not be taken down, so too, if they were taken down, they should not be brought up a second time. For they have been disqualified.
If the [altar's] fire took hold of them<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 18, Halachah 21, where the Rambam speaks of the fire taking hold of the majority of the entity. Seemingly, that concept would apply here as well.</i> [before they were brought down from the altar], they should be brought up again [so that] they will be consumed by its fire.
When the handful of meal [from the meal-offering] becomes disqualified as <i>piggul</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13, Halachah 1, for a definition of this term.</i> and a portion of it is on the ground and a portion took fire, the entire [handful] should be brought up [to the altar to be consumed].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For the handful of meal is considered as an integral entity.</i>
When limbs, fats, and handfuls of meal were left overnight on the top of the altar, it is as if they were left overnight in the Temple Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are disqualified. Nevertheless, they should be offered on the altar's pyre, because they are on the top of the altar.</i> If they were brought down from the altar, they should not be brought up again. If, however, they were not brought down, they should be offered on the altar's pyre in all situations.
The open space above the altar is considered as the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Thus even if the disqualified sacrificial entities were not placed down on the altar, but held by a person standing on the altar, the above concepts apply (see <i>Zevachim</i> 88a). Rav Yosef Corcus notes that the Talmud mentions also a situation where a person is standing in the Temple Courtyard and holds a disqualified sacrificial entity over the altar with a pole. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since the Talmud does not reach a final decision whether such an entity should be offered on the altar's pyre or not, because of the doubt, they should not be taken down from above the altar.</i> When one brought the fats and the organs of sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Certainly, this applies to the fats and the organs of sacrifices of the most sacred order (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> up [to the altar] before their blood was poured on the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of afterwards, as required.</i> they should not be taken down, because they have become "the food of the altar."
[The following law applies when a person] sets aside two [animals for] a guilt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Or two sin-offerings (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> one intended to serve as surety for the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if one was lost, the other would be sacrificed (Rashi, <i>Meilah</i> 7a).</i> If he slaughtered both of them and brought the fats and organs of one up [to the altar] before [the blood] was cast [upon it], they should be brought down.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The blood of the second animal should be cast on the altar and then its fats and organs offered. Since two animals were slaughtered and one offering can be carried out in a perfectly desirable manner, that is preferable to performing the offering in a manner that is effective only after the fact. Since the second animal will be offered in an effective manner, the blood of the first should not be cast on the altar. And since its blood should not be cast on the altar, the fat and the organs should not be offered on the altar's pyre (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
When an unacceptable sacrifice and unacceptable wine libations<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This clause is speaking about wine libations that were brought as accompanying offerings for a sacrifice.</i> were brought up to the altar, the sacrifice should not be taken down as we explained. The wine libations, [by contrast,] should be taken down.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua in <i>Zevachim</i> 9:1, who maintains that for a disqualified entity to be offered on the altar, it must be fit for the altar's pyre and wine libations are poured over the altar and not on its pyre.</i> Similarly, when wine libations are brought independently and they were disqualified and brought to the top of the altar, they should be taken down.
When <i>melikah</i> was performed on a fowl by a non-priest and then it was brought to the top of the altar, it should not be taken down.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that in the era when sacrifices could be brought on individual altars (see the notes to <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:1), it was possible for a non-priest to perform <i>melikah</i> on a fowl that was offered as a sacrifice. Hence, even after the Temple was built, when a non-priest performs <i>melikah</i> on a fowl, that act is significant enough to endow with holiness to the extent that if the fowl is brought to the top of the altar, it should be offered on the pyre (<i>Zevachim</i> 69a).</i> If, [by contrast,] a handful of meal was taken by a non-priest and brought to the top of the altar, it should be brought down. Even though both of these acts disqualify [the offerings], [the handful from the meal-offering] is considered as if it was never consecrated at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">One might ask: Why isn't the handful of meal acceptable? When offerings were brought on an individual altar, a handful of meal could also be separated by a non-priest. In resolution, however, it is explained that in the Temple, the handful of meal was afterwards placed in a sacred utensil (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 13:12) and then offered on the altar and such service was not performed by a non-priest on an individual altar (<i>Zevachim, loc. cit.</i>).</i> [These laws apply to] a non-priest as well as to anyone else who is disqualified [from performing sacrificial service].<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., a priest with a disqualifying physical deformity; one who is intoxicated; one in the state of severe <i>onein</i> mourning (see <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>).</i>
The following, however, should be taken down [even though] they were brought up to the top of the altar, anything that is not fit<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., halachically not fit to be offered, but either eaten, offered on the inner altar, or discarded.</i> for the altar's pyre. [This includes:] the meat of sacrifices of the most sacred order, the meat of sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The meat of these sacrifices should not be offered on the altar, but rather eaten by the priests and, with regard to sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, the owners.</i> the remainder of the <i>omer</i>, the remainder of the meal-offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">After a handful of meal is taken from the <i>omer</i> and the meal-offerings, the remainder should not be offered on the altar, but eaten by the priests.</i> the two breads [offered on Shavuot], the showbread,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">These breads are eaten by the priests.</i> the incense offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This is not fit to be offered on the pyre of the outer altar, but instead, on coals on the inner altar.</i> the wool that is on the heads of sheep, the hair on the beards of goats, the bones, the sinews, the horns, and the hoofs if they are not attached to [the animal's body].<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Once these entities are separated from an animal's body, they should be discarded rather than offered on the altar's pyre. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 6:2.</i> [In all these instances,] if [these entities] were brought to the top [of the altar], they should be brought down.
If some of the oil from the handful of meal was squeezed out on a bone<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling is derived from the version of <i>Menachot</i> 23a in his possession. Ra'avad, Rashi, as well as the standard published text of that passage follow a different version which reads <i>eitzim</i>, wood, rather than <i>etzem,</i>, bone.</i> [that had been laying on the altar] and then the bone was taken down, it should be returned [to the altar]. [The rationale is that] there is an unresolved doubt whether entities attached to entities that should be brought up [to the altar]<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The oil is the entity that should be returned to the altar and the bone is the entity attached to it (Rav Yosef Corcus). Although on its own accord, the bone should not be returned to the altar as stated in the previous halachah, since it is attached to the oil, it should be returned, lest this be considered as treating sacred articles with disdain (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> are considered as if they should be brought up as well.
The inner altar sanctifies unacceptable entities whether they are fit for it or not fit for it,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The inner altar has an added measure of holiness, because it was anointed and thus is comparable to a sacred vessel (Rashi, <i>Zevachim</i> 23b).</i> but the outer altar only sanctifies unacceptable entities that are fit for it, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 16.</i><br>What is implied? When sacrifices that were disqualified are brought up to the outer altar, they should not be brought down. If an unfitting incense offering<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This includes all incense offerings, because no incense offerings are ever offered on the outer altar.</i> was offered upon it, it should be brought down, because an incense offering is not fit for the outer altar. If, by contrast, a handful of meal from the meal-offering was placed on the inner altar, it should not be taken off, whether it was fit or not fit. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>Just as the altar sanctifies any entity that is fit for it, so too, the ramp, and other sacred utensils, sanctify what is fit for them. For with regard to the sacred utensils, [Exodus 30:29] states: "Any entity that touches them will be sanctified." Thus when an entity that is fit for it reaches the ramp, it should not be brought down even though it is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, it should be offered on the altar's pyre.</i> Similarly, if any entity that is fit for a sacred vessel reaches a sacred vessel, it should never be redeemed even though it was disqualified, as stated in <i>Hilchot Issurei HaMizbeiach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 6:4-5.</i>
Vessels made for liquids do not consecrate solids and vessels made for solids do not consecrate liquids.<br>To what does the above apply? To the liquid and dry measures that existed in the Temple which we mentioned in <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot K'lei Hamikdash</i> 1:16-17. The rationale is that these vessels were anointed only for the sake of measuring and only for measuring the particular types of substances - liquids or solids - intended for them.</i> Receptacles,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The receptacles used to receive the blood from the sacrificial animal and then cast it on the altar.</i> by contrast, consecrate both liquids and solids.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Since they were anointed to serve as receptacles, they consecrate anything placed inside of them.</i> Sacred utensils sanctify blood that was disqualified and cause it to be offered [on the altar].
Sacred vessels only consecrate [entities] in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">If, by contrast, an entity is placed within a sacred vessel outside the Temple Courtyard, it is not consecrated.</i> Also, they only consecrate [entities placed in them] willfully,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">And not something that fell in accidentally.</i> from their insides,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, solids are piled up over the edges of a sacred container, they are not consecrated. Note the apparent contrast to <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 1:19 which states that liquid measures consecrate the overflow that drips down their sides.</i> and when intact. [The following rules apply if] a hole was made within them. If they could still be used to perform the original task for which they were used when intact, they consecrate what is placed within. If not,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the hole prevents them from being used as a container.</i> they do not consecrate [their contents].<br>They consecrate [their contents] only when they are full. The measures do not consecrate their contents when they are lacking unless one intends to fill them. If one does not intend to fill them, they consecrate their contents only in that [the contents] could [later] be disqualified,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if they remained overnight or were taken out of the Temple Courtyard.</i> but not to have them offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to offerings of flour and the like. As mentioned in the previous halachah, blood that is placed in such utensils is sanctified to be offered on the altar.</i>
[When an entity is placed] in a sacred vessel at an inappropriate time, it is consecrated only to the extent that it is disqualified, not that it should be offered.<br>What is implied? When an entity whose mitzvah is performed during the day is placed into a sacred vessel at night, it is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., placing it in the sacred utensil is significant - for if it was not significant, it would not have been disqualified, and would have been able to be used on the following day.</i> It should be burnt,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">As are sacred entities which became disqualified.</i> but not sacrificed. For example, if a handful is taken from a meal-offering at night and that handful is placed in a sacred vessel, it should be burnt.
When an altar became damaged,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The square of the altar must be totally intact, even a slight chip disqualifies it, as stated in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:14-16; 2:18.</i> all of the sacrificial animals that were in the Temple and had been slaughtered, but whose blood had not been cast on the altar, are disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the altar is repaired before sunset, the blood of these sacrifices should not be cast upon it. Since at the outset, the altar was fit to have their blood cast upon it and then there was a time when that service could not be performed, the blood is disqualified forever.</i> For there is no altar on which to cast the blood and [Exodus 20:21] states: "And you shall slaughter upon it your burnt-offerings and your peace-offerings." Implied is that when you slaughter [your offerings,] it shall be intact and not blemished.
Sacrificial animals that were alive and located in the Temple Courtyard at the time [the altar] became damaged are not disqualified. Instead, when the altar is repaired, they should be sacrificed. [The rationale is that] living animals are not deemed unacceptable forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This is a concept that applies in many different contexts of the laws concerning the consecration of animals. See Chapter 4, Halachah 24; Chapter 6, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:4; <i>et al</i>.<br>As mentioned in the notes to <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 4:15, this represents a reversal of the Rambam's initial position on the matter.</i>
If animals were consecrated before the altar was built, they should be sacrificed after the altar was built, for the fact that they could not [be sacrificed] originally is not a disqualifying factor.
Similarly, sacrificial meat should not be eaten while the altar is damaged, as [Leviticus 10:12] states: "You shall eat it<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The meal-offering brought as part of the dedication of the altar. As the verse states, it was considered as a sacrifice of the most holy order.</i> as unleavened bread near the altar."<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 60a explains that there is no obligation to eat sacrificial food near the altar. Rather the intent is as explained here.</i> This also applies to sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity; they should not be eaten in Jerusalem while the altar is damaged until it is repaired.

In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Temurah</i> 3:3, Rav Kapach's edition), the Rambam explains the meaning of that phrase. There were thirteen chests shaped like <i>shofarot</i> in the Temple. Six of them were for money to be used for freewill offerings (see <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 2:2). The money from such a sale would be deposited in one of these chests.</i> [The rationale is that] a communal sin-offering is never consigned to death. [This same law applies when] the goats sacrificed as [atonement for the worship of] false divinities<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 12:1.</i> are lost other [animals] were set aside instead of them [and sacrificed, and then the original animals were found].<br>Why are [the animals that were lost and then discovered] themselves not offered as freewill offerings, for they are male?

[The following rules apply when a person] designated [an animal as] a sin-offering and it was lost, he designated another one instead of it, then the first one was found, and they both stood [before him]. If he took one of them and attained atonement through its [sacrifice], the other should be consigned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since he took one without questioning what should be done with the second, it is obvious that he consciously rejected the second one and is not concerned with its future. Hence it should be consigned to death (Rashi, <i>Temurah</i> 23a).<br>This ruling reflects a reversal in the Rambam's thinking. Originally [i.e., in the first version of his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Temurah</i> 4:3)], he accepted the opinion of Rav Abba who made his statements in the name of Rav. According to that view, if he sacrificed the animal that was set aside originally, the second animal that was set aside need not be consigned to death. He later changed his mind (see Rav Kapach's version of the Commentary to the Mishnah; see also the gloss of <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> to <i>Temurah, loc. cit.</i>) and amended his text to read as above.</i> If he asks the advice [of the court],<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">And thus shows that he is concerned about the fate of the other animal. Accordingly, it is not consigned to death.</i> he is told to gain atonement through the one set aside first. The second should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish. [Then] it should be sold and the proceeds used for a freewill offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 9.</i><br>If one of them was unblemished and the other had a disqualifying physical blemish, the unblemished one should be sacrificed and the blemished one should be redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">And the proceeds used for freewill offerings as above.</i> If, [after it was redeemed,] the blemished one was slaughtered before the blood of the unblemished one was cast [upon the altar],<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The act that brings about atonement.</i> it is forbidden to benefit from [the blemished one].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezar ben Shimon (<i>Temurah</i> 24a) who maintains that once the owner receives atonement, it becomes forbidden to benefit from the second animal even if the second animal was already slaughtered. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that it is unlikely the Rambam accepted this view when it is opposed by the majority of the Sages. Hence he suggests amending the text to read: "If, [after it was redeemed,] the blemished one was slaughtered before the blood of the unblemished one was cast [upon the altar], it is permitted. [If it was slaughtered] after [the blood of the first] was cast upon the altar, it is forbidden to benefit from [the blemished one]."</i> If they were both blemished, they should both be sold, a sin-offering should be purchased from the proceeds, and the remainder used for freewill offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 3.</i>
[The following rules apply when a person] designated [an animal as] a sin-offering and it was lost, he designated another one instead of it and it was [also] lost, and he designated a third. Afterwards, the lost ones were found, and all three stood [before him]. If he received atonement through the first animal [that was set aside], the second should be consigned to death and the third left to pasture [until it contracts a disqualifying blemish].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since the third animal does not have a direct connection with the first, the fact that the owner received atonement through the sacrifice of the first does not cause the third to be consigned to death.</i> If he received atonement through the third animal [that was set aside], the second should be consigned to death and the first left to pasture.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For the same reason as stated in the previous note.</i> If he received atonement through the second animal [that was set aside], the first and the third should be consigned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For both of these share a direct connection with the second.</i>

If [the animal] was stolen or robbed at the time atonement was achieved and afterwards returned, it is not consigned to death.

[The following laws apply when a person] brought a conditional guilt-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Which must be brought when he is in doubt of whether he inadvertently committed a sin that would make him liable for a sin-offering,</i> and then discovered that he did not sin<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance he would not have to bring a sacrifice at all.</i> or that he definitely sinned.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, he would have to bring a sin-offering instead.</i> [Should he become aware of this] before the animal was slaughtered, it should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish.

Since he designated [the animal as a sacrifice] because of a doubt, [we assume that] he resolved to consecrate it [regardless]. If he designated [an animal as a conditional guilt-offering] even because of witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he had no suspicions that he sinned, but witnesses told him that he performed an action that could have involved a transgression, e.g., he ate a piece of meat that could possible have contained an olive-sized portion of forbidden fat.</i> and the witnesses were disqualified through <i>hazamah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazamah</i> refers to a situation in which other witnesses disqualify the witnesses who testified previously by stating that it was impossible for their testimony to be true, for the witnesses were together with them in a different place at the time the transgression mentioned in their testimony was performed (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 18:2).<br>Here, also, there is room to say that the person consecrated the animal in error.

[This law] does not apply with regard to an unconditional guilt-offering.

Chapter 5

When a person sets aside money for a sin-offering and dies, the money should be [thrown] to the Mediterranean Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The ruling is comparable to that governing an animal set aside as a sin-offering whose owner died mentioned in Chapter 4, Halachah 1. Since this money was set aside to be used for a sin-offering, it may not be used for any other purpose. Hence, it should be cast in a place where no one will benefit from it. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Temurah</i> 4:2).<br>Although the term <i>Yam HaMelech</i> is generally translated as "the Dead Sea," it literally means "the Salt Sea." In several places in his Commentary to the Mishnah, however, the Rambam interprets the term as referring to the Mediterranean.</i> Similarly, when a person sets aside money for a sin-offering, the money is lost, another sin-offering is offered in its place, and then the [initial] money is found after atonement was achieved, [the money should be thrown] to the Mediterranean Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this ruling is comparable to that governing an animal set aside as a sin-offering which was lost and the owner attained atonement through the sacrifice of another animal, as stated in Chapter 4, <i>op. cit.</i></i>
When a person sets aside money for a sin-offering, the money is lost, and he set aside other money in its stead, but did not have the opportunity to purchase a sin-offering with the later funds before the first funds were found, he should purchase a sin-offering with the combined funds.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since both sets of money were set aside for the purchase of a sin-offering, they should be used primarily for that purpose. It is preferable to purchase a more expensive animal for a sin-offering than to have more money left over to purchase burnt-offerings.</i> The remainder should be used for freewill offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since the money was not used as of yet and the person did not yet gain atonement, any funds that remain can be used for another purpose.</i>
When a person sets aside money for a sin-offering, the money is lost, and he set aside [an animal] as a sin-offering in its stead, but before he sacrificed it, the [original] funds were found and the [animal was discovered] to have a disqualifying physical blemish, it should be sold and he should purchase a sin-offering with the combined funds.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For the same reasoning as in the previous halachah.</i> The remainder should be used for freewill offerings.
When a person set aside [an animal] as a sin-offering, it was lost, he set aside money in its stead, but was not able to purchase [an animal] as a sin-offering with it before the [first] animal was found, but it [was discovered] to have a disqualifying physical blemish, it should be sold and he should purchase a sin-offering with the combined funds. The remainder should be used for freewill offerings.
If he set aside two piles of money for surety [that he will be able to purchase a sin-offering], he should gain atonement with one of them<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He should not, combine the two to purchase a single offering.</i> and the other should be used for freewill offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 5.</i>
If he set aside [an animal for] a sin-offering or the money for a sin-offering, because he thought that he was obligated [to bring one] and then he discovered that he was not so obligated, [the animal or the money] is of ordinary status; it is not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For the consecration was made in error and hence is not binding.

With regard to an animal, the animal should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish. It should then be sold and the proceeds used for freewill offerings (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Since he did not specify which of the animals should be associated with the particular sin and he is liable for one sin-offering, the remaining animal is not considered to have been consecrated in error (Rav Yosef Corcus).</i>
When he picks up coins in his hand or was in the process of collecting them and said: "I will bring my sin-offering from these," the remainder are not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since he said, "from these," the implication is that all of the coins were not consecrated, only those necessary to purchase the animal for the sin-offering.</i> Similarly, it appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase introduces a conclusion drawn by the Rambam through logic that is not based on any explicit prior Rabbinic source. The rationale is that when bringing a sin-offering it is likely that the person feels remorse and is willing to give more to attain atonement. Nevertheless, none of the extra money is consecrated. It follows logically that this principle should also apply with regard to a freewill offering in which instance the donor may not be as powerfully motivated.</i> that an inference can be drawn [from this ruling] to [similar situations involving] other sacrifices and the remainder are not considered as consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad accepts the Rambam's conclusion with regard to sacrifices that one is obligated to bring, but differs with regard to burnt-offerings and peace-offerings that one gives of his own volition. In those instances, he maintains that the extra money should be used for those sacrifices. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, substantiates the Rambam's approach.</i>

Seemingly, there is no difference between that clause and the situation mentioned in the previous halachah.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that the Rambam had a different version of that text.

If one of [the animals designated as] a sin-offering that was consigned to death or an ox that was condemned to be stoned<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For killing a human; see Exodus 21:29-32; <i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i>, ch. 10.

In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 8:1), the Rambam states that, in this context, the term also applies to an ox that was sodomized by - or forced to participate in sexual relations with - a Jew, for it is also condemned to be executed.</i> becomes intermingled with any other sacrificial animals - even in a ratio of one to a myriad - they should all be consigned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For it is possible that every animal is that animal condemned to die.</i> [The rationale is that] living animals are important and are never considered insignificant [in a mixture].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to Scriptural Law, a forbidden substance is considered as insignificant if mixed with a larger volume of permitted substances (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:1). Even according to Rabbinic Law, it is considered insignificant if mixed with more than sixty times its volume in most situations (<i>ibid.</i>:5). Nevertheless, this situation is an exception for the reason stated by the Rambam.</i><br>If [the animals] were sacrificed,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For their designated purpose.</i> [the sacrifices] are acceptable, because living animals are never permanently disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle applicable in many contexts, as stated in Chapter 4, Halachah 24; Chapter 3, Halachah 22; and <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:4. Thus the fact that as an initial preference the animal should not have been sacrificed is not significant, for according to Scriptural Law, the presence of the forbidden animal is nullified.

If four animals that were designated as peace-offerings became intermingled with four unblemished ordinary animals, the four ordinary animals<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the owner does not know which four animals they are, he may sell them (Rav Yosef Corcus).

Similar laws apply with regard to burnt-offerings and guilt-offerings.<br>The proceeds of the sale are considered as ordinary money, for they are the proceeds of the sale of ordinary animals.
When an ox that was consecrated became intermingled with ordinary animals, the largest among them is considered as the consecrated one<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And should be sacrificed for the purpose for which the animal was consecrated originally.</i> and the others should be sold for sacrifices of that type.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For it is possible that any one of them is the consecrated animal.</i> If sacrifices of the most sacred order became intermingled with animals consecrated for the same purpose,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., burnt-offerings with burnt-offerings.</i> each one should be offered for the sake of its owner, even though none [of the owners] recognize their sacrificial animal.<br>When does the above apply?

By the same reasoning, it would seem that it would be forbidden to make the exchange mentioned here.</i> or until they all become blemished and are sold. [In that instance,] each one should then bring a sacrificial animal equal in value to the more select of that type.
If [sacrificial animals of] two [different] types become intermingled, e.g., a peace-offering with a burnt-offering, they should not be sacrificed, even as the more sacred.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the example given above, to offer both of them as a burnt-offering.</i> [The rationale is that] we should not cause sacrificial animals to become disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See the explanation of this principle in Halachah 12. This rationale is given by <i>Zevachim</i> 8:3 with regard to a peace-offering and a guilt-offering that became mixed together, for it is possible that the meat of one of the animals will not be finished during the first night and will therefore be disqualified, lest it be that of the guilt-offering. This is undesirable, because perhaps it is from the peace-offering and thus it will be disqualified, before its appropriate time (for peace-offerings may be eaten on the following day as well).<br>This explanation of this concept is slightly different for a mixture of a peace-offering and a burnt-offering, since a burnt-offering is not eaten at all. Instead, in that instance, offering the peace-offering as a burnt-offering is forbidden, based on <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 5:4 which states that it is forbidden to offer the meat of sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity on the altar. As a result, the meat of the sacrifice is disqualified.</i>
Just as we may not reduce the time [in which sacrifices] may be eaten,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous note. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 10:12.</i> so too, we may not limit the people eligible to partake of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For example, a firstborn offering which may be eaten only by priests, became mixed with a tithe offering that can be eaten be anyone.</i> nor the place where they can be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Sacrifices of the most sacred order may be eaten only in the Temple Courtyard, while sacrifices of lesser sanctity may be eaten throughout the city of Jerusalem.</i> Instead,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for this reason, we do not merely take one animal for one type of sacrifice and another for the other.</i> what should be done? All [of the sacrificial animals of mixed identity] should be allowed to pasture until they contract a disqualifying physical blemish. Then each one should be sold individually. He should purchase a sacrifice for each type of the value of the most choice animal. He must suffer the loss<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between the price of the most choice animal and the other animal.</i> from his own resources.
Even though the person already sacrificed the burnt-offering or the peace-offering which he was obligated to bring,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Using another animal so that he will not delay the fulfillment of his obligation.</i> he should nevertheless bring a different burnt-offering and peace-offering from the proceeds [of the sale] of the mixture.
When a sin-offering becomes intermingled with a peace-offering, [the two] should be allowed to pasture until they contracted disqualifying physical blemishes and were redeemed. He should bring a peace-offering of the value of the most choice animal and a sin-offering of the value of the most choice animal. If he took the initiative and offered another [animal as a] sin-offering for the sin-offering that was set aside for him first,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., before these animals became blemished.</i> they should all be consigned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As is the law with regard to an animal set aside as a sin-offering that was lost and another was offered in its place (Chapter 4, Halachah 1). Since the animal cannot be sacrificed because its identity is unknown, it is as if it was lost (see Rav Yosef Corcus who discusses this issue). Since it is not known which one of the mixture was consigned to death, both are given that fate.</i>
Similarly, if money for a sin-offering becomes mixed together with money for a guilt-offering, one should take two animals and transfer the holiness of the money for the sin-offering wherever it is on [the animal set aside as] a sin-offering and transfer the holiness of the money for the guilt-offering on [the animal set aside as] a guilt-offering.<br>If he already offered his sin-offering, all of the money should be taken and thrown to the Mediterranean Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 5, Halachah 1, with regard to money set aside for a sin-offering that was lost.</i> If he had already offered his guilt-offering, all of the money should be used for freewill offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rambam LeAm</i> states that this refers to the money that remains after some of the money was used to purchase a sin-offering.</i>

Nevertheless, the second animal should also be offered as a sacrifice, but bread should not be offered together with it (Chapter 12, Halachah 8). In this instance, since we do not know which is the original animal and which is the one exchanged for it, the bread should be waved with both of them.</i><br>If a thanksgiving-offering becomes mixed with other sacrificial animals, even if the person offered [another animal as] his thanksgiving-offering, all [the sacrificial animals] should be allowed to pasture until they contract a blemish. He should then bring another thanks-offering of the value of the most choice animal and the other offering of the value of the most choice animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that bread should not be brought with the second thanksgiving-offering. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that, since the thanksgiving-offering had already been brought, this is obvious.

When a piece [of meat] from a sin-offering that has become impure becomes intermingled with 100 pieces of meat from a pure sin-offering or a slice of the showbread that has become impure becomes intermingled with 100 slices of the showbread that are pure, [the mixture] may be considered acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that there is enough acceptable meat or bread to render the presence of the unacceptable meat or bread insignificant.<br>Some commentaries have suggested that, based on <i>Yevamot</i> 81b, we are forced to say that this is speaking about small pieces of meat that are not significant enough to be used to honor guests. If they are larger and significant, their presence in the mixture is never nullified. However, it is more likely that since the concept that significant pieces of meat are nullified is a Rabbinic safeguard, it was not applied in this instance (see <i>Lechem Mishneh, Kessef Mishneh</i> to the law from <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> cited in the following note).</i> as we explained in <i>[Hilchot] Terumot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 14:14.</i>

Hence the entire mixture should be eaten by the priests. In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>, by contrast, we are speaking about pieces of the showbread that are impure. If the showbread was a significant part of the mixture, the entire mixture would have to be burnt. Since it is not significant, we considered its existence negated.<br>(As evident from a comparison to that source, the laws governing sacrificial foods are more stringent than those applying to <i>terumah</i>.</i>

Chapter 7

Whenever anyone who is unacceptable to perform Temple service performs the rite of <i>melikah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The process of snipping of the head of a sacrificial dove.

For <i>melikah</i> is acceptable only during the day (see <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 4:1), ordinary doves slaughtered in the Temple Courtyard are considered as <i>tereifah</i> (<i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 2:1-2), and sacrificial doves slaughtered outside the Temple Courtyard are disqualified (see <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTuma'ah</i> 3:9). Nevertheless, since <i>melikah</i> is a valid process for killing sacrificial doves and the doves that were slaughtered in the wrong locations were slaughtered properly, the corpses do not convey impurity as a corpse of a <i>nevelah</i> would.</i>

If the disqualifying factor did not take place after it was brought into the Temple Courtyard, [the dove] is a <i>nevelah</i> in all contexts.
For this reason, when a person performs <i>melikah</i> and the animal is discovered to be <i>tereifah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A dove which is <i>tereifah</i> is not acceptable as a sacrifice (<i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:1).</i> he performed <i>melikah</i> with a knife,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Melikah</i> may only performed with the priest's hands.</i> or performed <i>melikah</i> on an ordinary dove in [the Temple Courtyard] or a consecrated dove outside [the Temple Courtyard],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTuma'ah</i> 3:12.</i> they are considered as a <i>nevelah</i> in all contexts.

In contrast, if <i>melikah</i> was performed on a dove that was sodomized, set aside for pagan sacrifice, worshiped, given to a prostitute as her fee, exchanged for a dog, was a <i>tumtum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">An animal whose sexual organ is covered by a mound of flesh and thus its gender cannot be determined.</i> or an <i>androgynus,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">An animal which has both male and female sexual organs.

When their identity had been explicitly determined when they were purchased by the owner, [saying]: "This is a sin-offering. This is a burnt-offering." Different rules apply, however, if one brought doves to fulfill his obligation, some [for] a sin-offering and some for a burnt-offering, without stating explicitly [what each was, instead, they were brought] without specification and then a [dove designated as] a sin-offering or as a burnt-offering became mixed with these undesignated [doves] brought to fulfill his obligation.
What are the appropriate laws? If [a dove designated as] a sin-offering becomes intermingled with this unspecified [group of doves] brought to fulfill one's obligation, only the number of doves to be brought as sin-offerings in the unspecified [group] are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that half of the doves in the unspecified group are sin-offerings. Hence even if another dove that was designated as a sin-offering becomes intermingled with a group of four unspecified doves, there are definitely two doves that can be selected to be offered as sin-offerings (either two are from the unspecified group or one is from the unspecified group and one is the sin-offering that became intermingled).<br>A third sin-offering may not be brought because it is possible that the third dove is from the unspecified group and it should be designated as a burnt-offering.</i> The number of burnt-offerings in the unspecified [group] and the sin-offering that became intermingled with them are disqualified, for a sin-offering has become intermingled with burnt-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Either the dove designated as the sin-offering is among the three. Or the three are from the unspecified group and two are burnt-offerings and one is a sin-offering.</i>
Therefore if the unspecified [group] is [at least] twice as large as the number of sin-offerings [that became intermingled with them], half of the unspecified group is acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For example, if five sin-offerings become intermingled with an unspecified group of ten, there are five acceptable sin-offerings in the intermingled group of fifteen.</i> and half are disqualified. It appears to me that [the priest offering the sacrifices] should offer all of them on the lower portion of the altar according to the rites appropriate for a sin-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The expression "It appears to me" indicates a conclusion the Rambam reached through the process of deduction without any clearcut prior Rabbinic source. It appears that the Rambam is saying that all of the doves, even those which are disqualified, should be offered on the lower half of the altar. The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam, asking how is it possible for him to suggest that unacceptable doves should be offered as sacrifices. (If, he states, the Rambam's intent was that all of the sin-offerings should be offered on the bottom half of the altar, that is obvious and does not need the introduction "It appears to me.")<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that with the expression "It appears to me," the Rambam is introducing a new idea. The previous halachah is speaking about an instance where the priest offered only half the doves in the unspecified group on the lower half of the altar. If, however, he offers more than half of the doves (half of the unspecified group and the number of doves designated as sin-offerings that became intermingled with them) on the lower half of the altar, not only is half the unspecified group acceptable, the sin-offerings that became mixed with the unspecified group are also acceptable. The priest is allowed to offer the majority of the unspecified group on the lower half of the altar because the other doves were never specified as burnt-offerings. Although they would have to be offered as burnt-offerings (and hence, are disqualified), since they were never specified as such, they may be offered on the lower half of the altar. Rav Yosef Corcus adds that according to the Rambam, the intent is the sacrifices are acceptable. It is just that the owners can fulfill their obligation only for half of them.</i>
Similarly, if a burnt-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to burnt-offerings from the pairs mentioned above, this could also refer to doves donated for freewill offerings which are all burnt offerings [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kinnim</i> 1:3)].</i> becomes intermingled with this unspecified [group of doves], only the number of doves to be brought as burnt-offerings in the unspecified [group] are acceptable. The number of sin-offerings in the unspecified [group] and the burnt-offering that became intermingled with them are disqualified, for a burnt-offering has become intermingled with sin-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the same principles applied in Halachot 2-3 with regard to a sin-offering are applied here with regard to a burnt-offering.</i><br>Whether there are more doves in the unspecified group than the number of burnt-offerings that became intermingled with them, there were more burnt-offerings than doves in the unspecified group, or they were of equal amounts, only the amount of burnt-offerings in the unspecified group are acceptable. Therefore if the unspecified group was twice as large as the number of doves that became intermingled with them, half of the unspecified group is acceptable, and half are disqualified. It appears to me that [the priest offering the sacrifices] should offer all of them on the upper portion of the altar according to the rites appropriate for a burnt-offering.
When one unspecified group becomes intermingled with another unspecified group - whether they were all for one purpose, e.g., doves brought by <i>zavim</i> together with doves brought by <i>zavim</i>, or for two purposes, doves brought by <i>zavim</i> together with doves brought by women after childbirth, whether they were both brought by the same person, or they were brought by two separate people, if they were both similar, half are acceptable and half are disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Here the problem is that perhaps unknowingly, the priest will be offering all the doves from one unspecified group as sin-offerings and all of the others, as burnt-offerings, instead of offering them, half and half, as required.</i> [This applies] whether [the priest] offered all of them on the upper portion of the altar or all on the lower portion of the altar, or half were offered on the upper portion of the altar and half on the lower portion, half are always acceptable and half are always disqualified, because half [of the mixture] are burnt-offerings and half are sin-offerings and a sin-offering is offered on the lower portion of the altar and a burnt-offering is offered on the upper portion.<br>[To explain:] If he offered them all on the upper portion, half are acceptable and they are burnt-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The other half are unacceptable, because they were sin-offerings and they were offered as burnt-offerings.</i> If he offered them all on the lower portion, half are acceptable and they are sin-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The other half are unacceptable, because they were burnt-offerings and they were offered as sin-offerings.</i> If half were offered on the lower portion of the altar and half on the upper portion, half of the half offered on the upper portion are acceptable [and the other half are disqualified,] because of the mixture.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in note 8.</i> [The acceptable ones] are burnt-offerings. And half of the half of those offered on the lower portion are acceptable and they are sin-offerings.
[The following rules apply if] two unspecified groups became intermingled with each other and one was larger than the other, e.g., one had four doves and one had six. If he offered them all on the upper portion of the altar, or all on the lower portion, half are acceptable and half are disqualified for the reason we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous halachah.</i> [Different laws apply] if he offered half on the lower portion of the altar and half on the upper portion. If he did this after he asked,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he consulted with the women and asked them what he should do [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kinim</i> 1:4)]. Others interpret this as meaning that he consulted the court.</i> the lesser amount are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For example, Leah brought six doves and Rachel, four. If the priest offered five on the upper portion of the altar and five on the lower portion, it is possible that three are from Leah's group and she intended for them to be sin-offerings not burnt-offerings. Hence only two of the doves offered on the upper portion are acceptable. The same applies with regard to those offered on the lower portion (see the gloss of Rav Yosef Corcus).</i> If he did this on his own initiative, the greater amount are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For the reason explained in the next halachah.</i>
This is the general principle: Whenever, on his initiative, the priest offered half on the upper portion of the altar and half on the lower portion, and it is impossible that [the doves of] one [owner] will not have been offered on both halves of the altar, the greater amount is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Because the distinction of the sacrifices as burnt-offerings and sin-offerings was left to the priest to determine.</i> Since it is known that a portion of [this person's]<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the person who brought the larger group.</i> sacrifices will be [offered] on the upper portion of the altar and a portion on the lower half, all of his sacrifices are acceptable.
When two individuals purchase pairs of doves together or give the money for them to the priest [to purchase them], the priest may offer whichever he desires as sin-offerings and whichever he desires as burnt-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">They are all acceptable, because when offering them, he is determining which is a sin-offering and which, a burnt-offering.</i> For [the identity of the sacrifices] in the pair is determined only when purchased by the owners or when offered by the priest, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5, Halachah 11.</i>
If there were [groups of doves], some [groups of] sin-offerings and others, burnt-offerings, before a priest and he offered<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kinnim</i> 3:2), the Rambam states that this is speaking about an instance where the groups were not intermingled. The identity of the groups was left for the priest to determine. After doing so, he forgot how he had determined the identity of the groups and offered them in the manner described. Afterwards, he remembered they were of different types and inquired what was the outcome of his deeds. If, however, the groups became intermingled at the outset, they should all be consigned to death, as stated in Halachah 1 (see <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> both [groups] on the upper portion of the altar or both on the lower portion, half are acceptable and half are not.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the groups contained an equal number of sin-offerings and burnt-offerings. Thus if they are all offered as one type, half will be unacceptable.</i> If he offered half on the upper portion and half on the lower portion without knowing whether it was the sin-offerings or the burnt-offerings that he offered on the lower portion, they are all unacceptable. For we surmise that it was the burnt-offering that were offered on the lower portion and the sin-offerings on the upper portion.
If there were three groups of doves before him:<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This too is speaking about an instance where the groups are not intermingled, but rather three groups were brought to a priest to define their status and to offer them. Afterwards, he forgot and offered them without being conscious of their different status [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>op. cit.</i>:3)].</i> one sin-offerings, one burnt-offerings, and one undefined, half burnt-offerings and half sin-offerings, without the purpose [for any given dove] being defined, if he offered all of them on the upper portion or on the lower portion, half are acceptable and half are not.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This is a combination of the previous halachah and Halachot 2 and 4.</i>
If he offered half on the upper portion and half on the lower portion,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a situation similar to that described in note 23, except that here, he offered one group on the upper portion of the altar, one group on the lower portion, and one group, half and half.</i> only the group that was undefined that was offered half on the upper portion and half on the lower portion is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For it was offered as required, half on the upper portion of the altar and half, on the lower portion.</i> It is divided between the owners<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Each of the people who brought sacrifices are credited with an equal share of the sacrifices offered. Thus each one is considered to have brought half their sacrifices and must bring the other half.</i> and [the portion allotted to] each one is considered as valid for them, for the priest does not know which groups were specified [as being sin-offerings] and which one was left undefined. The two specified groups are not acceptable, because it is not known which one was offered on the upper portion of the altar and which one, on the lower portion and it is possible that the burnt-offerings were offered on the lower portion and the sin-offerings on the upper portion.

Chapter 9

When a dove from an unspecified group flies to free spaces or among doves that are consigned to death,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Because they have become intermingled with a dove designated as a sin-offering.</i> or one of the doves dies, a second one should be taken for its pair.
If it flies among [doves] that are fit to be offered, it is disqualified and it disqualifies one [of the group], for when a dove flies from an unspecified group to among those which will be offered, it becomes disqualified and it disqualifies another one corresponding to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The redundancy in the Rambam's ruling is a quote from <i>Kinim</i> 2:1.</i><br>What is implied? A dove from a group of unspecified doves flies to an unspecified group of ten doves. If [the priest] offered five on the lower portion [of the altar] and six on the upper portion, five of the burnt-offerings from the six offered on the upper portion are acceptable<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is obvious that one of the six offered as burnt-offerings is unacceptable, because there were only five in the second group. The sixth is either one of the original group that should have been offered as a burnt-offering and is thus unacceptable. Or it is the one that flew into it, in which instance, it is unacceptable, because perhaps it was to be offered as a sin-offering. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kinim</i> 2:1).</i> and four of the sin-offerings from the five offered on the lower portion are acceptable. [The rationale is that] one says: "Perhaps the dove that flew is one of the five offered on the lower portion."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And one of the sin-offerings in that group had been offered together with the burnt-offerings.</i><br>Similarly, if he offered six on the lower portion and five on the upper portion, five sin-offerings and four burnt-offerings are acceptable. For one might say: "Perhaps the dove [that flew] is one of the five offered on the upper portion." Thus from the ten [from the second group], nine are acceptable and [the dove] disqualified one.
[The following rules apply when there is one] unspecified group of four doves and another unspecified group of four doves. If one from the first group flew to the second group, it disqualified one of the second group.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As described in the previous halachah.</i> If, after it became intermingled among them,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, it is obvious that the dove that flew from the first group flew back to it, none of the doves are disqualified (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> one of the second group flew to the first group, it disqualifies one of the first group.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">And it is disqualified itself.</i> Thus there are only two doves in the first group that are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They should be offered one as a burnt-offering and one as a sin-offering. Similarly, in the second group, only one pair of doves should be offered, for we surmise that it was one of the three that was acceptable that flew to the first group.</i>
If, again, one of the first group flew back to the second group, even if [they continue flying back and forth] the entire day, they do not add to the number disqualified,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., each group has two acceptable doves and two which are disqualified.</i> for even if they become entirely intermingled with each other, half are acceptable and half are disqualified, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 8, Halachah 5.</i>
[The following rules apply when there is one] unspecified group of two doves, a second group of four doves, a third of six, a fourth of eight, a fifth of ten, a sixth of twelve, and a seventh of fourteen.

Thus the first and second groups do not have any [acceptable doves]; the third group has two; the fourth, four; the fifth, six; the sixth, eight, and the seventh, twelve.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">More acceptable doves remain in the last group because only two doves are disqualified in each circuit, while in all the other groups four are disqualified each time.</i><br>If one of the doves flew from [group] to [group] a second time and then one flew back from the last [group], going from group to group until it reaches the first, one dove is disqualified in the movement from group to group and one is disqualified in the return. The third<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, all of the doves in the first and second group were disqualified in the first phase of movement.</i> and the fourth groups do not have any [acceptable doves]; the fifth group has two; the sixth, four, and the seventh, ten.<br>If one of the doves flew from [group] to [group] a third time and then one flew a fourth time, going from group to group, one dove is disqualified in the movement from group to group and one is disqualified in the return. Thus the fifth and the sixth are disqualified entirely and the seventh has eight acceptable doves remaining, i.e., when the fourteen doves are offered [on the altar], seven on the upper portion and seven on the lower portion, eight will be acceptable and six will be disqualified because of the intermingling of the doves that flew back and forth.
[The following laws apply when there was] a group of doves that was unspecified and another group [in which the doves for the sin-offering and the burnt-offering] had already been specified. If one of the doves from the unspecified group flew to the group that had been specified, [the owner of the unspecified group] should take a partner for the remaining dove.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">One should be offered as a sin-offering and one as a burnt-offering.

Hence one burnt-offering and two sin-offerings should be offered and only one of the sin-offerings is acceptable. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kinim</i> 2:4).</i><br>If [the above group became intermingled and then one of the doves] returned [to the unspecified group] or [at the outset,] one of the doves from the specified group flew to the unspecified group and it was not known whether it was the one designated as a burnt-offering or the one designated as the sin-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the identity of the dove which became intermingled is known, different laws apply, as explained in Chapter 8.</i> all of the doves in the unspecified group should be consigned to death.

She should bring another dove to complete her obligation and it should be offered on the lower portion. <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains that this follows the same rationale as above. One of the burnt-offerings is acceptable. Hence it is necessary to bring a sin-offering to complete her obligation. He continues explaining that this decision is somewhat of a leniency, because it is possible that she will be offering the sin-offering from a different type of dove than the burnt-offering. Nevertheless, since we do not know of which type the original four doves were, this leniency is granted.<br>The above explanations are based on Rav Kappach's edition of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah. The initial version (preserved in the standard printed texts) reads differently. Similarly, this explanation requires - as suggested by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> - amending the standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> to read:<br>it should be offered on the upper portion, for two were already offered on the lower portion as sin-offerings.</i><br>When does the above apply? When originally she brought all of the four of one type. If, however, they were of two types, she must bring six other doves: two turtle doves and two young doves for her vow<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">To be offered as burnt-offerings, for as above, it is possible that the ones designated as her vow were not offered as burnt-offerings and she does not remember which type she specified.</i> and for her obligation, she should bring either two turtle doves or two young doves<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the previous situations, she must bring two doves to fulfill her obligation. In this instance, one of those that were offered as a burnt-offering is not acceptable, because we know for certain that the offerings originally brought were of two types and we do not know which type of dove was brought as a burnt-offering so that a sin-offering could be brought from the same type of dove. Hence she must bring an entire pair to fulfill her obligation.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's rulings based on his interpretation of the Mishnah in <i>Kinnim</i> (which is also supported by Rashi). Rav Yosef Corcus and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain the Rambam's understanding.</i> and offer one on the upper portion of the altar and one on the lower portion.<br>Similarly, if she gave them to the priest<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Four doves.

If she defined [which type of offering<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., whether she would bring a lamb, the burnt-offering brought by a woman of means after childbirth, or a dove, the burnt-offering brought when one lacks adequate means.</i> to be offered to fulfill] her obligation and [which types of doves to be offered to fulfill] her vow and forgot what she defined, it is [also] possible that her obligation was a lamb for a burnt-offering and a dove - either a turtle dove or a young dove - as a sin-offering.

Chapter 11

Whenever any of the persons who are disqualified from performing Temple service take the handful of meal from a meal-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the description of the taking of the handful of meal in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 13:13.</i> the offering is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam explains that taking a handful of meal is equivalent to slaughtering an animal sacrifice.

If, however, it falls to the floor from his hand, it is disqualified. As support, he cites a similar ruling with regard to the blood of a sacrifice (Chapter 1, Halachah 26).</i>
[In all the following instances,] a meal-offering [is unacceptable]:<br>it was not placed in a sacred utensil,<br>the handful of meal was not placed in a sacred utensil,<br>it was brought to the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:12 with regard to bringing the meal-offering to the altar.</i> while not in a sacred utensil,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 26a elaborates on the necessity of using a sacred utensil for each of these stages of service.</i><br>or it was mixed with oil outside the Temple Courtyard; [it is acceptable] only if it was mixed with oil in the Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Although it need not be mixed with oil by a priest, it must be mixed in the Temple Courtyard (<i>Menachot</i> 9b).</i>
All of the meal-offerings are acceptable even if oil was poured over them by someone who was unacceptable for Temple service, e.g., a non-priest or the like, or such a person mixed [the oil with the meal], broke [wafers] into pieces,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">As required for certain meal-offerings; see Leviticus 2:6.</i> or put salt upon them.

If a priest did not approach the altar with them and/or wave them again, they are [nevertheless] acceptable. [This is derived from Leviticus 2:2:] "And he shall bring it to the sons of Aaron and [one] shall take a handful..." From taking the handful and onward, the mitzvah must be performed by a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:23.</i> Pouring and mixing [the oil] may be performed by a non-priest.
When even the slightest amount of oil from another meal-offering or oil that was not consecrated falls into a meal-offering, it is disqualified. If [the full measure<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">One <i>log</i> for every <i>isaron</i> (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:7).</i> of] its oil is lacking, it is disqualified. If, [by contrast, the full measure<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A handful per offering (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> of] its frankincense is lacking, it is acceptable provided there are at least two particles of frankincense upon it. If there is only one particle, it is disqualified, as it is written:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">There is no Biblical phrase using the exact wording employed by the Rambam. <i>Menachot</i> 11b derives the concept stated by the Rambam from Leviticus 6:8.

Even if he placed frankincense on the smallest portion of the meal-offering, he disqualifies it until he gathers it.
If one mixed water with the meal and then took a handful, it is acceptable. [The Torah's requirement<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:10 speaks of a meal-offering "mixed with oil or that is dry."</i> that the offering be] "dry" [refers only] to oil.
A meal-offering from which a handful was taken twice - or many times - is acceptable, provided an olive-sized portion is offered on the altar's pyre at once. For no less than an olive-sized portion may be offered on the altar.
If one offered the handful [of meal<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The remainder of the offering, however, need not be salted.</i> on the altar] without salt, it is unacceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Menachot</i> 18a states: "If salt was not placed on it, it is acceptable," it is explained (<i>ibid.</i> 20a): "If a priest did not salt it, but a non-priest did."</i> for the salt is an absolute requirement for a meal-offering, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 5:12.

When a person donates a handful<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This is the minimum size of the offering, as stated in <i>ibid.</i> 16:13.</i> of frankincense independently, it is unacceptable if it is lacking at all. Similarly, if the two bowls of frankincense that accompany the [show]bread<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 5:2.</i> are lacking even the slightest amount, they are unacceptable. They must contain two handfuls from the beginning until the end.
[The following rules apply when a] person set aside two handfuls [of frankincense] for one offering<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Doubling the minimum requirement.</i> and one was lost. If this occurred before the handful [of meal] was taken, [the association between them and this offering] was not [yet] established.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">And thus the offering is acceptable.</i> If it occurred afterwards, [the association] has been established and [the offering] is unacceptable, because he increased its frankincense.<br>Similar [laws apply if one] sets aside four handfuls for the two bowls of the [show]bread<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Doubling the minimum requirement.</i> and two were lost. If this occurred before the bowls were removed [from the showbread],<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">On the afternoon of the Sabbath, before the showbreads are replaced by new breads, the bowls of frankincense are removed and the frankincense offered on the altar.</i> [the association between them] was not established and they are acceptable. If it occurred after the bowls were removed, [the association] was established and they are disqualified, because of the extra amount.
When the handful taken from a meal offering became impure and then it was offered on the altar's pyre,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is speaking after the fact. As an initial preference, once the handful of meal becomes impure, it should not be offered.</i> the High Priest's forehead plate causes it to be considered acceptable, as [Exodus 28:38] states: "And Aaron shall bear [the iniquity....]"<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachot 34-35; <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 4:7; <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 3:9, <i>et al</i>.</i><br>If the handful was taken outside the Temple Courtyard and then brought in and offered on the altar's pyre, the forehead plate does not cause it to be considered acceptable. For the forehead plate causes [sacrifices tainted by] impurity to be considered acceptable, but not those which are taken outside the Temple Courtyard.
If one took the handful from a meal-offering and then the entire remainder [of the offering] became impure,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 26a derives this from a comparison to the laws regarding offering the blood on the altar when the meat of a sacrifice became impure or otherwise disqualified.</i> was burnt, was taken out of the Temple Courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Which causes the meal-offering to be disqualified.</i> or was lost, the handful should not be offered on the altar's pyre. [After the fact,] if it was offered, it is accepted [Above].<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">And the person who brought it is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.</i> If a small amount of the remnants [of the offering] remained acceptable, the handful should be offered. [Nevertheless,] the remnant that remains is forbidden to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 9b derives this concept from Leviticus 2:3: "The remainder of the meal-offering shall be for Aaron and his sons." Implied is that the priests should receive the remainder of the offering and not the remainder of the remnants.</i>
If there was a divider in the lower portion of a vessel containing an <i>isaron</i> [of flour] for a meal-offering, even though [the flour] is mixed together above, one should not take a handful.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For the handful must be taken from an <i>isaron</i> of flour and since there is a division in the container, it is considered as if the <i>isaron</i> was brought in two containers which is unacceptable (<i>Menachot</i> 24a).</i> If one did, it is unacceptable.
If, [by contrast,] the container was separated by a divider above, but [the contents] were mixed together below, one may take a handful from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Since the flour is mixed together below, it is considered to be a single entity.</i>
If one divided the <i>isaron</i> in a single container and thus the portions were not touching each other, but there was no divider between them, there is an unresolved doubt whether the container causes [the two portions to be considered as] combined or not. Therefore, [at the outset,] one should not take the handful [in such an instance].<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since the question was not resolved, one should not attempt to bring the sacrifice in this manner.</i> If one did take the handful, it should not be offered on the altar's pyre. If it was offered, it is accepted [Above], but the remainder [of the offering] should not be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have not found an explicit source for this ruling. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that it is derived from the Halachah 20 above.</i>
If one took a handful [of flour from a meal-offering] and placed the handful on the top of the [Golden] Table [elevated to] the height of the arrangement of the showbread,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">15 handbreadths, for there are six showbreads in each arrangement and each one is two and one half handbreadths high.</i> the Table causes it to be sanctified in that it can be disqualified,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if it remains overnight, is taken out of the Temple Courtyard, or the like. Beforehand, it could not be disqualified for those reasons. From the Rambam's wording, one can infer that placing the handful of meal on the table does not disqualify the handful entirely and if it is gathered and placed in a sacred vessel, it may be placed on the altar's pyre (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> but it does not sanctify it so that it can be offered. For [the handful of flour] should not be sacrificed until it was sanctified in a sacred vessel fit for the handful [of flour].
If he attached the handful to the wall of the vessel and took it or overturned the vessel above his hand and took the handful while the opening of the vessel was turned downward, it should not be offered on the altar's pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 11a questions whether these situations are acceptable and leaves the matter unresolved.</i> If it was offered, it is accepted [Above].
[The following rules apply when] an <i>isaron</i> was divided and one of its portions were lost, another portion was set aside in its stead, the lost portion was found and the three are all placed in one container, but are not touching each other. If the portion that was lost becomes impure, it is combined with the first portion and they are disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for the ruling is that their presence in a common container causes the different elements of an offering to be considered as one, even if they are not touching (<i>Chagigah</i> 20b; <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTuma'ah</i> 12:7). Hence, since these two portions were originally part of the same offering and they are now in the same container, the first part is also disqualified.</i> The portion that was set aside [as a replacement] is not combined with them<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since these two portions were never planned to be offered together, they do not share a halachic connection.</i> and it should be supplemented [to produce a full <i>isaron</i>].<br>If the portion set aside [as a replacement] becomes impure, it and the first portion are combined and disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For the portion set aside as a replacement and the original portion were intended to serve as a single offering.</i> The portion that was [lost and] discovered is not combined with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For as mentioned, it and the replacement have no intrinsic connection.</i> If the initial portion becomes impure, both the portion that was lost and the portion set aside because of it are combined with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For they both share a connection with it.</i>
Similar concepts apply with regard to taking the handful. If one took the handful from the portion that was [lost and then] discovered, the remainder of it and the first portion<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In its entirety.</i> may be eaten and the portion that was set aside [afterwards] may not be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, another portion should be combined with it and a second meal-offering brought (<i>Zevach Todah</i>).</i> If one took the handful from the portion that was set aside [afterwards] the remainder of it and the first portion may be eaten and the portion that was [lost and then] discovered may not be eaten. If one took the handful from the first portion, neither [of the other] two may be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The remainder of the first portion may, however, be eaten, because the handful is acceptable.</i> [The rationale is that] they are both extra portions.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam continues to explain, taking the handful from a meal-offering enables the remainder of the <i>isaron</i> from which it is taken to be eaten. It, however, only allows an <i>isaron</i> to be eaten, not more. Thus the two portions could not be eaten because when brought together, the three would comprise more than an <i>isaron</i>.</i> For together they are an entire <i>isaron</i> and thus resemble an entire <i>isaron</i> from which a handful was not taken and which is hence, forbidden.<br>[One might ask:] How can the handful [that was taken] be offered, since there is an <i>isaron</i> and a half [in the vessel]? Because taking the handful is dependent on the intent of the priest and when he takes the handful, he has his mind on an <i>isaron</i> alone and the portions [of the <i>isaron</i>] are not touching each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Since each portion is distinct from the other, it is possible for the priest to be focused on two, but not three.</i>
When a handful [taken from] a meal-offering became mixed with a handful [taken from] another meal-offering, they should both be offered on the altar's pyre together and they are acceptable. Similarly, it is acceptable if a handful [taken from a meal-offering] became mixed with a meal-offering of a priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:9.</i> the meal-offering from an accompanying offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i> 2:1.</i> or the <i>chavitin</i> offering of the High Priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:9.</i> They should be offered on the altar's pyre together. [The rationale is that all of these substances] are offered on [the altar's] fire in their entirety.
[The following rules apply when] two meal-offerings from which a handful had not been separated become mixed together. If [the priest] can remove a handful from each one separately, they are acceptable. If not, they are disqualified.
When a handful [taken from a meal-offering] becomes mixed together with a meal-offering from which a handful had not been taken, it should not be offered on the altar's pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one might desire to offer the entire mixture so that he will have fulfilled his obligation to offer the handful. This, however, is undesirable for one will have offered a meal-offering without separating the handful from it.</i> If one did offer the entire mixture, the owner of [the offering] from which the handful was taken is considered to have fulfilled his obligation and the owner of the one from which the handful was not taken is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation.
If the handful [taken from a meal-offering] becomes mixed together with the remaining portions of the offering or the remaining portions become mixed together with the remaining portions of another meal-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation reflects the version in the standard published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> even though many commentaries have questioned it and have suggested that the text should read: "or [the handful] became mixed with the remaining portion of another meal-offering." This version appears preferable, for seemingly, even if two offerings become mixed together, if their handfuls have already been separated, why shouldn't the handfuls be offered? Halachah 29 apparently leads to such a conclusion. Nevertheless, we did not correct the text in this fashion, for the authoritative manuscripts and early printings employ the same version as the standard printed text. Moreover, the Rambam's text of the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 3:3) also contains such statements.</i> it<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">In the first instance, this refers to the mixture of the handful and the remainder.

Nevertheless, in this instance, <i>Menachot</i> 23b quotes a textual association to prove that the handful does not become <i>betal</i> to the remainder of the offering.</i> If it was offered, the owner is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.

See also Chapter 11, Halachah 17.</i> it is unacceptable. If the bowls of frankincense were already placed on the altar's pyre, it is acceptable.
With regard to the accompanying offerings that lacked [the required measure]: whether the sacrifice was offered or not, they are acceptable, but other accompanying offerings must be brought to complete [the required measure].
[The following rules apply when] accompanying offerings were sanctified in a sacred vessel and then the sacrifice was disqualified. If it was disqualified through ritual slaughter, the accompanying offerings have not been sanctified so that they must be offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In all instances, however, they are considered sanctified to the extent that they must be kept overnight and then destroyed by fire.</i> If it was disqualified from the reception of the blood and onward,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, the intent is that even the reception of the blood was not performed in an acceptable manner. See the following note.</i> the accompanying offerings have become sanctified, because what sanctifies the accompanying offerings so that they should be offered is solely the slaughter of the sacrifice [in an acceptable manner].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Hence since the sacrifices were slaughtered in an acceptable manner, the accompanying offerings should be offered on the altar. The Ra'avad notes that this ruling is the subject of a difference opinion between our Sages in <i>Menachot</i> 79a. Rabbi Elazer ben Shimon maintains that for an accompany offering to be offered, the blood of the sacrifice must be received in an acceptable manner. Rabbi Yehudah <i>HaNasi</i> differs and maintains that as long as the slaughter is acceptable, even if the blood was not received in an acceptable manner, the accompanying offering should be offered.<br>The Ra'avad maintains that the Rambam follows Rabbi Elazer ben Shimon's ruling. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and R. Yosef Corcus, by contrast, elaborate to show that he accepts the position of Rabbi Yehudah <i>HaNasi</i>. Moreover, they cite the Rambam's ruling in Chapter 17, Halachah 18, as proof that this is the Rambam's understanding here. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> does, however, explain a way to interpret the passage according to the Ra'avad's view.</i><br>What should be done with [these accompanying offerings]?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., by definition an accompanying offering may not be sacrificed alone, only with a sacrifice, and in this instance, the sacrifice has been disqualified.</i> If there was another sacrifice that had already been slaughtered at that time,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">And does not have an accompanying offering to be brought with it.</i> they should be offered together with it. If there was not another sacrifice that had already been slaughtered at that time, they are considered as if they were disqualified because they were left overnight and they should be destroyed by fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The priests must wait until the next morning to burn them. For until a sacrifice is actually disqualified, it is forbidden to destroy it. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 7:4).</i><br>When does the above apply? With regard to communal sacrifices, because the heart of the court makes stipulations concerning them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the court takes into consideration all the possible eventualities that might crop up and has the accompanying offering brought with those possibilities in mind. Hence if the sacrifice is disqualified, the basis on which the accompanying offering was brought is not nullified.</i> [Different rules apply with regard to] individual sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For the court does not make such stipulations about them.</i> Such [accompanying offerings] should not be offered together with another sacrifice even if it was sacrificed at that time. Instead, they should be left until they become disqualified because they remained overnight and then they should be destroyed by fire.
Whenever a sacrifice was offered for a purpose other than that for which it was consecrated,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when one sacrificed it with the intent that it was another type of offering, e.g., one slaughtered an animal consecrated as a burnt-offering with the intent that it was a peace-offering.</i> the accompanying offerings should be offered with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For with the exception of a sin-offering, sacrifices are acceptable if slaughtered with such a mistaken intent. And there are no accompanying offerings for a sin-offering.</i>
[The following laws apply with regard to] the offspring of a thanksgiving-offering, an animal onto which the holiness of a thanksgiving-offering was transferred, and [a situation in which] one separated his thanksgiving-offering, it was lost, and he separated another one instead of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See the parallels to similar questions involving a sin-offering in Chapter 4, Halachah 4.</i> If [any of these animals] were to be offered after the owner's obligation was not satisfied with the original thanksgiving-offering, bread<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the 40 breads offered together with a thanksgiving-offering.</i> need not be brought with it. If the owner's obligation was satisfied with the original offering and it and the one separated in place of it, it and its offspring, or it and the animal onto which its holiness was transferred are both present before us, bread is required to be brought with both of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The apparent meaning of the Rambam's words here and in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i>) is that bread should be brought when offering both of these sacrifices. <i>Shoham VeYashpah</i>, however, cites <i>Menachot</i> 79b which states that when both a thanksgiving-offering and an animal separated as a replacement for it are both present before us, the breads should be offered with either one and the other, offered without bread. Even such an interpretation, however, is not appropriate with regard to an animal onto which the holiness of a thanksgiving-offering was transferred. The Rambam's ruling here is also slightly problematic when compared to the following halachah.</i><br>When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">That bread is or is not required for both of the offerings in the above situations.</i> apply? When one vowed to bring a thanksgiving-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he did not designate a specific animal as a thanksgiving-offering, but instead, undertook the responsibility to bring such a sacrifice.</i> When, however, one designated an animal as a thanksgiving-offering, an animal set aside instead of it or one onto which its holiness was transferred require that bread [be offered with them].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rambam LeAm</i> explains that when an animal is designated as a thanksgiving sacrifice and is lost, there is no need to bring another instead of it. Hence the second thanksgiving-offering is considered as an independent sacrifice and bread is required for it independently.<br>With regard to an animal upon which the holiness of the thanksgiving offering was transferred, <i>Rambam LeAm</i> questions the Rambam's ruling, because seemingly, bread should not be required for such a sacrifice after the first animal was offered. Based on Halachah 13, Rav Yosef Corcus maintains that there is a printing error here and that in no instance is bread required when offering an animal on which the holiness of a thanksgiving-offering was transferred.</i> Its offspring does not require bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in any situation; see <i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 4:1.</i> [This applies] whether or not the owner's obligation was already satisfied with the original offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rambam LeAm</i> maintains that this line refers only to the offspring of a thanksgiving-offering.</i>

Thus the three animals are standing before us. If he fulfills his obligation with the first one, the second one does not require that bread be brought with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The second animal was set aside in place of the first.

[The following laws apply when one] sets aside money for a thanksgiving-offering and it was lost, other money was set aside in its place, but [the owner] did not have the opportunity to buy a thanksgiving-offering until the first money was found. He should bring a thanksgiving-offering and its bread from a combination of the two. From the remainder, he should bring a thanksgiving-offering, but it does not require bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For if there are funds left over from the purchase of a sacrifice, the money should be used to purchase an offering of the same type, as stated in Chapter 5, Halachah 9. Nevertheless, the additional thanksgiving-offering does not require bread as reflected by Halachah 8.</i> It does, however, require accompanying offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">For it must be offered according to the requirements appropriate for thanksgiving-offerings.</i><br>Similarly, when one sets aside [an animal for] a thanksgiving-offering and it was lost, money was set aside in its place, and afterwards [the original animal] was found, he should bring a thanksgiving-offering without bread with that money.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the animal originally set aside as a thanksgiving-offering should be offered for that purpose together with the bread and the money should be used to purchase an additional thanksgiving-offering.</i> Similarly, if one sets aside money for a thanksgiving-offering and it was lost, a thanksgiving-offering was set aside in its place, and then the money was found, the money should be used to purchase a thanksgiving-offering and its bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since the money was originally set aside for this purpose, it should be used for the primary offering.</i> The second thanksgiving-offering should be offered without bread.

When a person set aside money for his thanksgiving-offering and some remained, he should use it to bring bread. If he set aside money to bring bread and some remained, he should not use it to bring a thanksgiving-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Because the bread is referred to as a thanksgiving-offering, but the offering is not referred to as bread (<i>Menachot</i> 80a).</i>

The Ra'avad maintains that the person should bring another thanksgiving-offering and bread from his own resources and the proceeds from the sale of the blemished animal should be used to purchase a thanksgiving-offering without bread. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, while the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i> (Responsum 24) reinforces the Ra'avad's objection.</i>
When one of the loaves of the bread brought with a thanksgiving-offering was broken in pieces, they are all disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The breads accompanying the thanksgiving offering must be whole.

When a person slaughters a thanksgiving-offering, but its bread was located outside the walls of <i>Beit Pagi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This term refers to the wall that surrounds the Temple Mount.

Chapter 13

There are three improper intents that disqualify sacrifices. They are: the intent [to offer a sacrifice]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The particular activities which disqualifiy a sacrifice are mentioned in Halachot 4-6.</i> for a different purpose,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for the sacrifice of another type or not for the sake of its owner, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> the intent [to offer or partake of the sacrifice] in an [improper] place, and the intent [to offer or partake of the sacrifice] at an [improper] time.<br>What is meant by the term "the intent [to offer a sacrifice] for a different purpose"?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 1:1 states: "All of the sacrifices that were sacrificed without the proper intent are acceptable, but their offering does not fulfill the owner's obligation with the exception of a sin-offering and the Paschal sacrifice." Thus although most sacrifices that are not offered with the proper intent are acceptable, since the owner does not fulfill his obligation while offering them, the Rambam mentions them in this halachah (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 4:10.</i> [The animal was designated as] a burnt-offering and [the priest] had the intent that it was a peace-offering, he slaughtered it for the sake of a burnt-offering and a peace-offering, or for the sake of a peace-offering and a burnt-offering, or he did not slaughter the sacrifice for the sake of its owners. These are all examples of "intents [to offer a sacrifice] for a different purpose."<br>What is meant by the term "the intent [to offer or partake of the sacrifice] in an [improper] place"? [The priest] slaughtered the sacrificial animal for the correct purpose<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for the type of sacrifice for which it was designated and for the correct owner.</i> with the intent of casting its blood or offering a portion of it that was fit to be offered on the altar's pyre outside the Temple Courtyard or eating a portion of it that is fit to be eaten outside the place designated for it to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Sacrifices of the most sacred order must be eaten in the Temple Courtyard and sacrifices of lesser sanctity must be eaten in Jerusalem.</i> These are all examples of "intents [to offer a sacrifice] in an [improper] place." Sacrifices [that were slaughtered] with such an intent are called sacrifices that were slaughtered outside their proper place.<br>What is meant by the term "the intent [to offer or partake of the sacrifice] at an [improper] time"? [The priest] slaughtered the sacrificial animal for the correct purpose with the intent of casting its blood [on the altar] after sunset which is not the time at which its blood may be cast, with intent of offering a portion of it that was fit to be offered on the altar's pyre] on the next day, after dawn, which is not the time when it may be offered, or to partake of a portion of it that is fit to be eaten after the time when it is fit to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Most sacrifices must be eaten on the day they were offered and on the following night. Certain others may also be eaten on the following day.</i> These are all examples of "intents [to offer a sacrifice] at an [improper] time." Sacrifices [that were slaughtered] with such an intent are called sacrifices that were slaughtered outside their proper time. They are also referred to be the term <i>piggul</i>. This is the meaning of the term <i>piggul</i> mentioned in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:18; 19:7. The term has the implication of "rejected" (<i>Targum Onkelos</i>) and "abhorrent" (Rav Saadia Gaon).</i>
According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra</i> to the verse quoted; <i>Zevachim</i> 29a; see the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 3:3).</i> we learned that the Torah's statements [Leviticus 7:18]: "If some of the meat of the peace-offering was eaten on the third day," [should not be interpreted literally]. Instead, it is speaking about one who has the intent while offering the sacrifice that it will be eaten on the third day.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the verse states: "if it was eaten on the third day, it is unacceptable." Peace-offerings may be eaten only for two days. The Oral Tradition explains that the intent is not that eating the sacrifice on the third day disqualifies it, but that having the intent that it be eaten on the third day while offering disqualifies it from the outset.<br>Although this interpretation is communicated by the Oral Tradition, there are allusions to it in the Torah's words. The above verse uses the term: "the one who offers it," implying that the disqualification involves the offering. And it uses the phrase <i>venechshav</i> ("and it will be considered"), implying that the disqualification has to do with thought.</i> The same applies with regard to every sacrifice that, while offering it, one had the intent to partake of it after the time that is appropriate to partake of that type of sacrifice.<br>Similarly, [the sacrifice is disqualified] if one had the intent to offer portions of it that are fit to be offered on the altar's pyre after the time appropriate for them to be offered. According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 28b explains that since the above verse uses a twofold construction for the term "eat," <i>haechol yaechol</i>, our Sages interpreted it as referring to two types of consumption: consumption by the altar and consumption by man.</i> the following concept was derived: With regard to both consumption by man and consumption by the altar, if one had the intent that [sacrifices] be consumed after the appropriate time, the sacrifice is considered as <i>piggul</i>.
When, however, a sacrifice was not disqualified because of an improper intent, but instead, its blood was cast on the altar in the proper manner, but it remained after the time allotted for it to be eaten, the portion that remains is considered <i>notar</i>. It is forbidden to eat it,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 18, Halachah 10, for more details regarding this prohibition.</i> but the sacrifice was already accepted and atonement was achieved. It is written with regard to the blood [of a sacrifice, Leviticus 17:11]: "And I gave it to you upon the altar to bring atonement." [Implied is that] since the blood reached the altar according to law, the owners achieved atonement and the sacrifice was acceptable. Therefore the concept of <i>piggul</i> applies only to entities that possess services that will enable [them to be consumed] either by men or by the altar, as will be explained.<br>The same laws apply if one had one of these three disqualifying intents when slaughtering a sacrifice, receiving its blood, taking its blood to the altar, or casting it on the altar.
We derive from the above that it is with regard to these four services that a sacrifice can be disqualified because of an [improper] intent: slaughter, receiving the blood, bringing it [to the altar], and casting it on the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that these four services are necessities for the offering of a sacrifice (<i>Zevachim</i> 1:4.)</i>
A fowl [can be disqualified because of an improper intent] in two services: <i>melikah</i> and squeezing out the blood [on the altar].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 6:7), the Rambam writes that performing <i>melikah</i> is equivalent to slaughter and squeezing a fowl's blood on the altar equivalent to casting an animal's blood. In this instance, there are no parallels to receiving the blood or carrying it to the altar.</i>
The meal-offerings from which a handful is taken [can be disqualified because of an improper intent] in four services: taking the handful, placing the handful in a sacred utensil, bringing the utensil to the altar, and casting it on the pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For these four services are comparable to the four services mentioned in Halachah 4 (<i>Zevachim</i> 13b). As the Rambam writes in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 1:3) separating the handful is equivalent to ritual slaughter and the handful of meal, equivalent to the blood of a sacrificial animal.</i>
If, however, one had an improper intent while performing services other than these: e.g., one had such an intent when skinning [sacrificial animal], when cutting it into pieces, when bringing its internal organs and fats to altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">All of these services are not essential to the offering of a sacrifice. Even if they are not performed, the sacrifice is acceptable.</i> when mixing [the oil and flour of] a meal-offering, when bringing it close to the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">These services are performed before taking the handful. Thus it is comparable to the services performed before slaughter which do not disqualify an animal.</i> or the like, that [improper] intent is of no consequence. [This applies] whether it is an intent [to offer a sacrifice] for a different purpose, an intent [to offer or partake of the sacrifice] in an [improper] place, or an intent [to offer or partake of the sacrifice] at an [improper] time.
Similarly, if when performing one of these four tasks or all of them, one has an [improper] intent other than these three intents, that undesirable intent does not disqualify [a sacrifice] at all.<br>What is implied?

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offers a resolution of the passage according to the Rambam's understanding.</i>

Chapter 14

[With regard to the intent that could disqualify a sacrifice:] The only intent that is significant is that of the person performing the Temple service. The intent of the person bringing the sacrifice is of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Note the parallel in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 2:22.</i> Even when we heard that the owner had an intent which would cause the sacrifice to be considered as <i>piggul</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 22:7 states that even if the owner "sits and thinks [unacceptable intents] the entire day," the sacrifice is not disqualified.</i> if the person performing the Temple service had the proper intent, the sacrifice is acceptable.
The intent of [the person performing sacrificial service] is significant only when he is fit to perform this service, he is performing service with an entity fit for service, and is doing so in a place fit for service.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam proceeds to define each of these concepts.</i><br>What is implied? If a person who is unfit for Temple service receives the blood, brings it to the altar, or casts it on the altar and at the time he is performing this service has an unacceptable intent with regard to place or time, his intent does not disqualify the sacrifice, because he is not fit to perform Temple service.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For these undesirable intents disqualify a sacrifice only when they alone are the factors that disqualify it and not when it is disqualified for other reasons [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 3:1)].</i> The blood that he received or a portion that remained after he cast some [on the altar] should be poured into the drainage canal.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For it is disqualified and must be disposed.</i> If "the blood of the soul" remains [within the animal], a person who is fit to perform Temple service should receive it with a proper intent.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He should then bring it to the altar and cast it upon it. The sacrifice is then acceptable. As stated in Chapter 1, Halachot 27-28, the rationale is that "individuals who are unacceptable for Temple service do not cause the remainder of the blood to be considered as remnants." Hence it is as if the blood of the sacrifice had never been taken.</i><br>If, however, a person who is unfit for Temple service has a disqualifying intent at the time he slaughters [the animal], he disqualifies it with his intent, because ritual slaughter is acceptable if performed by an unfit person, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 1.</i><br>They are sacrifices that are acceptable if they are offered for an intent other than specified originally,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., a burnt-offering is offered with the intent that it is a peace-offering.</i> as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 15, Halachah 1.</i> Therefore, [in those instances,] if a priest who is not fit for Temple service receives the blood, carries it, or casts it on the altar, he disqualifies the sacrifice as if he offered it for the desired intent in which instance, it would be disqualified. Even if "the blood of the soul" remains and it was received by an acceptable [priest] and cast on the altar, the sacrifice was already disqualified. It was not disqualified because it was offered for a different purpose, but because [service] was performed by someone unfit for service, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam is implying that since the sacrifice is acceptable in these instances, even though in other instances, such a change in intent would disqualify it, a person who is not fit for Temple service is considered just like one who is. His intent is significant and could disqualify the sacrifice. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, questions on what the Rambam bases this principle.</i>
What is meant [by the concept that these principles apply only with regard] to "performing service with an entity fit for service"? [For example,] if a handful was taken from the meal-offering of the <i>omer</i> without the proper intent,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., with the intent that it be offered as another type of meal-offering.</i> it is considered as if it was taken with the proper intent and the remnants are eaten. [The rationale is that] it is offered from barley and barley is not a substance fit for other offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., all of the other meal-offerings were brought from wheat and thus the barley used for the <i>omer</i> offering is unfit to be used for other meal-offerings. Hence even if one had the intent to offer it as another type of offering, that intent is of no consequence. (The meal-offering of a <i>sotah</i> is also brought from barley, but there are fundamental differences between it and the <i>omer</i> offering.)<br>The Rambam's understanding is based on his understanding of <i>Menachot</i> 5b which states that the <i>omer</i> offering is a <i>chidush</i>, something new and different than other meal-offerings, for it is from barley, as explained. The Ra'avad follows a different version of the text which states that the <i>omer</i> offering is different, because it is brought from <i>chadash</i>, wheat from the new harvest.<br>There is an advantage to the Ra'avad's understanding, because - as he explains - according to the Rambam, the same rationale could seemingly be used with regard to the <i>sotah</i> offering mentioned in the second clause of the halachah. There would be no necessity to mention frankincense. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> favors the Rambam's version and explains that by mentioning frankincense, our Sages (and the Rambam) chose one of two possible answers. They could also have stated that it is unfit to be used for other offerings.</i><br>Similarly, if one had a [disqualifying] intent with regard to the meal-offering of envy<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The term used by Numbers 5:15,18 to describe the meal-offering brought by a woman suspected of adultery.</i> while frankincense was on it, before the frankincense was removed,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to place frankincense on this offering (Numbers 5:15 . Thus before the offering is brought, the frankincense must be removed and until it is removed, the offering is not fit. Hence, whatever intent the person has concerning the offering at that time is of no consequence.</i> there is no consequence to that intent, because [it does not involve] an entity fit for service. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
What is meant [by the concept that these principles apply only with regard to "performing service] in a place fit for service"? When the altar has become damaged and [the priest offering the sacrifice] had a [disqualifying] intent with regard to the time or place [the sacrifice was to be offered or eaten], he did not disqualify the sacrifice with this intent,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">And it may be offered when the altar is repaired.</i> because the place was not fit for Temple service at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if he had this intent while performing service in the Temple Courtyard. Since the altar is not fit for sacrifices to be offered upon it, the place is not considered as fit for service.</i><br>If one took a handful of flour from a meal-offering outside the Temple Courtyard and had a [disqualifying] intent with regard to the time or place [the meal-offering was to be offered or eaten] while taking the handful, the intent is of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Because the act was performed outside the Temple Courtyard, a place where sacrificial service may not be performed.</i>
These are elements of sacrificial [animals] that are not fit to be eaten, but are fit to be offered on the altar's pyre:<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The definitions given in this and the following two halachot are necessary to understand the laws stated in Halachot 8-10 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> its blood,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have noted that the Rambam's wording is not exact, for although the blood is presented on the altar, it is not "offered on the altar's pyre."</i> its <i>eimorim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The fats and organs offered on the altar (see <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 1:18).</i> the meat of a burnt-offering, and the handful of meal and the frankincense from the meal-offerings from which such a handful is removed.

All of the above are not significant with regard to an intent [that could disqualify] sacrifices. They are considered as a matter that is not fit to be eaten.
A [disqualifying] intent is significant [even though] it concerns an entity that ultimately will be destroyed or that will ultimately be burnt.<br>If, while performing any or all of the four [significant] services,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 2 above.</i> one has a [disqualifying] intent - whether concerning the place or the time - to partake of an entity that is not usually eaten or to offer on the altar's pyre an entity that is not usually offered there, the sacrifice is acceptable.<br>What is implied?

Any of the sacrifices - whether individual sacrifices or communal sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The mention of communal sacrifices represents a change of mind for the Rambam. In his original version of his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 1:1, which is preserved in the standard printing of that text), he writes that a communal sacrifice slaughtered for a different intent fulfills the community's obligation. Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura also follows this view. In his later years, however, the Rambam emended his text to agree with this ruling (see Rav Kapach's text). Note also Rabbi Akiva Eiger's gloss who questions the initial version of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah.</i> - that were sacrificed for a different purpose than that for which they were originally designated are acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, even if one slaughtered an animal designated as a burnt-offering for the sake of a sin-offering, one should continue performing all the subsequent tasks for the sake of a burnt-offering [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>op. cit.</i>)]. See Halachah 3.</i> but they did not satisfy the obligation incumbent on their owner with the exception of a sin-offering and the Paschal sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 3 which explains why these offerings are singled out in contrast to all others.</i> If they are offered for a different purpose, they are unacceptable. [This applies whether] one changes the purpose of the sacrifice at the time of slaughter, at the time he receives its blood, at the time he brings it to the altar, or when he casts it upon it, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 13, Halachah 4.</i><br>What is meant by saying that [the owner] does not fulfill his obligation through such [a sacrifice]? For example, one slaughtered [an animal designated as] a burnt-offering as a peace-offering. It does not fulfill the obligation of the owner, neither for the burnt-offering for which he is obligated or for a sin-offering. Instead, he is obligated to bring another sacrifice.

The <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> questions the Rambam's equation of sacrifices offered for a different purpose than they were originally designated and those offered for the sake of a different person. There is, he explains, a fundamental difference between them. If one slaughters an animal for the sake of another person, the owner is still considered to have fulfilled his obligation. It is only when the blood is cast on the altar for the sake of another person that he is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Nevertheless, the Rambam's statements can be interpreted as referring to an instance when one slaughtered the animal with the intent to cast its blood on the altar for the sake of another person.</i><br>When does the above apply? When one changed the purpose of the sacrifice intentionally. If, however, one erred and had the impression that the [animal designated as] a burnt-offering was [designated as] a peace-offering and carried out all of its services for the sake of a peace-offering, the owner is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.

It is forbidden to have an incorrect intent [when performing sacrificial service with] consecrated animals, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 18, Halachah 1.</i> Therefore if one slaughtered a sacrificial animal for a different purpose or took a handful from a meal-offering for a different purpose, whether intentionally or unintentionally, he is obligated to complete the remainder of the services for the proper purpose. Even if one slaughtered [the animal], received its blood, and brought it to the altar for an improper purpose, one is obligated to cast it on the altar for the proper purpose.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that since the sacrifice is acceptable, its functions must be performed for the proper intent.</i><br>Why are the laws governing a sin-offering and the Paschal sacrifice different from those governing all other sacrifices and the laws governing a meal-offering of a sinner and that of a <i>sotah</i> different from those governing all other meal-offerings? Because the Torah singled them out. With regard to a sin-offering, [Leviticus 4:33] states: "And he shall slaughter it as a sin-offering," i.e., that it must be slaughtered for the sake of a sin-offering. Similarly, all of its other services [must be performed] for the proper intent, as [implied by <i>ibid.</i>:28]: "for his sin," i.e., that its service must be performed for the sake of [atoning for] that sin. And [<i>ibid.</i>:26] states: "And he will atone for him," i.e., [the service must be performed] for the sake of its owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 7a interprets the phrase cited as implying: for him and not for his colleague. See Halachah 8.</i><br>And with regard to the Paschal sacrifice, [Deuteronomy 16:1] states: "And you shall offer a Paschal sacrifice to God, your Lord," implying that all of the acts must be performed for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice. [Exodus 12:27] states: "And you shall say, 'It is a Paschal sacrifice unto God,' implying that it must be slaughtered for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice. Thus if one altered the purpose for which it was sacrificed or [offered for] a different owner,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 1:1), the Rambam states that the first verse teaches that the offering must be brought as a Paschal sacrifice and the second, that it must be brought for the sake of its owner. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 5:2), the Rambam quotes the Jerusalem Talmud which mentions only the second verse and states that a Paschal sacrifice that is not offered for the proper purpose is unacceptable. See also Halachah 11.</i> it is not acceptable.<br>And with regard to the meal-offering of a sinner, [Leviticus 5:12] states: "It is a sin-offering."<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Our text reflects an amended version. The standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> contains a different prooftext.</i> And with regard to the meal-offering of a <i>sotah</i>, [Numbers 5:15] states: "It is a meal-offering [resulting from] envy." [The implication is that] all of the actions associated with them must be performed for that purpose.
When a sin-offering is offered for the sake of another sacrifice, e.g., it was offered for the sake of a burnt-offering, a guilt-offering, or a peace-offering, it is unacceptable, as we explained. If, however, it was slaughtered as an ordinary animal, it is acceptable, but the owner does not fulfill his obligation.
According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 46b derives this principle through Biblical exegesis.</i> it was derived that [an intent for] sacrificial purposes can disqualify sacrificial animals, but an intent for ordinary purposes does not.
If one slaughtered [an animal designated as a sin-offering to atone] for another sin, e.g., it was brought [to atone] for partaking of fat and one slaughtered it [to atone] for partaking of blood, it is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even though it was slaughtered as a sin-offering, since it was not slaughtered for the sake of the sin for which the animal was originally designated, it is unacceptable.</i>
If one slaughtered [an animal designated as a sin-offering to atone] for the sake of another person who was obligated to bring a sin-offering, even an adjustable guilt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is a different type of sacrifice, one might think that the situation is comparable to that stated in the following halachah, slaughtering a sin-offering for the sake of a person obligated to bring a burnt-offering. Nevertheless, since both offerings atone for sins punishable by <i>karet</i>, they are considered as comparable. Hence the sacrifice is disqualified (Rashi, <i>Zevachim</i> 9b).</i> it is unacceptable.
If, however, one slaughtered it for the sake of another person who was obligated to bring a burnt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">To atone for the failure to observe a positive commandment.</i> it is acceptable, but the owner has not fulfilled his obligation.<br>[The concept mentioned previously<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the law stated in Halachah 7. From this concept, it is also possible to derive the law stated in this halachah, for the implication is that when one offers a sin-offering for the sake of another person who is obligated to bring a sin-offering, it is disqualified, but not when one offers it for the sake of another person who is not so obligated (<i>Zevachim</i> 7a).</i> derived from Leviticus 4:26:] "And he will atone for him," [i.e., "for him,"] and not for his colleague who is obligated to bring a sin-offering like he is.
If one slaughtered [an animal designated as a sin-offering] for the sake of a deceased person, it is acceptable, but it does not satisfy the obligation of the owner, because there is no atonement for the dead [through sacrifices].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the deceased person is not considered as obligated to bring a sacrifice. Therefore, this is not considered as an instance where one offered a sacrifice for the sake of another person obligated to bring a sacrifice.</i><br>If one slaughtered it for the sake of a person who is not obligated to bring a sacrifice at all, not a sin-offering, nor a burnt-offering, nor any other sacrifice, it is unacceptable. [The rationale is that] perhaps he is obligated [to bring a sacrifice],<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">A burnt-offering to atone for the failure to observe a positive commandment.</i> but does not know.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he is considered to be obligated to bring a sacrifice.<br><i>Zevachim</i> 71-7b explains that there is a difference between such a situation and a person who knows he is obligated to bring a burnt-offering (in which instance, the sin-offering is not disqualified, as stated in the previous halachah). When the person knows he must bring a burnt-offering, his atonement is associated with that offering only. When, however, he does not know that he must bring a burnt-offering, he will not seek atonement. Hence, the sin-offering he brings will bring him a certain measure of atonement for the positive commandments he did not perform. For as stated in Halachah 14, everyone has certain positive commandments that he has failed to fulfill.</i>
If one slaughtered [a sacrificial animal] with the desired intent, but at the time of slaughter had the intent to cast its blood on the altar for a different purpose, it is disqualified, for the intent one has for one service during the performance of another service [is significant].<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> restricts the scope of the Rambam's statements, maintaining that if at the time of slaughter or the performance of one of the other three services mentioned in Halachah 2, one has a disqualifying intent concerning receiving the blood or bringing it to the altar, the sacrifice is still acceptable.</i> Thus the intent one had during the time of slaughter is considered as if it was in [the priest's] mind at the time he cast [the blood on the altar]. Therefore [the sacrifice] is disqualified.
A Paschal sacrifice that was slaughtered for a different intent - whether for the sake of another sacrifice or whether as an ordinary animal<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question the Rambam's ruling, because even a sin-offering is acceptable when slaughtered as an ordinary animal. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the phrase "unto God" in the prooftext excludes slaughtering the animal for ordinary purposes. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 5:2), the Rambam cites the Jerusalem Talmud which states that the phrase "And you shall say, 'It is a Paschal sacrifice' excludes all other intents.</i> - it is unacceptable, as it is written: "And you shall say, 'It is a Paschal sacrifice unto God,'<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 1 and 3.</i><br>When does the above apply? When it was slaughtered on its appropriate time, the day of the fourteenth of Nisan. Moreover, even if it was slaughtered in the morning of that day<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Paschal sacrifice may not be sacrificed until the afternoon of the fourteenth of Nisan.

The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam maintaining that the more lenient opinion should be accepted. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam accepted the more stringent view because it is debated in the Talmud.</i> If, however, one slaughtered it with a different intent at a time not appropriate for its [sacrifice], it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For if it was slaughtered at such a time, it is considered as a peace-offering and a peace-offering that was slaughtered with a different intent is acceptable.<br>In the clause which follows, the sacrifice is unacceptable, because there is no one to partake of it and a Paschal sacrifice is brought only to be eaten (<i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i>, ch. 2).</i><br>[If it was slaughtered] for the sake of others and not for its owner, it is considered as if it did not have an owner on the day [when it should be sacrificed] and it is unacceptable.
When a Paschal sacrifice was slaughtered with the proper intent on the fourteenth of Nisan before noon, it is unacceptable, because this is not the time of the sacrifice. If it was older than one year<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">At this age, it is no longer fit to be offered as a Paschal sacrifice.</i> and it was slaughtered at the appropriate time for the sake of a Paschal sacrifice and similarly, if one of the other sacrifices were slaughtered for the sake of a Paschal sacrifice, even if it was slaughtered after noon, they are acceptable, but the owners do not fulfill their obligation.
When a thanksgiving-offering is slaughtered for the sake of a peace-offering, the owner's obligation is fulfilled. When a peace-offering is slaughtered for the sake of a thanksgiving-offering, the owner's obligation is not fulfilled. [The rationale is that] a thanksgiving-offering is called a peace-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Leviticus 7:15 which speaks of "the thanksgiving-peace sacrifice."</i> but a peace-offering is not called a thanksgiving-offering.
When a burnt-offering was slaughtered for the sake of another person who was not obligated to bring a sacrifice at all, the owner does not fulfill his obligation,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">For it is considered to have atoned for the person for whose sake it was sacrificed, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> for it was not slaughtered for his sake.

When the two sheep to be brought on Shavuot were slaughtered with the intent that they were rams,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 8:1, together with the two loaves brought on Shavuot are offered several burnt offerings, among them two rams, and two sheep as communal peace-offerings.</i> the community is not considered to have fulfilled its obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">And two other sheep must be brought.</i> If [the priests] thought they were rams and slaughtered them with the intent that they were rams, they are considered to have fulfilled their obligation, for the intent was uprooted in error.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 1.</i>
When a guilt-offering of a person [to be purified from] <i>tzara'at</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">A skin malady similar to, but not identical to leprosy that renders one ritually impure.</i> was slaughtered for the sake of another type of sacrifice or its blood was not placed on the thumb and large toe of the person seeking atonement,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 4:2.</i> accompanying offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>, ch. 2.</i> are required.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the person has not fulfilled his obligation and must bring another sacrifice, he is required to bring the accompanying offerings, for the reason mentioned by the Rambam.</i> For if it was offered without accompanying offerings, it would be as if one offered a freewill offering.

When the sheep that is brought together with the <i>omer</i> offering<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 7:3.</i> was slaughtered for a different intent, one should not bring two <i>esronim</i> for its accompanying offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As would be required were it offered for the specified intent (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 2:5).</i> Instead, he should bring one <i>isaron</i>, as is brought for other freewill offerings.

When the sheep offered on Shavout<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 8:1, together with the two loaves brought on Shavuot are offered several burnt offerings, among them two rams, and two sheep as communal peace-offerings.</i> were slaughtered for a different intent or were slaughtered before their appropriate time or after their appropriate time, the blood should be cast upon the altar and the meat eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that it is forbidden to offer the <i>eimorim</i> on the festival and question whether the intent is that the meat may be eaten on the festival or whether it is necessary to wait until the evening.</i> even though the obligation of the community was not fulfilled.

Chapter 16

We have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 13, Halachah 1.</i> that when a person has a disqualifying intent with regard to the place [a sacrifice will be offered or eaten] while performing one of the four [specified] services,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Slaughter, receiving the blood, bringing it to the altar, and casting it on the altar, as stated in Chapter 13, Halachah 4, and in the following halachah.</i> the sacrifice is disqualified, but it is not <i>piggul</i>. If he had a disqualifying intent with regard to the time [the sacrifice would be offered or eaten], it is <i>piggul</i>.<br>When does the above apply? When no other intent is combined together with the intent concerning time. If, however, an intent concerning the place - or with regard to the Paschal sacrifice or a sin-offering, an intent concerning the type of sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is that with regard to other sacrifices which are not disqualified when slaughtered for another purpose, if there was a disqualifying intent concerning time, the fact that they were slaughtered for a different purpose does not prevent them from being considered as <i>piggul</i>.</i> - was combined with the intent concerning time, the sacrifice is disqualified, but it is not <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 18, Halachot 3 and 6, when a sacrifice is merely disqualified, a person who partakes of its meat is liable for lashes. If, however, it is deemed <i>piggul</i>, he is liable for <i>karet</i>, a much more serious punishment.</i><br>What is implied? If one slaughtered, received [the blood], brought it [to the altar], and cast it [on the altar] with a [disqualifying] intent concerning time or [even if] he had a [disqualifying] intent concerning time while [perfoming] one of these services and his intent was proper or he had no intent while performing the other services, [the sacrifice] was <i>piggul</i>. If, however, one slaughtered with a [disqualifying] intent concerning time, but received [the blood], brought it [to the altar], and cast it [on the altar] with a [disqualifying] intent concerning place or slaughtered with a [disqualifying] intent concerning place, but received [the blood], brought it [to the altar], and cast [on the altar] with a [disqualifying] intent concerning time, [the sacrifice] is not <i>piggul</i>, merely disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there is no difference which disqualifying intent a person has first, as long as another intent is mixed together with the intent involving time, the sacrifice is disqualified, but not <i>piggul</i>. In <i>Zevachim</i> 29b, there is a differing opinion which maintains that if the intent involving time is first, the sacrifice is deemed <i>piggul</i> even if there is another disqualifying intent afterwards.</i><br>Similarly, if a Paschal sacrifice or sin-offering were slaughtered for a different purpose, but one received [the blood], brought it [to the altar], and cast it [on the altar] with a [disqualifying] intent concerning time, or one slaughtered with a [disqualifying] intent concerning time, but received [the blood], brought it [to the altar], and cast [on the altar] for a different purpose, [the sacrifice] is not <i>piggul</i>, merely disqualified.<br>The same principles apply with regard to offerings of fowl and meal-offerings. The term <i>piggul</i> applies only when a sacrifice is disqualified because of an intent concerning time, without a [disqualifying] intent concerning place combined with it, neither at the outset or at the end, nor is an intent concerning the type of sacrifice combined with it with regard to those sacrifices that are disqualified when offered for a different purpose.
When, while performing one or all of the four services, a person has the intent to eat<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">More precisely, that the meat be eaten whether by himself or by someone else.</i> an olive-sized portion of a substance that is fit to be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 14, Halachah 8.</i> outside [the limits of where it may be eaten] and an olive-sized portion on the following day;<br>an olive-sized portion on the following day and an olive-sized portion outside [the limits of where it may be eaten],<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Both of these situations are examples where a disqualifying intent involving place is combined with a disqualifying intent concerning time.</i><br>half an olive-sized portion outside [the limits of where it may be eaten] and half an olive-sized portion on the following day, or<br>half an olive-sized portion on the following day and half an olive-sized portion outside [the limits of where it may be eaten],<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Chapter 14, Halachah 10, to disqualify a sacrifice one must have an intent concerning an olive-sized portion.

Similarly, if one combined another disqualifying intent regarding offering [a sacrifice with one regarding time, the sacrifice] is disqualified, but not <i>piggul</i>.
If one had the intent to eat or to offer half an olive-sized portion with a [disqualifying] intent concerning place and to eat or to offer an olive-sized portion with a [disqualifying] intent concerning time, [the sacrifice] is <i>piggul</i>. [This applies] whether the [disqualifying] intent concerning the olive-sized portion was first or last. [The rationale is that] half an olive-sized portion is not significant in relation to an olive-sized portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous halachah, the half portion was considered significant, because there was no olive-sized portion present and it can be combined with another half portion. In this halachah, there is an olive-sized portion present. Hence, nothing concerning the smaller portion is significant.<br>The commentaries note that the Rambam apparently had a slightly different version of the Talmudic passage that serves as the source for this law than the standard printed text.</i>
If he had a [disqualifying] intent concerning time with regard to half an olive-sized portion and a [disqualifying] intent concerning place with regard to [another] half an olive-sized portion, and then a [disqualifying] intent concerning time with regard to [another] half an olive-sized portion, [the sacrifice] is <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the same law mentioned in the previous halachah applies in this instance as well. The fact that - had the person not had the second disqualifying intent concerning time, the first half portion would have been combined with the second half portion is not of consequence Ravva (<i>Zevachim</i> 31a) states lyrically: "The <i>piggul</i> arises, like one rising from sleep.".</i><br>Similarly, if one had a [disqualifying] intent concerning time with regard to half an olive-sized portion and then a [disqualifying] intent with regard to an olive-sized portion: with regard to half, a [disqualifying] intent concerning time, and with regard to the other half, a [disqualifying] intent concerning place, [the sacrifice] is <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Although the second disqualifying intent combines an intent concerning place and one concerning time and thus there is room to think that they cannot be separated from each other, the two intents concerning time are considered as one unit and the intent concerning place is disregarded.</i>
If one had an intent to present blood that should be presented on the lower portion [of the altar] on the upper portion [of the altar] or he had an intent to present [blood] that should be presented on the upper portion [of the altar] on the lower portion [of the altar] or the like, [these] intents that do not disqualify [a sacrifice], as explained;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachah 10.</i> if one combined a [disqualifying] intent concerning time, [the sacrifice] is <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since these intents are not significant, they do not prevent the sacrifice from being considered as <i>piggul</i>.</i> If he combined a [disqualifying] intent concerning place alone,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this word is problematic, because even if a disqualifying intent concerning time is also combined, the sacrifice is not <i>piggul</i>.</i> [the sacrifice] is unacceptable, but it is not <i>piggul</i>.
If one had an intent to present blood that should be presented on the upper portion [of the altar] on the lower portion on the following day,<br>[an intent] to present blood that should be presented on the upper portion [of the altar] on the lower portion on the following day,<br>he had an intent to present blood that should be presented in the Sanctuary on the outer altar on the following day, or<br>he had an intent to present blood that should be presented on the outer altar in the Sanctuary on the following day, [the sacrifice] is not <i>piggul</i>. Even though he had an intent concerning the time, since he changed the place where the blood was presented in his mind, [the sacrifice] is disqualified, but is not <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Ra'avad's objection follows the interpretation of <i>Zevachim</i> 27a advanced by Rashi. The Rambam, he maintains, has a different understanding of that Talmudic passage.<br>It is possible to distinguish between the situations mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in the previous halachah as follows: In the situations mentioned here, the very same thought which concerned the place where the blood of the sacrifice would be offered concerned also its time.</i><br>Since we have explained in these halachot<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachah 10.</i> that when blood is presented in a place other than the desired place, it is considered as if it was presented in the desired place, why is [the sacrifice] not considered as <i>piggul</i> because of this intent to present the blood outside of its desired place on the following day? [The rationale is that] even though the sacrifice is acceptable, since the blood was not presented in its proper place, it does not cause the meat to be permitted to be eaten, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachah 10.</i> [There is a general principle:] In any situation where blood is cast upon [the altar, but it] does cause the meat to be permitted to be eaten, if one had the intent to present it at a time [after the prescribed time], it is not <i>piggul</i>. Therefore, [in the circumstances mentioned above,] if one had a [disqualifying] intent concerning time with regard to this sacrifice, it is unacceptable, but it is not <i>piggul</i>.
If a person had a disqualifying intent concerning time at the time he took [the handful of flour from a meal-offering], but did not have such an intent at the time he collected the frankincense or he had a disqualifying intent concerning time at the time he collected the frankincense, but did not have such an intent at the time he took [the handful of flour, the meal-offering] is disqualified, but is not <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Although the priest had a disqualifying intent while performing one of these acts, we do not say that he had the same intent concerning the other unless he explicitly had such a thought.</i> [An offering becomes <i>piggul</i>] only when one has a disqualifying intent with regard to all [the substances which] cause it to be permitted [to be eaten], i.e., the handful of meal and the frankincense, at the time the handful is taken and the frankincense is collected, or when they are both placed into a sacred utensil, brought [to the altar], or cast [upon its pyre].
If at the time he cast the handful [of meal] on the altar's pyre, he had the intent to offer the frankincense on the following day, it is not <i>piggul</i>, because an intent to offer something on the altar's pyres while offering something else on the pyre does not cause the offering to be <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For, as stated in Chapter 13, Halachah 6, a disqualifying intent concerning time causes a meal-offering to be considered <i>piggul</i> only when one thinks of it while performing one of the four services mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> Similarly, if one offered only the frankincense or only the handful [of meal] and had the intent to eat the remainder on the following day, [the meal-offering] is disqualified, but is not <i>piggul</i>. [The rationale is that a disqualifying intent involving only] half [the substances which] cause an offering to be permitted [to be eaten], does not cause it to be considered as <i>piggul</i>.<br>If, [by contrast,] one offered only the handful [of meal] and had the intent to offer the frankincense on the following day and afterwards offered the frankincense and had the intent to partake of the remainder [of the offering] on the following day, [the offering] is <i>piggul</i>, for the [disqualifying] intent concerning time has spread throughout the entire meal-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Even though neither of the intents in their own right would cause the sacrifice to be considered as <i>piggul</i>, when combined, they have this effect.<br>To explain: Until the frankincense is offered, it is forbidden to partake of the remaining portions of the meal-offering. Thus having the intent to offer the frankincense on the following day is equivalent to having the intent to partake of the remainder of the offering on the following day.</i>
If one offered a portion of the handful [of meal] the size of a sesame seed together with the frankincense with the intent that he eat a sesame seed-sized portion of the remainder [of the offering] on the following day, [even if] he continues offering the entire handful [of meal] with the frankincense with [the same disqualifying] intent concerning time, [the meal-offering] is disqualified, but is not <i>piggul</i>. [The rationale is that] even though eating little by little is an ordinary manner of eating,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by Chapter 14, Halachah 10, which states that if one had the intent to eat an olive-sized portion in an extended interval, he can be held liable.</i> this is not the ordinary manner in which entities are offered on the altar. Instead, it is like a meal-offering whose handful was not offered on the altar's pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion concerning this instance in <i>Menachot</i> 16b. One sage maintains that the offering is acceptable. One maintains that it is <i>piggul</i>, and one rules as the Rambam rules here. The Rambam accepts that view, because there are a majority of opinions, negating either of the extremes (see <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
When there was frankincense placed on the meal-offering of a sinner or that of a <i>sotah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Even though there are explicit negative commandments not to place frankincense on these offerings. See Chapter 14, Halachah 3; Chapter 11, Halachah 10.</i> and one had a [disqualifying] intent involving time before the frankincense was removed, [the offerings] are disqualified, but are not <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Because the offering is not fit to be brought on the altar until the frankincense is removed.</i> If after he collected the frankincense he had a [disqualifying] intent concerning time with regard to the offering, it is <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Because the offering is fit to be brought on the altar.</i>
If the remaining portion [of a meal-offering] was diminished between the time the handful was taken and it was offered on the altar and then the handful was offered with a [disqualifying] intent concerning time, there is a doubt whether it was established [as fit to become] <i>piggul</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For the handful is fit to be offered on the altar. Hence if one has a disqualifying intent while placing the handful in a sacred vessel, bringing it to the altar, or offering it on the altar's pyre, there is room to say that it is <i>piggul</i>. (See Rashi, <i>Menachot</i> 12a.)</i> and thus it is <i>piggul</i> or it was not established<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For it is unfit to partake of such a meal-offering.</i> and it is not <i>piggul</i>.

Chapter 17

Whenever blood must be presented on the outer altar and the first presentation was made with a proper intent and a second or further presentation was made for the sake of a different sacrifice or he had a [disqualifying] intent with regard to place or time, atonement is achieved and the sacrifice is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the person(s) bringing the sacrifice are not required to bring another one.</i><br>If the first presentation [of blood] was made with a [disqualifying] intent with regard to time and [the priest] completed the presentation of the blood with a [disqualifying] intent with regard to place, [the sacrifice] is <i>piggul</i>. [The rationale is that] the first presentation of the blood is of fundamental importance.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.<br>Chapter 16, Halachah 1, states that when a disqualifying intent concerning place is combined with a disqualifying intent concerning time, the sacrifice is disqualified, but is not <i>piggul</i>. In the present instance, it is placed in the more severe category, because once the fundamental presentation was made in a manner that rendered the sacrifice <i>piggul</i>, the subsequent intentions the priest had are of no consequence.</i><br>In contrast, with regard to all of the presentations of blood on the inner altar - since they are all absolute requirements [for the offering of the sacrifice], as we explained<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachah 3.</i> - if one of presentations was not made as required, but instead, one had a disqualifying intent, the sacrifice is unacceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">However, it is not <i>piggul</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that it is not considered <i>piggul</i> because one must have the disqualifying intent concerning time when performing all of the presentations.</i> even if all the other presentations were made as required.
If one had a [disqualifying] intent with regard to time when making the first [of the presentations of the blood on the inner altar]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:7.</i> and had no specific intent<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the Rambam's words mean: "Remained silent with regard to the others."</i> regarding the remainder or he presented all of them as required with the exception of the final one, which he presented with a [disqualifying] intent with regard to time, [the sacrifice] is disqualified, but it is not <i>piggul</i>. [It is not given that distinction] unless one makes [all] the presentations with a [disqualifying] intent with regard to time, for they are all considered as one presentation.
[Having a disqualifying intent while] immersing one's finger in the blood of a sin-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>:8.</i> [whose blood is offered] on the inner altar can cause a sacrifice to become <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that this ruling appears to run contrary to the statements of <i>Zevachim</i> 44a: "If one had a disqualifying intent that would render an offering <i>piggul</i> inside the Sanctuary, the offering is not <i>piggul</i>." <i>Rambam LeAm</i> suggests that Rabbi Elazar the author of the statement cited does not accept the concept that one's intent when immersing one's finger in the blood can cause an offering to be considered as <i>piggul</i>. If, however, he would have accepted that concept, he would also have accepted the Rambam's ruling here.</i><br>What is implied? If at the time [the priest] immersed his finger in the blood, he had a disqualifying intent concerning time, it is as if he had such an intent when presenting [the blood on the altar].
If a priest was standing in the Temple Courtyard and he had a disqualifying intent concerning time with regard to one of the sin-offerings [whose blood is offered] on the inner altar with regard to an aspect of the sacrifice that is performed in the Sanctuary, [the offering] is not <i>piggul</i>. If he had such an intent with regard to an aspect that is performed in the Temple Courtyard, it is <i>piggul</i>.
What is implied? If a priest was standing in the Temple Courtyard and said: "I am slaughtering [this animal] with the intent of presenting its blood tomorrow,"<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">When they should be presented on the day the sacrificial animal is slaughtered.</i> [the offering] is not <i>piggul</i>, because presenting the blood is performed inside, in the Sanctuary.
If [a priest] was standing in the Sanctuary and he said: "I am presenting [the blood] with the intent to pour the remaining [blood]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">On the outer altar (see <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:10).</i> on the following day, [the offering] is not <i>piggul</i>, because he had a disqualifying intent inside [the Temple Sanctuary] regarding a service performed outside. If, however, he was standing in the Temple Courtyard and slaughtered [the animal] with the intent to pour out the remainder [of the blood] on the following day or to offer the fats and the organs on the following day, [the offering] is <i>piggul</i>, for he had a [disqualifying] intent while outside concerning a service that is performed outside.
A [disqualifying intent] concerning a thanksgiving-offering causes the bread [that accompanies it] to become <i>piggul</i>, but a [disqualifying intent] concerning the bread does not cause the thanksgiving-offering to become <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For the bread is secondary to and dependent on the sacrifice, but the sacrifice is not dependent on the bread [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 2:3)].

When one slaughtered a thanksgiving-offering and had the intent to partake of its meat, cast its blood on the altar, or offer its fats and organs on the following day, the offering and the bread are <i>piggul</i>. If he had the intent to partake of the bread on the following day, the bread alone is <i>piggul</i>; the thanksgiving-offering is not <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi's commentary to <i>Menachot</i> 15a implies that it is forbidden to eat the meat.

Similar concepts apply with regard to the two sheep offered on Shavuot with the two breads offered with them. If one had a [disqualifying] intent concerning time with regard to the sheep, the two breads are considered as <i>piggul</i>. If he had the intent to partake of the two breads on the following day, the two breads are <i>piggul</i> and the sheep are not <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Here, also, the bread is considered as secondary to the sacrifice, but the sacrifice is not secondary to the meat [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>)].</i> If while performing one of the four [significant] services, [the priest] had the intent to partake of an olive-sized portion of the meat of the sacrifice together with the bread<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., half an olive-sized portion of meat and half an olive-sized portion of bread (Rashi, <i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i>).</i> tomorrow, the bread alone is <i>piggul</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i>, mentions both of the situations spoken about in this halachah. One opinion maintains that the ruling was given both with regard to the bread on Shavuos and the bread of the thanksgiving-offering. A second view maintains that it was given with regard to the breads and the offering of Shavuos, for they are interrelated as evidenced by the fact that they are waved together (Leviticus 23:20 . It is possible, however, that it does not apply to the thanksgiving-offering. The Rambam accepts the more stringent view, because of the doubt involved (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and the thanksgiving-offering or the sheep are not <i>piggul.</i>
When [a priest] offers the two bowls of frankincense that accompany the showbread and, while offering them, had the intent to partake of the showbread on the following day, the bread is <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For it is the offering of the bowls of frankincense that enable the breads to be eaten.</i>

Similarly, if one had a [disqualifying] thought concerning time with regard to one of the breads of the thanksgiving-offering or with regard to one of the breads of meal-offering baked in an oven, all of the breads are <i>piggul</i>.
If, by contrast, one of the two breads [of Shavuot], one of the two arrangements [of the showbread], or one of the breads of the thanksgiving offering<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have noted the apparent contradiction to Chapter 12, Halachah 14.

What is pure may be eaten in its state of purity.
If, while performing the sacrificial service associated with one of the two sheep, [the priest] had the intent to eat an olive-sized portion of the two breads on the following day - and similarly, if while offering one of the two bowls [of frankincense], he had the intent to partake of an olive-sized portion of the showbread on the following day, the bread is disqualified, but it is not <i>piggul</i>. [It is given that distinction] only when he has a [disqualifying] intent while performing all the services that permit the bread to be eaten: [i.e.,] bringing both sheep and offering both bowls [of frankincense] on the altar's pyre.
If one slaughtered one [of the sheep] and had the intent to eat half an olive-sized portion from one loaf on the following day and slaughtered the second lamb and had the intent of eating half an olive-sized portion on the following day, [the two intents] are combined to render the loaves <i>piggul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For he had a disqualifying intent concerning time with regard to the entire offering that would enable the bread to be eaten.</i> Similar concepts apply with regard to the two bowls [of frankincense] and the two arrangements [of showbread].

If one slaughtered one of [these two sheep] and had the intent while slaughtering it to partake of the meat of the other one on the following day, they are both acceptable. For the intent one has with regard to one is of no consequence regarding the second.
The two lambs [offered on] Shavuot do not cause the bread to be sanctified unless they are slaughtered.<br>What is implied? If one slaughtered them and cast their blood [on the altar] for the sake of another sacrifice, he did not sanctify the bread. If he slaughtered them with the proper intent and cast their blood [on the altar] for the sake of another sacrifice, the bread is sanctified, but is not sanctified.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">It appears that the Rambam follows the view of Ravva (<i>Menachot</i> 13b) that bread is considered as consecrated, but it is forbidden to be eaten .</i><br>If they slaughtered it for the sake of another sacrifice even though he cast [the blood] for the proper intent, the bread was not sanctified.
When the two loaves were taken out [of the Temple Courtyard] between the slaughter [of the two sheep] and the casting [of their blood] and the blood of the sheep was cast on the altar with a [disqualifying] intent concerning time, the bread becomes <i>piggul</i> even though it is outside [the Temple Courtyard].

When the two sheep offered on Shavuos were slaughtered with the proper intent and the breads were lost, they are disqualified if their blood was cast [on the altar] with the desired intent.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 8:15, the offering of the bread is a fundamental requirement for the offering of the sheep and if the bread is lost, the sheep should be destroyed by fire.</i> If their blood was cast [on the altar] with a [disqualifying] intent concerning time<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that this is a printing error and the text should read "with an intent for another sacrifice." This view, however, is not borne out by the manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i> after the bread was lost, there is an unresolved doubt if [the meat of the sheep] is permitted to be eaten or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, the Rambam's ruling can be explained as follows: One might think that the meat would be permitted to be eaten, because they are peace-offerings and when a peace-offering is offered for the sake of another offering, it is permitted to be eaten, as stated in Chapter 15, Halachah 1. On the other hand, since the sheep are associated with the bread and the bread is lost, there is room to say that they have been disqualified. A question concerning this issue was raised by <i>Menachot</i> 47b. Rav Yosef Corcus maintains that according to the Rambam, the question was left unresolved. Rashi maintains that the question is rhetorical and that the meat is disqualified.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes, however, that Rabbenu Yehoshua, one of the Rambam's descendants, was asked about the matter and explained the question according to the existing text. According to his view, the issue is that since the blood was cast on the altar after the bread was lost, the Sages had a question whether to consider their meat as ordinary meat or whether the meat should still be considered as sacrificial meat, because the sheep were slaughtered before the bread was lost.</i>

Chapter 18

Anyone who has an incorrect intent [while performing] sacrificial service violates a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The wording used by the Rambam is often employed when referring to one of the 613 mitzvot. Nevertheless, neither in the listing at the beginning of these halachot, nor in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, does he count this charge in that reckoning. The Ramban (in his <i>Hosafot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, negative commandment 4) does give this charge that distinction. <i>Megilat Esther</i> explains that this charge is part of the directive to offer sacrifices in the proper manner and hence need not be considered as a separate mitzvah. See also <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 144) where the issue is discussed.</i> for [Leviticus 7:18] states: "He may not intent this."
According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that included in this prohibition is not to cause sacrificial offerings to be disqualified through thought, for this is comparable to causing a blemish in sacrificial animals. Nevertheless, [a transgressor] is not punished by lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As is one who causes a blemish to sacrificial animals (<i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 1:7).</i> for thought is not considered as deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">And lashes are given only when one violates a transgression while performing a deed (<i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2).</i>
Whenever a sacrifice is defined as unacceptable - whether it was disqualified because of an intent, an action, or something which caused it to be disqualified - anyone who partakes of an olive-sized portion of it intentionally is liable for lashes, as [a result of the prohibition, Deuteronomy 14:3]: "Do not partake of anything abhorrent."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 140) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 469) consider this prohibition as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i>
According to the Oral Tradition, we learned<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Sifri</i> to the verse cited.</i> that the verse was warning solely against [partaking of] sacrificial animals that were disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is emphasizing this point lest one think that the charge also refers to other prohibited substances. This stress is necessary, for otherwise the prohibition could be considered a prohibition of a general nature (<i>lav shebiklalut</i>). Lashes are not given for violating a prohibition of this nature (<i>Hilchot Sanhedrin, loc. cit.</i>).</i>
Similarly, when sacrificial animals which were [intentionally] blemished, a person who eats an olive-sized portion of them is liable for lashes, for they are included in the category of "anything abhorrent." [It is forbidden to partake of them] until they contract another blemish, [at which time,]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">After they have been redeemed. As the <i>Rambam LeAm</i> elaborates, in addition to contracting a blemish, an animal dedicated as a sacrifice must be redeemed before the prohibition against partaking of its meat is lifted. (This constitutes a difference between the laws pertaining to such an animal and a firstborn animal.) Even after the Scriptural prohibition is lifted, there is a Rabbinic prohibition to partake of its meat until it contracts another blemish on its own accord. (This prohibition was instituted as a penalty lest one intentionally inflict such a blemish. See <i>Bechorot</i> 34b.)</i> they may be eaten because of the blemish, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording has aroused the attention of the commentaries, for this law is stated in <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 2:7, where the entire law stated here is mentioned. As such, it would have been more correct for the Rambam to have stated "as will be explained." Some have suggested that the intent here is to the concept that a sacrificial animal that has contracted a blemish may be eaten after being redeemed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 1:10.</i> Whenever there is a unresolved doubt whether [a sacrificial animal] has been disqualified, lashes are not given.
Whenever a sacrifice has been deemed <i>piggul</i> because of a disqualifying intent concerning time, as we explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In various halachot from Chapter 13, Halachah 1, onward.</i> anyone who partakes of an olive-sized portion of it intentionally is liable for <i>karet</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, that the soul is cut off. This involves premature death in this world (before the age of 50, <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 28a) and the soul not meriting a portion in the world to come (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1).</i> as [implied by Leviticus 7:18]: "The soul which partakes of it will bear its sin."<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since this phrase is also used with regard to <i>notar</i> (sacrificial meat left beyond its limit) in Leviticus 19:8 and the punishment of <i>karet</i> is explicitly stated with regard to that prohibition in that verse, the <i>Sifra</i> makes an equation with regard to the punishment for the two transgressions.</i> If one partakes of [the meat of such a sacrifice] inadvertently, he should bring a fixed sin-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This term is used to differentiate between this offering and an adjustable guilt-offering in which instance, the sacrifice the person required to bring is dependent on the person's means. See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:3-4.</i>
One is not liable for <i>karet</i> unless one partakes of entities that were permitted for consumption, either by a person or by the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Entities eaten by a person or consumed by the altar's pyre.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 4:3), the Rambam explains this concept as follows: The prohibition of <i>piggul</i> is derived from Leviticus 7:18 which pertains to the peace-offerings. Our Sages explain that the peace-offerings are unique in that they involve both consumption by the altar and consumption by man and that there is an act that permits such consumption (the offering of the blood permits the fats and organs to be offered and offering them permits the meat to be eaten). Hence this is established as a general rule with regard to all sacrifices.</i> If, however, one eats of the entity that permits [the sacrifice to be eaten] itself, one is not liable for <i>karet.</i> Instead, he is liable for lashes like one who partakes of disqualified sacrificial animals for which the transgression of <i>karet</i> is not involved.<br>What is implied? When a meal-offering becomes <i>piggul</i>, one who partakes of an olive-sized portion of the remaining [meal]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the portion to be eaten by man.</i> intentionally, is liable for <i>karet</i>. If, however, he partakes of the handful [that is separated to be offered on the altar] or from the frankincense, he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, for these are the substances that enable [the meal to be eaten] by men. Similarly, when a sacrifice is deemed <i>piggul</i>, one who partakes of an olive-sized portion of its meat or of the fats and organs offered on the altar or from the meat of a burnt-offering is liable for <i>karet</i>. If, however, he partakes of an olive-sized portion of the blood, he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, because [the casting of] the blood permits the fats and the organs to be offered on the altar and [the offering of] the fats and the organs permit the meat [to be eaten by] a person. [Similarly,] the blood of a burnt-offering permits its meat [to be offered] on the altar. [The presentation of] the blood of a sin-offering of fowl permits its meat to be eaten by the priests. [The presentation of] the blood of a burnt-offering of fowl permits its meat to be offered on the altar.<br>[The presentation of] the blood of a sin-offering that is burnt permits its fats and the organs to be offered on the altar. Therefore one is liable for [partaking of] the fats and the organs as <i>piggul</i>. [Offering] the handful [of meal] and the frankincense permit a meal-offering to [be eaten by] the priests. [Offering] the two sheep<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The sheep themselves, however, can also become <i>piggul</i>, as stated in Chapter 17, Halachah 16.</i> on Shavuot permit the two loaves to [be eaten by] the priests. [Offering] the two bowls of frankincense permit the showbread to [be eaten by] the priests. Sacrificial entities that do not have entities that permit them [to be consumed either by the altar or by man], e.g., the meat of the sin-offerings that are burnt or the meal-offerings that are burnt, are never deemed as <i>piggul</i>.
These are the entities that are never deemed as <i>piggul</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For there is no other act performed that enables these to be offered.</i> the handful [of meal] and the frankincense; the incense-offering; the blood [of any sacrifice]; wine - whether wine that comes as part of the accompanying offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>, ch. 2.</i> or wine that is offered independently;<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i> 17:12.</i> and the meal-offerings that are burnt in their entirety; for there is not a handful that permits them, e.g., the meal-offering of a priest or the meal-offering of the accompanying offerings; the meat of the sin-offerings that are burnt; and the <i>log</i> of oil brought by a nazirite.<br>If one would ask [with regard to the latter instance]: Does not the blood of the guilt-offering [brought by the nazirite] permit the oil to be eaten? [In resolution, it can be said that] one is not dependent on the other, for a person may bring his guilt-offering one day and the <i>log</i> of oil after several days, as will be explained in the appropriate place.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 4:2.<br>It must be noted that the latter point is the subject of a difference of opinion in the Mishnah. Rabbi Shimon maintains that the <i>log</i> cannot become <i>piggul</i>, while Rabbi Meir maintains that it can for the reasons stated here. Although the standard published text of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah states that the halachah follows Rabbi Shimon's view (as the Rambam rules here), Rav Kappach notes that all the manuscript copies of the Commentary to the Mishnah state that the halachah does not follow Rabbi Shimon.</i>

According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that [the verse] is a warning to a person who is impure, that he or she should not partake of sacrificial food before he immerses himself [in a <i>mikveh</i>].

Hence, although he or she is liable for lashes for this transgression, there is no liability for <i>karet</i>.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that even in such a situation, one is liable for <i>karet</i>. As mentioned in the notes to <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 3:9, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites Talmudic passages which could be used as support for both positions.</i>
If a person was impure because of impurity resulting from a Rabbinic ordinance, he is not liable for lashes [if he partakes of sacrificial food].<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For according to Scriptural Law, he is not liable.

One is not liable for <i>karet</i> for partaking of sacrificial food that is made permitted by a particular act unless one partakes of it after that act is performed. If, however, he partakes of the meat [of a sacrifice] before its blood is cast on the altar, he is not liable for lashes for partaking of sacrificial meat while impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, according to the <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i>, the person would be liable for lashes for partaking of sacrificial food before its blood was cast on the altar, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 11:1,4.</i><br>This is the general principle: Whenever sacrificial food is permitted because [of the performance of] a particular act, one is not liable for the violation of any of the prohibitions against partaking of <i>piggul, notar</i>, or impure sacrificial food unless the act which permits partaking of the food was performed according to law. Whenever there is not a given act that makes sacrificial food permitted, once it is sanctified in a consecrated vessel, one is liable for partaking of it if it becomes impure.

See also the <i>Beit Yosef, Yoreh De'ah</i> 98.<br>It can be explained that in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>, the Rambam is speaking about an instance where there is sufficient amount of kosher food to nullify the prohibited substance according to Scriptural Law (for only a majority is required). Hence, for the additional amount required by Rabbinic Law, a forbidden substance is also sufficient. In this instance, however, the substances are not nullified according to Scriptural Law.

All of the bones of the sacrifices that do not have marrow need not be burnt<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">It is sufficient to merely discard them.</i> with the exception of the bones of the Paschal sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Pesachim</i> 10:1-2 which explain that the bones of the Paschal sacrifice are burnt together with its meat, because according to the Rambam, the prohibition against breaking a bone from the Paschal sacrifice applies even after the mitzvah to partake of the sacrifice is concluded, it is therefore desirable to burn the bones so that they do not become a cause of transgression. The Ra'avad mentions, based on <i>Pesachim</i> 83a, it can be concluded that only bones that had marrow and which were cracked open and the marrow removed must be burnt. If they have no marrow at all, there is no need to burn even the bones of the Paschal sacrifice.<br>According to this view, the difference between the law governing the bones of the Paschal sacrifice and those of other sacrifices can be explained as follows. It is forbidden to break open the bones of the Paschal sacrifice. Therefore if the bones of a Paschal sacrifice were broken open, we can assume that this was done after the Paschal sacrifice became <i>notar</i>, for, according to many authorities, there is no prohibition against breaking the bones of a Paschal sacrifice once it has been disqualified. In such a situation, the bones are forbidden, because they served <i>notar</i> (i.e., the marrow). (See the gloss of the <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> who notes that in <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 10:6, the Rambam writes that even in such a situation, it is forbidden to break the bones of a Paschal sacrifice, and offers a possible resolution.)<br>With regard to other sacrifices, by contrast, there is no prohibition against breaking their bones even during the time the sacrifice is acceptable. Hence we can assume that they were broken during that time and the marrow removed. Thus there is little likelihood that they served <i>notar</i> and thus became forbidden. According to this understanding, if a sacrifice was <i>notar</i>, any bone that contains marrow should be burnt. See the gloss of the Meiri to <i>Pesachim, loc. cit.</i>, who implies that the Rambam should have been more explicit in his statements.</i> We already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:20.</i> that when a sacrifice was disqualified after it was skinned, its hide should be given to the priests<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In the instance of sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity.</i> or to the owners, in the instance of sacrifices of a lesser degree of holiness. If, however, [a sacrifice] was disqualified before it was skinned, the hide is considered as the meat and it should be burnt in its entirety.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">As the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 12:2) states: "Whenever the altar did not acquire the flesh [of a sacrifice], the owners do not acquire the hide."</i><br>Similarly, if a sacrifice was skinned and then it was discovered to be <i>tereifah</i> or it was disqualified because of an improper thought concerning time or place, since the sacrifice was not accepted, the hide should be burnt. [This applies] both to sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity and to sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity. If, however, a sacrifice was offered for the sake of a different intent, even though the obligation of the owners was not fulfilled, since it is acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 15, Halachah 1.</i> the hide is given to the priests or the owners, as explained [above].

As indicated by <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 9:20, "the full length of a <i>sit</i>" is two thumbreadths.
