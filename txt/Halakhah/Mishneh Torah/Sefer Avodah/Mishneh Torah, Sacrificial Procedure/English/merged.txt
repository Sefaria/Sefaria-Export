Mishneh Torah, Sacrificial Procedure



Chapter 1

All of the sacrifices of living animals comes from five species alone: a) cattle, b) sheep, c) goats, d) turtle doves, and e) small doves.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:2 with regard to the differences between these species. In this chapter, the Rambam outlines the different types of animal sacrifices and which animals are offered for each one.</i>
All of the sacrifices - whether those brought by the community or by individuals - are of four types: a) burnt-offerings, b) sin-offerings, c) guilt-offerings, and d) peace-offerings.
There are also three other types of individual sacrifices: a) the Paschal sacrifice, b) the sacrifice of the firstborn,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The sacrifice of the firstborn of one's cattle or flocks.</i> and d) the tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the tithing of one's cattle or flocks.</i> sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah, in the introduction to the order of <i>Kodshim</i>, the Rambam speaks of "peace-offerings and [offerings] that resemble peace-offerings." He later explains that the term "[offerings] that resemble peace-offerings" refers to the three types of sacrifices mentioned here, because they resemble peace-offerings." He elaborates on that theme in his commentary to <i>Zevachim</i> 5:5, explaining that the procedure in which these three sacrifices are offered resembles that of the peace-offerings with only minor differences. For that reason and because they are offerings which a person is required to bring only on specific and infrequent occasions, he does not consider them as a separate category of sacrifices.</i>
All of the communal offerings are burnt-offerings or sin-offerings. There are no communal peace-offerings except the two sheep offered with the bread that is waved on Shavuot.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the two loaves offered that day. The Rambam is borrowing the wording of Leviticus 23:17.</i> They are called "the sacrifices of communal peace offerings." The community never offers a guilt offering, nor a fowl.
The communal offerings are the two <i>temidim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Literally "continuous offerings."</i> offered every day,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 1:1-3.</i> the additional offerings of the Sabbaths,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 4:9.</i> <i>Rashei Chodashim</i>, and the festivals,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i>, chs. 7-10.</i> and the sin-offering of a goat brought on Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 10:2.</i> Similarly, if [the High] Court<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sanhedrin</i> of 71 judges who would hold their sessions in the Chamber of Hewn Stone.</i> inadvertently gave an erroneous ruling with regard to the worship of false deities, every tribe is required to bring a bull and a goat. The bull is brought as a burnt-offering and the goat as a sin-offering. These goats are called "the goats of false deities." If they inadvertently gave an erroneous ruling with regard to other mitzvot, they bring a bull as a sin-offering. It is called "the bull associated with the overlooking of a matter by the community."<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Both of these sacrifices are described in <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 12:1.</i>
The sacrifices [brought by] individuals include: a) the firstborn offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i>, ch. 1.</i><br>b) the tithe offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i>, ch. 6.</i><br>c) the Paschal offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i>, ch. 1.</i><br>d) the <i>chagigah</i> offerings, i.e., the peace offerings [brought in association with the pilgrimage festivals],<br>e) the pilgrimage offering which is a burnt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Both of these sacrifices are described in <i>Hilchot Chagigah</i>, ch. 1.</i><br>f) the sacrifice brought by a convert, that involves a burnt-offering from a domesticated animal, two small doves or two turtle doves; both of them are burnt-offerings, or two domesticated animals, one as a burnt-offering and one as a peace-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i>, ch. 1.</i><br>g) one who vows<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A person vows to bring either a burnt-offering or a peace-offering.</i> or pledges<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A person pledges to bring a particular animal as a burnt-offering or a peace-offering.</i> a burnt-offering or a peace offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 14 of these halachot (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>) which describes these sacrifices.</i><br>h) peace-offerings that are accompanied by bread; they are called thanksgiving offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 5, and onward which describe this sacrifice.</i><br>i) the sacrifices of a nazirite,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">One who took a vow not to drink wine.</i> which are a burnt-offering, a sin-offering, and a peace-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nizirut</i>, ch. 8.</i><br>j) the sacrifices of a <i>metzora,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">A person afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> a skin ailment, similar, but not identical, to leprosy.</i> which are a sin-offering, and a guilt-offering, and a burnt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kaparah</i>, ch. 4.</i><br>k) the sacrifices of a <i>zav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A male who has emissions from his sexual organ similar to those resulting from a gonorrheal infection.</i> a <i>zavah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A woman who experiences vaginal bleeding outside her menstrual cycle.</i> and a women after childbirth; they are a sin-offering and a burnt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kaparah</i> 1:3.</i><br>l) the sacrifice brought by a person who inadvertently violated a negative commandment punishable by <i>karet</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Premature death at the hand of heaven and the soul being cut off in the World to Come.</i> it is a sin-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i>, ch. 1.</i><br>m) if a person was unsure of whether he transgressed or not, that transgressor brings a guilt-offering; it is called a conditional guilt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9 which describes both these types of sacrifices.</i><br>n) there are certain sins<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">When he engaged in relations with a maid-servant who was married, robbed, made mundane use of consecrated property. Similarly, a nazirite who became impure and a person afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> must bring this offering.</i> for which one brings a guilt-offering [to atone for their transgression]; this is called a definite guilt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9 which describes both these types of sacrifices.</i><br>o) similarly, the ram brought as a burnt-offering and the bull the High Priest brings from his own resources as a sin-offering on Yom Kippur,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i>, ch. 4, which describes the offering of these sacrifices.</i> are individual offerings; the bull is called "the bull of Yom Kippur."<br>All of these sacrifices are explicitly mentioned in the Torah and the laws governing each of them are explained in the appropriate places.
[The person bringing] any of the individual offerings is responsible for them and for their accompanying offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the animal he designated as a sacrifice dies or the meal or wine offering designated for the sacrifices was spoiled, he must bring another one in its place.</i> with the exception of an animal pledged as sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained in ch. 14, in that instance, the person is not vowing to bring a sacrifice, he designated a particular animal as a sacrifice. Hence if that animal is lost, he is not obligated to replace it.</i> [The community at large] is not responsible for sacrifices or their accompanying offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">We are speaking about sacrifices that are required to be brought at a specific time. If for some reason, the community was unable to bring them at that time, they are not required to bring them afterwards. As <i>Berachot</i> 26a states: "If the time passes, the sacrifice is nullified."</i> If a sacrifice was offered, they are responsible for its additional offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For these additional offerings may be brought even at a later date, as will be explained in Chapter 2, Halachah 12.</i> When an individual's sacrifice was required to be offered at a fixed time,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Like the Paschal or festive offerings.</i> it is like a communal offering and the person is not responsible for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, since the time passed, the sacrifice cannot be brought. In truth, the matter is not at all dependent on whether an individual's sacrifice or a communal offering is involved. The determining factor is whether there is a specific time associated with the sacrifice or not (Radbaz).</i>
All of the animals brought as burnt-offerings must only be male.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:18-19 speaks of bringing the three species mentioned as burnt offerings and specifies that they must be male.</i> It may be brought from sheep, goats, or cattle, whether large or small.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Provided they are eight days old, as explained in Halachah 11.</i> They may also be brought from turtle doves and small doves, whether male or female.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah does not make any specification with regard to fowl.</i>
A sin-offering may be brought from these five species, from both males and females, from small ones and large ones.
A guilt-offering may be brought only from male sheep. There are guilt-offerings that come from large members of this species<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Those brought for the sins mentioned in note 32.</i> and others which come from small members of this species.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The guilt offering brought by a nazirite.</i>
Peace offerings may be brought from sheep, goats, or cattle, from males and females, whether large or small. A fowl may not be brought as a peace offering.<br>[When describing an animal as] small, [the intent] is one between the eighth day<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Before eight days, it is forbidden to bring an animal as a sacrifice, as stated in <i>Hilchot Isssurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:4.</i> and a full year, from day to day. If the year was declared a leap year, [the extra month is included]. "Large" implies until three full years from day to day for cattle, for flocks,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Both sheep and goats.</i> until two full years from day to day. From this age onward, [the animal] is considered as "old" and it should not be brought as an offering.
Although all of the sacrifices are acceptable if they are brought from the eighth day onward, as an initial preference, we do not bring [an animal] as a sacrifice until it is 30 days old or older<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">If it was brought earlier, it is acceptable after the fact (Radbaz).</i> with the exception of a firstborn offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since Exodus 22:29 explicitly states that a firstborn animal may be offered on its eighth day of life, our Sages did not desire to place any restrictions on the offering. It may be offered on the eighth day even as an initial preference.</i> a Paschal offering, and a tithe offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The tithe offering and the Paschal sacrifice are, like the firstborn offering, sacrifices of lesser sanctity and the laws governing the pouring of their blood on the altar are the same. Hence, our Sages considered them the same in this instance as well [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Parah</i> 1:4)].<br>The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that the mishnah cited also states that the same laws apply to offerings that were vowed or pledged and question why the Rambam does not mention them in this halachah. The Radbaz notes that the Rambam does not mention pledges and vows in his Commentary to the Mishnah and maintains that he possessed a different version of the mishnah.</i> If one desires to offer these sacrifices from the eighth day onward, he may.
Hours are counted with regard to consecrated animals,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, years are counted from day to day and not from hour to hour. For example, with regard to a child becoming Bar Mitzvah at age 13, if he was born at 3 PM on the sixteenth of Elul, he reaches Bar Mitzvah at nightfall on the sixteenth of Elul. He need not wait until 3 in the afternoon. With regard to sacrifices, however, <i>Zevachim</i> 18b uses Biblical exegesis to teach that we count from the hour of an animal's birth.</i> i.e., if their [lives] were an hour longer<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam describes in the following clause.</i> or an hour was subtracted from their [lives],<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to an animal like a ram that is not acceptable for sacrifice until it is a year and 30 days old. It is not acceptable until the hour of its birth passes on the thirty-first day.</i> they are unacceptable.<br>What is implied? When it is required that a sacrifice be less than a year old, if an hour was added to its year, it is invalidated. Even if it was merely a year old when it was slaughtered and additional time was added before its blood was sprinkled [on the altar], it is invalidated. It must be less than a year until the time the blood is sprinkled [on the altar]. Similar [laws] apply with regard to all the sacrifices.
Whenever the Torah uses the expressions, "a male sheep," "a female sheep," "sheep," the intent is [an animal] in its first year [of life]. "A ram" or "rams"<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The term, <i>ayil</i>, Hebrew for ram, is identified with strength. Implied is that the animal must reach a stage of maturity that endows it with strength and power.</i> implies males in their second year [of life]. When is an animal called a ram? When 31 days of its second year of life pass. On the thirtieth day, however, it is not acceptable, neither as a sheep, nor as a ram. [At this stage,] it is called a <i>pilgas</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">This is a Greek term. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Parah</i> 1:3), the Rambam explains that the term carries an allusion to the Hebrew phrase <i>peleg gas</i>, implying that it has passed its limits exceedingly. Similarly, this animal is in an intermediate state, having left one category, but not entered another.</i><br>Whenever the expression "a calf" is used, the intent is [an animal] in its first year [of life]. The term "bull" implies that the animal is in its second year of life. The term "a goat kid" implies that it is in its first year, "a goat," that it is in its second year. Throughout the second year, it is called a goat.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps the Rambam's intent is that there is no concept of a <i>pilgas</i> with regard to goats.</i>
All of the communal offerings are male. All<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on early printing and authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The standard printed text has a slightly different version.</i> of the communal sin offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Brought on Rosh Chodesh or the festivals and those mentioned in the following halachot.</i> come from goats or from cattle, none are brought from sheep. All of the communal burnt offerings are from sheep or cattle; there are no burnt-offerings brought from goats.<br>All of the sin-offerings brought by individuals are female. They may be eaten by the priests and they do not come from cattle except three: a) the sin-offering of a <i>nasi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a king as stated in <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 15:6.</i> which is a goat<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as opposed to ordinary sin-offerings which can be either a goat or a sheep, the prince's offering must be a goat and it must be male in contrast to those offerings which are female.</i> and is eaten, b) the sin-offering of the anointed priest which is a bull,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the High Priest, but only one who was anointed. If he assumed his office through wearing the garments of the High Priest (as did the High Priests of the Second Temple), he is not required to bring this sacrifice (<i>Hilchot Shegagot, loc. cit.</i>).</i> which is burnt;<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and not eaten.</i> it is called "the bull that comes because of [the violation of] any mitzvah;" c) the bull brought by the High Priest on Yom Kippur;<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 1:1; 4:1.</i> it is a sin-offering that is burnt.
All of the communal sin-offerings are eaten with the exception of the goat offered on Yom Kippur whose partner is sent [to Azazel],<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 1:1; 4:1.</i> the goats brought [because of the violation<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">By people at large due to a erroneous ruling by the High Court.</i> of the prohibition against] idol worship,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 12:1.</i> and the bull [brought because of the violation of] a law forgotten [by the High Court].<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">By people at large due to a erroneous ruling by the High Court.</i> "The bull that comes because of [the violation of] any mitzvah"<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the High Priest, but only one who was anointed. If he assumed his office through wearing the garments of the High Priest (as did the High Priests of the Second Temple), he is not required to bring this sacrifice (<i>Hilchot Shegagot, loc. cit.</i>).</i> and the bull [brought because of] a law forgotten [by the High Court] are called "the bulls that are burnt." The goats brought [because of the violation of the prohibition against] idol worship are called "the goats that are burnt."<br>Thus there are five sin-offerings that are burnt: two are individual offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The two bulls brought by the High Priest mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> and three are communal offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The bulls and the goats brought because of transgressions performed due to a erroneous ruling by the High Court and the goat offered as a sin offered on Yom Kippur [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 12:5)]. Significantly, in his Commentary to <i>Parah</i> 8:3, the Rambam does not mention the goat offered on Yom Kippur among the goats that are burnt.</i>
All of these offerings are called <i>zevachim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz notes that this appellation is found in <i>Zevachim</i> 47a. He questions the reason for the Rambam's inclusion of this point and explains that it can resolve a question that might arise if a person made a particular pledge.</i> All of the burnt-offerings, sin-offerings, guilt-offerings, and the two sheep brought as peace-offerings on Shavuos are called "sacrifices of the highest order of sanctity."<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachot 2-3.</i> Peace offerings brought by an individual, the firstborn offerings, the tithe offerings, and the Paschal offerings, are called "sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity."<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 4.</i>
The limbs and organs that are burnt on the altar from the sin-offerings that are eaten, from the guilt-offerings, and from the peace-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam does not mention the burnt offering, because then the entire animal is burnt.</i> are called <i>eimorim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (Introduction to the Order of <i>Kodshim</i>), the Rambam explains that this term is derived from the term <i>emar</i>, "spoke," i.e., these are the organs spoken about, i.e., specified by God to be burnt.</i> These are the <i>eimorim</i> of an ox or a goat: the fat that is on the inner organs,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical term <i>kerev</i> (Leviticus 3:3, <i>et al</i>) refers to the inner digestive organs. That verse speaks of "the fat that covers the inner organs" and "all the fat on the inner organs." The first term refers to a large membrane that covers all of these organs like a sack. The second term refers to the fat on the organs themselves.</i> included with that is the fat that is on the maw,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one of the animals four stomachs. Since the verse uses the term <i>kol</i>, "all," our Sages understood that additional fat was to be brought.</i> the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, together with the fat that is on the flanks, the lobe of the liver, and a small portion of the liver should also be taken with its lobe.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">These are also mentioned explicitly in Leviticus 3:10, <i>et al</i>.</i> If the sacrifice is from sheep, he should add to these the fat tail<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The tails of goat and cattle do not collect fat. Hence the term <i>alyah</i>, "fat tail" is not appropriate with regard to them and their tails are not offered (Radbaz).</i> in its entirety<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:9 speaks of <i>haalyah temimah</i>. In this context, <i>temimah</i> means "entire."</i> together with the vertebrae from the spine until the place of the kidneys, as [Levitcus 3:9] states: "he shall remove it opposite the kidneys." All of the <i>eimorim</i> are burnt on the outer altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The inner altar is used only for incense and the blood sprinkled on it on Yom Kippur. See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 2:11.</i>
If a [sacrificial] animal was pregnant, even though the fetus had been carried for a full term, and even if it was discovered to be alive [after the mother was slaughtered],<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, its fat is forbidden to be eaten, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 7:3.</i> its fat should not be offered together with the fat of its mother. Instead, only the fat of the mother is offered. The fetus is considered as one of its limbs.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">We do not consider it as if two animals were offered as this sacrifice and the <i>eimorim</i> from each must be offered on the altar. Instead, only the mother is considered as the sacrifice and the fetus is considered as an appendage to it. If the sacrifice is a sin offering, it is given to the priests to partake of. If it is a peace offering, it is given to the owner. Females are not sacrificed as guilt offerings.</i>

Chapter 2

The wine and the fine flour that are brought together with an offering are called accompanying offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>nesachim</i> is used continually throughout the Torah, e.g., Numbers, ch. 15. Literally, it means "libations." We have not used that term, because it is not appropriate with regard to the meal offerings. In his introduction to the tractate of <i>Menachot</i>, the Rambam states that the Torah uses the term in a general sense without attention to its particular meaning.<br>Since every sacrifice is accompanied by such offerings, before delineating the details of the sacrifices, the Rambam describes these accompanying offerings.</i> The fine flour alone is called the accompanying meal-offering. The accompanying meal-offering need not be waved, brought [to the corner of the altar], nor [offered with] frankincense.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 12, Halachot 6-7, all of the meal offerings brought independently must be brought to the corner of the altar and frankincense must be offered with them. Some also must be waved.</i> It requires salt<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For Leviticus 2:13 states that salt must be brought on all sacrifices.</i> and it is burnt on the outer altar in its entirety.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, there are other meal offerings which are fit to be eaten.</i><br>The wine is poured over the altar. It is not poured over the fire. Instead, the priest should lift up his hands<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that <i>Sukkah</i> 48b gives that instruction with regard to the water libation brought on Sukkot. Nevertheless, that text questions why this instruction is mentioned here with regard to the wine libation, for seemingly, there would be no reason to do so.</i> and pour it on [the altar's] base<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad notes that <i>Sukkah</i> 48a,b speaks of two cups on the southwest corner of the altar, i.e., on the upper level around which the priests would walk. The wine and water libations would be poured into these cups and they would extend to the <i>shittin</i>. The Radbaz notes that the Rambam himself (<i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 6:5; see also Chapter 7, Halachah 11) speaks of bringing the wine to the top of the altar. Hence, he maintains that the Rambam agrees with the Ra'avad concerning this issue. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differs and maintains that these cups were only used during Sukkot. Otherwise, the wine was poured on the altar's base and from there, it flowed into the <i>shittin</i>.</i> and from there, it descends to the <i>shittin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 2:11 which explains that these were two cavities in the southwest corner of the altar.</i>
Accompanying offerings are required only for an animal brought as a burnt-offering or as a peace-offering. Whether it was a communal sacrifice, an individual sacrifice, a sheep brought by a woman who gave birth, or the ram brought by the High Priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">These two offerings are singled out because they are individual burnt-offerings that are not dependent on an individual's pledge or vow. <i>Menachot</i> 91b cites an explicit verse that teaches that accompanying offerings are required for these sacrifices.</i> since it was a burnt-offering, it requires the accompanying offerings. Accompanying offerings are not brought for [sacrifices of] fowl,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Even those brought as burnt offerings.</i> guilt-offerings, sin-offerings, with the exception of the sin-offering and guilt-offering of a person who had been afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i>, for those accompanying offerings are explicitly mentioned in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 91a derives the need for such accompanying offerings from a juxtaposing Leviticus 14:10 and Numbers 15:5. In his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that accompanying offerings are brought for these sacrifices, because they do not come because of a sin.</i>
What is the source that teaches that accompanying offerings should not be brought together with sin-offerings and guilt-offerings? [When speaking about the accompanying offerings, Numbers 15:3] states: "to utter a vow or pledge," [implying that these offerings are necessary only for sacrifices] brought because of a vow or pledge. [This] excludes a sin-offering, guilt-offering, firstborn offering, tithe offering, and Paschal sacrifice. Since [these offerings] are not brought because of a vow or a pledge, they do not require accompanying offerings.<br>Which is the source that teaches to include the festive peace-offerings and the pilgrimage burnt-offerings?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Which are obligations and not dependent on a person's volition.</i> [The above verse] states: "Or on your festivals."
What is the measure of the accompanying offerings? The accompanying offering for a male or female sheep is an <i>isaron</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>isaron</i> is equivalent to the size of 43.2 eggs. In modern measure, the size of an egg is 57.6 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 99.5 cc according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a <i>hin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 7, a <i>hin</i> is equivalent to twelve <i>log</i>. Each <i>log</i> comprises four <i>revi'iot</i>. In modern measure, a <i>revi'it</i> is 86 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and approximately 150 cc according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>. Thus a <i>hin</i> is 48 times this amount.</i> of oil and a quarter of a <i>hin</i> of wine as a wine libation. These are also [the accompanying offerings] for a goat whether small<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In its first year of life, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 11.</i> or large<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In its second year of life (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and whether male or female and for a ewe, even if she is large. The accompanying offerings of a ram, however, are two <i>esronim</i> mixed with a third of a <i>hin</i> of oil and a third of a <i>hin</i> of wine as a libation. The accompanying offerings of a cow or a calf, whether male or female, are three <i>esronim</i> mixed with a half of a <i>hin</i> of oil and a half of a <i>hin</i> of wine as a libation.
These measures are applicable for the accompanying offerings for burnt-offerings and peace-offerings for each animal offered,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if a person pledged to bring several sacrifices of a given type, he must bring the required accompanying offerings for each animal.</i> as [implied by <i>ibid.</i>:12]: "According to the number that you offer, so shall you do for [each] one according to their number." We may not increase these measures, nor may we decrease them. [Indeed,] if one increases or decreases [the measure by] even the slightest amount, one disqualifies [the accompanying offering]. The only exception is the sheep offered as a burnt offering on the day of the waving of the <i>omer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 7:3 where this sacrifice is mentioned.</i> The accompanying offering for it is two <i>esronim</i> mixed with a third of a <i>hin</i> of oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that only a quarter of a <i>hin</i> of oil should be used. The Radbaz notes that <i>Menachot</i> 89b appears to support the Ra'avad's position. Although he explains that the Rambam's position could be justified, he admits that it is somewhat difficult. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also suggests that a printing error crept into the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i> Although the measure of flour was doubled,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Usually, only one <i>isaron</i> of flour was brought for a burnt-offering of a sheep, as stated in the previous halachah.</i> the measure of wine was not and [only] a quarter of a <i>hin</i> is brought as a libation.
A person who had been afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> must bring three <i>esronim</i> of flour [as accompanying offerings] for the three sheep which he brings as a sin-offering, a guilt-offering, and a burnt-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 1:3. Bringing accompanying offerings for these sacrifices is an exception to the general rule, as stated in Halachah 2. The obligation to bring these three <i>esronim</i> is explicitly stated in Leviticus 14:10. The Oral Tradition (<i>Menachot</i> 91a) teaches that each one is designated for a different sacrifice.</i> According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that they come because of the sacrifices he brings,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This version is found in some of the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and is also suggested by the <i>Or Sameach</i>.

A <i>revi'it</i> of wine should be brought with each of the <i>esronim</i> as is the rule for the accompanying offering for all sheep. When one brings a <i>pilgas</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A ram that is between one year and one year and a month old (Chapter 1, Halachah 14).</i> he should bring with it the accompanying offerings for a ram, [nevertheless,] it is not considered as if he brought [the appropriate] sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., regardless of whether he pledged a ram or a male sheep, he is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation by bringing a <i>pilgas</i>, for it is too old for the latter type sacrifice and not old enough for the former.</i>
A <i>hin</i> comprises twelve <i>log</i>. We have already stated the measure of a <i>log</i> together with other measures in <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 1:13.</i> An <i>isaron</i> is an <i>omer</i> which is the measure [of dough from which] <i>challah</i> must be separated.

When the accompanying offerings or the meal offerings are measured, whether for an individual offering or a communal offering, they should not be measured in a measure of three <i>esronim</i> for a bull or two <i>esronim</i> for a ram. Instead, everything should be measured with the measure of one <i>isaron</i> that existed in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 1:16 which describes the various measures that existed in the Temple.</i> Similarly, the oil for the accompanying offerings should be measured with the appropriate measure in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As stated (<i>ibid.</i>:17), there were measures of a half a <i>hin</i>, a third of a <i>hin</i>, and a quarter of a <i>hin</i> in the Temple.</i> The oil for a meal offering brought by an individual is measured in the measure of a <i>log</i> that existed in the Temple;<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a person should not measure out the flour in a private measure he has outside the Temple.

The overflow of the measures of flour are considered to be ordinary flour,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are not consecrated.</i> because the outer side of the <i>isaron</i> measure is not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Flour, wine, and oil that come in contact with sacred utensils become consecrated. Nevertheless, only the inside of the dry measures were consecrated. The outside remained unconsecrated. Hence, the fact that the flour came in contact with it does not change its status. See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 1:19.</i> The overflow of the wine and oil, by contrast, is consecrated, because it flows down the back of the utensil and both the inside and the outside of the liquid measures were anointed.<br>Why were the overflows consecrated even though the person measuring only intended to sanctify what was within the utensil?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 3:20, an object placed in a sacred utensil does not become consecrated unless the person placing it there did so intentionally.

What would they do with the overflows? If there was another sacrifice, they would sacrifice them with it. [In that instance,] if they remained overnight,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there was another offering and it was thought they would be offered with it, but for some reason they were not and remained overnight.</i> they became disqualified accordingly.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For once they were placed in a sacred utensil, remaining overnight would disqualify them, as stated in Halachah 12.</i> If not, they were [redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">It is permitted to redeem them, because when consecrating them, there was the intent that they would be redeemed in such an eventuality (Radbaz).</i> and the proceeds] used to provide "dessert for the altar."<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:4), where he explains that the term <i>kayitz</i> refers to the time of the fig and grape harvest. These fruits are served as dessert, after a person has eaten his major meal. Similarly, these offerings do not represent the fundamental "food" of the altar, but instead, are offered only when the altar is free.</i>
What is implied? Burnt offerings are purchased [with the proceeds of] their [sale]. The meat is offered to God and the hides are given to the priests.
The flour mixed with oil<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The flour and the oil are, however, absolute requirements. One cannot be offered without the other (Radbaz).</i> of the accompanying offerings are not indispensable requirements preventing [the offering of] the wine libation, nor is the wine libation an indispensable requirement preventing their offering, nor are the accompanying offerings an indispensable requirement preventing the offering of the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the person is required to bring both of these elements of the accompanying offering. Nevertheless, the offering of one is not dependent on the other as the Rambam continues to explain.</i> Instead, a person may bring his sacrifice one day and his accompanying offerings after ten days. [This applies to] both individual offerings and communal sacrifices, provided the accompanying offerings were not consecrated in a sacred utensil. If, however, they were consecrated in a sacred utensil, they are disqualified if they remain overnight.
The accompanying offerings may only be brought from ordinary produce. They may not be brought from <i>terumah</i>, the second tithes, or the first fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">All of these have a certain dimension of holiness and are not considered as ordinary property.

Hence, it is permitted for it to be brought from the second tithes. The accompanying offerings, as stated above, are offered on the altar entirely. Hence, they may not be brought from the second tithes (Radbaz).</i>
All of the measures of the accompanying offerings mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">These differ greatly for the measures usually employed.</i> the listing of the sacrifices, and the order of service written there are all inauguration offerings and will not be practiced in generations to follow.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that since we are speaking about a directive for a specific time and not an ongoing practice, as a prophet, Ezekiel had the right to speak of offerings not prescribed by the Torah. This does not constitute a violation of the prohibition to add to the Torah's commandments. See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, ch. 9.</i> Instead, the prophet commanded and outlined how the inauguration offerings will be brought at the time of the dedication of the altar at the time of the coming of the King Mashiach when the Third Temple will be built.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">All authorities agree that Ezekiel's prophecy referred to special sacrifices and was not to be followed continuously. Rashi (<i>Menachot</i> 45b) interprets it as referring to the Second Temple, while the Rambam understands it as applying to the era of Mashiach.</i>
Just as the princes<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The leaders of the tribes as related in Numbers, ch. 7.</i> offered sacrifices at the dedication of the altar [of the Sanctuary in the desert], bringing offerings that were not brought in coming generations, and they brought them on the Sabbath, so too, a prince will bring a dedication offering on the Sabbath in the Ultimate Future, as stated explicitly there.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 46:4.</i> Similarly, the sacrifices which the people who returned [to Zion] from the [Babylonian] captivity in the days of Ezra,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezra 8:35.</i> were inaugural offerings and will not be practiced in generations to come. The practices to be followed in generations to come are the words of the Torah that we have explained as they were copied from Moses our teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from the Torah scrolls which he wrote.</i> We may not add to them<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 313) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 454) count the prohibition against adding to the Torah as one of its 613 mitzvot.</i> or subtract from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 314) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 455) count the prohibition against adding to the Torah as one of its 613 mitzvot.<br>The above is not merely a point of law, but a fundamental issue of Jewish faith. As the Rambam states in the ninth of his Thirteen Principles of Faith (Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i>, ch. 10) declaring:<br>The ninth principle is that the Torah of Moses will never be nullified.... There can be no additions to it, nor any deletions from it - neither in its text nor in its explanation. And thus we are commanded: "Do not add to it and do not detract it from it."<br>(Our translation is taken from the original manuscript versions of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah.

Chapter 3

When two people desired to bring a peace-offering or a burnt-offering in partnership,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 9.</i> they may whether it was pledged or vowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 6, with regard to the distinction between these types of offerings.</i> Even a fowl<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an entity of seemingly little value. One might think that bringing such an offering in partnership is not becoming to the altar. Even so, if one's intent is desirable, the offering is accepted (Radbaz, based on <i>Menachot</i> 110a).</i> may be brought in partnership.
Men, women, and, servants may bring all of these types of sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In this chapter, the Rambam outlines the types of individuals who may bring a sacrifice and the rite of <i>semichah</i> because that is an obligation on the person bringing the sacrifice.</i> From gentiles, by contrast, we accept only burnt offerings, as [derived from Leviticus 22:28]: "From the hand of an alien, you shall not offer the food of your God [from all of these]."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 2:1) notes that the prooftext states that it is forbidden to accept an offering from a gentile from a blemished animal. One can infer that if the animal is unblemished, the offering may be accepted.<br>The verse uses the term <i>lechem</i>, "food." That term is understood as referring only to a burnt-offering, as Numbers 28:2 states: "My food for my fires."And the burnt-offering is the only type of offering, consumed entirely by the fire of the altar (Radbaz).</i> Even a burnt offering of fowl may be accepted from a gentile,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Although the prooftext speaks only of animals, our Sages understood that the leniency applies to fowl as well (Radbaz).</i> even if he worships false deities.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 4, burnt offerings are not accepted from a Jew who worships false deities. Nevertheless, such restrictions are not placed upon gentiles.</i><br>We do not, however, accept peace-offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To offer them as peace-offerings. They are, however, brought as burnt-offerings, as stated in the following halachah.</i> meal-offerings, sin-offerings, or guilt-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For the concept of atonement applies only with regard to the Jews' relationship with God.</i> from a gentile. Similarly, burnt-offerings that do not come as vows or pledges are not accepted from gentiles, e.g., a burnt-offering from a women who gave birth or the like or other burnt-offerings that do not come as vows or pledges.
When a gentile brings peace-offerings, they should be sacrificed as burnt-offerings, for [the intention of] a gentile's heart is [for the sake] of heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Menachot</i> 73b) interprets this as meaning that the gentile desires that his sacrifices be offered entirely to God and not have mortals partake of them.</i> If he gives them to a Jew with the intent that a Jew receive atonement,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz notes that peace-offerings are not intended to bring atonement and explains that this is referring to an instance where a Jew vowed to bring a peace offering and the gentile offered to bring it for him. One might think that since the gentile is bringing them they would be offered as burnt-offerings. Hence it is necessary to explain that they are peace offerings.</i> the Jew may partake of them like the peace-offerings of the Jewish people. Similarly, if he gives them to a priest, the priest may partake of them.
When a Jew is an apostate who worships false deities or who desecrates the Sabbath in public,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> where the Rambam explains that the public desecration of the Sabbath is equivalent to idol worship, because they are both cornerstones of the Jewish faith. "Public" refers to a matter known about by ten people.<br>The Radbaz adds that we do not accept the sacrifices of a Jew who has abandoned Judaism and accepted a faith like Islam which does not involve idol worship. Such a person is included in the category (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:9) of an apostate with regard to the entire Torah.</i> we do not accept any sacrifices from him at all. Even a burnt-offering that is accepted from a gentile is not accepted from this apostate. [This is derived from Leviticus 1:2 which] states: "A man from you who will sacrifice." According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 5a-b.</i> we learned: "From you," i.e., not all of you, excluding an apostate.<br>If, however, one was a heretic with regard to other transgressions, any sacrifice [he brings] is accepted so that he will repent.

There are other instances - see <i>Hilchot Teshuvah, loc. cit.</i>, <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim</i> 8;14, <i>Hilchot Gezeilah ViAveidah</i> 11:2, and <i>Hilchot Rotzeach</i> 4:10 - where the Rambam does make such a distinction.</i> -is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since he frequently violates this transgression, we assume that he is not sincere in his desire for atonement for it, because a request for atonement must be accompanied by sincere regret. Sacrifices brought for other transgressions are, however, accepted from him. See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 3:7.</i> What is implied? If a person was accustomed to eat fat - whether committed to anger [God] or out of desire - and then he inadvertently partook of fat and brought a sin-offering [for this transgression], it is not accepted.
Gentiles do not bring accompanying offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A meal offering and a wine libation.</i> for the burnt-offerings they bring, as [can be inferred from Numbers 15:13]: "Every native among you shall do this."<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This verse concludes the passage commanding the offering of the accompanying offers, implying that it is only a native - i.e., a member of the Jewish people - who is required to bring them.</i> The accompanying offerings for their sacrifices are, however, brought from communal funds,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Temple treasury.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i>:12] states: "So shall you do for each one according to their number."<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that the sacrifices themselves require that the accompanying offerings be brought.</i> [These burnt offerings] do not require <i>semichah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Leaning on the animal with all one's strength, as the Rambam proceeds to explain in the concluding halachot of the chapter.</i> for <i>semichah</i> is performed only by a Jew, and by a male and not a female.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The prooftext for the obligation to perform <i>semichah</i> speaks of "the children of Israel," and uses the male form. <i>Menachot</i> 93b understands this to exclude gentiles and <i>Chagigah</i> 16b understands it as excluding women.

According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra</i> to the verse; <i>Menachot</i> 92b.</i> we learned that this refers to all the sacrifices with the exception of the firstborn offering, the tithe offering, and the Paschal sacrifice.
[A sacrifice of] a fowl does not require <i>semichah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifra</i> derives this concept from the exegesis of Leviticus 1:4: "And he will lean his hand on the head of the burnt-offering."

The person to which this money belonged does not perform <i>semichah</i> on that animal, nor does he bring the accompanying offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Since the money was placed in the chest for the freewill offering, it is no longer considered as his personal property, but as the property of the community. Hence, he is not the owner of the sacrifices and may not perform <i>semichah</i> on them. For that same reason, the community brings the accompanying offerings.</i> Instead, the accompanying offerings are brought from communal funds.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">A meal offering and a wine libation.</i> Even if he was a priest, the service [of offering the sacrifice] and its hide belong to the men of the watch.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The priests designated to serve in the Temple that week.

All people may perform <i>semichah</i> with the exception of a deafmute, a mentally and/or emotionally unstable individual, a minor,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">These three individuals are not considered as responsible for their actions and are free of the responsibility for all mitzvot.</i> a servant, a woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 5.</i> a blind man, and a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Gentiles are not obligated in any of the mitzvot.

"His hand" and not the hand of his wife, his servant, or his agent.
When five individuals bring a sacrifice [in partnership], they all perform <i>semichah</i>, one after the other. They should not perform <i>semichah</i> at the same time. <sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this concept is derived from the fact that the prooftext uses the term "his hand" in the singular.</i><br>When a person died and left a sacrifice of a burnt offering or a peace offering, his heir should have it offered, perform <i>semichah</i> on it, and bring its accompanying offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For he is acting in the place of the original owner.</i>
<i>Semichah</i> is not performed with regard to communal offerings except with regard to two sacrifices: the goat sent to Azazel<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">During the Yom Kippur services. The High Priest performs <i>semichah</i> on it.</i> and the bull brought because of a law being forgotten.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In both these instances, there is an explicit verse (Leviticus 16:21; 4:15) requiring <i>semichah</i> for the sacrifice.</i> Three members of the <i>Sanhedrin</i> perform <i>semichah</i> on it. This is a law conveyed by Moses our teacher that <i>semichah</i> is not performed on communal offerings other than these two.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., were it not for that tradition, we might have derived the need for <i>semichah</i> for communal offerings from these two instances using Biblical exegesis [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 9:7)].</i>
<i>Semichah</i> is performed only in the Temple Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 32b explains that just as the slaughter of the animal must be performed "before God," in the Temple Courtyard, so too, <i>semichah</i> must be performed "before God," in that same place.</i> If one performed <i>semichah</i> outside the Temple Courtyard, he should perform it again inside. If the one bringing the sacrifice was standing outside [the Temple Courtyard] and he extended his hands into [the Courtyard] and performed <i>semichah</i>, his <i>semichah</i> is valid,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This is indeed what is done when the atonement process of the people bringing the sacrifice has not been completed and they are not allowed to enter the Temple Courtyard until the sacrifice is offered.</i> provided he performed <i>semichah</i> with all his strength.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">As required by Halachah 13.</i><br>Only a person who is ritually pure may perform <i>semichah</i>.

The animal should be slaughtered in the place where <i>semichah</i> is performed.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 93b derives this concept from the subsequent law: that slaughter must be performed directly after <i>semichah</i>.

If one slaughtered it in a different place or waited [before slaughtering it], the slaughter is acceptable.<br><i>Semichah</i> is an incremental aspect of the mitzvah. Accordingly, if one did not perform <i>semichah</i>, the sacrifice [still] brings atonement; [the <i>semichah</i>] is not an indispensable requirement. Nevertheless, it is considered as if the sacrifice did not bring atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Yesheinim, Yoma</i> 5a, explains that the intent is that although the person is not obligated to bring another sacrifice, in G‑d's eyes, his atonement is lacking.</i>
The person performing <i>semichah</i> must do so with all his power, [placing] both hands<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from Leviticus 16:21 which states such a requirement with regard to the goat sent to Azazel.</i> on the head of the animal, as [Leviticus 1:4] states: "on the head of the burnt-offering."

See also <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:16.</i> facing the west. The person performing <i>semichah</i> stands to the east with his face to the west. He should place both his hands between its two horns and recite [the appropriate] confession, for a sin-offering, the sin which warrants a sin-offering and for a guilt-offering, the sin which warrants a guilt offering. For a burnt offering, he confesses the sin of [negating the observance of] a positive commandment or of a negative commandment that can be corrected by the observance of] a positive commandment.
How does he confess?

Chapter 4

All of the sacrifices may be offered only during the day,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In this chapter, the Rambam lists the time limits associated with bringing the sacrifices and describes the intent with which the sacrifices must be offered.</i> as [can be inferred from Leviticus 7:38]: "On the day when He commanded the children of Israel to offer their sacrifices." [Implied is] during the day and not at night. Therefore sacrifices are slaughtered only during the day and their blood is sprinkled [on the altar] on the day of the slaughter, as [can be inferred from <i>ibid.</i>:16]: "On the day he offers his sacrifice." Implied is that on the day the sacrifice is slaughtered, it should be offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., its blood should be sprinkled on the altar.</i> When the sun sets [on that day], the blood is disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As is the entire sacrifice (<i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 1:37).</i>
As long as the elements that cause a sacrifice to be permitted were offered<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar (Radbaz).</i> during the day, [the other elements of] the sacrifice may be offered on the altar throughout the night.<br>What is implied? When the blood of sacrifices was sprinkled during the day, their <i>eimorim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The fats and inner organs of the animal that are offered on the altar.</i> may be offered on the fire of the altar at night until dawn.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The appearance of the first glimmerings of the light of the sun on the horizon more than an hour before sunrise.</i> Similarly, the limbs of the burnt-offerings may be offered on the fire of the altar until dawn.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As Leviticus 6:2 speaks of "the burnt-offering... on the altar, the entire night until the morning."</i> In order to distance [a person] from inadvertent transgression,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., "lest time become pressing and they would not be offered until the following day" [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:3)]. Rashi (at the beginning of his commentary to <i>Berachot</i>) and other authorities differ and maintain that such a safeguard was not instituted.</i> our Sages declared that the <i>eimorim</i> and the limbs of the burnt-offerings should only be offered on the fire of the altar until midnight.
Even though the <i>eimorim</i> and the limbs [of the sacrifices] may be offered on the fire of the altar at night, they may not be willingly delayed. Instead, an attempt should be made to offer everything during the day, for it is desirable that a mitzvah be performed at its designated time. [The importance of this can be seen from the fact that] the offering of the <i>eimorim</i> and the limbs [of the sacrifices] on the fire of the altar supersedes the Sabbath prohibitions on that day. We do not delay this until Saturday night.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">When there would be no prohibition involved in offering them.</i>
Any element of a sacrifice that may be offered only during the day, e.g., the handful [of flour from the meal-offering], the frankincense [from the meal-offering], the incense offering, and the meal-offerings that are burnt [on the altar],<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For example, the meal-offerings brought by the priests.

The libations that are offered with sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As accompanying offerings. See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> are only offered during the day,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">They need not be offered on the day the sacrifice is offered, but they must be offered during the day.</i> as [Numbers 29:39] states: "And for their libations and for their peace-offerings." An association is established between the peace-offerings and the libations. Just as the peace-offerings [are offered only] during the day, so too, the libations must be offered during the day. Nevertheless, the libations that are offered independently may be sanctified at night and offered at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since they were not associated with a particular sacrifice, there are no limits as to when they may be offered.</i> Therefore if it happens that a person obtains libations that are brought independently, he should<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the gloss of the Radbaz who maintains that it is preferable for him to offer them at night, for the libations should be consecrated and offered at the earliest possible opportunity.

Hence, it is necessary to state that this is not so.</i>
The entire day is acceptable for <i>semichah</i>, slaughter, severing a fowl's head,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 6.</i> offering objects on the altar's fire, bringing [meal] offerings to the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12, Halachah 6.</i> sprinkling [blood on the altar], waving [sacrificial offerings],<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, Chapter 9, Halachah 7.</i> taking a handful of the meal offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13, Halachot 12-13.</i> and bringing the <i>Musaf</i> offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The word "day" is mentioned in either the verse commanding the ritual acts mentioned or in a verse associated with them.

Nevertheless, the eager hasten to perform the mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one should endeavor to perform them at the earliest possible opportunity.</i>
As an initial preference, all of the sacrificial animals may be slaughtered only with a knife that is a sacred utensil. Nevertheless, if one slaughtered it with any article [fit] to slaughter an ordinary animal - even the edge of a bulrush<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 1:14 and notes.</i> - it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that the rationale is that slaughter is not considered part of the sacrificial service, as evidenced by the fact that it may be performed by a non-priest.</i>
Whenever one received less than the amount of blood need to sprinkle it on the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The laws governing the sprinkling of the blood are described in the following chapter.</i> from any of the sacrifices, the blood does not become consecrated. [As an initial preference,] one should have the intent of receiving all the [animal's] blood.<br>What should be done? One should hold the windpipe and the gullet<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam refers to these with the term <i>siman</i>, "signs," for they are the organs which, when slit in the desired manner, indicate that ritual slaughter is acceptable.</i> in his hand, and together with the jugular vein, place them inside a basin<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is quoting <i>Zevachim</i> 25a-b. As indicated by the conclusion of the halachah, it appears that the intent is not that the animal's neck should be held inside the sacred basin - for then, it would be difficult to perform the slaughter - but rather, above it (see Radbaz).</i> and slit both of them - or their majority<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 1:9, the Rambam states: "Superior slaughter involves cutting both [the windpipe and the gullet], whether for an animal or a fowl, and a slaughterer should have this intent. [After the fact,] if one cut the majority of one of them for a fowl and the majority of both of them for an animal or a beast, the slaughter is acceptable."</i> - so that all of the blood will be received in the basin. [After the slaughter,] the knife should be lifted up, so that the blood does not flow down along it, but rather from the neck. He should wipe off the blood that is on the knife on the [outer] edge of the basin.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">So that the blood will not flow into the basin (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
The space above the basin is considered as if it is inside the basin.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Our division of the halachot is based on the authentic manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The standard published text has a slightly different version.</i> If one was receiving the blood [of a sacrificial animal] and the bottom of the basin opened before the blood reached the open space of the bottomless basin, the blood is not consecrated. [The rationale is that when the blood enters] space in which it will ultimately not come to rest, it is not considered as if it came to rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The question is whether the blood is considered as if it came to rest in the basin and then spilled out (in which instance, it would be acceptable to be gathered from the floor) or whether it spilled directly on the floor and was hence, disqualified (Rashi, <i>Zevachim</i> 25b). The Rambam is stating that since the blood is not going to come to rest in the bottomless basin, it is not considered as if it was spilled out and is therefore not consecrated.<br>Note the Radbaz who maintains that even if the utensil has a hole in it, if the blood is able to be collected, it is acceptable.</i>
With regard to all of the sacrifices, the person performing the service<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">His intent is significant and not the intent of the person who donated the sacrifice [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 4:6); <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 14:1].</i> must have the intent of offering the proper type of sacrifice for the sake of the person bringing it at the time of slaughter, at the time the blood is received, at the time it is brought to the altar, and at the time that it is sprinkeled on the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Although there are many activities connected with a sacrifice being offered, these four activities are considered the ones that are significant with regard to whether or not the sacrifice is disqualified.</i> as [indicated by Leviticus 7:15]: "And the meat of his thanksgiving, peace-offering." [Implied is that] the slaughter together with the [three other] services must be for the sake of his peace-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The process of Biblical exegesis through which these concepts are derived is explained in <i>Zevachim</i> 4a-b.</i> Similar concepts apply with regard to other sacrifices.<br>If one slaughtered [an animal] and performed [these] other services without any intent, without thinking at all,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, they were sacrificed with a different intent, the sacrifice is acceptable, but the person is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation (<i>Zevachim</i> 2a).</i> this is acceptable for a burnt-offering and a peace-offering and the owner is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's words, it appears that this is not true with regard to a sin-offering or a guilt-offering or the Paschal sacrifice. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that from <i>Zevachim</i> 46b, it would appear that even those sacrifices are acceptable as long as one does not have a wrong intent. It is only when one has a wrong intent that they are disqualified. The Radbaz maintains that even though those sacrifices are not disqualified, the person bringing them is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> does not accept this explanation and leaves his question of the Rambam's ruling unresolved.</i>
At the time of the slaughter of [an animal designated as] a burnt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries discuss whether these concepts apply with regard to the peace offerings as well. From the Rambam's words, it would appear that the general intent applies to the peace-offerings, some of the particulars the Rambam mentions obviously do not.</i> [the person offering it] must have six things in mind, [that the animal be slaughtered]: for the sake of the [desired] sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he must know the type of offering for which he is slaughtering an animal (Rashi, <i>Zevachim</i> 46b).</i> for the sake of the person bringing it,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and not for someone else (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> that it be sacrificed unto God, blessed be He, that it be consumed by fire,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than roasted for human consumption (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> that its consumption by fire be for the sake of generating a [pleasing] fragrance,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">That they be burnt on the altar and not elsewhere and then brought to the altar (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and that the fragrance be pleasing before God. If he slaughtered [the animal] without any intent, it is acceptable, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous halachah.</i><br>One who slaughters [an animal as] a sin-offering or a guilt-offering should have the intent that [the sacrifice atone] for the sin which he committed.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 15:6.</i>

Chapter 5

We have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 9:6.<br>In this chapter, the Rambam explains the place where sacrifices are offered and the manner in which the blood and fats from the sacrifices is presented to God.</i> that the slaughter of consecrated animals is acceptable even when performed by non-priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, a non-priest may slaughter a sacrificial animal as an initial preference (Radbaz).</i> From the receiving of the blood and onward, the mitzvah is that of the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:5 states: "The sons of Aaron will offer it." Implied is that all the acts involved in offering the animal should be performed by the priests (<i>Zevachim</i> 32a).</i> The blood of all the sacrifices must be received in a sacred utensil<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 97b notes that Exodus 24:5-6 speaks of the blood of peace-offerings being received in sacred vessels. Now if this is a requirement for peace-offerings which are sacrifices of lesser sanctity, it certainly holds true for sacrifices of the most sacred order.</i> held by a priest's hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the receptacle may not be resting on the ground (Radbaz).</i> Nevertheless, the place where they are slaughtered and their blood is received is not the same in all instances.
What is implied? Sacrifices of the most sacred order may be slaughtered and their blood may be received<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since, as implied by Chapter 4, Halachah 8, one must receive the blood immediately after slaughter, this is seemingly obvious. It could be explained that the Rambam is implying that even after the fact, receiving the blood elsewhere disqualifies the sacrifice. Moreover, even if he received only part of the blood outside the northern portion of the Temple Courtyard, the sacrifice is disqualified (Radbaz).</i> in the any portion of [the area designated as] north of the altar whose boundaries we defined in the beginning of this book.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:16 states:<br>[The area] from the northern wall of the Temple Courtyard until the wall of the Altar, was sixty and a half [cubits] wide. The length of this area, from the wall of the Entrance Hall until the eastern wall of the Courtyard, was 76 [cubits].<br>The rectangle [described above] is called "the northern portion." The sacrifices of the most sacred order were slaughtered there.<br>The 60 and a half cubit width can be broken down as follows:<br>the space between the pillars and the northern wall, 8 cubits,<br>the area of the pillars 12.5 cubits,<br>the area of the tables, 8 cubits,<br>the area of the rings, 24 cubits,<br>the space between the rings and the Altar, 8 cubits. It was also called <i>beit hamitbachayim</i>, the butchering area, because here the large majority of sacrifices were slaughtered and prepared to be offered on the altar.</i> Sacrifices of lesser sanctity may be slaughtered and their blood received in every place in the Temple Courtyard.
What is the source that teaches the sacrifices of the most holy order may be slaughtered only in the northern portion of the Temple Courtyard. With regard to a burnt-offering, [Leviticus 1:11] states: "And it shall be slaughtered on the northern flank of the altar." And with regard to the sin-offering, [<i>ibid.</i> 6:18] states: "In the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered, you shall slaughter the sin-offering." And just as a sin-offering is called a sacrifice of the most sacred order,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In the verse cited.</i> so too, the burnt-offering is called, a sacrifice of the most sacred order.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 5:1), he explains that although there is no specific verse referring to a burnt-offering as a sacrifice of the most sacred order, since an equivalence is established between it and a sin-offering and a guilt-offering, we can assume that it is included in that category.</i> With regard to the guilt-offering, [<i>ibid.</i> 7:2] states: "In the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered, you shall slaughter the guilt-offering." And an association was established between communal peace-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the sheep offered on Shavuot. Different laws apply to individual peace-offerings, as stated below.</i> and sin-offerings, as [<i>ibid.</i> 23:19] states: "You shall offer one he-goat as a sin-offering and two sheep a year old as a peace-offering." Therefore, they are considered sacrifices of the most sacred order like a sin-offering and are slaughtered in the place where it is slaughtered.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that based on Numbers 10:10, <i>Zevachim</i> 55a establishes an association between communal peace-offerings and burnt-offerings and asks why the Rambam prefers the association with the sin-offerings. Seemingly, deriving the concept from the burnt-offering would be more direct. In resolution, he explains that since the Torah states that the sin-offering should be slaughtered in the same place as the burnt-offering, it is as if it is explicitly stated that the sin-offering should be slaughtered in the north. Hence, the derivation is not indirect.</i> In the place where [these sacrificial animals] are slaughtered, their blood should be received.
What is the source that teaches that sacrifices of lesser sanctity may be slaughtered in any place in the Temple Courtyard, even behind the Temple building?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 54b explains that there was a small opening at the rear of the Holy of Holies. Since the area behind the Temple building could see the Holy of Holies, it was considered as if it saw "the entrance to the Tent of Meeting."</i> With regard to the peace-offerings, [Leviticus] 3:2] states: "And you shall slaughter it at the opening to the Tent of Meeting," this indicates that all directions are acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the verse cited, <i>Zevachim</i> 55a states that there is another verse (Leviticus 3:8  which mentions the slaughtering a sacrifice "before the Tent of Meeting." It explains that both verses are necessary, for from the verse cited by the Rambam, one would not know that it is permissible to slaughter an animal in the side portions of the Temple Courtyard. Indeed, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> suggests that a printing error crept into the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and the Rambam indeed desired to cite Leviticus 3:8.</i> for a particular direction was not specified. The same applies to other sacrifices of lesser sanctity. If they were slaughtered in the Temple building itself, they are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For if seeing the entrance to the Temple Building makes a sacrifice acceptable, certainly, being inside the Temple building itself does (<i>Zevachim</i> 63a).</i> If, however, they slaughtered them on the roof of the Temple building,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, this applies with regard to the roofs of the chambers in the Temple Courtyard (Radbaz). For the roofs of the structures in the Temple complex were not consecrated (<i>Pesachim</i> 85b).</i> they are not acceptable, for the roofs are not fit for ritual slaughter at all. It must be performed on the earth of the Temple Courtyard.
Peace offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Yoma</i> 29a, maintains that this also applies to any other sacrificial animals that must be slaughtered. This view is not, however, accepted by all authorities (see the commentaries to <i>Zevachim</i> 61a).</i> that were slaughtered before the gates to the Temple building were opened are unacceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This law also applies if the gates to the Temple were closed during the day, but that generally did not take place (Radbaz).</i> as [indicated by the prooftext,] "at the opening to the Tent of Meeting," i.e., when it is open.

However, the curtain that is over [the entrance]<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 7:17.</i> does not disqualify [the offering].
The manner in which the blood of a burnt-offering, a guilt-offering, and a peace offering, whether communal or individual, is cast on the altar is the same for all three types of sacrifices at all times.<br>What does [the priest] do? The priest takes the blood which is in a receptacle and casts it from the receptacle<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., unlike the sin-offering mentioned in Halachah 9, he need not sprinkle it with his hand.</i> twice, [once] on each of two of the corners of the altar on a diagonal, on the bottom half of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Beneath the scarlet band that was tied around the middle of the Altar. See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 2:9. If he cast the blood above that band, the sacrifice is disqualified.</i> [The corners were] the northeast and the southwest.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The priest would cast the blood on the northeast corner and then the southwest in that order (<i>Tamid</i> 4:1), so that when walking, he would be circling the altar to the right (<i>Yoma</i> 15b). These corners were chosen because there was no base on the altar's northwest corner (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 2:10).</i> When casting the blood on the corners, he should have the intent that the blood will surround the corners like a <i>gamma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A Greek letter whose shape resembles an upside-down "L."</i> In this way, the blood from these two castings will be found on the four walls of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Hence our Sages (<i>Zevachim</i> 53b, <i>et al</i>) uses the expression: "Two presentations of blood that constitute four."</i> For with regard to the burnt-offering and the peace-offering, [the Torah] uses<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:11, 3:2.</i> the term "surrounding."<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And in the manner described above, the blood will be cast on all four sides of the altar.</i> This also applies to the guilt offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:2 which describes the guilt offering also uses the term "surrounding." Nevertheless, its wording is slightly different.</i> The remainder of the blood is poured on the foundation on the southern side of the altar.
The sin offerings from which [the priests] partake require four presentations [of blood], [one] on each of the four corners of the outer altar, on its upper half,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">If the blood is placed below the midway point of the altar, the sacrifice is disqualified.</i> for concerning it, [Leviticus 4:25] states: "On the corners of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that it must be placed on all four corners.</i><br>What should [the priest] do?

He must dip his finger [in the blood] before applying it to each corner.

None of the other sacrifices require the application of the blood on the altar with one's finger aside from the sin-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 6.</i> for with regard to it [Leviticus 4:6] states: "And he shall dip his finger into the blood." There must be enough blood so that he can dip his finger into it. He should not collect the blood with his finger.
From [which] corner should he begin? He should ascend on the ramp and turn to his right, walking on the surrounding ledge.

He then mixes together the blood of the bull and that of the goat and sprinkles it four times, one on each of the four corners of the golden altar in the Temple building and seven sprinklings on the center of this altar, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 4:2.</i> [Even] if he did not carefully direct the sprinklings<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The sprinklings had to be directed, one upward and seven downward, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i>. If the High Priest was not careful about directing the sprinklings in this manner, they are still acceptable.<br>This is the interpretation offered by Rav Yosef Corcus and also suggested as an alternative by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, also offers another interpretation: that the Hebrew should be translated as "he did not have the intent," i.e., he performed the act without the intent of it being a mitzvah. This can be connected to a question of a much larger scope: Must a person who performs a mitzvah have the intention of doing so or not? From <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b, it would appear that such intention is necessary. However, other Talmudic sources imply that there is no need for such intention. Whenever a person performs the deed of a mitzvah, he fulfills his obligation, regardless of his intention.<br>On the surface, the Rambam's own decisions regarding this question appear paradoxical. <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 6:3 states: "A person who eats <i>matzah</i> without the intention [of fulfilling the mitzvah]... fulfills his obligation." By contrast, <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4 states that a person who hears the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> from one who blows it casually, without the intent of performing a mitzvah, does not fulfill his obligation. There is extensive debate about this issue among the commentaries. The general consensus is that one must have the intent of performing a mitzvah. The situation involving <i>matzah</i> is unique for various reasons, each authority explaining the rationale for the exception in his own way. See the discussion of the rulings cited for more details.</i> performed in the innermost [chamber], they are acceptable.
The blood of the bulls that are burnt<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">These include a bull brought by a High Priest as a sin-offering and the bull brought as atonement for a law forgotten by the High Court (Chapter 1, Halachot 15-16).</i> and the goats that are burnt<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">As atonement for the prohibition against idol worship (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> should both be cast [in the following manner].

With regard to the blood placed on the golden altar: When he enters [the Sanctuary],<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the sprinkling of the blood on Yom Kippur, this refers to the entry of the High Priest from the Holy of Holies.

He should [sprinkle the blood] on the outer side of the horns of the altar.

The goats [offered in atonement for] idol worship are called the goats which are burnt. The Torah does not explicitly state how their blood was sprinkled [on the altar]. Nevertheless, since they are communal sin offerings, the laws applying to them should be the same in their particulars as those applying to the bull brought because of a forgotten law, for it is also a communal sin-offering. [This applies to] the sprinkling of the blood, burning [the sacrifices], and the impurity they impart to the one who has them burnt.
The blood of each [of the following], the firstborn offering, the tithe offering, and the Paschal sacrifice is required to be presented to the altar through one pouring at its base, in any direction one desires on the three corners of the altar that have a base. For, as we explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 2:10.</i> the southeastern corner did not have a base.<br>What is the source that teaches that all that is required is one present? For with regard to the first born sacrifice, [Numbers 18:17] states: "You shall cast its blood on the altar." According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that this also applies to the tithe offering and the Paschal sacrifice. Their blood is presented once like that of the firstborn offering.
The <i>eimorim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The fats and the inner organs that are offered on the altar.</i> of all the sacrifices are the first [elements of the sacrifice] offered on the pyre of the altar after the blood is cast [on the altar].<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This order is explicitly stated in the Torah's description of the manner in which several sacrifices are offered, e.g., Numbers 18:17: "Their blood shall the cast upon the altar and their fats they shall offer on the altar's pyre."</i> All of the sacrificial [animals] are skinned and then the <i>eimorim</i> are removed. They are not skinned until the blood is cast. [This applies] with the exception of the sin-offerings, for they are not skinned at all,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 2.</i> as [Leviticus 16:27] states: "You shall burn with fire their hide and their flesh." Thus, [the order of sacrifice is] first the blood is cast [on the altar].<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">For otherwise there would be an interruption between receiving the blood and casting it upon the altar (Rashi, <i>Zevachim</i>103b). This, however, is not an absolute requirement. If the animal is skinned first, the sacrifice is not disqualified (<i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 19:9).</i> Then the sacrificial [animals] are skinned and then their [bellies] are ripped open, the <i>eimorim</i> are removed and offered [on the pyre of the altar].
All of the hides of the sacrifices of the most sacred order - whether communal offerings or individual offerings - are given to the priests, as [Leviticus 7:8] states: "The hide of the burnt-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">And from the burnt-offering, we derive that this law applies to other sacrifices of the most sacred order (<i>Zevachim</i> 103a).</i> he offered [shall belong to that priest]." The hides of sacrifices of lesser sanctity, by contrast, are given to the owners.

[We can infer that it refers only to] a burnt-offering that was acceptable for a man.
In all instances that a disqualifying factor was caused in one of the sacrifices of the most sacred order before they were skinned, their hides are not granted to the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, they are burnt together with the meat of the sacrifice (<i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 19:9).</i> [If they are disqualified] after they are skinned, their hides are granted to the priests.

After one cuts up the limbs of the burnt-offering, all of the different portions should be brought to the altar's ramp<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 10-18 which describes the manner in which the limbs are brought to the altar.</i> and salted there.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For salt must be applied to all offerings (see <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 5:11-12).</i> Afterwards, all of the limbs should be brought up to the top of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Different priests would perform this service, i.e., one priest would bring a limb to the ramp and salt it and another one would bring it to the top of the altar (Radbaz, <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 4:6,8).</i> The <i>gid hanesheh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis identified the <i>gid hanesheh</i> as the sciatic nerve, the large main nerve running down the back of an animal's hind leg.

If limbs [of sacrificial animals] were roasted and then brought up to the altar, they are not considered as a pleasing fragrance.
How is the burnt-offering cut up? One would not break the animal's leg.

How many priests bring the limbs to the ramp? If the burnt-offering is from sheep, six priests should carry it.
The first [priest] carries the head and the [right] foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In this way, a portion of the animal with many bones (the head) and much meat (the leg) will have been offered.

The second [priest carries] the two forelegs, the right one in his right hand and the left one in his left hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">These limbs are the largest and hence, receive priority.</i> The side from which the skin was removed should face outward.
The third [priest carries] the tail and the hindleg, the tail in his right hand with the fat-tail that hangs between his fingers. Together with it should be the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys. The left hindleg should be in his left hand with the side from which the skin was removed facing outward.
The fourth [priest carries] the breast and the neck, the breast in his right hand and the neck in his left hand with the ribs between his fingers.
The fifth [priest carries] the two flanks, the right flank in his right hand and the left flank in his left hand. The side from which the skin was removed should face outward.
The sixth [priest carries] the intestines in a bowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>op. cit.</i>). Others interpret the term <i>bezech</i> differently.</i> The feet should be placed above them.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">To cover them, for their appearance is not appealing (Radbaz).</i> [This applies] if the burnt-offering was a sheep or a goat. If, however, it was a ram, two priests should bring the intestines.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since a ram is much larger than a sheep, it would be difficult for one priest to carry the intestines alone.

Why was a large limb of an ox not divided into portions? Because it is written: "You shall cut it into its portions."

Squeezing out the blood of a fowl brought as a sin-offering is an absolute requirement.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Although there is a difference of opinion concerning this matter in the Talmud and there are passages which appear to follow the other view, the Rambam's approach represents the consensus, as indicated by <i>Me'ilah</i> 9b (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> All the altar receives from this offering is its blood. The remainder is eaten by males of the priestly family like the meat of an animal brought as a sin-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10.</i>
How should the fowl brought as a sin-offering be held at the time of <i>melikah</i>?

If one deviated and held the fowl in any other manner, it is acceptable.
Every part of the altar is acceptable for <i>melikah</i>, provided he sprinkles its blood below the midpoint of the altar. If he sprinkles it anywhere [on the altar], it is acceptable provided he presents [at least] a small amount of the blood of the soul<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 6:3, this term refers to the blood that flows out when the fowl is slaughtered.</i> below [the midpoint of the altar].
The upper half of southwest corner of the altar would serve three purposes and the lower half would serve three purposes. The lower half was used for the <i>melikah</i> of a fowl brought as a sin-offering, approaching the altar with the meal-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12, Halachah 6; Chapter 13, Halachah 12.</i> and pouring the remainder of the blood of the burnt-offerings, the sin-offerings that are eaten, the guilt-offerings, and the peace-offerings upon its [base].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachot 6, 10.</i><br>The three purposes for which the upper portion was used are: the water libation on Sukkos,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 10:6.</i> the wine libation of the accompanying offering [of Sukkot],<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in contrast to the wine libations offered throughout the year which are offered on the lower portion of the altar.

All of those who ascend the altar on the right [side of the ramp],<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they should turn to the southeastern corner.

[Those involved in these services] ascend on the left side, turn to the left, to that corner, perform their task, and retrace their steps.<br>Why do they turn to the left? So that they will encounter the southwest corner first. For if they would turn to the right and circle the entire altar until they reached the southwest corner, the water or the wine might become smoky<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Wine that became smoky is unacceptable for a libation (<i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 6:9).

Therefore when someone who performs a water or wine libation circles the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">There is no necessity - or even preference - that the priest circle the altar. The matter is solely dependent on his choice. The Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 6:6) that is the source for this teaching speaks about a High Priest, but as the Rambam states in his Commentary to the Mishnah, the concept applies to any priest. If he desires, he may circle the altar before performing this service.</i> he should not have anything in his hands. He begins circling from the southeast corner, [proceeding] to the northeast and then to the northwest and the southwest. He should not be holding anything. When he reaches the southwest corner, the water or the wine is placed in his hand and he performs the libation. If he does not [desire to] circle [the altar], he may ascend [the ramp], turn to the left, perform his service, and descend.

There is a stringency that applies with regard to an animal<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">But not a fowl (Halachah 2).</i> brought as a sin-offering that does not apply [even] to other sacrifices of the most sacred order.

If, however, the blood spews on a wooden utensil or a metal utensil, it need not be washed because it is not fit to be washed. Instead, one should merely scrape the blood off.

Based on that discussion, Rav Yosef Corcus suggests that there is a printing error in the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and the ruling is that the garment must be washed.

A metal vessel in which [a sin-offering] was cooked must be cleansed<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 11:8), the Rambam defines this term as meaning "thoroughly washing a utensil until everything attached to it is removed."</i> and rinsed in water<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">There the Rambam interprets this as meaning "pouring water over the utensil without scraping the filth off by hand." The Radbaz elaborates on the difference between the Rambam's approach (who appears to require only the thorough cleaning of the vessels) and that of Rashi who interprets <i>Zevachim</i> 95b as requiring that these utensils must be purged in the same manner as one purges non-kosher food from a vessel into which it was absorbed.<br>According to this conception of the Rambam's approach, the problem is not that the fat absorbed in the utensil becomes <i>notar</i>, "sacrificial food that remained overnight," and must be destroyed. Instead, the question involves merely the thorough cleaning of the utensil. This interpretation is borne out by the continuation of the Rambam's statements in his Commentary to the Mishnah where he speaks about the issue of <i>notar</i> with regard to the food attached to the utensil, but does not mention the food absorbed within it.</i> in the Temple Courtyard, as [Leviticus 6:21] states: "An earthenware vessel in which it is cooked shall be broken."<br>Although this verse does not state "in a holy place,"<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">As does the preceding verse which mentions washing the blood from a garment.</i> the same laws that apply to washing [a garment] apply. Just as the washing must be performed in a sacred place, so too, the breaking of an earthenware vessel and the cleansing and the rinsing of a metal utensil must be performed in a holy place. [These laws apply equally to] a utensil in which [the sin-offering] was cooked and one into which it was poured while it was boiling.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since the stew including the meat of the sin-offering was boiling while it was poured into the vessel, it is considered as if it was cooked there.</i>
"Cleansing" is performed with hot water and "rinsing" with cold water.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the Rambam's version of <i>Zevachim, loc. cit.</i> There are, however, other versions of that Mishnah.</i> The prooftext mentions "water," [excluding] wine, wine mixed with water, or other liquids. The thorough cleansing and rinsing [of the vessel] should resemble the thorough cleansing and rinsing of a cup.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam writes that the intent of this comparison is to imply that the container must be washed until there is no trace of the previous substance, as one would a cup from which he would drink.</i><br>A spit and a grill [used to cook the meat of a sin-offering] must be purged<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">To remove the fat absorbed in the container (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> in water that is heated by fire and then washed [in cold water].<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In the above source, the Rambam explains that this purging follows the same process in which non-kosher food is purged from cooking utensils. Significantly, however, when he mentions the process of purging non-kosher cooking utensils (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 17:3-4), he does not mention the need to rinse them in cold water although he does mention that requirement in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:23.</i>
When does the above apply? When one cooked [sacrificial meat] in these utensils after their blood was sprinkled as required by law. If, however, he cooked in [these utensils] before the sprinkling [of the blood]<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">This would disqualify the sacrifice.</i> or he cooked meat from sin-offerings that were to be burnt in such utensils,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 11.</i> it is not necessary that they be washed thoroughly and rinsed.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz questions this ruling, because seemingly, the fat absorbed in the utensil, becomes <i>notar</i>, "sacrificial food that remained overnight," and it must be destroyed. He offers three possible resolutions:<br>a) the Rambam is speaking about an instance when the utensil was used on the same day. Hence, the problem does not arise.<br>b) the issue does not concern <i>notar</i> at all, as explained in the notes to Halachah 12.<br>c) since the absorbed fat is more than a day old when it becomes <i>notar</i>, its flavor is impaired (<i>notain taam lifgam</i>). Hence, since the prohibition against the absorbed food is merely a Rabbinic safeguard, our Sages did not apply it in this instance, because the situation involves the Temple service.</i><br>If one cooked [the meat of a sin-offering] in [only] a portion of a utensil, the entire utensil must be washed thoroughly and rinsed.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz uses this law as a further support for his idea that the fat need not be purged from the utensil. For the concept that cooked food which is absorbed in part of a utensil is considered as if it were absorbed in the entire utensil is an established principle.</i>
There is an unresolved doubt [concerning the ruling] when meat [from a sacrificial offering] was roasted in the space of an earthenware oven:<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Similar laws apply with regard to sacrifices cooked in a metal oven, except that the question involves the requirement to be thoroughly washed and rinsed.</i> Must [the oven] be destroyed<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">As required by Halachah 11.</i> since [the meat] was cooked inside of it<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For the Torah mentions the necessity of washing out or destroying the utensil after sacrificial meat was cooked in it.

Instead, all utensils that were used for [meat] from sacrificial offerings with hot water,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., sacrificial meat was either cooked in it or poured in it while warm [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 11:8)].</i> whether sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity or sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, are required to be washed thoroughly and rinsed after<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the glosses of the Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i> the time for eating from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam quotes <i>Zevachim, loc. cit.</i>, explaining that this concept is derived as follows. Leviticus 6:21-22 states: "All of the priestly males shall partake of it" and directly afterwards states: "and it shall be washed thoroughly and rinsed in water," implying that the two activities should be performed in direct sequence.</i> Similarly, a spit and a grill should be purged after eating [from the sacrifice which they were used to cook].<br>They should not be left until one desires to eat from them a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., beyond the time when it is permitted to eat from them.</i> Instead, when the time for eating from them is completed, one should purge the grill and the spit and wash thoroughly and rinse the utensil whether it be a metal utensil or an earthenware utensil.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, stating that there is no point in washing an earthenware utensil thoroughly. Even if one does so, the taste of the sacrificial offering will remain absorbed within it. The Rambam's understanding is that the Torah only required that an earthenware utensil be broken when it was used for cooking a sin-offering, if it was used for cooking other sacrifices, there is no obligation. This difference of opinion relates to a question of greater scope: the difference of opinion mentioned above whether it is necessary to purge the utensils from the food absorbed in them or not.</i> [There is] one exception: [the meat from] a sin-offering. An earthenware utensil [in which it was cooked] must be broken. [Nevertheless,] one may cook [in a utensil] and do so a second and third time immediately, whether using a metal utensil or an earthenware utensil. [The requirement to] wash it thoroughly and rinse it [applies only] at the conclusion of the time permitted to partake [from these sacrificial foods].
Utensils made from animal turds,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Keilim</i> 10:1), the Rambam mentions that there are some who interpret the Hebrew term as referring to utensils made from marble.

All that is necessary is that they be cleansed.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that since the Torah does not make any specifications with regard to such utensils (as it does with regard to earthenware and metal utensils), there is no obligation with regard to them.

If it is kosher, anything that touches it should be eaten according to the laws that apply to it, with the same degree of holiness.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it can only be eaten in the Temple Courtyard by males of the priestly family on the day the sacrifice was offered and on the following night.</i>
When does the above apply? When [the flavor of the meat of a sacrificial offering] was absorbed by it. If, however, it merely touched it, but its flavor was not absorbed, it does not cause it to become sanctified.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 97a, <i>et al</i>, derives this concept from the fact that the term the prooftext uses for "its meat," <i>bibisarah</i>, literally means "in its meat."

If the meat [of a sacrificial offering] touched a cake<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">A soft, spongy wafer [see the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 1:4)].</i> and [its flavor] was absorbed in a portion of it, [the cake] does not become sanctified in its entirety.

[The following laws apply to] a utensil in which sacrificial food and ordinary food were cooked together or sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity were cooked together with sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity. If there is a sufficient amount [of the sacrificial food] to impart its flavor,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Unless there is a priest who can distinguish whether the taste was imparted or not, we assume that if the food in the more lenient category is 60 times the amount of the food in the more severe category, the taste of the more severe type of food has not been imparted.

Nevertheless, when the time to partake of the sacrifices of the lesser degree of holiness is concluded, the utensils must be thoroughly washed and rinsed (<i>ibid.</i>). When sacrificial meat is cooked together with ordinary meat, even if its taste is not recognizable, we require that the utensils be thoroughly washed and rinsed, because of the stringencies involving sacrificial food (Radbaz).</i>

If the sacrifice was a nazirite's ram, [the priest] should remove the portions to be offered on the altar, set aside the breast and the thigh, and cook the remainder of the ram in the Women's Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">More particularly, as mentioned in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:8, there was a chamber in the southeast portion of the Women's Courtyard set aside for this purpose.</i> The priest takes the cooked foreleg from the ram<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As commanded by Numbers 6:19.

What is meant by the breast? The portion [of the animal's body] that faces the ground that extends from the neck until the belly. Two ribs on either side should be cut off [and given to the priest] together with it. What is meant by the foreleg? The portion from the upper-joint until the ankle joint; two limbs, one connected with the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">An animal's foreleg is comprised of three bones. According to the Rambam, the lower two are given to the priest. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 10:4). Others maintain the upper two should be given to the priest.</i> The foreleg that is mentioned refers to the right foreleg. The corresponding portion in the rear leg is the thigh that is referred to universally.
After <i>tenufah</i> is performed with [these portions], they are offered on the pyre of the altar except for the breast and the thigh that are eaten by the priests,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachah 4.</i> as [Leviticus 7:34] states: "but the breast with which <i>tenufah</i> was performed and the thigh that was lifted up...." The remainder of the peace-offerings are consumed by the owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">And any - both male and female - with whom he desires to share the meat.</i> The priests do not acquire the breast and the thigh until after the portions to be offered on the altar were placed on its pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 59b derives this law from the order in which the concepts are stated in the Torah. Similarly, the owner may not partake of his portion until that time (<i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 18:7).</i>
Similarly, the bread with which <i>tenufah</i> was performed from the thanksgiving offering and the nazirite's ram and the cooked foreleg are eaten by the priests. The remainder of the bread and the remainder of the meat are eaten by the owner. The bread with which <i>tenufah</i> was performed together with the breast and the thigh is referred to<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:21; <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 1:15.</i> as "the elevated portion from the thanksgiving offering." The cooked foreleg together with the breast and the thigh and the bread with which <i>tenufah</i> was performed are referred to as "the elevated portion from the nazirite's ram."
There is an unresolved doubt whether the bread from the elevated portion of the thanksgiving offering<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">There is, however, no such doubt with regard to the elevated portion of the nazirite's ram (Radbaz).</i> is categorized as <i>terumah</i> or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For Leviticus 7:14 uses the word <i>terumah</i> when describing this offering. Nevertheless, since we find exclusions with regard to penalties associated with <i>terumah</i> in other verses, it is possible that they do not apply with regard to these breads. Accordingly, <i>Menachot</i> 77b leaves the matter unresolved.</i> Therefore one is not liable for death,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 6:6.</i> nor to repay an additional fifth, [as one is when partaking of] <i>terumah</i>. Nor is a mixture of it subject to the laws of <i>dimua</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 13:1-2, in such an instance, one hundred times the amount of <i>terumah</i> is required before the mixture is permitted.</i> as is a mixture of <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that if these breads become mixed with ordinary breads, seemingly, there is a question whether a Scriptural prohibition applies and one should rule stringently. They explain that as long as there is a majority of permitted substances, the Scriptural prohibition is considered as nullified and the prohibition is only Rabbinic in origin (see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:13). This also applies with regard to a mixture of <i>terumah</i> (<i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 14:7). Accordingly, in this instance, since it is possible that the laws of <i>terumah</i> are not applied to these breads, we do not impose the Rabbinic prohibition.</i>
If the person bringing the thanksgiving offering was a priest, the remainder of the bread may be eaten by the owner like a thanksgiving offering brought by an Israelite. For the bread that accompanies a thanksgiving offering or a nazrite's ram is not called a meal offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As will be stated (Chapter 12, Halachah 9), in contrast to the meal offerings brought by Israelites, meal offerings brought by the priests are consumed entirely by the altar's pyre. Hence, the Rambam felt it necessary to clarify that these breads are not in that category.</i>
When two people bring a peace-offering in partnership, one should perform <i>tenufah</i> with the other's permission.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">If the two partners would perform <i>tenufah</i> each one holding part of the items, neither would be performing the rite as required. If one put his hand below the hand of the other one, there would be an interposition between that person's hand and the sacrificial items. And it is also impossible for them to perform <i>tenufah</i>, one after the other, because the Torah speaks about <i>tenufah</i>, using the singular, and not <i>tenufot</i>, using the plural (<i>Menachot</i> 94a).</i> Even if there are 100 [partners], one should perform <i>tenufah</i> for the sake of all of them. This does not apply with regard to <i>semichah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">That rite must be performed by each of the partners individually (Chapter 3, Halachah 9).</i>
When a woman is the one bringing a sacrifice, she does not perform <i>tenufah</i> with it. The priest must perform that rite,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz suggests that if she is married, her husband should perform this rite on her behalf.</i> for the sacrifice requires that <i>tenufah</i> be performed with it and a woman is unacceptable to perform that rite. A woman never performs <i>tenufah</i> except in two instances: a <i>sotah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">A woman suspected of adultery who is required to bring an offering as part of her process of atonement.</i> and a female nazirite, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 3:15; <i>Hilchot Nizirut</i> 8:4.</i> <i>Tenufah</i> should always be performed before [the elements of the sacrifice] are brought close to the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 61a derives this concept from Numbers 5:25 which speaks of <i>tenufah</i> being performed with a <i>sotah's</i> offering and then of it being brought to the altar.</i>
What is meant by the bread that is brought together with the thanksgiving offering? One should take 20 <i>isaronim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>isaron</i> is defined as a measure equivalent to the volume of 43 and 1/5 eggs.</i> of fine flour. He should make ten <i>isaronim</i> leavened and ten unleavened. The ten that are made leaven should be made into ten loaves.
How are they made leavened? He should bring enough yeast to cause the dough to leaven and place it in the measure of an <i>isaron</i>. He then fills the measure. Even though ultimately, [the measure] will be lacking or excessive because of the yeast,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the space intended for the flour will be taken by the yeast.</i> for at times [the yeast] will be thick and hard<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">And thus take up only a small amount of space.</i> and at times it will be soft [and inflated],<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">And thus take up a lot of space.</i> we are concerned only with its measure at the present time. Hence he should measure full <i>isaronim</i>.<br>From the ten <i>isaronim</i> for the unleavened bread, he should make 30 loaves of the same size, ten of each [of the following three] types: ten loaves baked in an oven, ten loaves of flat-cakes, and ten loaves of fried cakes.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 9:3), the Rambam writes that he has found no definition for the term <i>murbechet</i>, but that appears to him that it implies that a large quantity of oil is used in the preparation of the cakes.</i>
How are the fried cakes prepared? [The cakes] should be scalded with boiling water.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 1:6; <i>Menachot</i> 9:3), where he describes how these fried cakes are made.</i> Then they should be baked slightly and then fried in oil in a roasting pot or the like, like doughnuts and fried. A large amount of oil is used for them. This is the deep frying process mentioned in all places.
How much oil is used to prepare these 30 loaves?<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Those loaves which are leavened do not require oil [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 7:4)].</i> Half a <i>log</i> of oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">A half a <i>log</i> is 172 cc. according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 300 cc. according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> This measure is a halachah communicated to Moses from Sinai. A fourth is used for the fried doughballs, an eighth for the loaves [baked in the oven], and an eighth for the wafers.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz maintains that the measure of half a <i>log</i> was communicated to Moses, but the breakdown of how this measure should be used was not. Hence, after the fact, the sacrifice is not disqualified if there was some deviation.</i>
With regard to the loaves [that are baked]: their flour should saturate in the eighth [of a <i>log</i>]. Afterwards, they should be kneaded and baked. The oil should be poured over the wafers after they have been baked.<br>The priest takes four loaves from the entire [mixture], one of each type, as [Leviticus 7:14] states: "One from each [type], a sacrifice."
When one made [only] four loaves for the bread for the thanksgiving offering, he has fulfilled his obligation. [The Torah] mentions 40 only as [the optimum way of fulfilling] the mitzvah. [This applies] provided he separates a <i>challah</i> from each of the types of sacrifices while they are still dough.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Although the person desires to bake only four loaves, he must also separate one loaf of each type for the priest. This separation must be done beforehand, as the Rambam precedes to explain. Thus one tenth of each type of dough must be separated and prepared for the priest.</i> For a piece of bread may not be separated [as a sacrificial portion].<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it would not be deferential to give the priest a piece of each of the four doughs as his sacrificial portion.</i> [This is implied by the prooftext:] "One from each [type], a sacrifice," that the priest should not receive a portion.
What is meant by the bread that is brought together with the nazirite's ram? He should take six and two thirds <i>isaronim</i> of flour and make 20 equal sized loaves from them. They must all be unleavened bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The nazirite is bringing two thirds of the unleavened bread brought in connection with a thanksgiving offering. Hence, he uses two thirds the amount of flour.</i> Ten should be wafers with oil poured over them and ten loaves whose flour was saturated in oil. The entire amount should be baked in an oven. A fourth [of a <i>log</i>] of oil is used for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a similar amount of oil is used as is used for the corresponding loaves of the thanksgiving offering.</i> This measure is a halachah communicated to Moses at Sinai. The priest takes two of the loaves, one from each type.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Numbers 6:19.</i>
Each of the two types of bread [brought by] a Nazirite and the four types of bread brought for the thanksgiving offering is an absolute necessity.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if any of the types of bread are lacking, the sacrifice is unacceptable and nothing should be brought at all.</i> The bread for both these offerings is prepared outside the Temple Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In his gloss to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 3:7), <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> writes that these breads were baked in <i>Beit Pagi</i>, a small settlement, outside, but close to the Temple Mount.</i>
How are the firstborn, tithe, and Paschal sacrifices offered? After their blood is poured on the altar as we explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5, Halachah 17.</i> they are skinned, the portions offered on the altar are removed,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5, Halachah 18.</i> salted, and placed on [the altar's] pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 1:14; <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 1:2; 6:4.</i> The remainder of the meat of the firstborn offering is eaten by the priests. The remainder of the meat of the tithe sacrifice is eaten by the owner. The remainder of the meat of the Paschal sacrifice is eaten by those enumerated upon it according to its laws, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot [Korban] Pesach.</i>

Chapter 10

It is a positive commandment for the sin offerings and the guilt-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 89) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 102) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to be eaten,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This mitzvah is incumbent on the priests; it is not a dimension of the obligation to bring a given sacrifice.</i> as [Exodus 29:33] states: "And they shall eat [the sacrifices] which convey atonement."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The choice of this prooftext and the concept it teaches sheds light on an issue debated by the commentaries: Is it a positive mitzvah to partake of the meat of the sacrifices of lesser sanctity? In his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, the Rambam explains that since eating the other sacrifices does not bring about atonement, it should not be considered as an independent mitzvah. Instead, it is an extension of this mitzvah. In this instance, however, since the atonement of the person bringing the sacrifice depends on the priests' consumption of the sacrifice, it is considered as an independent mitzvah. There is extensive discussion on this issue by other Rabbis.</i> The priests eat the sacrifices and the owners receive atonement. This also applies to other sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., the communal peace offerings.</i> that are eaten by the priests; partaking of them is a mitzvah.
Similarly, partaking of the portion that remains from the meal offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after the handful has been taken out to be offered on the altar. See Chapter 12, Halachah 9.</i> is a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 88) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 134) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. This mitzvah encompasses partaking of all the different types of meal offerings (Radbaz).</i> as [Leviticus 6:9] states: "What remains of it shall be eaten by Aaron and his sons."
The sin-offering, the guilt-offering, and the remnants of the meal-offering may be eaten only by males<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Even minors; see Halachah 17.</i> of the priestly family in the Temple Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, as stated in Chapter 11, Halachah 5, there is a prohibition against partaking of these sacrifices outside the Temple Courtyard.</i> If they were eaten in the Temple building, their consumption is [acceptable], as [indicated by Numbers 18:9-10]: "For all of their meal-offerings, for all of their sin-offerings, and for all of their guilt-offerings.... In the most holy place,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This includes the Temple building.</i> you shall partake of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 63a asks: From that verse, it would appear that it is desirable (not merely acceptable after the fact) to partake of the offerings inside the Temple building. Our Sages then cite Leviticus 6:9 which indicates that the sacrifices should be eaten in the Temple Courtyard. They explain that it is preferable to consider the Temple Courtyard the primary place where the sacrifices are eaten, for the Temple building is the resting place for the Divine Presence and it is not befitting for that to be the primary place for eating, an activity that is essentially a human need.</i> All males shall partake of it." Similarly, the communal peace-offerings are similar to the sin-offerings and the guilt-offerings, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 9, Halachah 4.</i>
The breast and the thigh of the peace-offerings are eaten by both males and females of the priestly family, for with regard to these [Numbers 18:11] states: "I have given it to you, to your sons and your daughters." This also applies to the elevated portions of the thanksgiving offering and the nazirite's ram,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The breads and the portions of meat given to the priest from those offerings; see Chapter 9, Halachah 12.</i> [<i>ibid.</i>:19] states: "All of the elevated portions of the consecrated [offerings] that the children of Israel shall raise up have I given to you, your sons, and your daughters."
The same applies with regard to the firstborn offering, for concerning it [<i>ibid.</i>:18] states: "Their meat shall be yours, like the breast with which <i>tenufah</i> was performed and the right thigh."<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are comparable to the peace-offering.</i><br>All of these<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the portions from the sacrifices of lesser sanctity, including the breast and the thigh of the peace offering and the firstborn offering.</i> [portions of sacrificial meat] that may be eaten by the women of the priestly family may be eaten by the priests' servants and their wives, like <i>terumah</i>. All [these sacrifices]<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Not only the portions given to the priests, but also those given to the Israelites.</i> may be eaten throughout the city [of Jerusalem],<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 11, Halachah 6, which delineates the prohibition against eating such sacrificial meat outside of Jerusalem.</i> as [Leviticus 10:14] states: "And the breast with which <i>tenufah</i> was performed and the thigh that was lifted up shall you eat in a pure place." It was not specified that they [be eaten] "in a holy place," which would mean "the Temple Courtyard," but "in a pure place." This refers to the camp of the Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As related in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:11, while the Jews were journeying through the desert, their encampment was considered as divided into three camps: the Camp of the Divine Presence, the Camp of the Levites, and the Camp of the Israelites.</i> The parallel with regard to future generations is the city of Jerusalem.<br>The same laws apply to the tithe offering and the Paschal sacrifice, for they are sacrifices of lesser sanctity like the peace-offerings. The windows and the thickness of the wall is considered as being within [the city].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:9. See also parallel rulings in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:16; <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 9:1.<br>The Radbaz clarifies that this is referring to instances where the windows are open to the city. If they are open only to the area outside the wall, he maintains that they should be considered as outside the city.</i>
The peace-offerings may be eaten on the day they were slaughtered, throughout the [following] night, and throughout the following day until sunset, as [Leviticus 7:16-18] states: "On the day when his sacrifice was offered, it shall be eaten and on its morrow... If one would partake of the peace-offering on the third day...."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues "he shall bear his sin," implying that there is a prohibition in partaking of the sacrifice at that time.</i> Thus one can derive that they may be eaten for two days and one night. [This applies both] to the portion of the priests and the portions of the owners. This also applies to the firstborn and tithe offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">But not the Paschal sacrifice, as stated in <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 8:1, 15.</i> for they are also sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, like the peace-offerings.
The thanksgiving-offering, by contrast, even though it is one of the sacrifices of lesser sanctity, may be eaten only on the day of its sacrifice and the [following] night, as [<i>ibid.</i>:15] states: "It shall be eaten on the day it was offered. Do not leave anything from it until the morning." This also applies to the nazirite's ram and the bread which accompanies [these offerings], both to the portion of the priests and the portion of the owner. This also applies to the sin-offering, the guilt-offering, the communal peace-offerings, and the remainder of the meal-offerings. All of these are eaten for a day and [the following] night, as it is written: "It shall be eaten on the day it was offered."<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Rambam understands the verse as referring to all sacrifices unless it is specifically stated otherwise.</i> This appears to include all of the sacrifices with the exception of the peace-offerings concerning which the Torah explicitly [stated otherwise] and the firstborn and tithe offerings which resemble the peace-offerings.
According to Scriptural Law, all of these [sacrifices] that may be eaten on the day [of their sacrifice] and the [following] night may be eaten until dawn.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The first appearance of the sun's rays - but not the sun itself - on the eastern hemisphere. According to different halachic views, it is between 72 minutes and two hours before sunrise.</i> In order to separate a person from sin, our Sages said that they may only be eaten until midnight.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if a person would be given the entire night, he might become lax and delay the consumption of the meat and come to partake of the meat after dawn. Giving him a more restricted time serves as a safeguard to prevent the violation of this limit. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1).</i>
All of the sacrifices - both those of the highest degree of sanctity and those of a lesser degree - may be eaten only by those who are ritually pure<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 18:13, partaking of sacrificial meat in a state of ritual impurity violates a Scriptural prohibition.

Nevertheless, they may not partake of sacrifices until they bring the offerings required of them. See also <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 18:14.</i> he may not partake of sacrificial foods. A <i>tumtum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">A person whose gender is masked by an extra piece of flesh.</i> may not partake of sacrificial foods, because there is an unresolved doubt whether he is uncircumcised.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if he is in fact male, circumcision will not have been performed upon him.</i> It appears to me that an <i>androgynus</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">One with both a male and female sexual organ.</i> may partake of sacrifices of lesser sanctity.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For these sacrifices may be eaten by both males and females. Although there is a halachic uncertainty with regard to the definition of his gender (see <i>Hilchot Nizirut</i> 2:10), that should not prevent him from partaking of these sacrifices. He may not, however, partake of sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity, for these may only be eaten by males and he is not categorically defined as male.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> clarifies that this leniency applies only when the male organ of the <i>androgynus</i> has been circumcised.</i>
It is permitted to eat sacrificial meat together with any other food. Even the priests are permitted to eat their portions - both from the sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity and those of a lesser degree - together with any other food.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's ruling, as noted by Rav Yosef Corcus in his gloss to the following halachah, for sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity may only be eaten in the Temple Courtyard and ordinary food may not be brought into the Temple Courtyard. Rashi (<i>Temurah</i> 23a) explains that the intent is that one may partake of ordinary food outside the Temple Courtyard and then enter the Temple Courtyard to partake of the sacrificial food. <i>Tosafot</i> explains that the prohibition against bringing ordinary food into the Temple Courtyard applies only when it is not being brought there for a purpose connected with the Temple service. If, however, it is being brought there to be eaten together with the sacrifices, there is no prohibition.</i> And they may change the manner [in which it is prepared] to be eaten, eating them roasted, lightly cooked, or thoroughly cooked<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The Paschal sacrifice may only be eaten while roasted, but that is a specific obligation that does not apply to other sacrifices.</i> and to spice them with spices that are not consecrated.

This addition satisfies the objections raised by the Ra'avad.<br>According to this interpretation, the fundamental point of this ruling is that the meat is permitted only to priests and not to non-priests. Although the prohibitions against <i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i> have been nullified since the sacrificial meat was originally to be eaten only by priests, that restriction still remains. There are, however, others who interpret the mishnah differently.</i>
When meat from the sacrifices of the most sacred order or sacrifices of lesser sanctity is cooked together with ordinary meat,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The term the Rambam uses literally translates as "the meat of desire," i.e., meat that there is no mitzvah to partake of.</i> the ordinary meat is forbidden to those who are ritually impure<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Because it has absorbed the flavor of the sacrificial meat.

If it was of sacrifices of lesser sanctity, it may be eaten by ordinary individuals, provided they are ritually pure.<br>In one of his responsa, the Radbaz mentions that only the ordinary meat is permitted to be eaten, the sacrificial meat is forbidden, because it is considered to have become ritually impure because of its contact with the ordinary meat. See <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i> 11:5. In his Commentary to the Mishnah, however, the Rambam states that "everything may be eaten by pure priests" or "pure non-priests."</i>
With regard to a burnt-offering, [Leviticus 7:8] states: "The hide of the burnt-offering which the priest sacrificed will belong to him." With regard to a sin-offering, [<i>ibid.</i> 6:19] states: "The priest who performs the sin-offering shall partake of it." With regard to a guilt-offering, [<i>ibid.</i> 7:7] states: "It will belong to the priest who brings about atonement because of it." With regard to a peace-offering, [<i>ibid.</i>:14] states: "It will belong to the priest who pours the blood of the peace-offering." And with regard to the meal-offering, it is written: "The priest who offers it shall partake of it."<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The verse cited in the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> does not exist. The commentaries have suggested that the intent is Leviticus 7:9 as stated in the following halachah.<br>See the gloss of the Radbaz who explains why all the different verses are necessary, because the concepts cannot be derived from each other.</i><br>In all the above instances, the verses are not referring [to the priest who actually brings the offering, but] to [any priest] who is fit to have done so. Any priest who is fit to perform the service has a right to share in the division [of the sacrifice] to partake of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by Halachah 17 [see also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 12:1)], priests with a disqualifying physical blemish are not excluded from receiving a portion of the division of the sacrifices even though they are unfit to offer them, because there is a special verse that teaches that they should receive a portion.</i> [Conversely,] one who is not fit [to serve] at the time it is offered, e.g., he was ritually impure, does not have a right to share in the division [of the sacrifice] to partake of it even if he will regain ritual purity in the evening.<br>With regard to the division, the entire [matter] is given to the men of the clan who offer sacrifices that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:11 with regard to what is meant by a clan.</i> They all share in the division of all of the sacraments of the Temple, each man [receiving the same portion] as his brother, whether he was the one who offered the sacrifice or he was together with him in the Temple, but did not offer the sacrifice.
Why did the verse make a distinction between the meal-offerings that are baked and the meal-offerings of flour? For with regard to [the meal-offerings] that are baked, [Leviticus 7:9] states: "Any meal-offering that is baked in an oven... it will belong to the priest who offers it" and with regard to the meal-offerings of flour [<i>ibid.</i>:10] states: "Any meal-offering that is mixed with oil or that is parched shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, every man like his brother."<br>[The following explanation can be given:]<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that the explanation appears to be the Rambam's own, rather than to stem from a prior source.</i> When [the meal-offerings] that are baked are divided among the members of the clan, whenever a person receives a portion, even if it is [merely] an olive-sized portion of bread, it is fit for him to partake of it, because it may be eaten immediately. When, however, we are speaking of flour, if [such an offering] will be divided among them, there will be those who will receive only a handful of flour or less. This is not fit either to be kneaded into dough or to be baked. Hence, one might think that one meal offering should be apportioned in consideration of another meal-offering instead of dividing each meal-offering individually among all the members of the clan.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if there were 20 meal-offerings and 60 priests, one might think that each of the meal-offerings would be divided among three priests rather than have all 20 divided among the 60. Hence, it is necessary to explicitly state that every priest receives a portion of a meal-offering of flour.</i> Therefore it is necessary for the Torah to state [that it] "shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, every man like his brother," i.e., that it is divided individually.<br>On this basis, our Sages said:<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra</i> to the verse, <i>Kiddushin</i> 53a; <i>Menachot</i> 73a.</i> that a meal offering is not divided in consideration of another meal-offering, not even one offering brought in a flat frying pan in consideration of another such offering or one flour-offering in consideration of another such offering. Instead, what remains<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">After the portions offered on the altar are taken.</i> from every [offering] is divided individually.
Similarly, an offering of fowl is not apportioned in consideration of another such offering, nor a sin-offering in consideration of another such offering, nor a breast and a thigh in consideration of another such portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In all these instances, one might think that it would be preferable to divide each of the sacrifices among a smaller number of priests.</i> Instead, every [sacrificial portion] is divided among all [the members of the clan] equally.

Once the relative is buried, however, the priest may perform service and partake of sacrifices in the evening.

If [a priest] became impure after [the blood of the sacrifice] was sprinkled [on the altar] and immersed himself and thus was also pure when the fats were offered on the altar's pyre, there is an unresolved question whether or not he receives a portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">For although he was pure when both these services were performed, he was impure in the interim.</i> Therefore if he grabs a portion, it is not expropriated from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is not given a portion, because he cannot prove that he is worthy of one, but it is not taken from him, since the other priests also cannot prove that he is not worthy.

When a communal sacrifice is offered in a state of impurity,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as stated in <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 4:10,12, when the majority of priests are impure, the communal offerings may be offered by the impure priests.</i> even though impure priests [could have] offered it,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed additions are made on the basis of the glosses of the Radbaz and Rav Yosef Corcus who note that if the sacrifice was offered by impure priests, its meat is not eaten (<i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 4:11).

Thus the sacrifice may be eaten. One might think that the impure priests would receive a portion since they were fit to offer the sacrifice.

Meal-offerings are a type of sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 67) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 116) include bringing the meal-offerings as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> The meal-offerings that are offered independently and not as part of the accompanying offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> include both communal meal-offerings and individual meal-offerings.

All of the meal-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that this includes the meal offerings brought by priests even though a handful of flour is not removed from them. It does not, however, include the meal-offerings brought as part of the accompanying offerings. The rationale for the distinction is that this rite is required only for the meal-offerings that are brought as independent offerings, not for those that merely accompany other offerings. The showbread and the two loaves offered on Shavuos are not brought close to the altar, because they are not offered on the altar at all.</i> that are brought to the altar must be brought close to the altar on its western side, facing the tip of its southwest corner.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:7 states: "The sons of Aaron will bring it close, before God, towards the face of the altar." <i>Sotah</i> 14b interprets this as referring to the southwest corner of the altar."</i> <i>Tenufah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 7, where this rite is described.</i> is not required for them with the exception of the meal-offering of a <i>sotah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 16.</i> and the <i>omer</i> [offering].<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 7:12.</i> Both of them require both <i>tenufah</i> and being brought close to the altar.
All of the meal-offerings that are brought to the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This term excludes the showbread and the two loaves offered on Shavuos, as mentioned above.</i> require that oil and frankincense be placed upon them,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">With the exception of the meal-offering of a sinner and a <i>sotah</i>, it is explicitly stated that oil must be brought with every meal-offering.

Similar statements are made with regard to the meal-offering brought by a <i>sotah</i> in Numbers 5:15.

If one placed [oil and/or frankincense on these offerings] and offered them,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's understanding is that one is not liable unless he offers these meal-offerings on the altar after placing the oil and frankincense on them (Radbaz).</i> he is liable for the oil individually and the frankincense individually.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For they are considered as independent prohibitions.</i> If one placed a container holding oil or frankincense on the offering, he does not transgress,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Even if he offers the meal-offering on the altar in this manner (Radbaz).</i> nor does he disqualify [the offerings].<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he placed oil and/or frankincense directly on the meal-offering, he does disqualify it.

A handful is taken<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13, Halachah 13, for a description of how this handful is taken.</i> from all of the meal-offerings that are brought to the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this does not include the meal-offerings that are brought as part of the accompanying offerings, for they are offered on the altar in their entirety.</i> That handful is offered on the altar in its entirety and the remainder [of the offering] is eaten by the priests with the exception of a meal-offering brought by a male priest. A handful is not taken from such an offering. Instead, the entire offering is offered on the altar's pyre, as [Leviticus 6:16] states: "Every meal-offering from a priest [is offered on the pyre in its entirety]."<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The passage from which the prooftext is taken speaks about the initiation offering and the High Priest's <i>chavitin</i> offering. Nevertheless, since it includes the word "every," the concept it states is applied to other offerings brought by priests (Radbaz).</i> From this we learn that all [of the following offerings]: an initiation and <i>chavitin</i> meal-offering or a meal-offering of a sinner or a free-will meal-offering brought by a priest are all offered on the altar's pyre and a handful is not taken from them.
A handful is taken from a meal-offering brought by a woman of the priestly family<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one unmarried, alternatively, one married to an Israelite as evident from Halachah 12 (Radbaz; <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> as it is taken from the meal-offerings brought by Israelites and the remainder of it is eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 23b derives this concept from the fact that the prooftext cited above uses a male term for priest.</i>
When sons [from a priestly family and one of Israelites] become intermingled and each of their identities are doubtful, a handful is taken from a meal-offering [brought by either], as is done with regard to a meal-offering brought by an Israelite, but [the remainder] is not eaten, as is done with a meal-offering brought by a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since there is a doubt involved, the offering is treated with both the stringencies applying to one brought by priests and those applying to one brought by Israelites (<i>Yevamot</i> 99b).</i><br>What is done? The handful alone is offered on the altar and the remainder is scattered over the ash heap.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>ibid.</i> 100a) interprets this as referring to the place outside the Temple Courtyard where the ashes from the altar are deposited. <i>Tosafot</i> interprets it as the place inside the Temple Courtyard where sacrifices of the most sacred order that are disqualified are burnt. This difference of opinion is possible, because the term ash-pile is used for several different places.<br>The offering may not be eaten, for perhaps the person bringing it is a priest and meal-offerings a priest brings may not be eaten. Nor may it be burnt entirely on the altar, for perhaps the person bringing it is an Israelite and an Israelite's offerings may not be burnt entirely.</i>
The meal-offerings brought by all women married to a priest - whether from the priestly family or Israelites - are not eaten, because of the portion of the husband [present within them],<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For a woman will bring her offering from flour that belongs to her husband (Rashi, <i>Sotah</i> 23a).</i> nor is it offered on the pyre in its entirety, because of the portion of the woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">For she is bringing it for her atonement.</i> Instead, a handful alone is offered on the altar and the remainder is scattered over the ash heap.<br>The handful may be taken in any place within the Temple Courtyard. If it was taken in the Temple Building, it is acceptable.
A meal-offering may be consecrated by [placing the flour] in a container [even] while it is placed on the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it need not be held by a priest.</i> [Similarly,] the handful may be taken from a container [placed] on the ground, [but] the handful may not be consecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The consecration of the handful is discussed in Chapter 13, Halachah 12.</i> in a container [placed] on the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 7b derives this concept from a parallel to the receiving of the blood.

When the fire [of the altar] has consumed most of the handful.
All of the meal-offerings that are brought to the altar are unleavened.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The only meal-offerings that are leavened are the two loaves brought on Shavuos and ten of the loaves brought for the thanksgiving offering and these are not brought to the altar.</i> Similarly, although the remaining portions of the meal-offerings that may be eaten by the priests may be eaten with all foods and with a sweetener,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Although a sweetener may not be offered on the altar (<i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 5:1), it may be eaten with sacrificial foods.</i> they may not be eaten while leavened, as [Leviticus 6:10] states: "It shall not be baked leavened; their portion...."

One is liable for each act [that causes the remnants of the meal-offering to leaven].<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the following halachah.</i>
What is implied? If one mixed [the remnants of a meal-offering] with water in a manner that causes them to leaven, one kneaded them in a manner that causes them to leaven, <sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 5:2).</i> one shaped the loaves in such a manner, or baked them in such a manner, he is liable for lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Each of these acts carries liability individually, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> as [Leviticus 2:11] states: "It shall not be prepared as leavened." [Now it is also written:] "It shall not be baked leavened." [Why are the two verses necessary?] To make one liable for every individual act performed [in its preparation]. If one prepared it as leavened from the beginning to the end, one is liable for lashes for every individual act performed.
If one left yeast on a dough and then departed and sat elsewhere and [let] it leaven on its own accord, he is liable for lashes, for placing yeast [on the dough] is a deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">And thus the person caused the dough to leaven.</i>
If one dipped the remainder [of a meal-offering] in caraway or sesame seeds or any type of spice or oil, it is acceptable. It is <i>matzah</i>; it is merely called spiced <i>matzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:20 where the Rambam rules that the addition of such substances does not cause <i>matzah</i> to leaven.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, stating that it is permissible to dip baked <i>matzah</i> in the substances mentioned in this halachah, but not to mix them into the dough used to prepare <i>matzah</i>.

A person who causes a meal-offering that was disqualified<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>, ch. 11, describes many different factors that can cause a meal offering to become disqualified.</i> to become leavened is exempt, as [implied by Leviticus 2:11]: "which will be offered to God; it should not be prepared as leaven." [We can infer that the prohibition applies when the offering is] acceptable to God, not when it is disqualified.<br>If one caused [a meal-offering] to become leaven while it was acceptable and then it was taken outside the Temple Courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Which disqualifies it, as evident from Chapter 11, Halachah 6.</i> and he then caused it to leaven again after it was disqualified, he is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">For the second leavening. He is, however, liable for the first leavening (Rav Yosef Corcus).</i> for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Although generally one who causes a meal-offering to leaven a second time is liable (Halachah 14), in this instance, since it was disqualified in the interim, he is exempt.</i> If one caused [a meal-offering] to become leavened at the top of the altar, he is not liable for lashes, for it is written "which will be offered," and this [offering] was already offered and it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">It should not, however, be offered on the altar's pyre (but should be taken from the altar and discarded), because no leaven should be offered on the altar, as stated in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 5:1 (Radbaz).</i>
One who causes the showbread to become leaven is liable for lashes, for [the verse cited] states: "Any meal-offering."<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">And this also includes the showbread. The commentaries note that <i>Menachot</i> 57a derives this concept from a different prooftext.</i> [Causing] the meal-offering of the accompanying offering [to leaven] does not incur liability for lashes.

It is a positive commandment to prepare all of the meal-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 67) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 116) include bringing the meal-offerings as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> according to the commandments prescribed by the Torah.
How was the <i>chavitin</i> offering of the High Priest prepared? He would bring an entire <i>isaron</i> and sanctify it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">By placing it in the <i>isaron</i> measure found in the Temple Courtyard (see Chapter 2, Halachah 8). Once it was sanctified, it could not be taken out of the Temple Courtyard. Hence all the stages of its preparation had to be completed within the Temple Courtyard (Radbaz). Indeed, one of the chambers in the Temple Courtyard was the Chamber of the Makers of the <i>Chavitin</i> (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:17).</i> and then divide it in half<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Because half was sacrificed in the morning and half in the afternoon.</i> with the half <i>isaron</i> measure in the Temple. [This was necessary,] because even though it was offered in half [portions],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 4.</i> it was not sanctified in half portions. Three <i>lugim</i> of oil are brought with it, as [Leviticus 6:13] states: "You shall prepare it with oil," i.e., [an amount of] oil equivalent to the accompanying offering for a lamb<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachot 4, 7.</i> should be added to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 51a explains that since the <i>chavitin</i> is cooked on a flat frying pan, it is obvious that oil should be added to it like the other meal offerings cooked on such a frying pan (see Halachah 7). Hence by saying that the <i>chavitin</i> is prepared in oil, the verse implies that additional oil is added. The need for three <i>lugin</i> is then derived from a textual association of the terms used.</i> The flour should be mixed with the oil and then scalded<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 1:6) the Rambam defines the term <i>cholait</i>, the verb translated as "scalded" here as: "pouring boiling water over the flour."</i> with boiling [liquid].<br>Each half <i>isaron</i> should be kneaded into six loaves. Thus there are a total of twelve loaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 15a derives this point from a comparison to the showbread which also comprised twelve loaves.</i>
[These loaves] were prepared one by one.<br>How were they prepared? The three <i>lugim</i> of oil would be divided [into twelve] using the measure of a <i>revi'it</i> [of a <i>log</i>] that existed in the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when the quantity of three <i>lugim</i> is divided in twelve (an equal portion for each loaf), we arrive at the figure of a <i>revi'it</i> (a fourth of a <i>log</i>). There was a measure of this size in the Temple. Hence the oil would be poured into this measure for each loaf to provide it with the desired amount of oil.</i> a <i>revi'it</i> for each loaf. The loaf would be baked some and then fried on the flat frying-pan with the remainder of its oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Thus there were three phases in the cooking process of these loaves. First, the flour was scalded as mentioned in the previous halachah. Then the loaf was made and then baked. Afterwards [see also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 9:3)], the oil was boiled and the loaf fried in it. See also Chapter 9, Halachah 19, which describes all these different stages of the cooking process. The same term, <i>murbechet</i>, is use to describe both that offering and the <i>chavitin</i> offering.</i> It should not be cooked very much,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he should only bake it slightly (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). This interpretation is also borne out by Chapter 9, Halachah 19.</i> for [Leviticus 6:14] uses the term <i>tufinei</i> which implies something between cooked and lightly cooked.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Afterwards, it is fried to complete the cooking process (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
Afterwards, each loaf should be divided into two<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that the cakes should not be divided. Thus instead of offering twelve half-cakes as the Rambam maintains, he maintains that six full cakes should be offered in the morning and six in the afternoon.</i> by approximation,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although half should be offered in the morning and half in the afternoon, an exact division is not required. The division is made by hand and not with a utensil. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's position, noting that the concept of dividing the cakes by hand and not with a utensil is stated in <i>Menachot</i> 87b.</i> so that half can be offered in the morning and half in the evening.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the late afternoon.</i> He should take the halves and fold each one of them in half and then divide [the loaves at] the folds so that each flat cake will be folded in half.

Instead, it is offered entirely as a single entity together with the handful of frankincense. Both of them are consumed entirely by the altar's pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For the meal-offering of a priest is never eaten (Chapter 12, Halachah 9).</i>
How is a meal-offering of fine flour prepared? One brings an <i>isaron</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">But no less than an <i>isaron</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:5).</i> - or several <i>isaronot</i> or [many,] according to his vow<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">One may bring as many <i>isaronot</i> as he desires, even 1000 (or more).</i> - of fine flour and the oil appropriate for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>log</i> of oil for every <i>isaron</i> of flour, as stated in Chapter 12, Halachah 7.</i> The flour should be measured in the <i>isaron</i> measure<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the offering contained many <i>isaronot</i>, it is measured out, <i>isaron</i> by <i>isaron</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> of the Temple.

This sequence is not explicitly stated with regard to the offering of fine flour. In his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam explains the process through which it is derived that the above concepts apply to this meal-offering as well.</i> a container<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a trough where the oil and flour are mixed. Both the Radbaz and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> state that, from the Rambam's wording, it appears that this trough was not a sacred utensil. They question that conclusion, for once the flour had been put in a sacred utensil, it does not appear appropriate to place it in an ordinary utensil again. Indeed, they explain that perhaps the second utensil was also sacred.</i> and the flour poured upon it, and then other oil should be poured over the flour and the flour mixed in it. Afterwards, it is placed in a sacred vessel and oil is poured into it. The total of the oil placed first, that mixed with the flour, and that poured upon it is a <i>log</i> for an <i>issaron</i>. Frankincense is placed upon it.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">A handful of frankincense for every offering regardless of its size (Chapter 12, Halachah 7).</i>
How are a meal-offering [cooked in] a flat frying-pan and one [cooked in] a deep frying pan prepared? Oil should be placed in a container and the flour poured upon it and then other oil should be poured over the flour and the flour mixed in it. Afterwards, it should be kneaded with warm water<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Care was taken so that they do not leaven (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and baked in a flat frying-pan or a deep frying-pan as he vowed.

What is the difference between a flat frying-pan and a deep frying pan? A deep frying-pan has an edge<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 63b notes that Leviticus 7:9 states of such an offering being cooked "in a deep frying-pan," while the others are described as being cooked "on a flat frying-pan." Implied is that the deep frying-pan had an edge large enough to contain liquids.</i> and the dough cooked in it is soft,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">And thin like the dough of pancakes [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 5:8)].</i> because since it has an edge, [the dough] does not drip off. The flat frying-pan does not have an edge. The dough cooked in it is firm so that it will not drip off to either side.
How is a meal-offering baked in an oven prepared? If it is of loaves, one should mix the flour with oil,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Oil is not, however, placed in the container before the flour is (<i>Menachot</i> 6:3).</i> knead it with warm water, and bake it. [Afterwards,] it is broken into pieces, placed in a sacred utensil, and its frankincense is placed upon it. Oil is not poured over it, as [indicated by Leviticus 2:4]: "loaves of <i>matzah</i> mixed with oil."<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., only "mixed with oil." No other oil is used in preparing them.</i><br>If it is of wafers, one should knead the flour with warm water and smear the wafers with oil, as [<i>ibid.</i>] states "wafers of <i>matzah</i> smeared with oil." It appears to me that they should be smeared after they are baked.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz supports this supposition, explaining that if the wafers were smeared before they were baked, they would not absorb the oil.</i>
How are they smeared? One brings a <i>log</i> of oil for every <i>isaron</i> and smears them and then smears them again until all of the oil in the <i>log</i> is finished.
All of these four types of baked<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., those fried in a deep frying pan and a flat frying-pan or the two types baked in an oven.

What is the order in which the meal-offering is brought? A person should bring flour from his home in a container of silver, gold, or another type of metal, a container that is fit [to be sanctified] as a sacred vessel.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:18, a sacred utensil may not be made of wood, bone, stone, or glass, only of metal.</i><br>If it is a meal-offering of flour, he should place it in a sacred utensil and consecrate it<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Placing it in the sacred vessel with the intent to consecrate it brings about its consecration.

That is sufficient.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he touches the altar's corner with the utensil. He does not have to have the flour itself touch the corner (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>He then moves all of its frankincense to one side<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">So that it will not be mixed with the flour taken in the handful (<i>Sotah</i> 14b).</i> and gathers a handful from the place where the majority of its oil has collected, as [Leviticus 2:2] states: "[He shall take a full handful] from its flour and from its oil." He places the handful in a sacred vessel and consecrates it in the sacred vessel.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Although the handful of flour was consecrated together with the other flour, it should be consecrated again now that it has become a separate entity. <i>Sotah, loc. cit.</i>, draws a comparison to the blood from a sacrificial animal which is consecrated together with the entire animal at the time of its slaughter and is consecrated again when collected in a sacred utensil.</i> If a handful [from a meal-offering] was divided into two vessels, it is not consecrated. [Instead,] he should go back and consecrate it [in a single vessel].<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Although placing the handful of flour in two utensils is unacceptable, it does not disqualify it.</i><br>He should gather all of its frankincense and place it on the handful of flour in the vessel and take it up to the altar.

How is a handful [of flour]<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">We have mentioned flour, because taking a full handful - but only a handful, not more and not less - of flour can be easily pictured.

The pinky and the thumb are not included. Therefore it is considered as one of the difficult services in the Temple.

A handful should not be less than two olive-sized portions.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">In modern measure, approximately 28 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>.</i> [Bringing every] portion of the handful is an absolute requirement in [bringing] the entire handful.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">For Leviticus 2:2 states that "a full handful" must be offered.

A person may vow or pledge<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 4 for the distinction between the two terms.</i> to bring a burnt-offering, a peace-offering, or any of the five types of meal-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12, Halachah 4.</i> that may be brought as vows or as pledges.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, see Halachah 8.</i> And he may vow or pledge [to bring] a meal offering from one of the three types of meal-offerings that serve as the accompanying offerings, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1, 4.</i> One may pledge or vow wine as an independent offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 16, Halachah 14; Chapter 17, Halachah 12.</i> frankincense as an independent offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 16, Halachah 13.</i> oil as an independent offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 16, Halachah 14.</i> or wood for the arrangement [of wood on the altar], for that is like a sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 6:9-10.</i> as [Nechemiah 13:31] states: "for the sacrifice of wood."
Two people may pledge or vow one sacrifice, a burnt-offering or a peace-offering, even one turtle-dove and large ordinary dove in partnership. A meal-offering, by contrast, may not be brought in partnership. These matters were conveyed by the Oral Tradition.

What is meant by a vow and what is meant by a pledge? When one says: "I promise to bring a burnt-offering," "I promise to bring a peace-offering," "I promise to bring a meal-offering," or "I promise to bring the value of this animal<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he mentions a specific animal, since his promise focuses on the animal's value and not the animal itself, it is considered as a vow and not a pledge. Moreover, he made a promise incumbent on himself - that he bring the value of the animal as a sacrifice - and did not designate the animal's worth itself. See also Halachah 6.</i> as a burnt-offering" or "...as a peace-offering," this is considered a vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The obligation is on him; he has made a commitment to bring the sacrifice.</i> If, however, he said: "This animal..." or "The value of this animal is [designated as] a burnt-offering,"<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., pledging that the animal would be sold and the money received be designated for the purchase of a sacrifice.</i> or "...a peace-offering," or "This <i>isaron</i> [of flour] as a meal-offering," this is a pledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the animal or its worth is designated as a sacrifice.</i>
What is the difference between vows and pledges? If a person took a vow and separated a sacrifice and then it was lost or stolen, he is obligated to replace it<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For the obligation is incumbent on him and it was not fulfilled.</i> until he offers the sacrifice he vowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Moreover, the sacrifice must be offered in an acceptable manner. If it was disqualified, he is still obligated to fulfill his vow.</i> If a person made a pledge and said: "This [animal] is a sacrifice," he is not obligated to replace it if it died or was stolen.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Because he personally is under no further responsibility. He fulfilled his obligation by designating the animal.</i>
When one says: "I promise to bring the value of this ox as a burnt-offering" or "I promise to bring the value of this house as a sacrifice," if the ox dies and the house falls, he is obligated to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 4, this is considered a vow. The rationale is that he said: <i>elai</i>, "I promise to bring." That expression indicated his willingness to accept responsibility.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 5:5), the Rambam states that he is obligated to pay only the value of the dead ox, not its value when it was alive.</i> If one says: "I promise to bring a burnt-offering on the condition that I am not obligated to replace it," he is not obligated to replace it.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since he made an explicit stipulation freeing himself of responsibility, he is not considered as liable.</i>
We already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 9:14 and the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 13:10) which refers to the temple constructed in Alexandria by Chonio, the son of Shimon the Just.</i> that one who constructs a temple to offer sacrifices within, outside the Temple is not considered as [having built] a temple to a false divinity. If one says: "I promise to bring a burnt-offering to sacrifice in the Temple [in Jerusalem]," and he brings it in [such] a temple, does not fulfill his vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 13:10) states merely "a burnt offering," omitting the words "to sacrifice in the Temple." The commentaries question why the Rambam felt it necessary to add them.</i> If he vowed to offer it in such a temple and he offers it in the Temple [in Jerusalem], he fulfills his vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since he promised to bring a burnt-offering, it is necessary that it be brought to Jerusalem. The fact that he added that he would bring it elsewhere is not significant.</i> If he offers in such a temple, he fulfills his vow. He is like someone who vowed to bring a burnt-offering on the condition that he is not obligated to replace it.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to the Rambam, the animal set aside is considered as designated as a burnt-offering and the person is liable for offering a sacrifice outside the Temple. Nevertheless, he is considered to have fulfilled his vow for the reason stated by the Rambam.</i> He is liable for <i>karet</i> for offering [the sacrifice] outside [the Temple Courtyard].<br>Similarly, if one takes a vow saying that he is a nazirite on the condition that he shave<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">As is done at the conclusion of one's nazirite vow.</i> in such a temple, he fulfills his obligation if he shaves there. He is considered as one who vowed to abstain from wine and he did so abstain. This is not considered as a nazirite vow.
A sin-offering and a guilt-offering may be brought only for a sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Thus when Leviticus 5:1 introduces the obligation to bring a sin-offering, it states: "If a person will sin...."</i> They may not be brought because of a pledge or a vow. [Hence,] if one<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one who is not obligated to bring such a sacrifice.</i> says: "I promise to bring a sin-offering" or "...a guilt-offering," his statements are of no consequence. [Similarly,] if he said: "This animal is [designated as] a sin-offering" or "...a guilt-offering," his statements are of no consequence.<br>If he was obligated to bring a sin-offering or a guilt-offering and he said: "This [animal] is for my sin-offering" or "...for my guilt-offering" or "This money is for my sin-offering" or "...my guilt-offering," his statements are binding.
When a person says: "I promise to bring the sacrifices of this person afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i>" or "...this women who gave birth," if the afflicted person or the women are poor, the one who took the vow should bring the sacrifices of a poor person.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The types of sacrifices these individuals are obligated to bring vary dependent on the person's financial standing, as explained in <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 1:3. Accordingly, one might think that regardless of the financial status of the person who pledged to bring the sacrifice, the type of sacrifice to be brought is determined by the financial status of the person who is obligated to offer it. Nevertheless, as stated in <i>Arachin</i> 13a (and quoted by the Rambam in <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 5:11), this is not the case. If a wealthy person vows to bring the sacrifices of a poor person afflicted by <i>tzara'at,</i> he must bring the sacrifices of a wealthy man. Hence, we are forced to say that here the Rambam is speaking of a poor person who took such a vow.</i> If they were wealthy, the person who took the vow must bring the sacrifice of a wealthy person even though he is poor.
[The following laws apply when] one says: "I promise to bring the sin-offering, burnt-offering, guilt-offering, and peace-offering of so-and-so." If that person agrees, he may allow him to bring those sacrifices for him and he receives atonement thereby. If he agreed at the time [the sacrificial animals] were set aside, but reneged and did not agree at the time they were offered,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Arachin</i> 21a) interprets the passage as referring to an instance where the person obligated to bring the sacrifice did not know it was being offered on his behalf. If he did know, however, he must consent. The Rambam differs and maintains that since he gave his consent originally and the atonement associated with these sacrifices is achieved immediately, it is not necessary that he consent at the time the sacrifice was offered (Rav Yosef Corcus; see Halachah 17).</i> with regard to a burnt-offering and a peace-offering, they should be sacrificed and he receives atonement through them even if he does not consent at this time, because he agreed at the time [the sacrificial animals] were set aside. With regard to a sin-offering and a guilt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since the atonement associated with these sacrifices is more encompassing, it requires not only his initial consent, but also continuous willful activity (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> by contrast, he does not receive atonement unless he consented from the beginning until the end.
One who says: "I promise to bring vows like the vows of the wicked who take upon themselves nazirite vows, sacrifices, and oaths," he is obligated in all [of his statements].<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to the wording of the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 1:1). The intent of the Mishnah is that the wicked make vows hastily and moreover, obligate themselves for vows which constitute a commitment incumbent on their person that they will not necessarily be able to fulfill. As the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 13:25 and in his commentary to the above mishnah, it is preferable not to take vows, for it is possible one will not be able to fulfill them. See also <i>ibid.</i> 1:25.</i> If he says: "...as the vows of the upright," he is not obligated in anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For the upright do not take vows for the reason stated in the previous note (<i>ibid.</i>:26).</i> If he says: "as the pledges of the upright," his vow is binding<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For the upright do make pledges, for a pledge involves the sanctification of an article at hand and if the upright wish to take such action, there is nothing preventing them from fulfilling their vow. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains that the upright would bring their sacrificial animals to the Temple Mount and only then, pledge to bring them. In this way, there would be no question of them keeping their word.</i> with regard to nazirite vows and sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam does not mention oaths, because the upright try to avoid taking oaths entirely.</i> All terms used to refer to sacrifices are considered as sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nizirut</i> 1:16 which states:<br>There are places where people are inarticulate and mispronounce words, calling subjects by different names. [In those places,] we follow the meaning of the local term.<br>What is meant by the statement that all the terms used for the word <i>korban</i>, "sacrifice," are equivalent to the term <i>korban</i>? When one says: "[This produce] is considered for me like a <i>konam</i>," "...a <i>konach</i>," or "...a <i>konaz,</i>" they are all terms referring to a <i>korban</i>.<br></i>
Neither one who takes a vow or one who makes a pledge is liable unless his statements match his intent.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle applying with regard to oaths (<i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:10-12) and vows (<i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 2:2).<br>In the continuation of the halachah, the Rambam describes a situation in which one is liable for a sacrifice he intended to give even though he does not say anything. That, however, is not a contradiction to the statements here, because here, the person's statements contradict his intent.</i><br>What is implied? If one had the intent of saying: "I promise to bring a burnt-offering," but he said "...a peace-offering" or he had the intent of saying: "I promise to bring a peace-offering," but he said "...a burnt-offering," his words are of no substance. If, [however,] he intended to take a vow to bring a burnt-offering and said: "a sacrifice," or he intended to say devotion offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Which is consecrated to the Temple treasury.</i> and he said: "consecrated property," his statements are binding, for a burnt-offering is a sacrifice, and something designated as devotion offerings is consecrated. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>With regard to vows and pledges, it is not necessary for him to make any verbal statements. He is obligated even if he made a firm resolve in his heart without saying anything. What is implied? If one made a resolve in his heart that an animal should be designated as a burnt-offering or that he should bring a burnt-offering, he is obligated. [This is derived from Exodus 35:5]: "All those generous of heart shall bring it." Generosity in the heart [alone is sufficient to] establish an obligation to bring. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations involving vows and pledges for the consecration [of sacrifices].
With regard to vows and pledges and other commitments that a person makes that obligated him, endowment obligations, pledges for worth,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Both of these terms refer to commitments to make donations to the Temple treasury.

If three festivals pass without him bringing the sacrifices he vowed or pledged to bring or without giving the endowment obligations, devotion offerings, and pledges for worth, he violates a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 155) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 574) count this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i> 23:22] states: "Do not delay in paying it."

If one consecrated an animal [to be offered] on the altar and [after] two festivals passed [without it being offered], it became blemished and it was redeemed for another animal, the person does not violate the negative commandment until three festivals pass without the second [animal being sacrificed].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For the calculation begins anew with the consecration of the second animal.</i><br>Both a man and a woman<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 6b explains that since a woman is not obligated to bring a burnt-offering (<i>olat re'i'ah</i>) for the pilgrimage festival, one might think that the entire concept of a pilgrimage festival - and hence, this commandment - does not apply to her. This supposition is, however, negated, for she is obligated in bringing the peace-offering of rejoicing (<i>shalmei simchah</i>) that are sacrificed on festivals.</i> are liable for the transgression [the prohibition against] delaying [the offering of a sacrifice]. An heir, however, does not violate this prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition is not to delay paying one's vow. Since the heir did not make the vow himself, he does not violate this prohibition if he does not carry out the vow at the appropriate time. He is, however, to bring the sacrifice. See <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 6b.</i>
Despite the fact that three festivals passed, no [animal consecrated as] a sacrifice is disqualified. Instead, [such animals should be] sacrificed and they are acceptable. Each and every day that passes after the three pilgrimage festivals involves a violation of [the above] prohibition. The [Jewish] court is commanded to apply physical coercion to the person<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>Ketubot</i> 86a-b explains, the court is obligated to compel every individual to observe every positive commandment incumbent upon him, even if it requires beating him to the point of death.</i> immediately until he offers his sacrifices on the first festival that presents itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording appears to imply that if the court sees the person acting indolently with regard to the sacrifice, it is obligated to subject him to compulsion even if the first festival has not passed. This point is not, however, accepted by all authorities (Rav Yosef Corcus).</i>
Even though [Leviticus 1:3] states that [a burnt-offering must be sacrificed] "willfully," he may be compelled until he says: "I desire."<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 2:20, the Rambam explains why acting under compulsion in such circumstances can be considered willful activity. [For there also, a bill of divorce must be written with the husband's consent and yet he can be compelled to consent.]<br>The concept of being compelled against one's will applies only when speaking about a person who is being compelled and forced to do something that the Torah does not obligate him to do - e.g., a person who was beaten until he consented to a sale, or to give a present. If, however, a person's evil inclination presses him to negate [the observance of] a mitzvah or to commit a transgression, and he was beaten until he performed the action he was obligated to perform, or he dissociated himself from the forbidden action, he is not considered to have been forced against his will. On the contrary, it is he himself who is forcing [his own conduct to become debased].<br>With regard to this person who [outwardly] refuses to divorce [his wife] - he wants to be part of the Jewish people, and he wants to perform all the mitzvot and eschew all the transgressions; it is only his evil inclination that presses him [to act otherwise]. Therefore, when he is beaten, until his [evil] inclination has been weakened, and he consents [to the divorce], he is considered to have performed the divorce willfully.<br>The Rambam's statements have implications far beyond their immediate halachic context. The Rambam is saying that the fundamental desire of every Jew is to affirm his Jewishness and observe the Torah and its mitzvot. Even when a person's conscious mind does not necessarily consent to this inner motivation, it is at work, molding his character without his knowledge. And at times, either because of undesirable circumstances - being compelled against his will as above - or because of desirable ones - an expression of Divine favor - this inner drive will surface.</i> Whether he vowed [to bring a sacrifice] and did not set it aside or set it aside, but did not offer it, he may be compelled until he sacrifices it.
[The court] seizes collateral from all of those obligated to bring burnt-offerings or peace-offerings [to compel them to offer them]. Even though [the sacrifice] will not bring him atonement unless he desires to offer it, as [implied by] the term "willfully," he is compelled until he says: "I desire."<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 3:14:<br>They take... [from the persons obligated] against their will. They are not required to return the collateral by day or by night. They sell all the landed property and movable property in [those person's] possession including their clothing, household articles, servants, and livestock, taking their payment from everything.<br></i> Collateral is not seized from those obligated to bring sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, by contrast. [The rationale is that] since [the failure to bring these sacrifices] prevents [the people] from receiving atonement,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Burnt-offerings also feature in bringing atonement for the failure to fulfill positive commandments. Nevertheless, in that instance the atonement is achieved through the person's repentance and the offering is considered merely as a present. In contrast, a sin-offering is required to bring about the atonement itself.</i> we are not concerned that they will be sinful and delay [bringing] their sacrifices. [The only] exception is the sin-offering brought by a nazirite. Since [the failure to bring] it does not prevent him from drinking wine,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nazirut</i> 8:10.</i> he is compelled [to bring the offering], lest he delay it.

Chapter 15

When a person says: "The offspring of this [animal]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is speaking about an animal that is not consecrated. If an animal that is consecrated becomes pregnant, its status is automatically transferred to its offspring [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Temurah</i> 5:1)].</i> is [consecrated] as a burnt-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the offspring should be sacrificed as a burnt-offering.</i> and it is [consecrated] as a peace-offering,"<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the discussion to follow, it is important to note that burnt-offerings are only male. Peace-offerings can be both male and female. Sin-offerings may also be female (Chapter 1, Halachot 8-11). Nevertheless, as stated in <i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 4:2, the offspring of a sin-offering is not sacrificed, but instead, set aside to die. Hence the Rambam speaks only of the offspring of peace-offerings.</i> his words are binding. [Should he say:] "It is [consecrated] as a peace-offering and its offspring as a burnt-offering," if that was his intent, his words are binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between the first clause and the second clause is that the first clause speaks about the offspring first. Consecrating the offspring certainly does not determine the mother's status. In the second clause, by contrast, the person consecrated the mother first. Now consecrating the mother determines the status of the offspring, for the offspring is considered as "the thigh of its mother." Hence ordinarily if an animal is consecrated as a peace-offering, its offspring also has that status and should be offered as such a sacrifice (<i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 4:1). Nevertheless, in this instance, if the person originally had the intent of consecrating the offspring as a burnt-offering, the offspring is given that status, because it was never meant to be a peace-offering. The person could only make one statement at a time and the fact that he chose to speak about the mother first does not affect the offspring's status.</i><br>If, after he made a resolve in his heart and expressed verbally that [the offspring] should be a peace-offering, he retracted and said: "Its offspring is a burnt-offering," even though he retracted immediately,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase translated as "immediately," <i>toch kedai dibbur</i>, has a very specific halachic meaning: "Within the time it takes to say <i>Shalom Elecha, Rebbi</i>" ("Greetings my master"; <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:17).</i> the offspring are [designated] as peace-offerings. For one cannot retract [pledges of] consecration even when one does so immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Temurah</i> 5:3), the Rambam explains that generally if one seeks to retract his statements immediately, the retraction is effective. There are, however, several instances marriage and divorce, the acceptance of a false divinity, blasphemy, the consecration of sacrifices, and the transfer of holiness from one animal to another where retraction is not possible.<br>Nevertheless, the Rambam's perspective is not accepted by all authorities. <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 255:5) takes issue with him and argues that one may retract the consecration of an animal. Other sages, however, support the Rambam's position.</i>
When one says: "The right forefoot of this animal is a burnt-offering," or "The leg of this animal is a burnt offering," it should be sold to those obligated to bring burnt-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">So that it will be sacrificed for that purpose and hence, the portion of the animal consecrated as a burnt-offering will have been offered as such.</i> The proceeds of the sale are considered as ordinary funds with the exception of the worth of that limb.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For that limb was consecrated.</i> [The above applies] provided the person obligated to bring a burnt-offering who purchased [the animal] vowed [to bring] a burnt-offering for a specific price.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difficulty because the person bringing the burnt-offering will be bringing a sacrifice that does not belong to him entirely. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Temurah</i> 1:5) resolves this difficulty, explaining that we are speaking of an instance where the person vowed to spend a specific amount to bring a burnt-offering. Since the animal is worth that amount, he has fulfilled his vow.</i><br>If one says: "The heart [of this animal]..." or "The head of this [animal] is a burnt-offering," the entire animal is a burnt-offering, for he consecrated an organ upon which [the animal's] life depends. If one consecrated a limb from a fowl, there is an unresolved doubt whether or not the entire fowl becomes consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This concept is debated without resolution by our Sages in <i>Temurah</i> 11b. The argument centers on the fact that the concept that one can consecrate a limb from an animal as a sacrifice was derived from the exegesis of a verse (Leviticus 27:9 . Now that verse is referring to an animal sacrifice and hence, our Sages question whether the concept applies to all sacrifices or only those involving animals.</i>
When one says: "Half of this animal is a burnt-offering and half is a peace-offering," it is consecrated, but it should not be offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Because there is no way that one animal can be offered for two purposes.</i> Instead, it should be allowed to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying physical blemish and then be sold. Half of the proceeds should be used to bring a burnt offering and half, a peace-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For in this way, his vow will be kept to the fullest extent of his capacity.</i><br>If he was obligated to bring a sin-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Here he must be obligated, because as stated above, a sin-offering may not be brought on one's own initiative.</i> and he said: "Half of this animal is a sin-offering and half is a burnt-offering," or "...a peace-offering," or he said: "Half of this animal is a burnt-offering..." or "...a peace-offering and half is a sin-offering," [the animal] should be left to die, as will be explained with regard to the sin-offerings that are left to die.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 4:1 regarding what is done with the animal. There the Rambam speaks about an animal separated as a sin-offering that was lost and discovered after its owner had brought another sin-offering in its stead. Since this animal was consecrated for a specific purpose and cannot be sacrificed for that purpose, it cannot be used for any other purpose and is hence caused to die. Similarly, in the instance at hand, since the animal cannot be sacrificed for the purpose for which it was consecrated, it is caused to die.</i>
When one of the partners who owned half an animal consecrated his portion and then purchased the other half and consecrated it, it is consecrated and offered on the altar. Even though originally, when he consecrated half of it, it was unacceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For half an animal cannot be sacrificed.</i> the fact that it was originally unacceptable does not cause it to be unacceptable forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This is a concept that applies in many different contexts of the laws concerning the consecration of animals. See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 3:24.</i> Even though originally only its worth was consecrated,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since only its worth was consecrated (for originally, it could not be sacrificed), there is more reason to think that it would not become acceptable afterwards.</i> since it is a live animal, [we follow the principle:]<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 59a. This is also a concept that applies in many different contexts of the laws concerning the consecration of animals.

Since it is [ultimately] fit to be sacrificed, it should be sacrificed. [Moreover,] if one sought to transfer its holiness to another animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Violating the prohibition of <i>temurah</i>.</i> the transfer is binding.
[Whether] one says: "The worth of this animal is a burnt-offering,"<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">And thus from his statements, there is room to say that it could be sold and the proceeds used to purchase an offering rather than it having to be sacrificed itself.</i> or "This animal is a burnt-offering," if it is fit to be sacrificed as a burnt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It is male and unblemished.</i> its body itself is consecrated and it should be sacrificed as a burnt-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For any animal that is consecrated and fit to be offered as a sacrifice should be offered (Radbaz).</i> If it is not fit [to be sacrificed], it should be sold<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> elaborates, proving that here also, the Rambam's intent is that it should be left to pasture until it becomes blemished and then sold.</i> and a burnt-offering brought with the proceeds of the sale.
If a person said with regard to an impure animal<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an animal from a non-kosher species.</i> or another similar animal that is forbidden [to be offered] as a sacrifice that can never be consecrated: "Behold this is consecrated as a burnt-offering,"<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Or any other type of sacrifice.</i> his words are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The animal is not consecrated at all. Not only is it considered as ordinary property, the person who took the vow is under no obligation and need not sell the animal and purchase a sacrifice with the proceeds.<br>We have punctuated the Rambam's words in this manner so that there is a direct correlation between the law stated in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:10 and the one stated here. Others maintain that the source refers to the first clause. In <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> (see below), the Rambam speaks of consecrating an animal "for the altar." If he states: "This animal is a sacrifice," no holiness is attached to it at all (see the gloss of the Ra'avad there). Similarly, in this instance, since he wished to designate the animals as a sacrifice, his words are of no consequence at all.</i> As we explained in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that this reference is to <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:10 where the Rambam states:<br>One who consecrates an animal which is a <i>tumtum, androgynus, tereifah</i>... to the altar is like one who consecrated stones or wood.... The holiness does not take effect with regard to its physical substance. It is considered as ordinary property in all contexts. It should be sold and the proceeds of the sale used to purchase any sacrifice one desires.

If a person said:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to a difference of opinion among our Sages, <i>Nedarim</i> 29a, whether or not the consecration of the value (but not the physical substance) of an object for a limited time expires if nothing is done within that time.

When a person vows to bring a large animal, but instead brings a small one, he does not fulfill his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For he has not fulfilled his vow.</i> [If he vows to bring] a small one and brings a large one, he fulfills his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For it is as if the promise to bring the smaller animal included the possibility of bringing the larger one.</i><br>What is implied? He said: "I promise [to bring] a lamb<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">An animal in the first year of its life (Chapter 1, Halachah 14).</i> as a burnt-offering" or "...as a peace-offering," and he brings a ram,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">One that is more than one year and one month old (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> or he vowed a calf<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">An animal in the first year of its life (Chapter 1, Halachah 14).</i> and brought an ox,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">An animal in the second year of its life (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> or a kid<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">An animal in the first year of its life (Chapter 1, Halachah 14).</i> and brought a goat,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">An animal in the second year of its life (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> he fulfills his obligation.
If he vows to bring a burnt-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The laws to follow also apply with regard to a peace-offering. They do not apply with regard to a guilt-offering or a sin-offering, for those sacrifices may not be brought voluntarily.</i> either from lambs or from rams and brings a <i>pilgas</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A sheep that is between the age of one year and one year and one month. Thus it is no longer a lamb, but it is not yet considered as a ram (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> there is an unresolved doubt whether or not he fulfilled his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">There is an unresolved doubt regarding the status of a <i>pilgas</i>. Hence, the person cannot be considered as having fulfilled his obligation. Nevertheless, since its status is unresolved, we are not definitely certain that he did not fulfill his obligation.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions why is he not considered to have fulfilled his obligation if he vowed to bring a lamb. As stated in the previous halachah, if one vows to bring a small animal and instead, brings a large animal, he is considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Thus in the case at hand, if a <i>pilgas</i> is considered a lamb, he will have fulfilled his obligation and if it is considered as a ram, he would have fulfilled his obligation, based on the principle stated in Halachah 1. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> answers that the animal's status is considered one of doubt, an intermediate state between the two. Hence it is not considered as acceptable as either type.</i> Similarly, if one vowed to bring a burnt-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This law applies only with regard to burnt-offerings, for peace-offerings may not be brought from fowl.</i> of fowl, from either turtle-doves, or ordinary doves<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Turtle doves may only be brought as sacrifices when they are small and under-developed. Ordinary doves, by contrast, may be brought as sacrifices only when they have developed and reached a mature state (<i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:2).</i> and brought a fowl that began to sprout yellow feathers<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">An intermediate stage in which the fowl is unacceptable, because it is too mature for a turtle-dove and not mature enough for an ordinary dove (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> of both species, there is an unresolved doubt [whether or not he fulfilled his obligation].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since there is an unresolved doubt concerning a fowl that reached this state of development, a person who brings one such dove would certainly not fulfill his obligation. In this instance, however, since he brought one for each species, one might think that it is considered as if he fulfilled his vow. For if this is considered as a stage of development, he will have fulfilled the vow for he brought an acceptable ordinary dove. And if it is not considered acceptable, he would have fulfilled the vow for he brought an acceptable turtle dove. Nevertheless, since a priest is not permitted to offer such a fowl as an initial preference, he is not considered to have fulfilled his vow.</i><br>If one vowed to bring a black[-colored animal] and brought one that was white, [vowed to bring] a white one and brought a black one, [vowed] a male and brought a female or vowed a female and brought a male, he did not fulfill his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For he did not bring the animal that he vowed to bring as a sacrifice.</i>
When one takes a vow without specifying [the type of animal he is bringing], he should bring from the developed animals in the species he vowed to bring. If in his place [of residence], people commonly identify one of [the type of sacrifices] with a specific species [of animals], he should bring [the type of animal brought by] the people of that locale.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This follows a general principle stated by the Rambam, that with regard to the interpretation of the wording used in vows, everything is determined by local custom.</i><br>What is implied? If a person vowed to bring a burnt-offering from cattle," he should bring an ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and not a calf.</i> Should he say: "I promise to bring a burnt-offering," if the practice of the people of that locale is to use the term "burnt-offering" without any description to refer even to a fowl offered as a burnt-offering, he may bring even one fowl, a turtle dove or an ordinary dove. If their practice is to use that term only when referring to a burnt-offering of cattle, he should bring an ox. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
A person who vowed to bring an ox, a ram, a lamb, a calf, or the like should not bring the frailest specimen of that species, because their value is minimal.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As Malachi 1:14 asks rhetorically: "You bring the stolen and the lame and the sick and offer it as a sacrifice. Shall I accept it from you." See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 7:1.</i> Nor is he obligated to bring the nicest, stockiest specimen of which there is no better.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>ibid.</i>:11 states: "One who desires to gain merit for himself, subjugate his evil inclination, and amplify his generosity, should bring his sacrifice from the most desirable and superior type of the item he is bringing," this is a desirable ethical standard, but not a halachic imperative.</i> Instead, he should bring an average animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 13:8 mentions prices to be paid for animals offered as sacrifices. In the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, he explains that the prices mentioned were the average prices for animals at that time.</i> If he brought a frail animal, he fulfilled his vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">As long as the animal is unblemished.</i>
When a person says: "I promise to bring an ox worth a <i>maneh</i>,"<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">100 silver pieces.</i> he should bring an ox worth a <i>maneh</i> in that place aside from its accompanying offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The wine, meal, and oil brought together with the offering, as stated in Chapter 2.</i> If he brought two [oxen] for a <i>maneh</i>, he did not fulfill his obligation.
[The following rules apply when] a person says: "This ox is a burnt-offering" and it becomes blemished. If he desires, he may bring two for the price he receives for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, since the ox was consecrated as a burnt-offering and was no longer fit to be offered as such, the proceeds of its sale must be used for that purpose. It does not matter, however, which animal(s) is purchased for that purpose.<br>In the previous halachah, it was not acceptable for him to bring two oxen that have a combined worth of 100, for he made an explicit vow to bring one ox worth 100 and until he does so, he does not fulfill his obligation. In this halachah, once the consecrated animal is disqualified, there are no qualifications regarding which animals may be brought as burnt-offerings. See <i>Menachot</i> 108a.</i> If he brings even one ram<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the sacrifice he brings need not even be of the same species as the animal he originally designated for sacrifice.</i> for the price he receives, he fulfills his vow.<br>If he says: "These two oxen are burnt-offerings," and they become blemished, should he desire, he may bring one with the money he receives for their sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The new point this clause is teaching is that even if two animals were originally consecrated, one may be brought with the proceeds of their sale.</i> "This ram is a burnt-offering" and it becomes blemished, if he desires he may bring a lamb with the money he receives for its sale. Similarly, if he vows a lamb and it becomes disqualified, he may bring a ram with the money he receives for its sale.
If he says: "I promise to bring a burnt-offering" and he set aside an ox and it was stolen, he may fulfill his obligation with a sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For when taking the vow, he did not specify what animal he would bring. This applies provided people of this locale also refer to a sheep as a burnt-offering (see Halachah 3). Moreover, if he had pledged to bring that particular ox as a burnt-offering, he is not obligated to bring any sacrifice at all (Radbaz).</i> If he says: "I promise to bring this ox or its value as a burnt-offering," [his commitment] is established as binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the animal is disqualified, he is obligated to bring another one like it as a sacrifice.</i> If [the ox] is disqualified, he may bring only an ox with the money he receives for its sale.
If he says: "One of my sheep is consecrated and one of my oxen is consecrated," but he had two, the larger one is consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For we assume that anyone who consecrates his property does so generously (<i>Menachot</i> 108b).</i> If he has three, the larger one is consecrated, but concern should also be shown for the middle one.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For it is also possible that this was his intent, since consecrating the middle one is still acting generously, because there is a smaller one.</i><br>What should be done? He should wait until the middle one becomes blemished so that the holiness will fall on the larger one alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets the Rambam's words as implying that once the second one becomes blemished, the holiness automatically falls on the third. This runs contrary to Rashi's approach (<i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i>) which requires the person to make a stipulation conditionally transferring the holiness that might have fallen on the middle ox.</i> If he says: "An ox from my oxen is consecrated," the larger one is consecrated and concern need not be shown for the middle one.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For by saying "An ox," we assume he meant the choicest one (<i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i>). The commentaries note that the Rambam's ruling in <i>Hilchot Meilah</i> 7:7 appears to run contrary to this explanation.</i>
If he designated one of [three animals as a sacrifice] and forgot [which one he designated] or his father told him "One of these animals was consecrated,"<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">And then his father died without informing him which one was consecrated (Rashi, <i>Menachot, loc. cit.</i>).</i> he should designate the largest one as consecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For we assume that he intended to offer the most choice one as a sacrifice. The Radbaz explains that this case is different from the one in the previous halachah where concern is also given to the middle one, because since he already designated the animal, we assume that he chose the best one.</i> and, afterwards, he fulfills his obligation [with its sacrifice]. Similarly, if one vowed to bring a burnt-offering from cattle and designated [an animal as a sacrifice to fulfill] his vow and [later] forgot whether he had designated an ox or a calf, he should bring an ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">For even if he originally designated a small animal as a sacrifice, we follow the principle stated in Halachah 1 that a person who vows to bring a small animal, but instead brings a large one fulfills his obligation [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 13:6); see also Ra'avad].</i> Similarly, if he designated a sheep and forgot what he designated,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Whether a ram or a lamb.</i> he should bring a ram. If he designated a goat and forgot what he designated,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Whether a grown goat or a kid.</i> he should bring a grown goat. If he forgot the species from which he designated the burnt-offering, he should bring an ox, a ram, and a grown goat.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he must allow for the possibility that he designated any of the three types of animals that could be offered as burnt-offerings and he must offer a large animal from each species for the reason mentioned above.</i> If he was in doubt that perhaps he designated the burnt-offering from fowl, he should also add a turtle-dove and an ordinary dove.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">He must bring both, because they are considered as two separate species and not as developed and underdeveloped specimens of the same species.</i>
When a person vowed to bring a thanksgiving-offering or a peace offering, specifying that it would be brought from cattle, but forgot what he designated to bring, he should bring an ox and a cow.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">As stated above with regard to burnt-offerings, he is obligated to bring a developed specimen. Unlike a burnt-offering, these sacrifices may be brought from females as well as males. Hence, although bringing a large animal fulfills his obligation even if he originally vowed to bring a small one, he is still required to bring both a male and a female, for he is unsure of the gender of the animal he originally designated.</i> Similarly, if he is unsure with regard to sheep, he should bring a ram and a ewe. If he is unsure with regard to goats, he must bring a he-goat and a she-goat.<br>If he forgot the species from which he designated the sacrifice, he should bring an ox, a cow, a ram, a ewe, a he-goat, and a she-goat.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Peace-offerings may not be brought from fowl, so there is no need to bring doves.</i> If he said: "I promise to bring a burnt-offering of fowl," he should bring a turtle-dove or an ordinary dove.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Bringing either will enable him to fulfill his vow.</i> If he designated one particular species in his vow and forgot which one, he should bring both a turtle-dove and an ordinary dove.
When one says: "I promise to bring [an offering] for the altar," he should bring a handful of frankincense,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 13, when one brings frankincense, he must bring at least a handful.</i> for there is nothing that is offered entirely on the altar in its immediate state except for frankincense.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Since he said: "For the altar," we assume he meant something that is only for the altar. As mentioned below, there are other entities which are also offered on the altar, but unlike frankincense, they are not offered on the altar in their entirety. (The hide of an animal offered as a burnt-offering and the feathers of a fowl offered as a burnt-offering are withheld. With regard to the wine, it is not consumed by the altar's pyre, but poured upon it. And with regard to an offering of flour, since there are types of meal-offerings which are given to the priests to eat, we assume that his intent was not to bring such an offering.)</i><br>If he specified his vow, but forgot what he specified to bring, he should bring every type of entity that is offered on the altar in its entirety.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since the primary elements of the burnt-offering are burnt on the altar and the wine is poured over the altar, it is possible that this was his intent.</i> Therefore he should bring a burnt-offering of an animal, a burnt-offering of fowl, a meal-offering of flour, frankincense, and wine alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., aside from the wine brought as part of the accompanying offering of flour (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
When a person says: "I promise to bring [an offering] worth a <i>sela</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">A large silver coin used in the Talmudic era.</i> to the altar," he should bring a sheep,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As a burnt-offering. The Radbaz states that this word should be included in the statement of the person's promise.</i> for there is nothing offered on the altar worth [exactly] a <i>sela</i> except a sheep. If he specified [a particular entity], but forgot what he specified, he should bring a <i>sela's</i> worth of everything that is offered on the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the burnt-offering, this could include wine, frankincense, and flour.</i>
When a person says: "I promise to bring frankincense," he should not bring less than a handful.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachot</i> 106b derives this concept from a comparison to the flour offered from a meal offering, just as there a handful is offered, so too, a handful of frankincense should be offered.</i> If one says: "I promise to bring wood," he should not bring less than two<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term is written in the plural. Hence at least two logs are required.</i> logs as thick as a leveling rod that are a cubit long.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 7:3.</i> "I promise to bring a piece of wood," he should bring one log a cubit long. If he desires to bring the worth of the logs, he may.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">He would place the money in a container designated for that purpose and the priests would take the money and purchase the wood (<i>Tosefta, Shekalim</i> 3:3).</i>
What should a person who vowed or pledged to bring oil do? He should take a handful of it,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> questions how one takes a handful of oil.</i> put salt on it,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">As required of all the sacrifices (<i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 5:11).</i> and toss it on the fire. The remainder is eaten by the priests like the remainder of the meal offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12, Halachah 9.</i><br>What is done with wine that is brought independently? It is salted<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach, loc. cit.</i>, states that salt is not required for wine that is offered on the altar, that refers to wine offered as a libation accompanying other sacrifices. When, however, wine is offered alone, salt is required (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and then poured entirely<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">None is given to the priests to partake of.</i> down the <i>shittin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 2:11 which states: "There were two cavities in the southwest corner [of the Altar], resembling two thin nostrils.... The blood [which was poured onto the Altar] would run off through them and... [ultimately,] go out to the Kidron River."</i> like the other libations.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">It is not poured over the fire, because it would - at least partially - quench the fire and that is forbidden (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Frankincense which is brought independently should be salted and then offered on the pyre in its entirety.
When a person vowed [to bring a sacrifice], he should not bring it from money [for which] the second tithe [was redeemed].<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Ma'asaer Sheni</i>, ch. 4, when a person lives far from Jerusalem and cannot easily take produce from the second tithe to the holy city, he should redeem it for money. That money must be used to purchase food which must be eaten in Jerusalem according to the strictures that apply to the second tithe.</i> [The rationale is that] he became obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Because of his vow.</i> to bring this sacrifice and anyone who is obligated to bring a sacrifice may bring it only from ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">And the second tithe is considered as holy, "consecrated unto God."<br>This is a general principle. The rationale is that since the person is obligated to bring the offering, it must be brought from resources that belong to him entirely (see the conclusion of Halachah 17).</i>
If a person states: "I promise to bring a thanksgiving-offering from ordinary funds and its bread from the [second] tithe," he should bring its bread only from ordinary funds. [The rationale is that] he vowed to bring a thanksgiving-offering and that offering comes only when accompanied by bread which is from ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the bread is considered as an integral part of that offering and not an additional element. Thus when he vows to bring a thanks-giving offering, that vow also requires him to bring bread. Hence the bread must come from ordinary property (Radbaz).</i>
If he explicitly said: "I promise to bring a thanksgiving offering from money from the second tithes and its bread from ordinary property," he may bring [the sacrifice] as he vowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">As stated below, if he specifies, he is allowed to bring a thanksgiving-offering using the money from the second tithes, for he will partake of the meat of that sacrifice in Jerusalem. What is unique here is the fact that the sacrifice will be from the second tithes and the bread from ordinary funds. Even so, the sacrifice is acceptable.</i> If he brought it all from ordinary property, he fulfilled his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 7:5; based on <i>Menachot</i> 81b), the Rambam writes that it is indeed more desirable for him to bring the sacrifice from ordinary funds.</i> Similarly, if he explicitly said: "I promise to bring a thanksgiving-offering and its bread from the second tithe," he may bring it [as vowed].<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, in his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam states that it is desirable for him to bring everything from ordinary property.</i> He should not bring the bread from wheat that is the second tithe, but from [flour purchased with] money [for which] the second tithe was redeemed like the animal which was [purchased with] such money.<br>Even though he explicitly stated that he would bring the bread from [the money of] the second] tithe, he should not bring its libations from the money of the second tithe, for at all times, libations must be brought solely from ordinary funds, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 3, Halachah 13.</i> [The rationale is] that concerning [the libations],<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">This refers not only to the wine libations, but to all vows for sacrifices.</i> [Numbers 15:4] states: "The one who offers them shall offer his sacrifice." Implied is that the sacrifice must be his without having any dimension that belongs to the Most High.

Chapter 17

When a person vows to bring a meal-offering baked in an oven, he should not bring one baked in a <i>kopach</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A range with an opening for one pot [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 5:9)].</i> one baked on rafters,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one of the common ways to bake in the Talmudic period was to heat rafters and stones until they were glowing hot and place dough upon them. Afterwards, the stones and rafters were covered and thus the dough would bake (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>or one baked in Arab pits.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A pit covered with mud into which wood was placed and kindled. The dough was placed within and it was covered so that it would bake like an oven (<i>ibid.</i>). These are not acceptable, because the person took a vow that he would bring a meal offering cooked in an oven and these devices do not fit that description.</i>
When one says: "I promise to bring a meal offering [baked] on a flat frying-pan," and he brings one [baked] in a deep frying-pan<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13, Halachah 6, with regard to the difference between the two.</i> or he promised to bring one [baked] in a deep frying-pan and brought one [baked] on a flat frying-pan, [the sacrifice] he brought is acceptable, but he did not fulfill his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Because he did not bring the sacrifice he vowed to bring.</i><br>If he said: "I will bring these<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Pointing to cakes that he prepared to bake.</i> [baked] in a deep frying-pan and brings them [baked] on a flat frying-pan or promised to bring it [baked] on a flat frying-pan and brought it [baked] in a deep frying-pan," [the sacrifice] is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For he specified that the cakes be prepared in one way and they were not.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>Similarly, if a person says: "I promise to bring two <i>esronim</i> in one vessel and he brings them in two vessels" or "...in two vessels" and he brings them in one vessel, [the sacrifice] he brought is acceptable, but he did not fulfill his obligation. [The rationale<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For all the above.</i>is that Deuteronomy 23:24] states: "As you vowed to G‑d."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that the vow must be fulfilled in all its particulars.</i>
If he said: "I will bring these cakes in one vessel" and he brought them in two or [promised] to bring them in two and brought them in one, they are unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">If he can take a handful from each one separately, they are acceptable as indicated by the conclusion of Halachah 4.</i>If he did not specify what he would bring when he took the vow, but [merely] said: "I promise to bring two <i>esronim</i> and when he designated [the meal for the offering], he set [the flour] aside in two vessels and afterwards, brought it in one vessel, it is acceptable. For the verse states "as you vowed" and not "as you set aside."<br>When he said: "I promise to bring two <i>esronim</i> in one vessel," but he brought them in two, if despite being told that he vowed to bring them in one vessel, he offered them in two, they are not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Because he did not fulfill his vow. It is, however, necessary to ask him and have him respond as the Rambam states. Otherwise, we assume that he is not bringing this offering in fulfillment of his vow, but rather as a separate sacrifice. In that instance, although he would not have fulfilled his vow, the sacrifice would be acceptable.</i> If he brought them in one vessel, they are acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since he offered them as he vowed, the fact that he originally brought them in two vessels is not significant.</i>
When he said: "I promise to bring two <i>esronim</i> in two vessels," but he brought them in one, if after being told that he vowed to bring them in two vessel, he offered them in two, they are acceptable. If he brought them in one vessel, they are like two meal-offerings that became mixed together.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In that instance, as stated in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 11:29, the law is that if one can take handfuls of each individually, they are acceptable. If not, they are not.</i>
If one says: "I promise to bring a meal-offering," he should bring one of the five types of meal-offerings that can be either vowed or pledged.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12, Halachah 4, for a description of these meal-offerings.</i> If he says: "I promise to bring meal-offerings," he should bring two<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since he used the plural, at least two offerings are required.</i> of the five types of meal-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> suggests that the word "types" is a printing error, because even if he brought two of the same type of meal-offering, he fulfilled his obligation. The Radbaz, however, initially explains that the Rambam's wording could be interpreted as being precise. Since the person said two meal-offerings, we can assume that he meant of two different types. Otherwise, he would have just vowed to bring one large meal-offering. Nevertheless, ultimately, the Radbaz rejects this interpretation and states that the Rambam's intent is "even of two types," i.e., he may bring two offerings either of one type or of two types.</i> If he says: "I promise to bring a type of meal-offerings," he should bring two<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, since he spoke of "meal-offerings," using the plural, he is required to bring two.</i> meal-offerings of one type.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For he said "a type," limiting him to only one type.</i> If he says: "I promise to bring types of meal-offerings," he should bring two meal-offerings [coming] from two types.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since he used the plural for both offerings and types, he should bring two offerings and they should be of two different types.</i> Similarly if he says: "...types of a meal-offering," he should bring two types of meal-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">One offering from each type, as in the previous clause. Hebrew grammar occasionally allows for a singular term to be used in a plural sense. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this matter is debated by <i>Menachot</i> 105a and a ruling is not reached. Hence he questions how the Rambam can require him to bring a second offering: If it is not required, he will be bringing ordinary flour into the Temple Courtyard (which is forbidden). Hence he maintains that the person must make a stipulation when bringing this offering: "If I am obligated to bring it, this is to fulfill my vow.

Note the parallels to the declaration made with regard to the firsts fruits mentioned in <i>Bava Batra</i> 82a.</i>
If one says: "I promise to bring 121 <i>esronim</i> [as a meal offering]." He should bring 120 [<i>esronim</i>] in two vessels - 60 in each vessel - and one <i>isaron</i> in a third vessel.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he does not divide them into three equal portions.</i><br>If he said: "I promise to bring an <i>isaron</i>," he should bring one <i>isaron</i>. "I promise to bring <i>isaronim</i>," he should bring two. If he specified [the number of <i>esronim</i>] he vowed and then forgot how many he specified, he should bring 60 <i>esronim</i> in one vessel.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For an individual meal-offering is never more than 60 <i>esronim</i> and if he had promised a lesser amount, bringing more will not disqualify his offering (Radbaz).</i> If he forgot how many <i>esronim</i> he specified and which type [of meal-offering] he specified, he should bring 60 <i>esronim</i> of each of the five types [of meal-offerings].
If he specified his vow and forgot both how many <i>esronim</i> he vowed and the number of vessels in which he vowed to bring them, he should bring [the full range of] one to sixty <i>esronim</i> in sixty different vessels.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This is necessary, because as stated in Halachah 3, if a person vowed to bring two <i>esronim</i> in two vessels and he brought them in one, the offering is unacceptable.

Any extra are considered as voluntary offerings.<br>The Radbaz notes that there is a difference of opinion concerning this matter in <i>Menachot</i> 13:2 and the opinion the Rambam quotes here is that of Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi. The Sages, however, differ and maintain that it is sufficient to bring one meal offering of 60 <i>esronim</i>. The Radbaz questions why the Rambam chooses to follow Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi's view, for it is a minority opinion. Moreover, he notes that in the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, he explicitly states that the halachah does not follow this view. The Radbaz explains that since the Talmud (<i>Menachot</i> 106a) tries to justify other teachings according to Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi's view, we can assume that it is accepted as halachah.</i><br>What is implied? He should bring one <i>isaron</i> in the first vessel, two <i>esronim</i> in the second vessel, three in the third, until he brings 60 <i>esronim</i> in the last vessel. If he also forgot what type [of meal-offering] he designated, he should also brings [60 offerings] according to this pattern in 60 vessels of each type. Thus he will be bringing 1830 <i>esronim</i> from each type.

If, however, he used the term <i>minchah</i> ("meal-offering"), we assume that the fundamental intent of his vow was to bring a meal-offering.

If he says: "I only took the vow because I thought it was permissible to offer such [sacrifices].

When a person says: "I promise to bring the bread of a thanksgiving-offering," He must bring a thanksgiving offering and its bread. [The rationale is that] it is known that the bread is never offered without the thanksgiving-offering and he mentioned merely the conclusion of the sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that this was intent when making the vow.

If he vowed ten, they are the libations for an ox and a ram or two sheep and a ram. Similarly, all numbers [can be seen as such combinations].
If he vowed to bring five <i>lugim</i>, we tell him: "Make it a complete six."<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Which are the libations for an ox.</i> [The rationale is that] he already established it as fit for a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Since libations of three and four <i>lugim</i> are brought, we assume that he did not want to make an empty statement.

When a person says: "I promise to bring wine," he should not bring less than three <i>lugim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 12.</i> "I promise to bring oil," he should not bring less than a <i>log</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See the previous halachah.</i> If he specified a given amount in his vow and forgot how many <i>lugim</i> of wine or oil he specified, he should bring 140 <i>lugim</i>.

The wine and oil brought as accompanying offerings for these sacrifices totaled 140 <i>lugim</i>. We assume that a person would not vow or pledge a larger amount. The Radbaz clarifies that this ruling applies to a very wealthy person who can be assumed to have made a generous vow. A person of ordinary means, by contrast, should be required to pay the largest amount he could conceive of having pledged (see <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 2:8-10).</i>

Chapter 18

There is a positive commandment to offer all of the sacrifices - whether sacrifices of animals or fowl or meal-offerings - in [God's] chosen house,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 84) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 440) include this commandment as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.</i> as [Deuteronomy 12:14] states: "There you will perform everything that I command you." Similarly, it is a positive commandment for a person to take the effort to bring animal sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this excludes sacrifices from fowl, but this understanding is not accepted by all authorities.</i> that he is obligated to bring<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Temurah</i> 21a states that the firstborn offering is not included in this commandment.</i> [and transport them] from the Diaspora to [God's] chosen house,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 85) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 453) include this commandment as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. The Ramban differs and maintains that this should not be considered as an independent mitzvah.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i>:26] states: "[Only] your sacraments that you possess and your vows shall you bear... [to the place that God will choose]." According to the Oral Tradition, we have learned that [the verse] is speaking only about sacrificial animals from the Diaspora which he takes the effort to deal with until he brings them to [God's] chosen house.
One who offers a sacrifice outside the Temple Courtyard negates a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The one stated in the previous halachah.</i> and violates a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 90) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 186) include this prohibition as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. There are several historical dimensions to this prohibition. First of all, in the era between the destruction of the Sanctuary of Shiloh and the construction of the Temple, it was permitted to offer sacrifices on <i>bemot</i> (literally, "high-places"), i.e., individual altars. See the notes to <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:3 which explain the transition between these periods. It is also relevant with regard to the sanctuary constructed by Chonio, the son of Shimon the Just, described in the notes to <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 9:14.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i> :13] states: "Take heed lest you offer your burnt-offerings in any place that you see." If he offered a sacrifice [in such a place] willfully, he is liable for <i>karet</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the soul's being cut off. This involves premature death in this world (before the age of 50, <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 28a) and the soul not meriting a portion in the world to come (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1).</i> as [Leviticus 17:8-9] states: "[Any man]...who will offer a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, but did not bring it to the Tent of Meeting... he will be cut off from his people." [If he transgressed] unknowingly, he must bring a fixed<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This term is used to distinguish this sacrifice from the adjustable guilt offering. See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:4.</i> sin-offering.
Similarly, one who slaughters sacrificial animals outside [the Temple Courtyard], even though he does not offer them as a sacrifice, [is liable].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 89) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 439) include this prohibition as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.</i> If he acted willfully, he is liable for <i>karet</i>, as [<i>ibid</i>:3-4]: "[Any man]...who will slaughter an ox, a sheep, or a goat... it will be considered as [the shedding of] blood for that person. He has shed blood... He will be cut off." [If he transgressed] unknowingly, he must bring a fixed sin-offering.
Which source serves as a warning not to sacrifice outside [the Temple Courtyard]? [It is derived through] an association of verses. [Deuteronomy 12:14] states: "There will you offer your burnt-offerings" and it continues: "There you will perform everything that I command you." [We can conclude:] Just as [the Torah] warns explicitly against offering a sacrifice outside the Temple, and one incurs punishment for this, as it is written: "Take heed lest you offer your burnt-offerings...," so too, it has warned with regard to the "performance" that is involved in slaughtering, for which it is explicitly stated that one receives punishment. For the Torah does not prescribe punishment unless it has issued a warning.
A person who slaughters sacrificial animals outside [the Temple Courtyard] and offers them [in such a place] is liable twice: once for slaughtering and once for offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if he performed both transgressions without realizing the prohibitions involved in the interim, for they are two separate transgressions that are not dependent on each other (Radbaz).</i><br>If he slaughtered [a sacrificial animal] in the Temple Courtyard and offered it outside, he is liable for offering it. If he slaughtered [such an animal] outside, but offered it inside, he is liable for slaughtering it.
He is not liable unless he slaughtered sacrificial animals that are fit to be offered on the altar. If, however, he slaughtered an animal that was forbidden [to be offered on] the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the animals mentioned in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i>.</i> or one of the sin-offerings that was consigned to death<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 4:1 for a definition of this term.</i> outside [the Temple Courtyard], he is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">It is, however, forbidden to do so.</i> [The rationale is that Leviticus 17:4<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The source for this prohibition, as stated in Halachah 3.</i>] mentions "before the Sanctuary of God." Whenever [an animal] is not fit to be come to the Sanctuary of God, one is not liable [for its slaughter].
If one slaughters an animal that is unacceptable because of a time factor involving its body<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachah.</i> or the status of its owners<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 9.</i> outside the Temple Courtyard], he is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It is, however, forbidden to do so.</i> [The rationale is that] in its present state, it is not fit to be brought into the Temple Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition involves slaughtering sacrificial animals and since these animals are not fit to be sacrificed or their owners are not fit to sacrifice them, they are not considered sacrificial animals in the full sense.</i>
What is meant by a disqualifying time factor involving its body? An animal in the seven days following its birth,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:8 which states that it is a positive commandment to offer sacrificial animals after eight days of life, but not before.</i> turtle-doves which have not reached the stage of development at which time [they are fit to be sacrificed],<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>:2 which states that "Turtledoves are acceptable when [their feathers all] are of a golden hue." Before this stage, they are not acceptable (<i>ibid.</i>:9).</i> and an animal and its offspring; for if one slaughters one on a particular day, the other is not fit to be slaughtered until the morrow.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 12:1-2 which states that it is forbidden to sacrifice an animal and its offspring on the same day. No matter which is slaughtered first, one must wait until the following day to sacrifice the other.</i>
What is meant by a disqualifying time factor involving the status of its owners? A sacrifice whose owners have not reached the appropriate stage of time to offer it.<br>What is implied? If a <i>zav</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A person with a physical affliction somewhat similar to gonorrhea that renders one ritually impure and obligates him to bring a set of sacrifices (see <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 1:1, 3-4; 2:1).</i> a <i>zavah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A woman who bleeds for three consecutive days after the seven days associated with her menstrual period.

[The rationale is that] a burnt-offering is a present<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">To appease God and restore His favor.</i> and it is the sin-offering and the guilt-offering which are the fundamental [factors leading to] atonement.<br>Similarly, when a nazirite slaughters his sin-offering outside [the Temple Courtyard] during the days of his nazirite vow, he is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nezirut</i>, ch. 8, for the details regarding the sacrifices a nazirite must bring upon completion of his nazirite vow.

For the sin-offering is what prevents him [from completing his nazirite vow] and it is the fundamental dimension [of the conclusion of] his nazirite vow.
When a person offers a conditional guilt-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i>, Chapter 8, for a description of the situations which warrant bringing these sacrifices.</i> or sin-offering of fowl that is brought because of a doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 1:7 which describes the situations under which such sacrifices should be brought.</i> outside [the Temple Courtyard], he is exempt. [The rationale is that] it was not definitely established that a prohibition [was violated].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to these sacrifices, it is possible that it will be discovered that the person definitely did sin. In such an instance, the sacrifice is not offered. If the sacrificial animal has not been slaughtered, it is left to pasture until it contracts a blemish. If it was slaughtered, its blood is poured down the drainage channel. Since there is a possibility of this taking place, the animal is not deemed a sacrificial animal in the full sense and one is not liable for slaughtering it or offering it.<br>The Ra'avad accepts the Rambam's ruling with regard to a sin-offering of fowl brought because of a doubt since only its blood is offered on the altar, but not its body. Hence, there is room to free one from the obligations involved with a sacrificial animal. Nevertheless, he argues, a conditional guilt-offering is offered on the altar. Hence one should be liable for slaughtering and offering it outside the Temple. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> question the Ra'avad's objection, noting that the Rambam's ruling has its basis in <i>Keritot</i> 18a.</i> When a guilt-offering for one afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i> was slaughtered outside [the Temple Courtyard], but not for the desired intent, [the one who slaughters it] is liable. [The rationale is that] since [when such a sacrifice is] not [slaughtered] for the desired intent in [the Temple Courtyard], it is deemed appropriate and acceptable, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 15:1, with the exception of a sin-offering or a Paschal sacrifice, whenever a sacrificial animal was slaughtered for the sake of an offering other the one for which it was intended, it is acceptable, but it does not fulfill the obligation of the owner (see also <i>ibid.</i>:20). Since the sacrifice would be acceptable if it was offered in the Temple, the person is liable for slaughtering it outside.</i><br>Whenever one is exempt for slaughtering a sacrificial [animal] outside the [Temple Courtyard], one is also exempt for offering it there.
[The following rules apply if] one slaughters the two goats offered on Yom Kippur<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The goat sent to Azazel and its pair whose blood is taken into the Holy of Holies. See <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 1:1.</i> outside [the Temple Courtyard]. Before [the High Priest] recites the confessional over them,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">More precisely, the confessional is recited only over the one sent to Azazel (<i>ibid.</i> 4:2).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that the matter is dependent not only the confessional, but on the lottery in which the goats are designated for their respective purposes. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that the Rambam's ruling is based on <i>Zevachim</i> 113a. Although there are other interpretations of that passage, the Rambam has a foundation for his decision.</i> he is liable for both of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Or for either of them, were he to slaughter only one.</i> since [they are both] fit to come before God for the confessional. After [the High Priest] recited the confessional, one is exempt for slaughtering [the goat] that is sent [to Azazel], because it is no longer fit to come before God [as a sacrifice].
When one slaughters [animals designated as] peace-offerings outside [the Temple Courtyard], before the gates of the Temple building are opened, he is exempt, for a [necessary] deed is lacking.

A person who slaughters [a sacrificial animal] outside [the Temple Courtyard] at night is liable, since slaughtering an animal<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an ordinary animal, not one designated as a sacrifice.</i> is acceptable at night.

If, by contrast, it was slaughtered outside the Temple Courtyard, it becomes placed in the category of animals slaughtered in such a place. Hence the time when it is offered is not significant.

Chapter 19

A person who offers a sacrifice outside [the Temple Courtyard] is not liable unless he brings [the sacrificial animal] to the top of the altar that he constructed outside [the Temple]. If, however, he offered it on a stone or a rock, he is exempt, for the term sacrifice applies only when [an animal is offered] on an altar, even if it is outside [the Temple], as [indicated by Genesis 8:20]: "And Noah built an altar." He is not liable unless he offers the sacrifice to God, as [Leviticus 17:9] states: "...to offer it to God," i.e., unless his intent is for God.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if he offers it for the sake of a person without designating him as a deity, but merely as a token of appreciation, he is not liable.</i>
One is liable only for offering an entity that is fit for the fire<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to an entity which is eaten, as stated in Halachah 4.</i> and for the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Excluding sacrifices that are not offered on the altar, as mentioned in Halachah 7.</i> for example, a burnt offering, as [<i>ibid.</i>:8] states: "who will offer a burnt-offering or a sacrifice." [One may infer:] Just as a burnt-offering is fit to be offered on the fires, so too, everything that is fit to be offered on the fire is what one is liable for offering outside [the Temple Courtyard].
On this basis, [our Sages] said that individuals [who perform the following services] outside [the Temple Courtyard] are liable: One who throws the blood, offers on the pyre the limbs of a burnt-offering, the parts of an animal offered on the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This applies with regard to all sacrifices, even sacrifices of a lesser order of sanctity. Since these parts are offered on the altar in the Temple, one is liable for offering them outside the Temple (Radbaz).</i> a handful [of meal], or frankincense,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Both the handful of meal taken from the meal-offering and the frankincense from that offering are offered on the altar in their entirety (Chapter 13, Halachah 12).</i> or incense,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is offered on the inner altar twice daily (<i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 2:11).</i> the meal-offering of a priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Which is offered on the altar in its entirety (Chapter 12, Halachah 9).</i> or the meal-offering within the accompanying offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> or one who pours a libation of three <i>lugim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For a wine libation is never less than three <i>lugim</i>. See the following halachah.</i> of wine or of water.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintain that one is liable for pouring water on an altar only during the holiday of Sukkos, for only then is water offered on the altar in the Temple. The Radbaz does clarify that this is not necessarily apparent from the Rambam's wording. Indeed, on the contrary, from the following halachah, one could infer the opposite.</i> [This is derived from <i>ibid.</i>:9:] "He did not bring it [to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting] to offer it." [Implied is that] any [sacrifice] that would be accepted within [the Temple Courtyard] causes one to be liable for [offering] it outside.
If, however, one throws the remainder of the blood [of a sacrificial animal] - even the remainder of the blood [from a sin-offering whose blood was offered] inside [the Sanctuary],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the sin-offerings that were burnt. See Chapter 5, Halachah 11.</i> he is exempt. [The rationale is that] throwing the blood on the altar is the remaining aspect of the mitzvah and is not an absolute necessity.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the fundamental aspect of pouring the blood is the sprinkling of the blood on the altar - or in the Temple Building - each sacrifice according to its laws. Pouring out the remainder of the blood on the base of the altar is not of fundamental importance and the sacrifices are acceptable even if it is not performed. Hence, it is not considered as an act of significance for which one is liable.</i><br>Similarly, one who pours a libation of less than three <i>lugim</i> of wine or water outside [the Temple Courtyard] is exempt, whether during Sukkot<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When the water libation is offered. See the notes to the previous halachah.</i> or throughout the year. Since the required measure is lacking,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For three <i>lugim</i> is the smallest wine libation offered (see Chapter 17, Halachot 12, 15). Similarly, the water libation offered on Sukkot is three <i>lugim</i> (<i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 10:7).</i> they are not fit to be accepted within [the Temple]. Similarly, one who offers from the meat of a sin-offering, that of a guilt-offering, or that of a peace-offering whether of an individual or of the community or from the remainder of the meal-offerings, the two breads [offered on Shavuot], or the showbread outside [the Temple Courtyard] is exempt. [The rationale is that] all of these are fit to be eaten, not for the fires [of the altar].
One who offers an entire animal outside [the Temple Courtyard] is liable, because of the portions offered on the altar. Even though they have not been separated, the meat of the sacrifice is not considered as an intervening substance<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 13:5), the Rambam explains that the rationale is that we follow the principles that two entities that are the same substance are never considered as intervening substances.</i> and it is as if he offered those portions on the pyre alone. In contrast, if one offers a meal-offering from which a handful [of meal] has not been separated, he is exempt. [Even though he would have been liable for the handful], the handful is not a distinct and discrete entity. If he separated [the handful] and then it was mixed back into it and he then offered the entire [measure] outside the Temple Courtyard, he is liable.
One who pours oil [over a meal-offering], mixes the meal and oil, breaks up the wafers, salts them, waves them, approaches an altar with them, arranges a table for showbread, cleans the lamps of a candelabra, separates a handful [of meal], or receives the blood [of a sacrificial animal] outside [the Temple Courtyard] is exempt. [The rationale is that] all of these are not activities that complete the offering [of the sacrifice] and [the prooftext] says: "Who will offer a burnt-offering or a sacrifice." [One may infer:] Just as offering [these sacrifices] is the final stage of the service [involved with them], so too, one is liable only for activities that are the final stage of sacrificial service.
When one burns a red heifer outside the place where it is required to be burnt<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The red heifer should be slaughtered on the Mount of Olives, as stated in <i>Hilchot Parah Adumah</i> 3:1-2.</i> or if one offers, outside [the Temple Courtyard], the goat that is sent [to Azazel]<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 3:7, the goat sent to Azazel was pushed off a mountain cliff in the desert outside of Jerusalem.</i> after the confession was recited over it,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 18, Halachah 11.</i> he is exempt. [The rationale is that the prooftext] says: "He did not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting." [One may infer:] One is not liable for any sacrifice which is not fit to be brought to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Temple. This excludes offerings like the above which, though they are consecrated, are not offered in the Temple.</i><br>In contrast, one is liable for offering [outside the Temple Courtyard] sacrificial animals that were disqualified, if they were disqualified in the Temple. What is implied? [Sacrificial meat or blood] that remained overnight [without being offered], they were taken out [of the Temple Courtyard], they became impure, or they were disqualified because of the intent of the person sacrificing them, all are required to be burnt<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Radbaz notes that <i>Zevachim</i> 109a mentions sacrifices disqualified for other reasons. He explains that the Rambam does not mention them here, because here he is speaking in general terms. They are detailed in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> where he discusses the particulars pertaining to these laws.</i> as will be explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukkdashim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>, ch. 19, which mentions the obligation to burn sacrifices that were disqualified for all these reasons.</i> If a person transgressed and offered [such entities] as sacrifices outside [the Temple Courtyard], he is liable.

One is liable for any [entity] that is are fit to be offered to God and these are fit to be offered to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>, ch. 3, if sacrificial meat or blood was brought to the top of the altar after being disqualified for these reasons, it should be offered on the altar's pyre.</i>
Whenever there is a substance for which one is liable for offering it outside [the Temple Courtyard], he is liable for offering an olive-sized portion of it outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Any lesser amount is not considered significant. See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 14:10.</i> [This applies] whether he offered [a portion of the entity] inside [the Temple Courtyard] first, left over an olive-sized portion and then offered it outside or left the entire entity inside and took an olive-sized portion and offered it outside. If, however, [the size of] the sacrificial entity was decreased in the slightest way<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a portion of it was lost or burnt.</i> inside the Temple Courtyard and then the remainder was offered outside, he is exempt.
What is implied? If a portion of the handful [of meal offered on the altar], the frankincense, the portions of a sacrifice offered on the altar, a burnt-offering, a meal offering that is burnt,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a meal offering brought by a male priest, the meal offering of the High Priest, and the meal component of the accompanying offerings (<i>Zevachim</i> 13:4).</i> and the wine libations was decreased within [the Temple Courtyard] and the remainder was offered outside [the Temple Courtyard], he is exempt. [This is derived from the prooftext which states:] "to offer it." [Implied is that] he is liable for a complete entity, but he is not liable if it is lacking.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For the prooftext states "it," and this implies that the entity must be complete.</i> If one removed [the sacrificial entity] from the Temple Courtyard while it was complete, its [size] was decreased outside [the Temple Courtyard] and then he offered it [there], there is an unresolved question [whether he is liable]. Therefore [a transgressor] is not given lashes.
If, [outside the Temple Courtyard,] one offered a limb that did not have an olive-sized portion of meat on it, but the bone itself caused it to reach the olive-sized measure, he is liable, because the meat is connected to the bone. If salt caused [the sacrificial entity] to reach the olive-sized measure, there is an unresolved question [whether he is liable].<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Note a similar ruling in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 3:10.</i> Therefore [a transgressor] is not given lashes.

Nevertheless, the Radbaz states that this ruling applies, not only to a burnt-offering and its own innards, but even one that is combined with the innards of another sacrifice.

If one offered [a portion of a sacrifice outside the Temple Courtyard] and then offered another portion of it, he is liable for every individual limb.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Provided he was notified of the transgression between the offering of each particular limb (Radbaz, based on <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 6:2).</i> If he sprinkled its blood [outside the Temple Courtyard] and then offered its limbs, he is liable twice. For the Torah made a distinction between [offering blood and offering limbs as indicated by the two prooftexts] "Who will offer a burnt-offering" and "to offer it."<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that the Torah uses two prooftexts implies that two different prohibitions are involved. The prooftext "to offer it" refers to both the prohibitions against slaughter and against sprinkling the blood and the prooftext "who will offer it" refers to the prohibition against offering the limbs on the altar (Radbaz and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, thus resolving the questions raised by the Ra'avad).</i><br>If one offered a limb that was lacking [in substance], he is exempt,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to this ruling, noting that the previous halachah stated that a person is liable if the combination of a portion of a limb and the portions of the innards offered on the altar equal an olive-sized portion. This indicates that a limb need not be whole. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others, however, justify the Rambam's ruling.</i> as [one can infer from the prooftext] "to offer it." [This indicates] that one is liable [only] for a complete [limb].
When two people slaughter [a sacrificial animal outside the Temple Courtyard], they are exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This law has already been stated in Chapter 18, Halachah 16. Indeed, there are some who considered its inclusion here as a scribal error.</i> If two people hold a limb [from a sacrificial animal] and offer it outside the Temple Courtyard], they are liable. [The rationale is that the prooftext states] "Every man<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The original Hebrew repeats the word <i>ish</i> meaning man, implying that even two men can be held liable for the same activity.</i> who will offer a burnt-offering." Implied is that even two people who offer [a sacrifice] are liable.
If a person makes several of the required sprinklings [of blood] outside [their appropriate place], he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he did not complete the required service associated with the sacrifice, as long as he sprinkled the blood on an altar once, he is liable.</i> A person who receives the blood of a sin-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is quoting the wording of the mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i>13:6).

[The rationale is that] the entire amount was fit to be offered inside.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Hence if he offers any of it outside first, he is liable. The fact that he does not offer the entire amount outside is not significant. As long as a portion is offered outside, he is liable.</i><br>If he applied it to [the altar] inside and then applied it outside, he is exempt, for [the blood he used] was merely remnants.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the offering was completed through the application of the blood to the altar inside. Although the remainder of the blood should also have been dashed on the altar, that is not an absolute requirement. Hence one is not liable for offering such blood outside the Temple Courtyard.</i> If, however, he received the blood in two cups, he is liable whether he applied both of them outside [the Temple Courtyard], [the first] outside and the other inside, or [the first] inside and the other outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam regarding the latter point, explaining that <i>Zevachim</i> 112a states that one is exempt in the latter instance. Since the blood was first offered inside, the sacrifice is acceptable and the fact that later blood was also offered outside is not of consequence. The Radbaz explains that, according to the Rambam, that rationale applies when the blood was offered inside according to all of its specifications. In this instance, however, the Rambam is speaking about a situation where the applications of the blood to the Temple altar were not completed. Hence, the blood in the second cup is still significant.</i>
When one offered a handful [of meal] or the frankincense from the meal offering<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13, Halachot 12-13, which describe the offering of the meal-offering.</i> outside [the Temple Courtyard], or offered one inside and the other outside, he is liable. Similarly, with regard to the two bowls of frankincense from the showbread,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 5:2 for a description of the offering of the showbread.</i> if one offered [the first] outside the [Temple Courtyard]<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the offering is not complete until both bowls of frankincense are offered (<i>ibid.</i>:3), one is liable for offering even one of them outside.</i> or [the first] inside and the second outside, he is liable.
If a person slaughtered consecrated animals in the present era and offered them outside the Temple Courtyard, he is liable, because [the sacrifices] are fit to be offered inside. For it is permitted to offer sacrifices even though the Temple is not built, because [when the Temple was] consecrated originally, it was consecrated for the immediate time and for all future time.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:15-16 for an explanation of these concepts. See also <i>ibid.</i> 2:4 which states that as long as the altar is built in its appropriate place sacrifices may be offered even though the Temple is destroyed. Based on <i>Zevachim</i> 59a, the Radbaz states that even if the altar is not built, sacrifices can be offered on its site. Indeed, he writes that it is only because the gentiles do not allow us that we do not offer communal sacrifices in the present age. (Communal sacrifices may be offered while ritually impure.)<br>Based on this rationale, after the conquest of Jerusalem in 5727 (1967), the Lubavitcher Rebbe advised his chassidim to leave the holy city on the day before Pesach. The rationale is that the Paschal sacrifice may also be brought while ritually impure. Now anyone who is close to Jerusalem on the day before Pesach and does not bring a Paschal sacrifice is liable for <i>karet</i>. Although many factors are involved and the Rebbe did not advise his followers to actually bring a sacrifice, he felt it necessary that precautions be taken so that they would not be held liable for not bringing the offering. This situation persisted for several years until the Rebbe felt that the Jewish control of the Temple Mount was weakened to the point that it would be impossible to bring an offering.</i>
[A Jew] who slaughters sacrificial animals belonging to a gentile outside [the Temple Courtyard] is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For slaughtering these animals outside the Temple Courtyard. As the Rambam proceeds to explain, this is speaking about a situation where the gentile desires to offer the sacrifice to God.</i> Similarly, one who offers them outside [the Temple Courtyard is liable].<br>Gentiles are permitted to offer burnt offerings to God in all places,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 116b notes that the passage prohibiting the slaughter of sacrificial animals outside the Temple Courtyard begins: "Speak to the children of Israel," implying that the prohibition applies only to them.</i> provided they sacrifice them on a raised structure that they build.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This license applies in the present era as well.</i> It is forbidden to help them [offer these sacrifices] or act as agents for them, for we are forbidden to sacrifice outside [the Temple Courtyard].
