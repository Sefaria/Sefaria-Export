Mishneh Torah, Appraisals and Devoted Property



Chapter 1

Endowment valuations [<i>arechim</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The translation "endowment evaluation" is used because the source of the word <i>airech</i> means "evaluate." Nevertheless, the term is not appropriate, because these endowments do not involve an evaluation of the worth of the person (house or field), but instead, a standard figure. It refers to a donation given to the Temple treasury of one's own free will to be used for improvements within the Temple or the like.</i> are pledges included in the category of vows made to consecrate property,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:2. The Rambam makes this statement to explain why he discusses these mitzvot in <i>Sefer Hafla'ah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). They are mentioned last, because unlike the other subjects discussed in this book, they concern donations to the Temple rather than prohibitions one takes upon oneself (Radbaz).</i> as [Leviticus] 27:2 states: "When a man will utter a vow, making an endowment evaluation concerning humans to God." Therefore [failure to fulfill them] makes one liable for the violation [of the prohibitions, Numbers 30:3:] "He shall not desecrate his word,"<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:5 with regard to this prohibition.</i> and [Deuteronomy 23:22]: "Do not delay in paying it,"<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam describes this prohibition as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah, but does not explain it in these halachot, but instead, in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> (in the introduction to those halachot and in Chapter 14, Halachah 13).</i> and [the positive commandment, Numbers, <i>loc. cit.</i>]: "He shall act in accordance with all that he uttered with his mouth."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:4 with regard to this positive commandment.</i>
It is a positive commandment to render judgment concerning <i>arechim</i> as prescribed by the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Leviticus, ch. 27. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 114) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 350) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> Whether one says: "I pledge my <i>airech</i>," "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of this person," or "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of so-and-so," he must pay the <i>airech</i> as prescribed according to the age of the person specified.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the age of the person mentioned. The age of the donor is not significant.</i>This is a fixed amount as dictated by the Torah, neither more, nor less.
What is the <i>airech</i> [prescribed by the Torah]? If the person whose <i>airech</i> was donated was 30 days old or less,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Until an infant reaches his thirty-first day, we are concerned that he will not survive. See also <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 11:17. Note, however, the contrast to Halachah 9.</i> he has no <i>airech</i>. When one says: "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of this person," [and the person is 30 days old or less,] it is as if he said: "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of this utensil"<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For the Torah makes no mention of the construct of <i>airachin</i> with regard to utsensils.</i> and [the donor] is not liable at all.<br>If [the person whose <i>airech</i> was donated] was between 30 days old and a full five years,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he reached his sixth birthday.</i> the <i>airech</i> of a male is five [silver] <i>shekalim</i> and of a female, three [silver] <i>shekalim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>shekel</i> is eight oz. of silver in contemporary measure.</i> From when one begins his or her sixth year until the completion of the twentieth year, the <i>airech</i> of a male is 20 [silver] <i>shekalim</i> and of a female, 10 [silver] <i>shekalim</i>. From when one begins his or her twenty-first year until the completion of the sixtieth year, the <i>airech</i> of a male is 50 [silver] <i>shekalim</i> and of a female, 30 [silver] <i>shekalim</i>..From when one begins his or her sixty-first year until the day of his or her death, [regardless of] the number of years [he or she lives,] the<i>airech</i> of a male is 15 [silver] <i>shekalim</i> and of a female, 10 [silver]<i>shekalim.</i>.
All of these years are calculated from day to day from the person's birthday.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the censuses taken in the desert, the person's age at the beginning of the year was important. In this context, by contrast, the reckoning is made for every person individually.</i> All of the <i>shekalim</i> are holy <i>shekalim</i>, i.e., the weight in pure silver of 320 barley corns. [Our Sages] already added to the value [of this coin] and made it equivalent to a <i>sela</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">A coin widely used in the Second Temple era. It was somewhat larger than a <i>shekel</i>, weighing 384 barley corns of silver.</i> as we explained in <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 1:2.</i>
There is no <i>airech</i> for a <i>tumtum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A person whose genital area is covered by flesh and thus it is impossible to determine his gender.</i> or an <i>androgynus</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A person with both male and female genital organs. See <i>Hilchot Nazirut</i> 2:11 for a detailed description of such a person's halachic status. See also <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:24.</i> for the Torah prescribed an <i>airech</i> only for a male whose status is definite or a female whose status is definite. Therefore if a <i>tumtum</i> or an <i>androgynus</i> says: "I pledge my <i>airech</i>," or another person pledges their <i>airech</i>, their statements are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, a <i>tumtum</i> or <i>androgynus</i> pledges the <i>airech</i> of a man or a woman, the pledge is binding (<i>Arachin</i> 2a). If an operation is performed on a <i>tumtum</i> and it is revealed that he is a male or female, an <i>airech</i> may be given accordingly.</i>
An <i>airech</i> may be pledged for a gentile, but the pledge of a gentile is of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 5b derives this from Leviticus 27:2 which introduces this mitzvah with the phrase: "Speak to the children of Israel," thus excluding gentiles from pledging endowment evaluations. Nevertheless, the verse includes the word <i>ish</i>, "man," seemingly unnecessarily, indicating that a pledge can be made concerning a gentile. This is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah derives the opposite concepts from the same verse.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that the halachah follows Rabbi Yehudah. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's ruling, citing Ezra 4:3 which states that the gentiles do not have a portion in building the Temple, the intent for which endowment evaluations are given. See also Halachah 11.</i> What is implied? When a gentile says: "I pledge my <i>airech</i>," or "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of this Jew," his words are of no consequence. When, [by contrast,] a Jew says: "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of this gentile" or "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of so-and-so, the gentile," he must pay according to the age of the gentile whose <i>airech</i> he pledged. Similarly, if one pledges the <i>airech</i> of a deaf-mute or an intellectually or emotionally unstable person,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Who are not liable in the observance of the mitzvot themselves, because they are not in control of their intellectual faculties.</i> he is obligated to pay according to that person's age.
An <i>airech</i> may be pledged for a servant and he may pledge an <i>airech</i> like any member of the Jewish people.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even to a Canaanite servant, not only a Jewish servant (<i>Arachin</i> 2a).</i> If he is redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For, otherwise, all of his financial resources are acquired by his master.</i> and he has financial resources, he should pay the pledge that he vowed.
Whether a person pledges the <i>airech</i> of an attractive, healthy person or one who is ugly and infirm, he must give the fixed amount specified by the Torah according to the age of that person.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast to the following halachah.</i> [This applies] even if that person has leprous blotches, is blind, lacking a limb, or possesses any type of blemish.
Pledges for a person's worth are not like <i>arechim</i>. What is implied? When a person says: "I am responsible for my worth," "I am responsible for that person's worth," or "I am responsible for the worth of so-and-so," he must pay the worth of that person as if he were a servant sold in the marketplace,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.</i> whether it be a <i>dinar</i> or a thousand <i>dinar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The person's age is of no consequence whatsoever.</i> [This applies] even if that person is a minor one day old, a <i>tumtum</i>, an <i>androgynus</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>airech</i> may not be pledged for these individuals (Halachot 3 and 5).</i> or a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 11.</i>
Unless specified otherwise,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 19.</i> all <i>arechim</i> and all pledges of worth are [dedicated to] physical improvements to the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam (and his sources) are borrowing the wording of II Kings 12:6.</i> They are placed in a special chamber in the Temple which is prepared for [funds] consecrated for physical improvements to the Temple.
When a gentile says: "I am responsible for my worth" or "I am responsible for the worth of so-and-so," he must pay according to his vow. [The money] is not, however, placed in the [abovementioned] chamber. For we do not accept pledges or vows from gentiles to make physical improvements in the Temple or in Jerusalem as [Ezra 4:3]: "It is not for you [together] with us to build [a house for our God]." And [Nechemiah] 2:20] states: "And you do not have a portion, a right, or a remembrance in Jerusalem."
What should be done with [these gifts]? We should question the gentile regarding the intent he had when taking the vow. If he had the intent to give it according to the guidance of the Jewish people, the court may use it for anything they see fit<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for matters that are for the communal benefit (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Arachin</i> 1:2).</i> except improvements to the Temple and Jerusalem. If he said: "I took the vow for the sake of Heaven," [his gift] should be entombed.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For it becomes consecrated and it is forbidden to benefit from it. See <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim</i> 8:8; <i>Hilchot Meilah</i> 5:15.</i>
When a person is in his death throes,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Who is taking his last breathes (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Arachin</i> 1:3, Rav Kappach's translation). Compare to <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 6:28.</i> he has no <i>airech</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Nor is an <i>airech</i> he takes binding (<i>Arachin</i> 6b). Note the contrast to the following halachah and note the gloss of the Radbaz.</i> nor has he any worth. Since most people in their death throes will die, he is considered as if he is [already] dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Note, however, <i>Hilchot Evel</i> 4:5.</i> Similarly, if a person was sentenced by a Jewish court to be executed because of a transgression that he committed<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Torah has condemned such a person to death, the matter is not dependent on the will of mortals. If, by contrast, one is condemned to death by a mortal king, these laws do not apply, because it is possible that the king will retract his decree (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.</i>). Compare to <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 6:29.</i> and another person pledged his <i>airech</i>, he pledged his own <i>airech</i>, or he pledged his worth or another person pledged his worth, none of the above are liable for anything. For the person is considered as if he is already dead and a deceased person has no <i>airech</i>, nor any worth. With regard to this, [Leviticus 27:29] states: "Any condemned person who is condemned from mankind shall not be redeemed,"<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the commentary of Rashi and others.</i> i.e., there is no redemption for him and he is considered as if he is dead.
If a person who is being led to his execution pledges the <i>airech</i> of other people, pledges their worth, or causes damage, he is obligated to pay. [The money owed] is collected from his estate.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Even against the will of the heirs, for a binding obligation has been created on the estate. Just as an estate is liable for the loans taken by the testator when supported by a legal document, so too, it is liable for the obligations established by Torah Law (the Rambam' s Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Arachin</i> 1:3).</i>
Priests and Levites may pledge <i>arechim</i> and their <i>airech</i> may be pledged by others like other Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 1:1), the Rambam explains that since these individuals are not liable for the redemption of the firstborn, one might think that they are not liable in this context as well. Hence, it is necessary to emphasize that they are.</i> When a minor reaches the age when his vows are of consequence,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 11:1-3, when a twelve year old boy and an eleven year old girl are aware of the significance of their vows, their vows are binding according to Scriptural Law. Below this age, their vows are not binding.</i> and pledges a person's <i>airech</i> or worth, he is obligated to pay,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">When he comes of age and has money of his own.</i> for his vows are of consequence, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>.
The <i>arechim</i> are fixed according to the age of the person who is the object of the pledge, not the age of the person making the pledge. What is implied? When a twenty year-old tells a sixty year-old, "I pledge your <i>airech</i>," he must give the <i>airech</i> of a sixty year-old. When a sixty year-old tells a twenty year-old, "I pledge your <i>airech</i>," he must give the <i>airech</i> of a twenty year-old. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
The statements of the person pledging the <i>airech</i> must match his intent, as [is the law with regard] to other vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 2:2. Since Leviticus 27:2 uses the term vow when speaking of these pledges, they are bound by the laws applying to other vows.</i> One may appeal [to a sage] for the absolution of a pledge of an <i>airech</i> or one's worth, just as one may appeal for the absolution of other vows and consecrations.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 4:5,7.</i>
When a person says: "I am responsible for the <i>airech</i> of these individuals," he must pay the combined <i>airech</i> of them all, each one of them according to his years. If he<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The person making the pledge.</i> was poor, he should give one <i>airech</i> paid by a poor man<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachot 2-3, which states that the minimum amount of an <i>airech</i> is a <i>sela</i>. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> rules that a <i>sela</i> must be given for each individual whose <i>airech</i> he pledged.</i> for them all together. If he was wealthy, he should give the <i>airech</i> paid by a wealthy man<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the <i>airech</i> specified by the Torah.</i> for each one of them.
When a person says: "I pledge my <i>airech</i>" and then repeats: "I pledge my <i>airech</i>" - even if he makes this statement several times - he must pay an <i>airech</i> for each pledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>arechim</i> are vows and one vow can take effect upon another (Radbaz).</i> If he says: "I pledge two of my <i>arechim,</i> he must pay two <i>arechim</i>. This also applies if he pledges four, or even 1000, <i>arechim</i>, he must pay the number that he pledged.
When one says: "I pledge an <i>airech</i>" without identifying the person whose <i>airech</i> he is pledging, but mentions an <i>airech</i> without any more particulars, he is liable to pay the lowest of all <i>arechim</i>, i.e., three <i>shekalim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that his obligation was for the smallest amount possible.</i>
When a person says: "I pledge my <i>airech</i>," but dies before standing before [a court for] appraisal,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.</i> his heirs are not liable to pay, as [implied by Leviticus 27:8]: "And he shall be made to stand before the priests and the priest will evaluate him."<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the obligation takes effect only when he stands before the priest for appraisal (the Rambam' s Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Arachin</i> 5:3). Since he did not do that, his heirs are under no obligation (Radbaz). The Ra'avad, however, differs with the Rambam and maintains that as soon as a person pledges an <i>airech</i>, he is liable for it and an obligation is created for his estate. Hence, he differs with the Rambam's ruling.<br>Apparently, the Rambam is saying that if a person pledges an <i>airech</i>, he must stand before a priest and state his age, so that the priest will establish his appraisal. The <i>Merkevat HaMishneh</i> notes that the literal meaning of the verse is that if a person is too poor to pay the <i>airech</i>, the priests will evaluate how much he can pay.</i> If he stood before [a court for] appraisal and then died, the heirs must pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For once an <i>airech</i> is established, a binding obligation is incurred and his estate is required to pay.</i>
If, however, he says: "I pledge my worth," even if he stands before [a court for] appraisal, but dies before they establish a fixed amount and the judges say how much he is worth, his heirs are not obligated to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Until an appraisal is established by the courts, the obligation is not defined. Hence, when he dies, all liability is removed from the estate because a deceased person has no worth (<i>Arachin</i> 20a).</i> If, however, they affixed his worth and then he died, his heirs must pay.
What is the difference between <i>arechim</i> and pledges of worth? [The amount required to be paid] for <i>arechim</i> is fixed by the Torah, while [the amount required to be paid] for a pledge of worth is not fixed.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">According to early printings and authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. This clause should be part of the previous halachah and the present halachah begins: "Similarly, when a person says: 'I pledge....'"</i><br>Similarly, when a person says: "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of so-and-so and both the person who made the pledge and the one whose <i>airech</i> was pledged died after the latter stood before [a court for] appraisal, the heirs [of the person who made the pledge] are obligated to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This is a direct extension of the concepts stated in Halachah 21.</i> If the person whose <i>airech</i> was pledged died before standing before [a court for] appraisal, even though the person who made the pledge is alive, he is not liable. [The rationale is that] a deceased person does not have an <i>airech</i> and a person whose <i>airech</i> must stand before [a court for] appraisal [before the commitment becomes binding]. [Similarly,] if one said: "I pledge the worth of so-and-so" and that person stood for an appraisal, but died before an evaluation of his worth was established,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam emphasizes in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 5:2), there is a difference in this regard between the pledge of an <i>airech</i> and the pledge of a person's worth. When his <i>airech</i> is pledged, the person who made the pledge is liable as soon as he stands before the court for appraisal. Since the matter is dependent on his age alone, there is no need for an evaluation. When, by contrast, a person's worth is pledged, that worth must be evaluated and until the evaluation is completed, there is no obligation.</i> [the one who made the pledge] is not liable, for a deceased person has no worth.

Chapter 2

When a person says: "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of my hand," "...my eye," or "...my foot," or "...that person's hand" or "...that person's eye," his words are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that the Torah prescribed an <i>airech</i> for a person in his or her totality, not for his individual limbs (<i>Arachin</i> 4a; 20a).</i> [If he says:] "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of my heart" or "...my liver" or "...that person's heart" or "...that person's liver," he must pay the entire <i>airech</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since the person's life is dependent on his heart or his liver, pledging the <i>airech</i> of these organs is like pledging his entire <i>airech</i>. See <i>Arachin</i> 20a.</i> Similarly, with regard to any limb which if removed would cause the person to die, if one says: "I pledge its <i>airech</i>," he must pay the <i>airech</i> of the entire person.
If a person says: "I pledge half my <i>airech</i>," he must pay half his <i>airech</i>. If he says: "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of half myself," he must pay his entire <i>airech</i>, for it is impossible for him to live if half his body is removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The same law applies if he pledges the <i>airech</i> of half of his heart (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Arachin</i> 5:3).</i>
When a person says: "I pledge the worth of my hand" or "...the worth of so-and-so's hand," we evaluate how much he is worth with a hand and how much he would be worth without a hand and he should give [the difference] to the Temple treasury.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This reflects one of the differences between pledges of worth and <i>arechim</i>. He is liable for his pledge, because his words have significance. His hand has value that can be appraised.</i><br>What is implied? If he is sold in his entirety, he will be worth fifty [<i>zuz</i>], but if he were sold aside from his hand - i.e., his hand would remain the property of its owner and the purchaser would not have any portion of it<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 19b emphasizes that we do not evaluate his value as if his hand were amputated, for then his worth would depreciate greatly, because no one wants a person without a hand.</i> - he would be worth forty, he is obligated to pay ten to the Temple treasury. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person says: "I pledge the worth of my head" or "...my liver" or "I pledge the worth of so-and-so's head" or "...so-and-so's liver," he must pay his entire worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Again, since the person's life is dependent on that organ, it is as if his entire worth was pledged.</i> Similarly, if one says: "I pledge the worth of half myself," he must pay his entire worth. When, however, he says: "I pledge half my worth," he [is obligated] to pay [only] half his worth.
When one says: "I pledge my weight" or "I pledge the weight of so-and-so," he should pay his weight. [If] he specified "[his weight in] silver," [he should pay in] silver; if [in] gold, [he should pay] in gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The laws that apply if he did not specify in what his weight should be measured are stated in Halachah 7.</i><br>If he said: "I pledge the weight of my arm" or "...my leg," we see how much it would weigh and he must pay the money that he specified. What is the length of the arm in this context? Until the elbow.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's opinion is shared by <i>Tosafot</i> 19a. Rashi and others, however, offer a different interpretation.</i> And the leg is until the knee. [The rationale is that] with regard to vows, we follow [the meaning of] the terms as used by people at large.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In a halachic context, by contrast, the term <i>yad</i> can refer to the hand. See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:4; <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 11:4.</i>
When a person says: "I pledge my height in silver" or "...in gold," he must give a scepter of his height that will [stand straight] without bending from the type [of metal] he specified. If he said: "I pledge the extent of my height," he may give even a scepter that will bend from the type [of metal] he specified.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Adding the extra term "extension of" indicates that he is deviating from the ordinary manner in which the term would be explained (<i>Arachin</i> 19a).</i>
[The following laws apply when a person] says: "I pledge my weight" and does not specify from which substance. If he is very wealthy and [obviously] intended to give a substantial donation, he should give his weight in gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin, loc. cit.</i>, derives this from an instance which occurred in the Talmudic era. A very rich woman pledged her daughter's weight to the Temple. Our Sages obligated her to give her weight in gold.</i> Similarly, if [such a person] says: "I pledge the weight of my arm," "...the weight of my leg," or "...my height" without specifying the substance from which he will give, he should give gold. If, however, [the donor] is not exceedingly wealthy, he should give his weight or the weight of his hand from any substance which is commonly weighed in that locale, even fruits. Similarly, he should give a scepter as tall as he is [from any substance], even from wood. Everything depends on his wealth and [our assessment of] his intent.
When a person uses any [of the following] expressions - "I pledge my standing," "...my sitting," "...the place where I sit," "...my width," "...my thickness," or "...my circumference" - [his intent is a matter of question<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For example, if he pledged: "My standing," we are unsure whether he meant a scepter that could stand on its own or one that would bend. If he pledged: "My sitting," we are unsure of whether he meant a scepter as tall as he is when he sits or one of his full height that is bent according to his position when he sits. See Rashi and <i>Tosafot, Arachin, loc. cit.</i>, where the possible interpretations of each of the above terms are explained.</i> and] there is doubt [regarding his obligation. Hence,] he should [be required to] give [generously] according to [what could be expected of a person of] his means until he says: "This was not my intent."<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we compel him to give generously, because if he gives less than the amount he promised, he will be transgressing the prohibition against desecrating his vow. If, however, he says: "This was not my original intent," we are certain that he fulfilled his vow (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).</i> If he died,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">And thus his estate is obligated to fulfill his vow (Chapter 1, Halachah 21).</i> his heirs are required to give the minimum that the expression could mean.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">There is no question of the heirs desecrating a vow, because they did not take the vow. The only question is the lien against the estate. Accordingly, we follow the principle that money is not expropriated from a person unless it is certain that he is liable (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).</i>
When a person says: "I pledge a silver coin," he should not give less than a silver <i>dinar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that this was the intent, for this is the most commonly used silver coin.</i> When he says: "I pledge a brass coin," he should not give less than [brass coins worth] a silver <i>me'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that this was the intent, for anything less would not have significant value.</i> "I pledge iron," he should not give less than [a piece of iron] one cubit by one cubit fit for the blade [of iron that protected against] ravens which stood at the top of the roof of the Temple, as explained in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As related in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 4:3, there was a blade of iron position on top of the Temple building to prevent ravens from resting there and dirtying it with droppings. We assume that this was the intent, for there would be no other purpose to give iron to the Temple treasury.</i>
When he says: "I pledge silver" or "...gold" without mentioning the word "coin," he should [be required to] give a slab of silver or of gold of [significant] weight until he says: "This was not my intent." Similarly, if he explicitly mentioned a weight [of silver or gold], but forgot how much he specified, he should [be required to] give until he says: "This was not my intent."
Whether a person says: "I pledge my worth" or "I pledge the worth of so-and-so," or whether one says: "I pledge a <i>manah</i>,"<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">One hundred <i>zuz</i>.</i> "...fifty <i>zuz</i>," "...silver," or "...gold," they are all called "monetary obligations." [Both] <i>arechim</i> and monetary obligations are given toward capital improvements for the Temple, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 10.</i>
There were two chambers in the Temple: one was called "the chamber of secret gifts," and the other "the chamber for vessels." "The chamber of secret gifts" was given that name because sin-fearing men make donations there furtively and poor people of distinguished lineage receive their sustenance from there in secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim</i> 10:8 which explains that giving charity in this manner - i.e., where neither the donor nor the recipient know of each other's identity - is one of the highest forms of giving.</i><br>"The chamber for vessels" was given that name because anyone who donated a vessel [to the Temple] would cast it there. Once in thirty days, the treasurers would open [the chamber]. Any utensil that could be used for the improvement of the Temple was saved [for that purpose]. The remainder would be sold and the proceeds placed in the chamber for [funds] consecrated for physical improvements to the Temple.
If [funds] were needed [to purchase] sacrifices for the altar and the funds collected for that purpose were not sufficient, what is necessary can be taken from [the funds] consecrated for physical improvements to the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">We are permitted to use funds designated for one charitable purpose for a charitable purpose that is higher.

Chapter 3

When a person pledges the <i>airech</i> of someone less than 20 years old and he does not stand before [a court for] appraisal until he exceeds that age, the donor is required to give only the <i>airech</i> of one less than 20.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a lesser amount, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 3.</i> For the <i>airech</i> is defined only at the time that it is pledged and not at the time one stands before the court.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 18a derives this from the exegesis of Leviticus 27:17.</i>
All of the <i>arechim</i> that are explicitly mentioned in the Torah are to be given when the one who makes the pledge is wealthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he has the means to pay the pledge that he made.</i> If, however, he was poor and he does not have the means, he is [required to] give everything that he possesses - even if it is only a <i>sela</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The laws that apply if he cannot pay even a <i>sela</i> are discussed in Halachah 4.</i> - and he discharges his obligation, as [Leviticus 27:8] states: "If he is too poor [to pay] the <i>airech</i>... the priest should evaluate him<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the evaluation mentioned by the verse is twofold: a) the age of the person whose <i>airech</i> is pledged is considered and on that basis, we determine the sum the one who made the pledge must pay;<br>b) if the one who made the pledge is poor, we evaluate his capacity to pay (Radbaz).<br>Once the poor person pays the lesser amount, he is not obligated to pay any more even if later he becomes wealthy (Halachah 7).</i> according to his capacity."
Which source teaches that if he possesses only one <i>sela</i>, it is sufficient to give that <i>sela</i>? [Leviticus, <i>ibid.</i>,] states: "All of your <i>arechim</i> will be in holy <i>shekalim</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is that an <i>airech</i> must be at least a <i>shekel</i>. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 2:1), the Rambam states that if he paid less than a <i>shekel</i>, it is as if he did not pay anything at all.</i> This teaches that there is no <i>airech</i> less than a <i>sela</i>, not more than 50.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For this is the highest <i>airech</i> mentioned in the Torah.</i>
If the person does not possess even a <i>sela</i>, we do not take less than a <i>sela</i> from him. Instead, the entire amount is considered as a debt incumbent upon him. If he acquires property and becomes wealthy,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., acquires the amount he pledged.</i> he must pay a full <i>airech</i> as prescribed by the Torah.
When a rich person [pledged an <i>airech</i>] and then became poor, or when a poor person pledged an <i>airech</i> and became wealthy [before he was evaluated], he must give a full <i>airech</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He is not given the option of paying a lesser amount. Instead, the full <i>airech</i> remains a debt incumbent upon him.</i> If, however, he pledged an <i>airech</i> when he was poor, became wealthy, and then became poor again [before he was evaluated], he may give the <i>airech</i> required of a poor man.
When a rich man says: "I pledge my <i>airech</i>" or "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of so-and-so," and a poor person heard and says: "I pledge whatever he said," the poor person is obligated to pay the <i>airech</i> required of a wealthy man, i.e., a full <i>airech</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For he was not pledging an <i>airech</i>, but instead, taking vow to pay the amount the wealthy person had pledged. The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that the poor man is judged according to his own financial capacity. The Ra'avad supports his view from <i>Arachin</i> 17a where there appears to be a difference of opinion among the Sages. Although the Rambam interprets that passage differently (see his Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Arachin</i> 2:1), the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the Ra'avad's view seems more appropriate to the text's simple meaning.</i><br>If, however, a poor person pledges the <i>airech</i> of a wealthy man, saying: "I pledge his <i>airech</i>," he is liable only for a poor man's <i>airech</i>, i.e., what he is capable of paying.
What is the difference between a person who is liable for a poor man's <i>airech</i> and one who is liable for the <i>airech</i> of a wealthy man which is the entire sum [mentioned in the Torah]? Once everything that he owns is expropriated from a poor man, even if it is only one <i>sela</i>, and then he becomes wealthy, he is not liable to pay the greater sum.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">We find a parallel concept with regard to sacrifices. There are certain offerings that are dependent on a person's financial status. If he is wealthy, he must bring one type of sacrifice and if he is poor another. If a poor person brings the sacrifice required of him, he is not liable to bring a second sacrifice if he becomes wealthy (<i>Arachin</i> 17b; Radbaz).</i> If, however, he would have been liable for the <i>airech</i> of a wealthy man, the entire <i>airech</i> would remain a debt for which he is liable until he becomes wealthy and pays it [in total].
When a person explicitly mentions the sum of the <i>airech</i>, saying: "I pledge my <i>airech</i> of 50 <i>selaim</i>" or "I pledge the <i>airech</i> of so-and-so, 30 <i>selaim</i>," his financial capacity is not evaluated.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if he is poor, we do not evaluate his financial status as we ordinarily do if he pledged an <i>airech</i>. The rationale is that he mentioned a specific amount and hence, he is obligated for that amount (Radbaz).</i> Instead, we expropriate everything that he possesses and the remainder remains a debt for which he is liable until he becomes wealthy and pays.
Similarly, if one says: "I pledge my worth" or "I pledge the worth of so-and-so," we do not evaluate his possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and establish his liability only according to the possessions he owns.</i> [The rationale is that] a pledge of worth is like an explicit vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs and offers a different explanation. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> favor the Rambam's view.</i> It is like someone who said: "I pledge a <i>maneh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">100 <i>zuz</i>.</i> to the Temple treasury." He is obligated to give an entire <i>maneh</i>.
When a person says: "I pledge an <i>airech</i>" without explaining his words, he is not considered as having pledged three <i>shekalim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The smallest <i>airech</i> there is. I.e., he is liable to pay three <i>shekalim</i> if he possesses that sum (Chapter 1, Halachah 20). If, however, he does not possess that sum, we do not say that he has taken an explicit vow. Instead, his worth is evaluated, as above.</i> Instead, he is judged according to his financial capacity, as is the law with regard to other <i>arechim</i>.
[The following laws apply when a person] states: "I pledge my <i>airech</i>" and then repeats: "I pledge my <i>airech</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">And thus he is obligated to pay two <i>arechim</i>. This halachah is speaking about an instance where the donor is poor and does not have the money to pay either - let alone both - of his pledges.</i> If he possesses [only] ten <i>selaim</i> and gives nine for the second <i>airech</i> and one for the first, he fulfills the obligations of both of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the priest began evaluating the second <i>airech</i> first.

This, however, applies only with regard to landed property and not to movable property (<i>ibid.</i>:2).</i> Although everything he possesses is on lien to the first [<i>airech</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">And thus he should have paid all ten <i>selaim</i> for that <i>airech</i>, if he did not do so and paid a lesser amount, he fulfills his obligation.</i> once the Temple Sanctuary has collected its due, it has been collected.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling follows the logic of Rav Sherira <i>Gaon</i>, as quoted by Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi (<i>Ketubot</i> 94a), although the wording of <i>Arachin</i> 7b, 8a, does not imply such a conclusion.<br>The difference between the two situations is that the two debts are owed to two different people. Hence giving one is taking from the other. Thus the chronological sequence when the liens were established is important. <i>Arechim</i>, however, are always given to the Temple treasury. Thus they are both being given to the same place. Hence there is no point in having the money expropriated.</i><br>If, however, he gave nine [<i>selaim</i>] for the first [<i>airech</i>] and one for the second, he fulfilled his responsibility for the second <i>airech</i>, but not for the first. [The rationale is that] everything that he possesses is on lien to the first <i>airech</i> and when he gave nine, he retained a <i>sela</i>. Thus he did not give everything in his possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For when giving the first <i>airech</i>, he should not consider the second <i>airech</i> at all.</i> Therefore the remainder of the first <i>airech</i> should remain [a debt incumbent] upon him until he becomes wealthy and pays it.
When a person says: "I pledge two of my <i>arechim</i>,"<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In which case he is obligated to pay both of them, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 19.</i> and he possesses only less than that sum, there is an unresolved question. Is [the money he possesses] on lien to them both? Hence he should give half of what he possesses for one <i>airech</i> and the other half, for the other and in this way fulfill his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">According to this view, even if he becomes wealthy afterwards, he is not obligated to give anything more.</i> Or is he required to give one full <i>airech</i> - or everything that he possesses<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">If he does not have enough for even one complete <i>airech</i>.</i> - for one <i>airech</i> and the other <i>airech</i> should remain a debt [incumbent] upon him which he will pay - either as a wealthy man or as a poor man - according to his financial capacity.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz rules that, because of the doubt, all we obligate the person is to fulfill the first (more lenient) view. Nevertheless, if the Temple treasurer seizes the entire amount as payment for the first <i>airech</i>, the donor remains liable for the second.</i>
When a person sets aside his <i>airech</i> or his worth and [the funds] are stolen or lost, he is liable to replace them even if he did not accept responsibility for them until they reach the Temple treasurer,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.

This is in contrast to some other financial commitments vowed to the Temple treasury, as stated in <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:2; <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 14:4-6.</i> Even though he set them aside, they are nevertheless considered as ordinary property<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are not consecrated and the prohibition against misusing property dedicating to the Temple treasury does not apply to them.</i> until they reach the Temple treasurer.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For the implication of the prooftext is that on the day you give the <i>airech</i>, it becomes consecrated.</i>
[The Temple treasurers are entitled to] seize collateral for <i>airechim</i> or pledges of worth. They take what they vowed [from the donors] against their will.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to an ordinary lender who must wait for collateral to be given to him.

[When a person] pledges <i>arechim</i>, the worth of an entity, or he consecrates a <i>maneh</i> to the Temple treasury and does not possess [the immediate resources to meet his pledge, we expropriate] all the movable property he owns, leaving him only:<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is left the basic necessities for his spiritual and material sustenance.

If he was a craftsman, we leave him two of every type of the tools of his trade.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">So that he will be able to continue to earn his livelihood.</i><br>What is implied? If he was a carpenter, we leave him two planes and two saws. If he had many tools of one type and a few of another type, we do not sell many of those of which he possesses a lot and purchase some of those of which he possesses a little. Instead, we leave him two tools of those which he possesses a lot and all those he possesses of those which he possesses a little.
If he was a donkey driver or a farmer, we don't leave him his livestock even though he can only earn his livelihood with it.

If there were livestock, servants, and pearls among his possessions and merchants said: "If clothing worth 30 [<i>zuz</i>] is purchased for this servant, his value will increase by 100"; "If we wait to sell this cow to a meat market, its price will increase by ten [<i>zuz</i>]; or "If this pearl is taken to this-and-this place, it will be worth much money, but here it will only be worth a small amount," we do not heed them. Instead, what is done? We sell everything in its place and at its time as it is, as [the above prooftext [implied by Leviticus 27:23]: "You will give your <i>airech</i> on that day, sanctified unto God." [This teaches that] every entity [that is] consecrated [to the Temple treasury] is not embellished, nor do we wait to take it to the market, nor do we bring it from place to place.

Chapter 4

A field which a person inherited from his testators is called "an ancestral field." One that he purchased or acquired<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As a present or the like.</i> is called "purchased property."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam begins describing the laws involving the consecration of ancestral fields. Those involving the consecration of purchased property are described from Halachah 26 onward.</i> When a person consecrates an ancestral field, it is measured and its <i>airech</i>  is the fixed <i>airech</i> prescribed by the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 27:16. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 117) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 355) include the commandment to deal with the consecration of a field as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. These laws apply only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> (<i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 1:6), but not in the Diaspora and only during the time the Jubilee year is observed (Chapter 5, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Shemitah V'Yovel</i> 10:9).</i>
How much is that? For every place where it is fit to sow a <i>chomer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 4 for a definition of this measure.</i>of barley,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is a larger area than that required to sow an equivalent amount of wheat (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Arachin</i> 3:2).</i> sowing it by hand<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 25a makes this distinction, differentiating between a field that is sown by hand or sown by leading an animal with an open bag of seed through the field.</i> without sowing it too closely or to distantly, its <i>airech</i> is 50 <i>shekel</i> for all the years of the Jubilee.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by the following halachah, the <i>airech</i> is given for every year individually. We calculate the number of years left until the Jubilee and divide the sum of 50 <i>shekalim</i> accordingly.</i> The <i>yovel</i> is not counted. [This applies] whether one is consecrating a good field which has no parallel in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> or a poor field which has none as bad as it. [The above] is the <i>airech</i> for it.
We have already explained in <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 1:2-3; see Chapter 1, Halachah 4.</i> that the <i>shekel</i> referred to by the Torah was called a <i>sela</i> in our Sages' terminology and a <i>gerah</i> referred to by the Torah was called a <i>ma'ah</i> in our Sages' terminology.<br>They added to the value of a <i>shekel</i>, making it equivalent to a <i>sela</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, a <i>sela</i> is equivalent to 384 barley corns of silver.</i> A <i>sela</i> is equivalent to four <i>dinarim</i>. A <i>dinar</i> is equivalent to six <i>ma'yin</i>. And a <i>ma'ah</i> is equivalent to two <i>pundiyonin</i>.<br>Thus [the <i>airech</i> for] each year is a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundiyon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we divide the 50 <i>selaim</i> into 49 years.</i> Although a <i>sela</i> is 48 <i>pundiyonin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">And thus seemingly one is overpaying by a fractional amount.</i> when one gives <i>pundiyonin</i> to purchase a <i>sela</i> from a money-changer, one gives 49.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">That is the money-changer's profit for the transaction.</i>
A <i>chomer</i> is equivalent to a <i>kor</i> which is equivalent to two <i>letachim</i>. A <i>letach</i> is fifteen <i>se'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>se'ah</i> is 8.3 liter in modern measure according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 16.2 liter according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> Thus a <i>letach</i> is equivalent to 30 <i>se'ah</i> which are ten <i>efot</i>, for an <i>efah</i> is three <i>se'ah</i>. We already explained in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:3.</i> that a place with an area of 50 cubits by 50 cubits is called a <i>beit se'ah</i>, because a <i>se'ah</i> can be sown in it.<br>Thus a place with an area of 75000 sq. cubits, i.e., a square approximately 274 cubits by 274 cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The measure mentioned by the Rambam produces a square with an area of 75076 sq. cubits.</i> This is a <i>beit kor</i> in which a <i>chomer</i> of barley can be sown.
What is the manner in which the <i>arechim</i> of fields are calculated? If a person consecrated his ancestral field when eight years remain until the Jubilee - not including the Jubilee, as we explained<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 2.</i> - whoever desires to redeem it from the domain of the Temple treasury must give eight <i>selaim</i> and eight <i>pundiyonin</i> for every portion in which a <i>chomer</i> of barley can be sown.<br>If the [prior] owners desire to redeem it,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 5, Halachah 1, the owners are commanded to redeem it and they are given the option of doing so before another person.</i> they must give ten <i>selaim</i> and ten <i>pundiyonin</i> [for every portion of that size], for owners add a fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As Leviticus 27:19 states: "If the person who consecrates it redeems it, he shall add a fifth in silver of its <i>airech</i>."</i> Similarly, whenever the Torah mentions a fifth, the intent is that the principal and the addition will be [a multiple of] five.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 10:26; <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:1.</i> Thus he adds a fourth of the principle. Similarly, if the wife of the one who consecrated it or one of his heirs redeems it, they must add a fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> states that this refers to a heir redeeming the field after his testator's death, but not during his lifetime. A person's wife, however, must add a fifth even during her husband's lifetime, for they are considered as a single entity.</i>
If four years remain until the Jubilee, the one who redeems it must give four <i>selaim</i> and four <i>pundiyonin</i> for every [portion in which a] <i>chomer</i> [of barley can be sown]. If the owners redeem it, they must pay five.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., five <i>selaim</i> and five <i>pundiyonin</i>.</i> Similarly, we calculate the sum [of every field dedicated based on multiples of] a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundiyon</i>.

Instead, it must be paid all at once.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">One may, however, redeem half the field by paying half the required sum, as stated in Chapter 5, Halachah 2.</i>
If there remains only a year between [the time the field was consecrated] and the Jubilee, one cannot redeem it by paying a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundiyon</i>, as [implied by Leviticus 27:18]: "And the priest shall calculate for him [the amount to be paid] according to the <i>years</i> that remain." [The use of the plural indicates] that the field cannot be redeemed by [the payment of] a reduced amount of silver<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">We have taken some liberty in the translation. The Hebrew term used by the Rambam, <i>girayon kessef,</i> means "the subtraction of silver," i.e., we subtract the sum due for the years of the Jubilee cycle that have already passed from the sum of fifty <i>shekel</i>. See Leviticus 26:18.<br>The Rambam uses this wording because, as stated in Halachah 9, if the person desires to pay the full 50 <i>shekelim</i>, he may redeem the field even if less than a year remains to the Jubilee.</i> except two or more years before the Jubilee.
If there remains a year and [several] months between [the time the field was consecrated] and the Jubilee and the Temple treasurer desires to calculate the months as a year so that [the donor] will give two <i>shekelim</i> and two <i>pundiyonin</i> for every [portion in which a] <i>chomer</i> [of barley] can be sown, this is permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, noting that although this appears to be the meaning of <i>Arachin</i> 25a, it is illogical to say so. If the field is not redeemed by its owner before the Jubilee, he must pay 50 <i>shekel</i> a measure to redeem it in the Jubilee. If he does not redeem it, it is given to the priests who are required to pay its fair value (see Halachah 19). Thus the Temple treasury will almost certainly be losing by allowing the person to redeem it for the 2 year amount. Why then would the Temple treasurer be allowed to do so?<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes the Ra'avad's logic, but states that this is the new concept taught: that even if it is not to the benefit of the Temple treasury, the treasurer may make such a decision. The Radbaz states that the law applies in an instance when there will be a benefit to the Temple treasury to enable the property to be redeemed in this manner.</i> [The rationale is that] we do not calculate months with regard to consecrated articles, as [indicated by the prooftext]: "According to the <i>years</i> that remain." [Implied is that one] should calculate years with regard to consecrated property, but one does not calculate months.
Accordingly, it is not appropriate for a person to consecrate his field less than two years before the Jubilee. If he does consecrate it, it is consecrated and it cannot be redeemed by [paying] a reduced amount of silver. Instead, if the one redeeming it is willing to pay 50 <i>shekel</i> for [each parcel in which] a <i>chomer</i> [can be sown], he may redeem it. If not, it is given to the priests in the Jubilee year, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 19.</i>
When a person consecrates his field in the Jubilee year itself, it is not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion concerning this issue in <i>Arachin</i> 25b. Shmuel interprets Leviticus 27:17 as excluding fields consecrated in the Jubilee itself. Rav differs. Significantly, although here the Rambam follows the opinion of Shmuel, in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 7:1), he originally follows Rav's view, as indicated by the standard published version. Rav Kapach maintains that the manuscript copies of the Commentary to the Mishnah reflect a change of view and as in the text here, he follows Shmuel's view.</i> If a priest or a Levite consecrate [their property] in the Jubilee itself, it is consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in the following halachah and in Halachah 21, they are governed by different laws than ordinary Israelites in this regard.

Just as they can redeem [their fields] at all times,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 21.</i> so too, they can consecrate them at all times.
When a person consecrates his field after the Jubilee year, it is not redeemed by [paying] a reduced amount of silver until the completion of a year after the Jubilee, because we do not calculate months with regard to consecrated property.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 8.</i> Therefore if the one redeeming it is willing to pay 50 <i>shekel</i> for [each parcel in which] a <i>chomer</i> can be sown, he may redeem it even on the day after the Jubilee year. He does not reduce its price at all.
When [a field] is measured,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">To calculate its size so that the amount required to be paid can be determined, as explained in Halachah 2.</i> we measure only those places fit to be sown. If there are stones that are ten [handbreadths] high or hollows filled with water that are ten handbreadths deep, they are not measured with it. If they are less than this, they are measured with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">If they are not that high or that deep, they are not considered as significant entities (<i>Arachin</i> 25a).</i>
If there are hollows that are ten handbreadths or more deep that do not contain water, they are measured independently and calculated according to their worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, noting that from <i>Arachin</i> 25a, it appears that such patches of land are measured together with the field. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that the Talmud is stating that they are consecrated, but that they are considered as independent from the field. Hence, rather than be measured according to the standard value, they are measured according to their worth.</i>
[If the consecrated field] contains trees, the trees are consecrated even if [the donor] did not say so explicitly. [The rationale is that] when a person consecrates property, he does so with a generous spirit. We calculate the worth of the trees [and add that to the sum arrived at by] measuring the land and placing its <i>airech</i> at a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundiyon</i> for every [parcel in which] a <i>chomer</i> can be sown, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 5. The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that although the trees are consecrated, they are redeemed when the field as a whole is redeemed. The Radbaz justifies the Rambam's view.</i>
When a person consecrates a field that is not fit to be sown and is referred to as rocky terrain, it is redeemed for its value.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah passage pertaining to consecrated fields mentions a field that is "sown." Since such a field is not fit to be sown, the general principles that apply to <i>arechim</i> for fields at large do not apply to it.

If there were three trees<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This reflects the Rambam's version of <i>Arachin</i> 14a.

He explains that there is a new dimension in the Rambam's ruling, for one might think that since the donor mentioned the trees explicitly, the land associated with them should be considered as a distinct entity and evaluated according to its worth and not its measure. Hence, the Rambam feels it necessary to emphasize that this is not the case.</i>
When a person consecrates an ancestral field and the Jubilee arrives without it being redeemed, but instead, it has remained in the domain of the Temple treasury, the priests [of the watch in which the Jubilee falls]<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 24 and notes.</i> must pay its <i>airech</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam shares the understanding of Rashi (<i>Arachin</i> 25b) who maintains that the priests pay the standard amount for a <i>beit kor</i>.</i> and it becomes their ancestral heritage.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it never returns to its original owner or his heirs.</i> [They are required to pay,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">From a simple reading of Leviticus 27:20, one might think that they are given the field without any charge.

If the person who consecrated it redeemed it before the Jubilee, it returns to its owner [in the Jubilee].<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to the law (<i>Hilchot Shemitah ViYoval</i>, ch. 11) that an ancestral field which is sold returns to its owner in the Jubilee year. The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's wording, for since the donor redeemed the field, it need not return to him in the Jubilee; it is in his possession. The Radbaz explains that the intent is that even if the donor gave the money, but did not take possession before the beginning of the Jubilee, the field returns to him in the Jubilee. The fact that he consecrated it does not cause it to be removed from the category of an ancestral field. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam is using wording that will enable the different clauses of the halachah to appear similar.</i> The <i>airech</i> which he pays is given for improvements to the Temple, as we have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">From a simple reading of Leviticus 27:20, one might think that they are given the field without any charge.

If the person who consecrated it redeems it from them, it returns to him at all times [before the Jubilee year].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">As is the law with regard to an ancestral field. The fact that it was consecrated and redeemed by another person does not remove it from this category.<br>This ruling follows the Rambam's version of <i>Arachin</i> 7:3 and his interpretation in his Commentary to the Mishnah. The standard printed text of <i>Arachin</i> 25a differs, however, and states that the field is given to the priests in such an instance. The Ra'avad notes the existence of the two versions of the source.</i> If, however, he did not redeem it from their possession and when the Jubilee arrived it is in the possession of the daughter, another relative, or an unrelated person, it is expropriated from them<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">For they purchased the right to it only until the Jubilee year.</i> [and becomes the property of] the Temple treasury. It never returns to its owners again. Instead, it becomes the ancestral property of the priests, as [Leviticus 27:21] states: "When the field departs [from the purchaser's domain] in the Jubilee, it shall become the priests." The priests do not have to pay its value,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the situation mentioned in the previous halachah.

Hence, it is returned to the priests as if they are its owners.
To whom does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">That a field which is not redeemed becomes the property of the priests.</i> apply? To an Israelite. If, however, the person who consecrated the field was a priest or a Levite,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a field that was given to a priest or a Levite as an ancestral heritage, not one that they purchased.</i> he may redeem it at all times. Even if the Jubilee passed and it was not redeemed from the Temple treasury, he may redeem it after the Jubilee, as [Leviticus 25:32] states: "The Levites have an eternal right of redemption."
When a woman consecrated her ancestral field, her husband redeemed it from the Temple treasury, and it is in his possession when the Jubilee arrives, there is an unresolved question whether it returns to the woman<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Because her husband's redemption of it could be considered as if she redeemed it herself.</i> or it is given to the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Because in actual fact, she did not redeem it.</i> Therefore if the woman came first and took possession of it after the arrival of the Jubilee, the priests cannot expropriate it from her domain. If the priests took possession of it first, she cannot expropriate it from their possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">We follow the principle: "When a person desires to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is upon him." The Ra'avad differs with this ruling, stating that since her husband is working the field, it is considered as having been acquired by him, for her. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the Ra'avad's ruling, stating that since the Talmud (<i>Arachin</i> 25b) left the matter unresolved, it is not appropriate for the Ra'avad to resolve it by logic. The Radbaz adds that the husband (as his wife's agent) must intend to acquire the field and it is possible to work a field without having this intent.</i>
If a person consecrated a field and a priest redeemed it from the Temple treasury and it is in his domain when the Jubilee arrives, he should not say: "Since it is expropriated for the sake of the priests and it is in my possession, I should acquire it." Instead, it is given to all of his brethren, the priestly family.
When it is expropriated on behalf of the priests in the Jubilee, it should be given to those priests<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">It is sold and its value divided among all the priests of that watch, not only those serving in the Temple on Rosh HaShanah.</i> in the watch<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The priestly family is broken up into 24 watches who each serve for a week in the Temple (<i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:3).

If the Rosh HaShanah of the Jubilee falls on the Sabbath and thus one watch will enter and one will depart,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 4:9.</i> it should be given to the watch which departs.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Because when Rosh HaShanah began, it was in their possession (Radbaz).</i>
When a person consecrates trees and the Jubilee arrives without him having redeemed them, they are not expropriated [and given] to the priests, for [Leviticus 27:21] states: "When the field is expropriated in the Jubilee... [it shall become the priests]." [Trees,] however, are not a field.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that this law applies when the person consecrates only one or two trees, but not when he consecrates three. For in that instance, they are consecrated together with the land on which they grow (see Halachah 17) and hence, the consecrated property could be referred to as a field.</i> If, however, a person consecrates rocky terrain<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Although certain aspects of the laws of ancestral fields do not apply to it (see Halachah 16), this dimension of them does.</i> and the Jubilee arrives without it being redeemed, it is expropriated [and given] to the priests, for [the prooftext] states "And the field shall..." and this is called a field.
What are the laws that apply when a person consecrates purchased property? Its worth is evaluated and we see what its value will be<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">This is in contrast to an ancestral field where a standard amount is given, as explained above. In his commentary to the Torah (Leviticus 27:22 , Rashi writes that it is redeemed in the same manner as an ancestral field.

The donor's ownership did not extend past that time. Hence he cannot consecrate it for longer, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> Anyone who desires may redeem it. If the person who consecrated it redeems it, he is not required to add a fifth. The redemption is given for the purpose of improvements to the Temple as are other <i>arechim</i> and pledges of worth.<br>When the Jubilee arrives, it returns to its original owner who sold it. [This applies] whether it was redeemed from the Temple treasurer and it is departing from the domain of another person or whether it was not redeemed and it is departing from the domain of the Temple treasury, it returns to the seller and is not expropriated for the priests.

Whenever a field is evaluated for the Temple treasury so that it can be sold for its worth, we announce its sale for 60 consecutive days in the morning when workers come to work and in the evening when they leave.

A prohibition derived from a positive commandment has the status of a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although the prohibition is of Scriptural origin, since the Torah did explicitly forbid it by saying: "Do not consecrate an unblemished animal for this purpose," it is not considered as the transgression of a negative commandment. <i>Temurah</i> 7b states that a negative commandment is also involved. Nevertheless, based on our Sages' statements in the <i>Sifra</i>, the Rambam considers that passage as merely an <i>asmachta</i>, the derivation of support for a concept by the Rabbis and not a Scriptural prohibition.</i>
[The following rules apply when a person] consecrates an animal without making any specifications or consecrates his property without making any specifications: We survey all the unblemished animals that are fit to be offered on the altar. The males should be sold for the purpose of burnt offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Although they could also be used for other types of sacrifices, it is preferable to offer them as burnt offerings.</i> and offered as burnt offerings. The females<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Which may not be brought as burnt offerings.</i> are sold for the purpose of peace offerings and offered as peace offerings.<br>The proceeds [of the sales] should be given for improvements to the Temple. For unless explicit specification is made, all consecrated articles are for the sake of the improvement of the Temple. Concerning this [Leviticus 27:9] states: "If it is an animal which can be offered as a sacrifice to God, all parts of it that you can give to God shall be holy." Implied is that every entity that is fit to be offered as a sacrifice on the altar should be offered [on the altar].
When a person consecrates his possessions without making any specifications and among them were wine, oil, fine flour, and doves that are fit to be offered on the altar, they should be sold for the purpose of [offerings that employ them] and they should be offered. The money should be used to purchase male animals that should be brought as burnt offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam on this issue, offering a different interpretation of the Rambam's source, <i>Shekalim</i> 4:7-8. The Radbaz explains the rationale behind the Rambam's ruling. Since animals can be redeemed, we assume that he consecrated them with the intent that they be redeemed and the money given for improvements to the Temple building. Since these other items cannot be redeemed, by contrast, we assume that from the outset, his intent was that they be consecrated for the sake of the altar alone. These concepts also apply with regard to Halachah 9.</i>
Why should the proceeds from these sales be used to bring burnt offerings and the proceeds from the sale of an unblemished animal be used for improvements to the Temple?<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 7.</i> [The rationale is that] when an animal is consecrated to the altar suffers a [disqualifying] blemish, there is a concept of it being redeemed, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 11.</i> When, by contrast, fine flour, wine, oil, and doves become unfit [for the altar], there is no concept of redeeming them.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad notes that fine flour, wine, and oil may be redeemed if they became impure before being placed in a consecrated vessel. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since they cannot be redeemed once they have been placed in a consecrated vessel, that is most significant. For until they have been placed in a consecrated vessel, they have not been sanctified in a complete sense. See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 6:4-5.</i> [This is derived from Leviticus 27:11-12 which] states: "You shall have the animal stand [before the priest and the priest shall evaluate it]." [Implied is that] any entity that is stood [before a priest] and evaluated may be redeemed. If any entity is not to be stood [before a priest] and evaluated, it may not be redeemed.
When a person consecrates his possessions without making any specifications and among them was incense which is given to the craftsmen for their wages until they return and purchase it, as we explained in <i>[Hilchot] Shekalim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 4:12, in every year that is not a leap year, there is a certain amount of incense left over. For 365 portions were prepared for daily offerings and there are either 353, 354, or 355 days in such a year. Thus there were extra portions left over. The holiness associated with these portions of incense was then transferred to money and that money used to purchase burnt offerings. Afterwards, the portions of incense would be given to the craftsmen who prepare the incense as their wages. They would then sell this incense back to the Temple treasury, so that it would be purchased back with the funds designated for communal sacrifices for the new year.<br>This halachah is speaking about an instance where one of those craftsmen consecrated the incense in his possession to the Temple treasury. It should be given to other craftsmen as their wages and then purchased back as above.</i> it should be given to the craftsmen for their wages as is done with the remainder of the incense. These guidelines are also followed when one of the spices used in the incense offering is found among his possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it should be given to the craftsmen as part of their wages and then purchased with the money designated for the purchase of communal sacrifices.</i>
When a person consecrates an unblemished animal [as a sacrifice to be offered on] the altar and it became blemished<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a blemish that will not become healed (Radbaz).</i> and was disqualified, it should be evaluated and redeemed. Concerning this, [Leviticus 27:11] states: "When any impure animal<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bechorot</i> 37b explains that the intent is not an animal from an impure species, but rather an animal from a kosher species that became disqualified because of a blemish, for there is a second verse (27:27) that speaks about evaluating non-kosher animals. See also <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeach</i> 1:10.</i> of which a sacrifice should not be brought as an offering to God, you shall have the animal stand [before the priest....]" He should bring another sacrifice equivalent to it with its money.
Whenever a person consecrates an animal in its lifetime - whether a kosher animal or a non-kosher one, whether it was consecrated for the sake of the Temple treasury,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Halachah 5.</i> it was consecrated to be offered on the altar and it became blemished,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">After its consecration.

The <i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i> suggests that the text should be left as is and that the reference is to Chapter 6, Halachah 8, which refers to consecrating to the Temple treasury an animal that was already designated as a sacrifice.</i> it must be stood [before the court] for evaluation, as implied by the phrase: "You shall have the animal stand [before the priest....]" Therefore, if the animal died before it is evaluated and redeemed, it should not be redeemed. Instead, it should be buried.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For the holiness that rested upon a consecrated animal cannot be transferred to money after its death. (See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Temurah</i> 7:3). Instead, it must be buried so that no one will make use of it.</i> If, however, a person consecrated a slaughtered animal or an animal carcass for the sake of improvements to the Temple, it should be redeemed like other movable property.
[In the above situation,] if one slaughtered [the animal, slitting] the two organs<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The windpipe and the esophagus. These are referred to as 'the signs' of ritual slaughter. See <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 1:9.</i> [necessary for the slaughter to be acceptable] or slit the majority of these organs<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For that is sufficient for the slaughter to be acceptable (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> but the animal is still making convulsive movements, it is considered as alive with regard to all matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Note a similar ruling in <i>Hilchot Shaar Avot HaTumah</i> 2:1.</i> It may be evaluated and [the provisions implied by the phrases:] "You shall have.... stand and... shall evaluate" apply until it dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that according to the Rambam, this applies even if the animal is incapable of standing unsupported. There are, however, other authorities who differ; see <i>Shitah Mekubetzet</i> (<i>Bava Kama</i> 76a).</i>
When a person consecrates the worth of an unblemished animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the person desired that the animal be sold and the proceeds used to purchase an animal to be sacrificed.</i> the body of the animal becomes consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Since the animal is fit to be sacrificed, it is dedicated to the altar and should be sacrificed itself (<i>Temura</i> 19b).</i> What is implied? When a person says: 'The worth of this animal is consecrated to the altar,' the animal itself should be sacrificed.<br>When one consecrates the worth of one of its limbs or organs, saying: 'The worth of the feet of this cow are consecrated to the altar,' there is an unresolved question: Does the sanctity spread throughout the animal or not?<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Temurah</i> 11b, the <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that were a person to consecrate the limb itself, there is no question that the sanctity would spread throughout the entire animal. The question is since the person did not consecrate the limb itself, merely its worth, do we make two extensions: from the worth of the limb to the limb itself and from the limb to the entire body. There are, however, those who note that in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:2, the Rambam does not accept the principle that the sanctity spreads from a limb or organ throughout the entire animal unless the limb or organ is of vital importance.</i> Therefore it should be sacrificed and not redeemed.
What should be done?<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For we cannot require the donor to sacrifice the entire animal (for perhaps it did not become consecrated), nor may allow him to regard it as his personal property (for perhaps it did).</i> We sell it in its entirety to a person who will offer it as a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">As the commentaries to <i>Temurah</i> 11b explain, there is a difficulty when one limb of an animal was consecrated and another person purchases it to offer it as a sacrifice, for it is as if the person offering the sacrifice is offering an animal lacking a limb. For that limb was not consecrated by him, but by the original donor. They explain that this is referring to an instance where the purchaser pledged to purchase a burnt offering of a certain value and the animal is worth that amount, even without the limb in question. See <i>Hilchot Maaseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:2.</i> The proceeds of the sale are not consecrated with the exception of those of that particular limb.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">We follow the principle that when there is a question concerning ownership, one who desires to expropriate property (in this instance, the Temple treasury) from a colleague (the donor), must prove the validity of his claim. Since that is not possible (because the question is unresolved), the donor may retain the proceeds from the portion of the animal that was not consecrated.</i> If the limb or organ [consecrated] was of vital importance [to the animal], the sanctity [is considered to] spread throughout the entire animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Since the animal could not live without that limb, consecrating it is equivalent to consecrating the entire animal.</i>
[Different rules apply if] the animal [consecrated] was blemished and unfit to be offered as a sacrifice. When one consecrates one of its limbs or organs - whether it is one of vital importance or not - only that limb becomes consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Since the animal is unfit to be sacrificed, we do not say that the sanctity spread throughout the entire animal.</i><br>What is implied? A person said: 'The worth of the foot of this cow...' or 'The worth of its heart is consecrated to the altar,' he and the Temple treasury own it in partnership.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The animal should be sold and the proceeds from the sale of that limb or organ used to purchase a burnt offering.</i>
Similarly, if a person says: 'The head of this servant...' or 'The heart of this donkey is consecrated to the altar,' [he is liable only for the worth of the limb or organ mentioned].<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since neither a donkey or a servant is fit to offer on the altar, the principles mentioned in the previous halachah apply.</i> Similarly, if he says: 'My head is consecrated to the altar,' he is liable only for the worth of his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, stating that a person's severed head is of no monetary value whatsoever, for it is forbidden to benefit from any portion of a corpse. And seemingly, if we would evaluate his head separately, it would be considered as equivalent to his entire worth, for of what worth is a person without a head? Hence, the Temple treasury should be the sole owner without leaving any portion for the person himself. Therefore the Ra'avad suggests that the intent of saying that they are partners is that the consecrated entity's value is divided in half.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the Talmud clearly mentions evaluation in that passage and therefore, does not accept the Ra'avad's view. How is a head evaluated? The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that we consider the tasks the servant or the person performs. To the extent he is involved with those that require intellectual activity, his head is worth more. If, by contrast, his activity is primarily physical, his head is worth less.<br>The Radbaz maintains that if a limb or organ is of vital importance to the animal or person, the value is divided in half as the Ra'avad states. The Rambam speaks of evaluating the worth of the organ only when it is not of vital importance.</i> We see how much that limb or organ is worth and he must bring a sacrifice for that amount.
When does the above apply? With regard to animals consecrated to the altar. If, however, a person says: 'The head of this donkey...' or 'Its liver is consecrated,' or 'The head of this servant' or 'His liver is consecrated,'<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for improvements to the Temple, for as stated in Halachah 7, whenever a person consecrates an entity without explicitly stated the purpose for which it was consecrated, we assume that it was consecrated for improvements for the Temple.</i> since his life is dependent on that organ, he is liable for its entire worth. For whenever an entity is consecrated for improvements to the Temple, the consecration involves the entity's worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Since the animal or person would not be worth anything without this organ, there is no difference between the worth of that organ and the worth of the entire entity.<br>The difference between this instance and those mentioned in the previous halachot is that the previous halachot involve limbs or organs explicitly consecrated to be offered on the altar. Thus that is all that may be done with them. Even when an article itself may not be sacrificed on the altar and hence, we understand that the person is referring to the value of the article, since he is singling out that limb or organ, we consider his intent to be that its individual value be offered on the altar.<br>In those instances, the holiness is focused on the physical substance of the limb or organ. Its value is only a substitute for that physical substance. Hence, we look it at as a particular and not part of the person or animal as a whole. In the instances referred to by this halachah, from the outset, we are concerned with value. Hence, we consider the value of the limb or organ in a more encompassing manner.</i>
When a person says: 'I pledge my <i>airech</i> to the altar,' he must bring sacrifices of the value of his <i>airech</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the fixed amount required by Torah law, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 3.</i> If he is not financially capable of giving his entire <i>airech</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, were we speaking about a person who pledged his <i>airech</i>, he would be required to pay according to his financial capacity, as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 2.</i> there is an unresolved question: Is his evaluation appraised according to his financial capacity for he made his pledge using the term <i>airech</i> or do we not appraise his financial capacity since he made his vow to the altar?<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">And there are no other instances where a pledge to the altar can be fulfilled by giving less that the article's worth (<i>Arachin</i> 5a).</i><br>Similarly, when a person consecrates his ancestral field to the altar, it should be redeemed and the proceeds should be used to purchase burnt offerings for the altar. There is an unresolved question: Should it be redeemed according to the fixed <i>airech</i> established for it<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>shekel</i> and a <i>pundiyon</i> for each year until the Jubilee, as stated in Chapter 4, Halachot 2, 5.</i> or should it be redeemed according to its value, since he made his vow to the altar?<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">And there are no other instances where a pledge to the altar can be fulfilled by giving less that the article's worth (<i>Arachin</i> 5a).</i> In all these and similar instances, we rule stringently.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">And the Temple treasury is always given the benefit of the doubt.

Similarly, in this instance, the property is being taken from the realm of private, personal possessions and being sanctified (see the gloss of <i>HaKtav VeHaKabalah</i> to Leviticus 27:29 . It must, however, be emphasized that the term <i>cherem</i> has negative connotations, meaning 'a ban' and the root has the connotation 'absolute destruction.'

Indeed, Rashi (<i>Beitzah</i> 36b) and others rule in this manner. The <i>Or Sameach</i> suggests that the Rambam's source is Ezekiel 44:29 which states: 'All the dedication offerings from the Jewish people shall be yours.'</i> as [Numbers 18:14] states: 'All of the dedication offerings from the Jewish people will be yours.

The rationale for this ruling is explained in Chapter 8, Halachah 13.</i> If he gives all he owns from a particular type of property as a dedication offering, even if he gives everything he owns as a dedication offering, his gift is binding. [This applies] whether he designates the dedication offering for the priests or for the improvement of the Temple.
When a person gives all of his property as a dedication offering or consecrates it, we take everything that he owns, even the <i>tefillin</i> on his head.

What is the difference between dedication offerings designated for priests and those dedicated to Heaven? Dedication offerings to Heaven become consecrated property and must be redeemed for their worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., until they are redeemed - by the owner or by another person - they are the property of the Temple treasury and it is forbidden to benefit from them or use them for mundane purposes.</i> The payment is given for the sake of improvements to the Temple and then the possessions become ordinary property.

They become the property of the priests, able to be used for whatever purposes the priest who receives the property desires, as explained in the following halachah.</i> Instead, they are given to the priests like <i>terumah</i>. Concerning dedication offerings designated for the priests, [Leviticus 27:28] states: 'It shall neither be sold,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., before it is given to the priest.

Once it is given to the priests, it is considered as ordinary property, as [Numbers 18:14] states: 'All of the dedication offerings from the Jewish people will be yours.'
If a priest has a field that was a dedication offering [or an ancestral field]<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the commentary of the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i>. The version of the standard published text (which reflects that of authentic manuscripts and early printings) would be literally translated as 'When a priest possesses a field that was designated as a dedication offering which he acquired after the Jubilee.' We prefer the version of the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i>, because there is no connection between the Jubilee year and a priest's acquisition of dedication offerings.</i> that he acquired after the Jubilee<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachot 19, 24.</i> and he designates it as a dedication offering, it is considered as a dedication offering and should be given to his brethren, the priests, as [implied by Leviticus 27:21], 'It will become the priest's, [like his] ancestral property.' This teaches that a field [designated] as a dedication offering that [a priest acquires] is like an ancestral field owned by an Israelite.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., just like an ancestral field belonging to an Israelite is given to the priests, so too, a field owned by a priest that is designated as a dedication offering is given to the priests.</i> If he designates it as a dedication offering, it becomes sanctified immediately.
When a priest sells a field that he [had acquired after it was designated as] a dedication offering and then the purchaser consecrates it - even if the purchaser was the original owner who designated it as a dedication offering<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since he was the original owner, one might think that the laws that apply when one consecrates an ancestral field would apply.

There is a difference of opinion concerning this point among the Sages. The standard published test of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 8:5) indicates that he favored the view that maintains that this only applies to priests. Rav Kapach maintains that this is an error and his ruling there is - as stated here - that it applies to both priests and Levites.</i> by contrast, may not be designated as a dedication offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if they make such a dedication, it is of no consequence.</i> [The rationale is that] with regard to the fields [granted to them, Leviticus 25:34] states: 'For it is an eternal inheritance for them,'<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., their landed property is theirs forever. It cannot be given as a dedication offering, because a dedication offering is given to a priest as his private property. Hence there would be no advantage in his making such an offering (Rashi, (<i>Arachin</i> 28a).<br>Thus there is obviously a difference between land or movable property that belongs to a priest and property that he acquired because it was designated as a dedication offering, as stated in Halachah 6. The rationale is that property that a priest owns as an ancestral heritage is essentially his. On the other hand, property that he acquired because it was designated as a dedication offering is not essentially his. Hence, it can be given to other priests as a dedication offering.</i> and an association is established between movable property and land with regard to dedication offerings, as [Leviticus 27:28] states: 'from anything he owns... and from his ancestral field."
When a person consecrates [animals that] had been consecrated [to be offered] on the altar for the sake of improvements to the Temple, the [second] consecration is of consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that consecrating an animal for the sake of improvements to the Temple is like taking a vow to pay its value to the Temple treasury.

[Afterwards,] it should be offered for the purpose for which it was originally consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For the second consecration and the redemption do not effect its original status.</i><br>When, however, a person consecrates [animals that] had been consecrated for the sake of improvements to the Temple [with the intent that they be offered] on the altar, saying: 'This is a burnt offering,' or '...a peace offering,' or he designates them as a dedication offering to the priests, his act is of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Temurah</i> 32a) explains the difference between the two instances as follows: The owner of an animal consecrated as a sacrifice still shares a connection to it.

In contrast, once an animal is consecrated to the Temple treasury, it leaves the owner's domain entirely.</i> For [animals that] had been consecrated for the sake of improvements to the Temple cannot be consecrated [to be offered] on the altar or designated as dedication offerings, because a person cannot consecrate an entity that does not belong to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">And once an animal has been consecrated to the Temple treasury, it is not the owner's unless he redeems it.</i>
When a person says: 'This ox will be consecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For the sake of improvements to the Temple.

The <i>Or Sameach</i> notes that the Rambam's apparent source, the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Temurah</i> 3:1), states that it is permitted to partake of the animal that was slaughtered and questions why the Rambam does not rule accordingly. He explains that the Rambam considers the person who consecrated the animal equivalent to an apostate for by slaughtering the animal, he prevents his vow from being fulfilled. As stated in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 4:14, there are certain conditions necessary for slaughter performed by such a person to be successful.</i> If he consecrated it to the altar, it is consecrated to the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since the original consecration has not yet taken effect, he may still consecrate it for another purpose.</i><br>If, by contrast, he says: "This animal is consecrated immediately after 30 days,"<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the animal does not die within 30 dies, retroactively, the consecration will take effect from the time of his statements.</i> and he slaughters it within those 30 days, it is forbidden to benefit from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since the consecration of the animal will ultimately take effect, it may not be used for mundane purposes unless it is evaluated by the court. That evaluation may not be performed when the animal is dead (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).</i> If he consecrated it to the altar within the 30 days, the consecration does not take effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since retroactively, the animal will become consecrated for the sake of improvements to the Temple, the consecration as a sacrifice is not of consequence, as stated in Halachah 8.</i>
When a person consecrates [an animal designated as] a burnt offering for the sake of improvements to the Temple, only [its evaluation by] the Temple treasurers holds back [its slaughter].<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this evaluation is necessary to establish the extent of his obligation, but nothing more. We do not require him to wait until he actually redeems the animal. The Radbaz explains that there are commentaries that if the animal was not redeemed the Temple treasurers are required to be present at the offering of the animal, because the owner of a sacrifice must be present when it is offered. The Rambam does not, however, require the treasurers' presence.</i> According to Rabbinic decree, however, it should not be slaughtered until it is redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For the Sages decreed that the animal be considered as if its body has become consecrated.</i> Therefore,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because the requirement to wait until its redemption is Rabbinic in origin.</i> if he transgressed and slaughtered it [before it was redeemed], it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Temurah</i> 32a,b) states that in such an instance, the person is not required to pay anything for the dedication offering, because the animal was never evaluated.</i>
A person may designate [animals consecrated as] sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Burnt offerings, sin offerings, or guilt offerings.</i> or as sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">All other sacrifices.</i> as dedication offerings - both as those set aside for the priests or for improvements to the Temple.

After they are redeemed, he should then offer the sacrifices for their original purposes.
What is the redemption process [when a person] vowed [to bring a particular animal as a sacrifice]<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., he said: "I will bring this animal as a burnt offering." In this instance, if the animal dies or is stolen, he is not required to replace it with another animal.</i> and then designated it as a dedication offering?<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one might think that since the animal itself is already designated as a sacrifice and the person is not required to replace it if stolen, it is no longer his, and he does not have the right to consecrate it at all.</i> We evaluate how much a person would be willing to give for the right of sacrificing this animal as a burnt offering even though he is not liable to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the person could in fact bring the sacrifice, we evaluate how much that right is worth to a person.</i> Whoever gives this amount<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Since the person who consecrated the animal is not obligated to replace it, we do not require him to redeem it and offer it. Instead, anyone who desires to pay the estimated amount has the right to do so.</i> may offer this animal [for the sacrifice] for which it was originally pledged.
When an Israelite designates a firstborn animal - whether unblemished or blemished<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">An unblemished firstborn animal is offered as a sacrifice and a priest is given the right to partake of it, while a blemished one must be given to a priest to use as his private property.</i> - as a dedication offering for the sake of heaven, the designation takes effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">And the animal must be redeemed as stated in the previous halachah.</i> Needless to say, if the priest designates it as a dedication offering for the sake of heaven after it enters his domain, [the designation takes effect].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This is speaking about a firstborn animal with a blemish. It becomes the priest's private property, as stated in <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 1:3. Hence, there is no question that he has the right to do as he pleases with it.</i>
How is it to be redeemed? We evaluate how much a person would be willing to give for the right for this firstborn to be his so that he will have the right to give it to whichever priest he desires, to his relative or his friend. Whoever gives this amount<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not require the person who consecrated the animal to redeem it.</i> may take the firstborn and give it to whichever priest he desires. The money is given for the sake of improvements to the Temple.
When a person designates an animal selected as a tithe offering<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See Leviticus 27:32; <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i>, ch. 6, for a description of this offering.</i> as a dedication offering, it is as if he designated an animal pledged to be sacrificed as a peace offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, we follow the principles stated in Halachah 12. A price to be paid to offer the sacrifice is established. Anyone willing to pay that price may redeem the animal.</i> [The rationale is that] he is not liable to replace it.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the animal selected to be sacrificed as a tithe offering dies or is stolen, he is not required to offer another animal in its place.</i>
When a person consecrates his [half-]<i>shekel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to the half-<i>shekel</i> every male is required to give to purchase his share of the communal offerings. See <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i>, chs. 1-3.</i> for the sake of improvements to the Temple, the consecration is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This is parallel to the law mentioned in Halachah 11, that a person may consecrate animals designated as sacrifices.</i> If one consecrates <i>bikkurim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The first fruits that were brought to the Temple and then given to the priests. See Exodus, ch. 23; Deuteronomy, ch. 26, <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i>, chs. 1-4.</i> for the sake of improvements to the Temple, the consecration does not take effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>bikkurim</i> are not his, but rather the property of the priest.</i> If, however, the priest [to whom the <i>bikkurim</i> are given] consecrates them after they enter his domain, the consecration is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>bikkurim</i> become the priest's private property (<i>ibid.</i> 4:14). Hence he may do with them whatever he desires.</i>
When a person designates half of his servant or half of his maid-servant as a dedication offering, he and the priests are joint owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for the portion given to the priest becomes his private property.</i> If, however, he consecrates half his servant and designates half his servant as a dedication offering to Heaven, he is consecrated entirely, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 5, Halachah 18, when a person consecrates a limb or an organ on which an animal's life depends, the entire animal becomes consecrated. Here, too, the servant cannot live with only half his body.</i> Whenever one consecrates his Canaanite servant or maid-servant or consecrates all of his property and he owns servants, their physical person becomes consecrated Therefore it is forbidden to benefit from them<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless the prohibition against <i>meilah</i>, misappropriating sacred property, do not apply. See <i>Hilchot Meilah</i> 5:10.</i> until they are redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are sold to others and the proceeds of the sale are used for the sake of improvements to the Temple.</i>
The Temple treasurers may not take the worth [of the servants] from other people and free them.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">For freeing them might create the impression that they were treating consecrated property with disdain and not seeking its full worth.</i> Instead, they sell them to others<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, they will receive the market value of the servant.</i> and those others free them if they desire.
When one consecrates his servant's hands,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">What the owner is attempting to do is to consecrate the servant's earnings. That, however, is not possible, for a person is unable to consecrate an entity that has not come into existence already (see Halachah 26). Therefore, he consecrates the servant's hands, for they do exist, and thus any earnings they produce become consecrated (Radbaz). Note the parallel in Halachah 28.</i> anything he earns beyond what is required for his sustenance is consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">A servant's master is not liable to provide for his sustenance (<i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 9:7). Hence that money must be taken from the servant's earnings. Nevertheless, since his earnings are consecrated, the process the Rambam continues to explain should be followed.</i><br>How should this servant sustain himself? He should borrow the money [required for his sustenance], work, and repay the debt. [This is allowed] provided he always works for less than a <i>p'rutah</i> and pays it. For if he earned an entire <i>p'rutah</i>, it would be acquired by the Temple treasury as soon as he earned it.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Gittin</i> 12b, explains that even a sum less than a <i>p'rutah</i> can be consecrated. (See <i>Hilchot Meilah</i> 7:8.) Nevertheless, the owner had the intent that this amount not be consecrated so that the servant would be able to sustain himself.</i>
When a person consecrates himself, he consecrated only his worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The price that would be paid if he was sold as a servant in the marketplace.</i> He is obligated to give [that amount to the Temple treasury]. He may earn money and [use it for] his sustenance, for his physical person did not become consecrated as that of a servant does.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">A servant is considered as property and consecrating him makes him the property of the Temple treasury. Hence it is entitled to all of his earnings. This does not apply with regard to a free man.</i>
A person cannot consecrate an entity that does not belong to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 69b derives this from the exegesis of Leviticus 27:14: "When a person will consecrate his house." Just as his house is his own, so too, everything he consecrates must be his own.</i><br>What is implied? If he designates his son, his daughter, his Hebrew servant, or Hebrew maid-servant, or a field he acquired as a dedication offering, they do not become dedication offerings. For a person cannot consecrate an entity when its physical person or substance is not his.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">All of the four types of people mentioned above are considered as independent personalities. Although a father and owner possess certain rights with regard to the earnings of these individuals, he does not own their physical persons. This applies even to his children who are beneath the age of majority (<i>Arachin</i> 28a). Similarly, a field that one acquires is never totally his, for he must return it to its original owners in the Jubilee.</i>
A person may not consecrate an entity that is not in his domain.<br>What is implied? A person entrusted an article to a colleague and the latter denied possession of it, the owners cannot consecrate it.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">For there is no way that they could regain possession of it immediately. Nor may the watchman consecrate it, because it does not belong to him.</i> If, however, [the watchman] did not deny possession of it, it is considered in its owner's domain, no matter where it is located.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although it is in the physical possession of the watchman, it is still considered as belonging to - and able to be secured by - the owner. See Halachah 25 and notes.</i>
When does the above apply? With regard to movable property. [Different rules apply] to landed property that was stolen and [the thief] denied [having taken it].<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">And instead, claimed to be the legitimate owner.</i> If [the original owner] could have the land expropriated through legal process,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Proving his ownership through the testimony of witnesses or through a valid deed of title.</i> he has the right to consecrate it even though he has not yet expropriated it. For the land itself is always considered in the domain of its [legitimate] owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">This is a principle applicable in many aspects of Jewish business law. Land can never be stolen and is always considered as being in the possession of the person who has title to it. See <i>Bava Metzia</i> 7a.</i>
When a person steals from his colleague and the [original] owner does not despair [of recovery],<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the owner despairs of the recovery of the article, it is not desirable for the thief to consecrate it. See <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeach</i> 5:7.</i> neither of them can consecrate it. [The robber cannot,] because the article does not belong to him and [the owner cannot,] because it is not in his possession. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
[The following laws apply when] a person was selling squash, eggs, or the like and a [prospective] purchaser comes, takes one, and then departs. If the price of each particular article is fixed, it is as if a price was established,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Since a standard price for each article was established and the articles were left for sale, we assume that as soon as the person took the article, he committed himself to the purchase and hence, the sale is completed.</i> and the seller cannot consecrate this squash, for it is not in his domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">For it is as if it was already sold.</i> If the price is not fixed and he consecrated it, it is consecrated, because it is still in his domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Since the price has to be established, until it is established, the sale is not complete. And until the sale is complete, the article is considered as belonging to the seller. Hence, the prospective purchaser is considered as the watchman of an entrusted article and the law stated in the final clause of Halachah 22 applies. Indeed, <i>Bava Batra</i> 88a mentions this instance and from it, the law stated in Halachah 22 is derived.</i> for [the prospective purchaser] did not take it with the intent to steal it.
A person cannot consecrate an article that has not yet come into existence.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiryat Sefer</i> explains the rationale for this ruling: Since the object has not come into existence as of yet, it is not in his domain. And, as stated in Halachah 22, a person cannot consecrate an article that is not in his domain.</i><br>What is implied? [If a person says:] "What my net will bring up from the sea is consecrated" or "The fruit my field will produce is designated as a dedication offering," his words are of no consequence.
When a person tells a colleague: "When I repurchase this field which I sold you,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, this applies when the person never owned the field he seeks to consecrate. By mentioning this instance, the Rambam (and his source, <i>Ketubot</i> 58b) emphasize that even though the person originally and ultimately owned the field, since he did not own it at the time he consecrated it, the consecration is not effective.</i> it is consecrated," [although] he repurchases it, it is not consecrated. [The rationale is] that it was not in his possession when he consecrated it. <sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Siftei Cohen, Yoreh De'ah</i> 258:15 emphasizes that his statement is not even considered a vow, because the wording used does not have the implication of a vow. See Halachah 31 which speaks of this issue. Note, however, the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 22:15.</i>
Similarly, when a person consecrates the work to be produced by his wife's hands, she may work and partake [of her earnings]. The remainder is not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the consecration is not effective, because the fruits of the woman's labor did not exist at the time her husband sought to consecrate them.</i> If he tells her: "May your hands be consecrated to their Maker," since they are under lien to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 12:3, all of the proceeds of the work a woman performs belong to her husband.</i> [the profits of] all of the work that she produces are consecrated. To what can this be compared? To one who says: "This tree is consecrated," in which instance all the fruit it produces is consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">For although the fruit did not exist at the time of the original consecration, the tree did. And once the tree is consecrated all the fruit it produces is consecrated. Similarly, the woman's hands exist at the time the consecration was made, and as a result, all the products of her work are consecrated.<br>Rabbenu Nissim does not accept the Rambam's ruling. He explains that although our Sages ordained that the profits from a woman's labor should be given to her husband, those profits are given in exchange for his support of her. If she desires, she has the right to withdraw from the arrangement, decline his support, and keep her earnings. Since she has this right, her hands are not on lien to her husband, and he cannot consecrate them. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 81:1) follows the Rambam's view, while the Rama quotes that of Rabbenu Nissim.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person tells a colleague: "The field that I will sell you<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., at the time he makes this statement it is in his possession.</i> will be consecrated when I buy it back from you," the consecration takes effect when he buys it back.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he does not make a second statement, it becomes consecrated if and when he repurchases it.</i> [The rationale is that] it is in his possession [originally] and he has the possibility of consecrating it.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the fact that he sells it to another person in the interim does not detract from the consecration.</i><br>[If one tells a colleague:] "The field that I entrusted to you as security<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">For a loan.</i> will be consecrated when I redeem it from you," the field becomes consecrated when he redeems it. [The rationale is that] he has the potential to redeem it.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the field was not in his possession at the time he made his statement, since he had the right to redeem it, it is considered as if it were.</i> [The consecration is effective] even if it was given as a security for a fixed time,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">And during that time, he did not have the right to redeem it.</i> because he has the potential to redeem it after that time.
[Although a person] rents out a house to a colleague, if he retracts and consecrates it, the consecration is effective and the rental arrangement is terminated.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Although the house is the tenant's for the duration of the rental period, since ultimately it belongs to the owner, his consecration takes precedence over the rental agreement. For as stated in Chapter 7, Halachah 14, consecration takes precedence over other obligations.<br>Although as implied by the previous halachah, the owner could not consecrate a field given as security while it was in the possession of the lender, he has a greater right to the land in this instance. In the previous case, the field will not return to him unless he pays the loan, while in this instance, the home will return to him at the end of the rental period without payment. Hence he is considered to have greater rights over it and is given the right to consecrate it (Radbaz).</i> If the tenant dwells there, he violates the prohibition against misappropriating sacred property.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">He may, however, avoid the prohibition by paying his rent to the Temple treasury (<i>Arachin</i> 21a).</i>
It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase indicates a law that the Rambam derived through the process of deduction without an explicit prior Rabbinic source.</i> that even though a person cannot consecrate an entity that has not come into being, if he says: "I pledge to consecrate it," he is obligated to consecrate it when it will come into being to [fulfill] his vow. If he does not consecrate it, he transgresses [the prohibitions]: "Do not delay in paying it" and "He shall not desecrate his word" and [fails to fulfill the positive commandment:] "He shall act in accordance with all that he uttered with his mouth" as is true with regard to all other vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:4-5, <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 14:13.</i>
What is implied? [When a person] says: "I pledge to consecrate everything that my net will bring up from the sea," "I pledge to give the fruit produced by this field to the poor," "I pledge to designate as a dedication offering - or give for the sake of captives - all of my earnings of this year," or makes any statement of this like, he is obligated to give and/or perform what he pledged when the article comes into his possession. For these and all similar statements are vows, not acts of consecration.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., were the person to have the intent to consecrate the article with this statement, the consecration would not be effective, because the article does not yet exist. He is not, however, consecrating the article, merely pledging to do so in the future. See also <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 22:15. On his notes to that source, the Ra'avad differs and maintains that for the statement to be considered a pledge, it must be worded in that matter. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and Rama (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 212:7).</i>
Support for this can be drawn from the statements of Jacob our Patriarch [Genesis 28:22]:<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">After his vision of the ladder extending to heaven. He was speaking of "what You will give me," i.e., possessions that he would acquire in the future.</i> "And everything that You will give me, I will tithe." And [later, <i>ibid.</i> 31:13]<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">When Jacob tells his wives of the message the angel gave him to return to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> states: "Where you took a vow."<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the pledge he made is considered as a vow.</i> And<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that the second proof is necessary, because one might say that Jacob's reference to his vow refers to his statement: "And the Lord will be my God."</i> when a person says: "I will not depart from this world until I become a nazirite," he is obligated to observe a nazirite vow<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nazir</i> 1:4 which states that he must observe the nazirite restrictions immediately, because he does not know how long he will live and he is required to fulfill his pledge before he dies.<br>The Ra'avad accepts the support from Jacob's statement, but not that from the nazirite's pledge, bringing two objections:<br>a) at present, it is within his potential to carry out the nazirite vow. Hence, the comparison to an entity that has not yet come into existence is not appropriate.<br>b) Since the person does not know when he will die, it is as if he has committed himself to observe the vow immediately. The Radbaz brings support for the Rambam's position.</i> although he did not actually take such a vow. Since he said that he would take a nazirite vow, he is obligated to observe those restrictions. This law parallels that. It is appropriate to rule in this manner.
A consecration that is made in error is not binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Just like a vow made in error is not binding (<i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 8:3).</i><br>What is implied? If one says: "When a black ox will go out of the building first, it will be consecrated," should a white ox go out [first], it is not consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we assume that his mention of a black ox was deliberate and intended to be a stipulation, not merely a statement of his supposition of what would happen.</i> [If he says:] "When a gold <i>dinar</i> comes into my hand first, it is consecrated," should a silver [<i>dinar</i>] come up, it is not consecrated. [If he says:] "When a barrel of wine comes into my hand first, it is consecrated," should a barrel of oil come up, it is not consecrated. [This applies] whether wine is more expensive than oil<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">In which case, we might say that he would accept the change, because he will be saving money.</i> in that place or oil is more expensive than wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">In which case, we might say that he would accept the change, because he will be bringing a more attractive offering.</i><br>If he attempts to extend the consecration to a second entity, saying: "[The status of] this is the same as [that of] the other," the second is consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling has amazed the commentaries, because if the first entity does not become consecrated, how can the second? Seemingly, its consecration is dependent on that of the first.<br>The Radbaz seeks to explain that the second consecration is dependent not on the status of the initial article, but the intent of the donor who sought to consecrate it. He admits, however, that the interpretation is forced. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this clause is referring to a different concept entirely. If he had an article that was consecrated and extended its holiness to another article unintentionally, that article is consecrated.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.

Chapter 7

Consecrated articles<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Articles which a person consecrated for the sake of improvements to the Temple.</i> may not be redeemed with land, nor with servants, for an equation was created between servants and land,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This applies not only in this context, but also in many other areas of Jewish business law. See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 7:4; <i>Hilchot Geneivah</i> 2:2, <i>et al</i>.</i> nor with promissory notes for their physical substance is not of financial worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A promissory note itself is not worth money. It is valuable because of the debt that it records.</i> [This is derived from the expression:]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There is no such verse in the Tanach. The Rambam is referring to wording used by our Sages in <i>Kiddushin</i> 5a. They are also referring to a verse, but have shortened and edited Leviticus 27:19.</i> "And he shall give the silver." [This includes] silver and other movable property that is worth silver,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This principle also applies in many aspects of Jewish business law. Objects that are worth silver may be used for the same purposes as silver (<i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i> 8:10).</i> even bran.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an object of minimal value.</i>
Whenever a person redeems his consecrated property, he must add an additional fifth. The person who consecrated the property himself, his wife, or his heirs must all add a fifth, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 5; Chapter 5, Halachah 3, and notes. As explained there, we are speaking of a fifth of the new total, a fourth of the original amount.</i> This fifth must also only be movable property. The fifth itself becomes like the consecrated property and the same laws apply to them both.
When a person redeems his consecrated articles, [failure to pay] the additional fifth does not hold back [the redemption]. Once the person paid the principal, the consecrated article is considered as an ordinary article and it is permitted to benefit from it [according to Scriptural Law]. According to Rabbinic Law, it is forbidden to benefit from it until one pays the additional fifth, lest one be negligent and fail to pay it. Nevertheless, on the Sabbath, [our Sages] gave one permission to partake [of a consecrated article that was redeemed] although the fifth was not paid for the sake of the enjoyment of the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages did not desire that his failure to pay the fifth prevent him from partaking of the entity, for this would reduce his Sabbath pleasure.</i> [Another reason for leniency is that] it is being demanded by the Temple treasurers.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since the treasurers demand payment of the fifth the person is not likely to forget. Nevertheless, this rationale itself is not sufficient reason for leniency. Hence, during the week, when the mitzvah of delighting in the Sabbath does not apply, the treasurers' reminder is not sufficient reason to permit use of the entity (see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 54a).</i>
[The following laws apply with regard to animals] consecrated for the sake of [sacrifice on] the altar which were [disqualified by] a blemish:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 11, which speaks of the redemption of such animals.</i> If the person who consecrated it redeems it, he must add an additional fifth<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is reflected by Leviticus 27:13.</i> as is the rule with regard to other consecrated articles.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 2.</i> The person who consecrated it for his own purposes is the one obligated to add a fifth, not the one who derives atonement through the [sacrifice after] it was redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if a person was obligated to bring a sacrifice and a colleague set aside an animal from his own resources for him to offer, that person required to bring the sacrifice is not required to pay an additional fifth if he redeems the animal.</i><br>[One is] obligated to add a fifth [when redeeming the article that was] consecrated originally, but one [need] not add a fifth [when redeeming an article] whose consecration was a derivative,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it was consecrated in the process of redeeming another article, as the Rambam proceeds to explain in the following halachah. See Halachah 11 for details regarding the redemption of an article by transferring its holiness to a second article.</i> as [implied by Leviticus 27:15]: "If the one who consecrated [it] will redeem his home, he must add a fifth." [The verse mentions] "one who consecrated," and not one who extends that holiness.
Accordingly, if one transferred the holiness of a [consecrated] animal - whether one consecrated for the sake of improvements to the Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, it must be redeemed whether blemished or unblemished.

Leviticus 27:10 states that it is forbidden to make such an exchange, but if one does so both the animal originally consecrated and the one exchanged for it remain consecrated (<i>ibid.:33;</i> see <i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 1:1).</i> When he redeems the second animal to which he transferred the holiness or which he exchanged for the sacrificial animal, he is not required to add a fifth.
There is an unresolved doubt [in the following situation]: A person set aside a guilt offering for the sake of his atonement and it became blemished. He added a fifth to its value and transferred its holiness to another animal and received atonement by [sacrificing] another guilt offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Because the animal to which the holiness was transferred was lost or unable to be used for a sacrifice for other reasons.</i> As explained in the appropriate place,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 4:14-15.</i> [the animal to which the holiness was transferred] is left to pasture [until it becomes blemished and then its holiness transferred to a third animal which is sacrificed as a burnt offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For he is no longer obligated to bring a guilt offering, but must offer the worth of the animal as a sacrifice.</i> The question is:] Are we required to add a fifth [when redeeming that animal], because it is a burnt offering, it involves another body<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is not the same animal that was originally consecrated. Our translation represents a slight variation from the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> that was made based on authentic manuscripts and early printings.</i> and is consecrated for a different purpose? Or are we not so required because its [holiness] stems from the initial consecration for which a fifth was already added.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Hence although the person is not obligated to pay the additional fifth, if the Temple treasurer seizes it, he cannot be required to relinquish it.</i>
The concept of exchanging an animal<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is speaking about a practice, <i>temurah</i>, that involves transferring the holiness of an animal consecrated as a sacrifice to another animal. Leviticus 27:10 states that it is forbidden to make such an exchange, but if one does so both the animal originally consecrated and the one exchanged for it remain consecrated (<i>ibid.:33;</i> see <i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 1:1).</i> does not apply with regard to animals consecrated for the sake of improvements to the Temple. For the Torah dealt with the concept of exchanging holiness only with regard to [animals] consecrated for [sacrifice on] the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Temurah</i> 13a relates that the concept of <i>temurah</i>, exchange, applies only with regard to sacrifices and an animal consecrated for the sake of improvements to the Temple is not considered a sacrifice.</i><br>What is implied? If a person had an ordinary animal and an animal consecrated for the sake of improvements to the Temple before him. If he said: "Let this one be substituted for this one" or "Let this one be exchanged for this one," his statements are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For these expressions imply <i>temurah</i>, exchange.</i> If, however, he says: "This one is in place of this one" or "The holiness of this one is transferred to this one,"<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., using statements that indicate that he desires to redeem the animal and not exchange it.</i> his statements are binding. The first animal returns to ordinary status and [its holiness] becomes attached to the second.
The initial and preferred manner is that both [animals] consecrated for the sake of the improvement of the Temple and entities consecrated for the sake of the altar that became blemished should be redeemed only for their worth. If one transgressed and redeemed them for less than their worth, even if one redeemed consecrated property worth 100 <i>dinarim</i> with an article worth a <i>p'rutah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A coin of minimal worth.</i> the article is redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to transactions between men, the laws of <i>ona'ah</i> (unfair gain) apply and a transaction can be nullified if it is sold for more or less than a sixth of its value (<i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 12:4). These principles do not apply, however, with regard to consecrated property.</i> It is considered as ordinary property and one is permitted to benefit from it. According to Rabbinic Law, it is necessary to evaluate its worth<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to carefully evaluate its worth. See Halachah 11.</i> and the person redeeming it is obligated to make up the monetary difference.
What is implied? A person had an animal consecrated [to be offered on] the altar and it became blemished. If it is worth ten [<i>zuz</i>] and there is an ordinary animal worth five and he says: "The holiness of this one is transferred to this," it is redeemed and its status becomes that of an ordinary animal. He must, however, pay the additional five [to the Temple treasury]. In the same way, [if a similar transfer was made] when the first animal was consecrated to the Temple treasury, its status becomes that of an ordinary animal. It may be shorn and put to work<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">While it is consecrated, both of these activities are forbidden according to Rabbinic Law (<i>Hilchot Meilah</i> 1:12).</i> and the second animal assumes its [consecrated status] according to Scriptural Law. Nevertheless, according to Rabbinic Law, it is necessary to evaluate its worth to see whether the one to which its holiness was transferred was of equivalent value. If not, he must make up the monetary difference.
If three people evaluated [the two animals involved] and said they were of equivalent value, the evaluation is not nullified even if 100 come afterwards and say that the animal that was consecrated was more valuable. Since the evaluation [of the animal's] worth is a Rabbinic requirement, our Sages were not strict with regard to it. If, however, two people made the original evaluation and then three people came and say that even the slightest advantage was taken of the Temple treasury,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to transactions between private individuals, by contrast, as long as the difference between the article's value and the price for which it is sold is less than a sixth, the transaction is allowed to stand (<i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 12:3).</i> [the animal] is reevaluated.
We do not redeem consecrated articles with a rough estimation instead, their worth is carefully evaluated, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 8.</i> If one redeemed a consecrated article [after making merely a rough estimation], the Temple treasury is given the upper hand.<br>What is implied? One says: "May the holiness of this cow that is consecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">We are speaking about a cow consecrated for the sake of improvements to the Temple. If it were consecrated for sacrifice on the altar, even after its holiness were transferred to another animal, it would remain consecrated itself (Radbaz).</i> be transferred to this cow" or "May the holiness of this garment that is consecrated be transferred to this garment," the consecrated article is redeemed and the Temple treasury is given the upper hand. If the second article is worth more than the first, the Temple treasurers take it and remain silent. If it is not worth the value of the first, [the redeemer] must pay the difference as we explained<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 8.</i> and he must add a fifth.<br>If, however, he said: May the holiness of this garment that is consecrated be transferred to this garment that is worth ten <i>selaim</i>" or "May the holiness of this cow that is consecrated be transferred to this cow that is worth ten <i>selaim</i>," he is required to add a fifth and must give two and a half <i>selaim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, the fifth is one fifth of the new total including the fifth and the amount for which the article is redeemed. Since he stated the value of the article he was giving as ten <i>selaim</i>, the value of the fifth is calculated accordingly even though he is paying more than would actually have been required.</i> [The rationale is that] he redeemed it at a fixed price. It is not necessary to add a fifth when redeeming the second animal, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 4.</i>
[The following rules apply when a person] redeems an article from the Temple treasury. If he drew the article into his possession<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Performing <i>meshichah</i>, an act that would complete the <i>kinyan</i> (formal act of acquisition) of the article.</i> when it was worth a <i>maneh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">100 <i>zuz</i>.</i> but did not pay the money until it appreciated to 200, he must pay 200. [This is indicated by the expression:]<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes to Halachah 1, the Rambam is not referring to an explicit verse in the Torah, but rather our Sages' restatement of the relevant verses in <i>Kiddushin</i> 28b.</i> "And he will pay the money and it will become his." It becomes his when he pays the money.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">And not when it enters his possession. Hence, he must pay the value at the time he redeems it.</i><br>If he drew it into his possession when it was worth 200, but did not pay the money until it depreciated to a <i>maneh</i>, he must pay 200. For the legal power of the Temple treasury should not be less than that of an ordinary person.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 9:2. As mentioned above, when an ordinary person completes <i>meshichah</i>, the transaction is completed and he must pay its price then. When it lost value, it was already in his possession.</i> He acquired it through drawing it into his possession and became liable for its value then.
If he redeemed it at 200 and paid the money<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">One might ask: Why must he actually pay the money? Seemingly the very fact that he pledged to redeem it from the Temple treasury at 200 should be sufficient to make him liable in accordance with the principle (<i>Kiddushin</i> 28b, <i>et al</i>): "A person's statements to the Temple treasury are equivalent to an ordinary person drawing the article into his possession." The Radbaz explains that in this instance, that principle is not applied, because it is possible to say that the pledge was made in error. He did not expect that the article would depreciate in value. Hence, unless he paid the money, he is not liable for the higher sum.</i> and did not draw into his possession until it depreciated to a <i>maneh</i>, he is considered to have acquired it when he paid the money.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">And the depreciation is considered to have taken place in his possession as above.</i> He should draw his article into his possession and the Temple treasury acquires the 200.<br>If he redeemed it at a <i>maneh</i> and paid the money, but did not draw it into his possession until it appreciated to 200, the redemption is allowed to stand. He is only required to pay the <i>maneh</i> that he paid already. In this instance, we do not say: The legal power of the Temple treasury should not be less than that of an ordinary person.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since the transaction is not completed until the purchaser draws it into his possession, with regard to ordinary transactions, the purchaser would have the right to nullify the transaction. Nevertheless, were he to do so, he is liable to have the admonition <i>mi shepara</i> administered to him by the court (<i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 7:1). As the Rambam continues to explain, it is not appropriate to have this admonition administered to the Temple treasurers.</i> [The rationale is that] even an ordinary person would not be able to retract unless he receives the admonition <i>mi shepara</i>, as will be explained in the appropriate place.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to this admonition, <i>ibid.</i>:2 states: "He is cursed in court and told: 'May He who exacted retribution from the generation of the Flood, the generation of the Dispersion, the inhabitants of Sodom and Amorah, and the Egyptians who drowned in the sea, exact retribution from a person who does not keep his word.'</i> And it is not proper to administer the admonition <i>mi shepara</i> to the Temple treasury.
When a person consecrates all of his possessions and he is liable to [pay the money due his] wife [by virtue of her] <i>ketubah</i> or promissory notes [owed to] creditors, the woman may not collect [the money due her by virtue of her] <i>ketubah</i> from the Temple treasury, nor may a creditor collect the debt due him. The rationale is that consecration absolves prior liens.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., were the person to sell all his possessions to a private person, his wife and his creditors would be able to collect their due from the landed property in his domain. Since the property becomes the possession of the Temple treasury, those obligations temporarily need not be met.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that the liens are in effect even when the property is in the possession of the Temple treasury. Our Sages' statement (<i>Ketubot</i> 59b) that consecration absolves prior liens applies only with regard to the consecration of articles that themselves will be used for the Temple or its sacrifices, not articles to be sold and the proceeds used.<br>One of the practical differences between the Rambam's position and that of the Ra'avad is whether a person will be liable for <i>me'ilah</i>, misappropriating consecrating property, for benefiting from this property. In <i>Hilchot Malveh ViLoveh</i> 18:7, the Rambam states similar ideas as in this halachah. In his gloss to that halachah, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> takes issue with the Rambam. Although, here, in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro defends the Rambam's position in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 117:7), it appears that he accepts the other view. The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama explicitly state that the Ra'avad's position should be followed.</i> [Nevertheless,] when the Temple treasury sells his property and the field loses its consecrated status, the creditor and his wife may collect it from the redeemer, for the lien remains on this landed property.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the property is redeemed with the awareness that it is under lien and that lien will ultimately be collected. Its price is calculated accordingly, as stated in Halachah 16.</i>
To what can this be compared? To two purchasers. [One bought the property from a woman's husband and the other from the first purchaser. The woman] wrote to the first [purchaser] "I have no claim against you."<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">She had the right to collect the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i> from this property, but she agreed not to press her claim against this individual.</i> [After] he sells it to the second person, she may expropriate the money due her from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For the field remains on lien to her. The promise she gave the first purchaser is not binding with regard to the second.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam on this point as well, maintaining that the woman does not have the right to expropriate the property from the second purchaser. For by purchasing the field, he purchased every right that the first purchaser had. Moreover, if forced to pay the woman, he could seek reimbursement from the first purchaser or nullify the sale. In his gloss to <i>Hilchot Malveh ViLoveh</i> 19:8, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> supports the Ra'avad's view. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, defends the Rambam's position.</i>
How is this land redeemed?<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is on lien, obviously, no one will desire to pay its actual worth.</i> We administer an oath to the woman or the creditor first as is the process whenever one seeks to expropriate property that is on lien.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 16:10,20 and <i>Hilchot Malveh ViLoveh</i> 22:10, we do not expropriate the field for the wife or the creditor until he or she takes an oath while holding a sacred object that the debt was not collected, waived, or sold to another person.</i> Afterwards, we publicly announce its sale for 60 days in the morning and in the evening, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 3, Halachah 20; Chapter 4, Halachah 27.</i> We say:<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The standard printed text follows a slightly different version.</i> How much a person will desire to give for this field in order to pay the woman [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> or the creditor his debt? A purchaser redeems it and acquires it even for a <i>dinar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Although the initial preference is that consecrated property be redeemed for its full value (Halachah 8), that is not feasible in the present instance. Instead, the person is allowed to pay any sum he desires, for his profit may be small after paying the debt. Indeed, as the Rambam continues, he may even suffer a loss.</i> so that it is not said that consecrated property was released without being redeemed. Then the redeemer comes and gives the woman [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> or the creditor his debt. [This applies] even if the debt was 100 [<i>zuz</i>] and the field worth only 90, [for] the person who redeems it does so for this sake.<br>If, however, the debt was twice the value of the field, e.g., the field was worth 100 and it was on lien to a debt or a woman's <i>ketubah</i> for 200, we do not redeem it with the intent of paying the debt or [the money due the woman by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>. Instead, it is redeemed unconditionally,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">And the lien on the field is ignored.</i> for if such a stipulation was required to be made, it would not be redeemed at all.
When a person consecrates all of his property, divorces his wife, and [leaves her to] collect [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> from the one who redeems [his landed property] from the Temple treasury, she cannot collect [the debt] until he takes a vow,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This vow must be taken conditional to the consent of people at large. In this way, it can never be nullified. Note a parallel in <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 6:9.</i> forbidding her to benefit from him. [This is a safeguard instituted,] lest an attempt be made to deceive the Temple treasury.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he would remarry her and retake possession of a portion of his property in this way. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 17:9-10. <i>Arachin</i> 23a emphasizes that we are speaking about a healthy man. If a person on his death bed divorces his wife so that she will not have to undergo <i>yibbum</i>, he is not required to take such an oath, for we do not suspect that a person on his death bed will try to deceive the Temple treasury. See Halachah 19.</i> We do not say that were he to desire [to nullify the consecration of his property], he should say: "I consecrated it in error," and ask a sage [to nullify] his consecration [in which instance, his property] would return to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For a consecration made in error can be nullified, as stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 34.</i>
Similarly, after<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he made such statements before consecrating his property, his word is accepted (Radbaz).<br>See the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 255:5) who elaborates on the concept that even if he makes this statement directly after consecrating his property, it is not accepted. As support, he cites <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:1 where the Rambam writes that after a person consecrates an animal, even if he seeks to retract his consecration immediately, he cannot. The Radbaz (see his gloss to the following halachah) supports this view. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, maintains that a healthy person can also retract his statement directly after making it.</i> consecrating his property, a person's word is not accepted if he says: "I owe a <i>maneh</i> to so-and-so" or "This utensil belongs to so-and-so."<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the person claims to be holding it as an entrusted article.</i> [In this instance, we fear that] he is attempting to deceive the Temple treasury.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">And prevent a certain portion of his property from having to be redeemed.</i> Even if the creditor has a promissory note, he cannot use it to expropriate [the property from the Temple treasury].<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in Halachah 14, consecration lifts liens on property.</i> Instead, he must collect his due like the other creditors due, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 16.</i>
When does the above apply? With regard to a healthy person. If, by contrast a mortally ill person consecrates all of his property and at the time he consecrates it says: "I owe a <i>maneh</i> to so-and-so," his word is accepted. [The rationale is that] a person will not try to deceive the Temple treasury at the time of his death and sin for the sake of others, for he is going to die.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">At such a time, when he will not derive any worldly benefit from sinning and is conscious of the retribution he will receive in the world to come, he will certainly not seek to deceive the Temple treasury.</i> Therefore if he says: "Give [the creditor his debt]," [the creditor] may collect it without having to take an oath.<br>If he did not say: "Give [the creditor...]," we do not give him this money unless he has a promissory note whose authenticity has been verified. [In that instance,] he may collect [his debt] from the Temple treasury, because of the statements [the debtor made] on his deathbed.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his acknowledgement of the debt. If, however, the creditor does not have a promissory note whose authenticity has been verified, he cannot collect the debt, even though the debtor acknowledged it on his deathbed. The rationale is that (as stated in <i>Hilchot To'ain ViNitan</i> 6:7), a person is wont to state that he owes money even if he in fact does not so that his sons do not think of themselves as rich. His estate is not bound by these statements unless, as stated above, he explicitly instructed that the debt be paid or the creditor has a promissory note that has been verified. Even though in this instance, the money will be going to the Temple treasury and not to his sons, a similar rationale can still be applied. We say that he is admitting the debt so that people will not think of him as a person who hoarded money throughout his life (<i>Sefer Meirat Einayim</i> 255:12).</i> If he said to give [the money to the creditor] after he consecrated [his property],<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision, stating that the word of a person on his deathbed is accepted even he makes his statements after consecrating the article. For at the time he consecrates an article, the statements of a healthy person are also accepted.<br>In view of this objection, the Radbaz explains that there are three different time frameworks:<br>a) before the consecration is made - in which instance the statements of both a healthy man and one on his deathbed are accepted;<br>b) immediately after (<i>toch k'dei dibbur</i>) the consecration is made - in which instance the statements of a healthy man are not accepted and those of one on his deathbed are;<br>c) some time after the consecration is made - in which instance neither the statements of a healthy man nor those of one on his deathbed are accepted.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> follows the same basic thrust in interpreting the Rambam, but differs regarding one point, maintaining that a healthy person can also retract his statement directly after making it. The difference between a healthy person and one on his deathbed is that when a person is on his deathbed, his word is accepted as long as he is still speaking of the deposition of his property even though it is not directly after he consecrated it.</i> we do not heed his statements. Instead, this person is considered like other creditors.

The Ra'avad adds that if we are speaking about an entrusted article which the dying man acknowledged having received for safekeeping, it is returned to its owner without being redeemed.

We do not take heed of a rumor that says that a certain person declared all of his property ownerless, consecrated it, or made it a dedication offering unless there is clear proof<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Through the testimony of witnesses or a contract that has been verified.</i> [of its validity].

Chapter 8

On the fifthteenth of Adar, the court<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, Israel's highest court.</i> diverts their attention [from other concerns] and examines and investigates matters involving the needs of the community and consecrated property. They check the matter and research the [cases involved], so that consecrated property and dedication offerings will be redeemed and <i>arachim</i> and pledges of worth are collected from all those who are liable for them so that the entire nation will be prepared to give the gift of <i>shekalim</i> to maintain the House of our God.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There is a certain lack of clarity in the Rambam's words. For the donation of the half-<i>shekel</i> that was announced and collected in the month of Adar was for the sake of the communal offerings (<i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 4:10).</i>
Consecrated articles are redeemed only on the basis of [evaluation by] three experts. Similarly, when movable property is being taken as security when one is liable for <i>arachim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 14.</i> it should be evaluated by three people.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A second opinion is always valuable lest one person err and a third is necessary, lest the two differ. None of the three is required to be a priest (Radbaz).</i> And when an animal or the like is designated as an <i>airech</i>, it should be evaluated by three people.<br>When, however, land is designated as an <i>airech</i> or if <i>arachin</i> for humans must be collected from landed property, it is evaluated only by ten people<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megilah</i> 23b derives this from the fact that Leviticus, ch. 27, mentions the word "priest" ten times when speaking of all of these types of evaluations.</i> and one of them must be a priest.

Based on Leviticus 25:46, an equation is established between landed property and servants. Hence, the same evaluation process is used (<i>Megilah, loc. cit.</i>).</i>
When consecrated property - whether landed property or movable property - is redeemed from the Temple treasury, an announcement is made before all those who might seek to redeem it.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast to Chapter 3, Halachot 19-20.</i> [The following rule applies if] one says: "I will [redeem] them for ten <i>selaim</i>," another says: "...for twenty," a third "...for thirty," a fourth "...for forty," and a fifth "...for fifty," and then the one who pledged fifty alone retracts. We expropriate ten [<i>selaim</i>] from the property [of the latter]<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although he merely pledged the fifty, we follow the principle (<i>Kiddushin</i> 28b, <i>et al</i>): "A pledge to the Temple treasury is like transferring the article to an ordinary person." Nevertheless, he is only required to pay ten, since the Temple treasury can collect the forty from the other person.</i> and give the consecrated article to the one [who pledged to] give forty. Thus the Temple treasury receives fifty: Ten from one and forty from the other.<br>If the one who pledged forty also retracts, we expropriate ten [<i>selaim</i>] from his property and give the consecrated article to the one who pledged thirty. [If he and the others also retract,] we follow the same process until [the option is given to] the first. If the first who pledged ten also retracts, we announce the redemption of the consecrated article a second time and sell it. If it is redeemed for less than ten, we collect the difference from the person who [originally] pledged ten.
When does the above apply? When they retracted one after the other. If, however, they all retracted at the same time, we divide the sum among them.<br>What is implied? The first one says: "I will [redeem] it for ten <i>selaim</i>," the second: "...for twenty," and a third "...for 24," and the second and third retract at the same time, we enable the first to redeem it for ten and we expropriate seven from the property of both the second and the third.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since they retracted at the same time, the loss suffered by the Temple treasury is divided equally between them. The Ra'avad and Rashi (<i>Arachin</i> 27b) offer a different interpretation of how the sum is divided between the two. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, justify the Rambam's view.</i> Thus the Temple treasury collects 24. Similarly, if all three of them retract and the consecrated article is [ultimately] sold for three, we expropriate seven <i>selaim</i> from the property of all of them. These principles are followed in all instances.
The [original] owners [of the consecrated article] are [given the opportunity to redeem the consecrated article] before all others, because they [are required to] add a fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">And thus if the original owner and another person pledge the same amount, the Temple treasury will receive more if the original owner is allowed to redeem it.</i> They are not, however, required to add a fifth to the sum that they bid above other [potential] redeemers, only to what they initially pledged.<br>What is implied? The owners said: "We will [redeem] it for 20 [<i>selaim</i>]," and another person says: "I will redeem it for 20," the owners are given the option, because they add a fifth and pay 25." If another person comes and says: "I will redeem it for 21," and the [original] owners remain silent and do not add anything, we sell it to them for 25.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">They are given the opportunity to redeem it, because the Temple treasury will benefit more from their redemption than that of the other person.</i><br>If the owners increased [the bid of] 21, adding even a <i>p'rutah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">A copper coin of minimal value.<br>The Ra'avad and Rashi (<i>Arachin</i> 27b) maintain that even if the original owners do not raise the bid, they are liable for 26 <i>selaim</i> for they are liable for the <i>sela</i> added by the other bidder. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justify the Rambam's approach.</i> they are required to pay 26 [<i>selaim</i>] and a <i>p'rutah</i>: the 21 and a <i>p'rutah</i> which they pledged on their own initiative and the five which are the fifth from their original bid.<br>Similarly, if the second person said: "I will redeem it for 22," a third said, "...for 23," a fourth said, "...for 24," a fifth said, "...for 25," and [the original owner] added even a <i>p'rutah</i> to the sum of 25, they are compelled to give 30 and a <i>p'rutah</i>: the 25 and a <i>p'rutah</i> which they pledged on their own initiative and the five which are the fifth that they are obligated. For the owner is not required to add a fifth to the additions of the others. Instead, they must add the fifth from their original pledge to the final sum that they pledged.
When does the above apply? When the consecrated property was not evaluated by three experts. If, however, three experts evaluated the consecrated property and said that it was worth what the last [bidder] pledged and the original owners then increased his bid by even a <i>p'rutah</i>, the additional fifth they must give [is calculated based on] the latter bid.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is the article's worth, it is appropriate that the fifth be calculated accordingly.</i> They must, therefore, give 31 [<i>selaim</i>], a <i>dinar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a fourth of 25 <i>selaim</i> is six <i>selaim</i> and a <i>dinar</i>. This is the additional fifth that the original owner is required to pay.</i> and a <i>p'rutah</i>.
[The following rules apply when] the consecrated property was not evaluated, the owner pledged 20, someone else came and pledged 25, and the owner remained silent and did not add anything. The owner is still given priority, for he is also required to pay 25 because of the additional fifth. If another person came and pledged 26,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">More precisely, anything above 25, so that his increase benefits the Temple treasury.</i> he is given priority. If the owner desires to add even a <i>p'rutah</i> he must give 31 [<i>selaim</i>] and a <i>p'rutah</i> as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 5.</i> This pattern is followed in all instances.
In the present era, we do not consecrate property, nor make evaluation offerings or dedication offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to dedication offerings for the sake of the Temple. With regard to dedication offerings to the priests, see Halachah 11.</i> for there is no Temple to make improvements upon. [The following laws apply] if one did consecrate property or make an evaluation offering or a dedication offering:<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since the property was consecrated, it is forbidden to benefit from it. Hence, it must be disposed of in a manner in which no one will benefit. The Ra'avad emphasizes that the advice given by the Rambam applies in an instance when one does not desire to redeem the consecrated property. If one desires to redeem it, it is preferable to do so, following the guidelines set down in Halachah 10. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam would not differ with this concept. See also the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 258:1) who suggests that if a person consecrates an article in the present age, he should ask a sage to repeal his vow.</i> If it was an animal, he should lock it in [a closed room] until it dies naturally. If it was produce, a garment, or a utensil, it should be set aside until it rots. If it was coins or metal utensils, they should be taken to the Dead Sea or the Mediterranean Sea<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a place where the money will be lost to human hands forever.</i> to be destroyed.
If a person consecrated a servant who accepted the mitzvot<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a gentile servant who is circumcised and immersed in the <i>mikveh</i> and then required to observe all the mitzvot incumbent upon women. See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:11.</i> [incumbent on servants] or designates him as a dedication offering, he should redeem him and bring the money to the Dead Sea as is the law with regard to other pledges of the worth of an article or <i>arachim</i> in the present age.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In this way, the holiness associated with the servant will be transferred to the article and the article left in a place where no one will benefit from it.</i> If the servant was a gentile,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 14:9, after being purchased by a Jew, a gentile servant is given a year in which to decide whether he wishes to observe the mitzvot. The Rambam is speaking about the laws that apply in the midst of that year.</i> he may not be cast into a pit, nor may he be raised up from one.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam makes similar statements with regard to idol-worshiping gentiles in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 10:1; <i>Hilchot Rotzeach</i> 4:11. The Radbaz interprets the Rambam's intent in citing these concepts here as implying that the owner should not redeem the servant. Since he remains consecrated, it is forbidden to benefit from his labor.</i>
It is permissible to redeem consecrated property for a <i>p'rutah</i> in the present age even as an initial and preferable option.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In the present era, since nothing can be done with the money, our Sages allowed the consecrated property to be redeemed in this manner. Note the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 258:1) who rules that consecrated property cannot be redeemed in the present age. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 258:3, however, cites the Rambam's view.</i> Our Sages, however, ruled that it be redeemed for four <i>zuzim</i> or close to that sum to publicize the matter. In the era of the Temple, as an initial preference, it should be redeemed for its worth, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 7, Halachah 8.</i>
In the present age, if a person made a dedication offering of movable property without specifying his intent, it should be given to the priests<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6, Halachah 1.</i> in that locale. If, however, he designated a field in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as a dedication offering without specifying his intent or designated it as a dedication offering to the priests, it is not a dedication offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad cites a view that maintains that even though the field is not given to the priests, it becomes consecrated and can no longer be used by the person for his individual concerns.</i> For [the laws of] a dedication offering of a field apply in the era that the Jubilee year is observed.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shemitah ViYovel</i> 10:9.</i><br>If one designated landed property as a dedication offering for the priests in the Diaspora even in the present era, it is considered like movable property in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 95) and commentaries which debate whether this principle applies in all matters or only in this limited context.</i> and should be given to the priests.
It is a mitzvah to consecrate property and designate dedication and evaluation offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As listed at the beginning of this set of halachot.</i> and it is appropriate for a person to observe these practices to subjugate his natural inclination<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See The Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, ch. 39, which states that the purpose for these mitzvot is to cultivate the trait of generosity. Also by consecrating his property, one uses his wealth for a holy purpose rather than his own indulgence.</i> so that he will not be parsimonious and to fulfill the charge of the prophets [Proverbs 3:9]: "Honor God with your wealth." Nevertheless, if a person never consecrated property nor designated a dedication or evaluation offering, it is of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Compare to the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>.</i> For the Torah has given testimony, saying [Deuteronomy 23:23]: "If you will refrain from [uttering] a vow, you will not have sinned."
A person should never consecrate all of his property or designate it as a dedication offering. A person who does so violates the Torah's guidance, for [Leviticus 27:28] speaks [of a person designating a dedication offering] "<i>from</i> all that is his." [Implied is that he should not give] "all that is his," as our Sages explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 28a.</i> This is not piety, but foolishness, for he will lose all his money and become dependent on others.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is very critical of those who can support themselves on their own, but instead, make wrong choices in the name of piety and thus, require others to support them. See for example, <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim</i> 10:18 which states:<br>Even a dignified sage who becomes poor should work in a profession, even a degrading profession, rather than seek public assistance. It is better to skin the hides of dead animals rather than tell people: "I am a sage, support me."<br></i> We should not show mercy to such a person. In a similar vein, our Sages said:<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 20a.</i> "A man of foolish piety is among those who destroy the world." Instead, a person who distributes his money for mitzvot should not distribute more than a fifth,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketubot</i> 50a derives this concept from Jacob's vow to tithe (Genesis 28:22 . There the verb which conveys the promise to tithe is repeated, allowing for the concept of giving two tithes. See also <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim</i> 7:5.<br><i>Yayin Malchut</i> notes that in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1), the Rambam writes that as an act of piety, a person may give more than a fifth. Nevertheless, there is not necessarily a contradiction between the two. In his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam is speaking about giving to a needy who asks for alms. In response to that acute need, one may give more that a fifth. Here the Rambam is speaking about giving to charity when there is no acute need. Hence the limit should be adhered to.<br>In <i>Iggeret HaTeshuvah</i>, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi states that one may give more than a fifth of his resources to charity to atone for his sins, for just as one is not concerned with the amount one gives when it comes to healing a physical wound or blemish, so too, one should not be worried about cost when healing a spiritual blemish.</i> and he should conduct himself as our Prophets advised [cf. Psalms 112:5]: "He arranges his affairs with judgment," both with regard to matters involving Torah and worldly concerns.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 5:10.</i> Even with regard to the sacrifices for which a person is liable, the Torah showed compassion for [a person's] resources and dictated that the type of sacrifice be offered according to a person's financial capacity.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there are different obligations for certain sacrifices, e.g., the adjustable guilt offering (Leviticus 5:6-11), depending on one's means.</i> How much more so should this approach be followed with regard to matters which a person is obligated only because of his vows. He should take such vows only in a manner appropriate for him, as [implied by Deuteronomy 16:17]: "Each man according to his generosity, according to the blessings of God, your Lord, which He has granted you."<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This verse specifically applies to the festive sacrifices a person brings for the pilgrimage festivals (see <i>Hilchot Chagigah</i> 1:2), but in an expanded sense, it applies to all offerings to the Temple.</i>
