Mishneh Torah, Vows



Chapter 1

There are two categories of vows: The first is to forbid oneself [from benefiting] from entities permitted to him;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For the intent of a vow is not to forbid what the Torah has prohibited, and certainly not to permit what the Torah has prohibited (Radbaz).</i> e.g., he said: "The produce from this-and-this country is forbidden to me for 30 days" or "...forever." "This type of produce is forbidden to me" or "This produce is forbidden." Regardless of the language in which the prohibition is stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it need not be stated in <i>Lashon HaKodesh</i> (Biblical Hebrew).</i> they become forbidden to him, even though there is no oath at all, nor did it mention God's name or a term used to describe Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:2, an oath must mention God's name or one of the terms used to describe Him.</i> Concerning this, the Torah [Numbers 30:3] states: "To cause a prohibition to take effect upon his soul," i.e., to cause permitted entities to become forbidden to him. Similarly, such a vow takes effect if he says: "They are forbidden to me." I call this category: "vows involving prohibitions."
The second category is to obligate himself for a sacrifice that he is not required to bring. For example, he said: "I obligate myself [to bring] a burnt offering," "I obligate myself to bring a peace offering," "...a meal offering," or "This animal is a burnt offering," or "...a peace offering."<br>When he says: "I obligate myself [to bring]...", this is called a vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is personally responsible to bring a sacrifice; there is no set animal designated for that purpose.</i> When he says: "This is...", it is called a donation.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the animal is designated to be offered as a sacrifice; there is no obligation on the person.</i> Donations and vows are of the same type [of pledges], but [the one making the pledge] is responsible for a vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the animal which he originally intended to be sacrificed is lost, he must provide another one, because he accepted personal responsibility. See Halachot 25 and 26 with regard to the distinction between the two terms.</i> With regard to a donations, by contrast, he is not responsible.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For it was only the one animal that was designated as a sacrifice.</i> Concerning these the Torah states [Deuteronomy 12:17]: "Your vows which you pledge and your donations...." This category, I refer to as "vows of sanctification."
The laws concerning the first category and its relevant matters are [the subject] we will discuss in these halachot. The laws concerning vows of sanctification and their particulars will be discussed in their appropriate place in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapters 6 and 9 of those halachot which explain the difference between these types of sacrifices. There are also occasional references to such vows in these halachot. See, for example, Halachah 17 of this chapter.</i>
It is a positive commandment of Scriptural origin for a person to carry out his oath or vow<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 94) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 575) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> whether it be a vow involving prohibitions or a vow of sanctification, as [Deuteronomy 23:24] states: "Heed the utterances of your mouth and do as you vowed." And [Numbers 30:3] states: "He shall act in accordance with all that he uttered with his mouth."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Although there are two different verses which point to the same commandment, they are counted only as one mitzvah. For the verse from Deuteronomy could be interpreted as a reinforcement for the negative commandment mentioned in the following verse and the verse from Numbers can be interpreted as referring only to vows involving prohibitions (Radbaz). In his <i>Hasagot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Ramban considers these as two separate mitzvot.</i>
When a person forbids himself from partaking of a particular type of food, e.g., he said: "Figs are forbidden to me," "Figs from such-and-such a country are forbidden to me," "These figs are forbidden to me," or the like, if he partakes of any amount of them, he is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">As is the punishment prescribed for the violation of any negative commandment. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 157) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 407) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Numbers, <i>Ibid.</i>] states: "He shall not desecrate his word."<br>There is no minimum measure [for the desecration of] a vow, for by taking a vow [not to partake of] a substance, it is as if one explicitly stated that he would not partake of even the slightest amount.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As evident from the continuation of the Rambam's statements, were the person to have mentioned "eating" in his vow, we would have interpreted the prohibition as involving an olive-sized portion, the minimum measure for eating that applies with regard to other prohibitions. Since he did not, the implication is that even the slightest amount is forbidden. Compare to <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 4:1.</i> If one said: "It is forbidden for me to eat the produce of this-and-this country" or "...to eat these fruit," he does not receive lashes unless he partakes of an olive-sized portion.
If a person forbade himself from eating figs and grapes - whether in two vows or in one - the two can be combined to make up the measure of an olive-sized portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This does not apply with regard to oaths (<i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 4:8). Even with regard to vows, it applies only when one uses the expression "eating." The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that the law applies only when the two are included in the same oath. Their difference of opinion revolves around the understanding of <i>Sh'vuot</i> 22a.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person says: "This produce is considered like a sacrifice," or he tells a colleague: "Everything that I partake of with you is a sacrifice,"<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the person wants to forbid himself from eating together with his colleague.</i> "...like a sacrifice," "or considered like a sacrifice for me," they are forbidden to him. For it is possible that a person will make a vow for a sacrifice and make an animal that is ordinary a sacrifice and thus be forbidden for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Just as a person cannot partake of a sacrifice until it is offered, so, too, he cannot partake of an entity forbidden by a vow. Just as the consecration of a sacrifice comes about because of a person's vow and his vow is what causes the sacrifice to become forbidden, so too, a vow causes an entity to be forbidden.<br>See <i>Hilchot Meilah</i> 4:9-10 which explains that with regard to the person forbidden by the vow, the article becomes like consecrated property. Hence, he is obligated to bring a sacrifice in atonement if he benefits from the article.</i>
If, however, a person says: "This produce is considered for me...", "This type of produce is considered for me...", "What I will eat with so-and-so will be considered as pig meat," "...as a false deity," "...as <i>nevelot</i> and <i>trefot</i>," or the like, they are permitted and no vow takes effect. [The rationale is that] it is impossible for a person to make something that is not pig meat as pig meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For these substances are inherently forbidden; they do not become prohibited because of man's statements. An animal consecrated as a sacrifice, by contrast, is inherently permitted. It is only man's statements that cause it to become forbidden.</i>
This is the general principle [that applies] whenever anyone attempts to have permitted entities considered as forbidden entities: If he could have endowed that forbidden entity with its status by taking a vow,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As a person can cause a sacrifice to become forbidden.<br>The Rambam is explaining a fundamental principle with regard to vows. A vow becomes effective when a person establishes an equation between an entity (e.g., produce) and another entity (e.g., a sacrifice), provided it is possible for him to cause the latter entity to become forbidden on the basis of his vow alone.</i> [the permitted entities] are forbidden. If he cannot endow it with its status by taking a vow,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., objects which are inherently forbidden.</i> [the permitted entities] remain permitted.
Sin-offerings and guilt-offerings cannot be brought as vows or as donations, as will be explained in the appropriate place.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 14:8, <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:1. These sacrifices are required when a person transgresses a prohibition. If he does not transgress, he may not bring such a sacrifice and if he does transgress, he is compelled to do so. Offering it is not dependent on his vow.</i> Nevertheless, it is possible for a person making a vow to offer them as a result of his vow. For a person who takes a nazirite vow must bring a sin offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Nazirut</i> 6:11; 8:1.</i> and if he becomes impure,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Due to contact with a human corpse (<i>ibid.</i> 7:2).</i> he must bring a guilt offering, as will be stated.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i> 6:11; see also <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 9:1.</i> Accordingly, when one says: "This produce is considered for me like a sin-offering" or "...like a guilt-offering," or he says: "It is a sin-offering" or "It is a guilt-offering," it is forbidden. Needless to say, if he says: "It is a burnt-offering," "...a peace-offering," "...a meal-offering," or "...a thanksgiving-offering," it is forbidden, for all of these offerings can be brought as vows or as donations.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">And thus bringing them is obviously dependent on his making a vow.</i>
If, however, one says: "This produce is considered for me like the <i>challah</i> [brought] to Aaron" or "...like the <i>terumah</i> for him,"<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Challah</i> refers to a portion that must be separated from dough and given to a priest. <i>Terumah</i> refers to a portion of grain that must be separated and given to a priest. Since they may not be eaten by a non-priest, one might think that they could be the subject of a vow. Aaron is mentioned, because he is the progenitor of the priestly family.</i> it is permitted. For there is no way that these can be brought as vows or as donations.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">A person is required to separate these portions from his dough or grain. Although the amount he gives and the designation of the priest to whom he gives them is dependent on his will, he is obligated to make the gift. The Ra'avad offers a different rationale for this law.</i>
If one says: "This produce is considered for me like <i>notar,</i>"<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Sacrificial meat that was left after its prescribed time and hence, forbidden to be eaten.</i>"...like <i>piggul</i>,"<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Sacrifices that were offered with the intent that they be eaten at a time when it was forbidden to do so and hence, become forbidden to be eaten.</i> or "...like sacrificial meat that has become impure,"<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">And is thus forbidden to be eaten.</i> it is forbidden. For the person has, nonetheless, made the substance like sacrificial meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">It is beyond his capacity to make the object concerning which he is taking a vow bound by any of the prohibitions mentioned. Nevertheless, all of these prohibitions involve sacrificial meat and sacrificial meat is forbidden to be eaten before it was offered in a proper way, because of his oath as above. Hence, the vow can take effect.</i>
If one says: "[This produce] is considered for me like the tithe-sacrifice of an animal,"<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As Leviticus 27:32 states, a person must bring every tenth animal born to his herd as a tithe offering. See also Chapter 2, Halachah 9.</i> it is forbidden, for the sanctity [of the tithe-sacrifices] is conveyed upon them by mortals.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Although we are required to separate these offerings, the tithing process through which the holiness is conveyed upon the animal is a result of man's actions.<br>It is possible to differentiate between such offerings and <i>terumah</i>, for even before the <i>terumah</i> was separated, the grain was not permitted to be eaten, because it was <i>tevel</i>. The animals, by contrast, could have been slaughtered, before the tithe was separated (see Radbaz, quoting Rabbenu Asher).</i> If he says: "[This produce] is considered for me like a firstborn,"<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Which is sanctified from birth and offered as a sacrifice.</i> it is permitted, for the sanctity [of the firstborn] is not conveyed by mortals.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, it is sanctified from birth.</i> It cannot be designated [for another sacred purpose] with a vow, as [Leviticus 27:26] states: "A man should not consecrate it."<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes a responsum from the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham who addresses the following question that was posed to him: The prooftext from Leviticus has been interpreted by the <i>Sifri</i> as teaching that a firstborn may not be consecrated as another sacrifice (see <i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 4:11 where the Rambam quotes this concept). Moreover, although the firstborn is intrinsically holy, it is a mitzvah to consecrate it for that sacrifice (quoted by the Rambam in <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 1:5), and thus seemingly, the holiness is conveyed upon it by a mortal's actions.<br>Rav Avraham replies that since the holiness of the firstborn is inherent and it cannot be changed to that of another sacrifice, that is a proof that a vow cannot affect it. With regard to using a first born as the basis for a vow, see also Halachah 15 and notes.</i>
If one says: "[This produce] is considered for me like a devotion offering for Above,"<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Arachin V'Charamim</i> 6:1 for a description of the nature of this pledge.</i> it is forbidden, for the devotion offering for Above are [set aside] for improvements within the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">And are forbidden to be used for mundane purposes. Thus they represent an entity that was forbidden by man's pledge.</i><br>[A vow takes effect and produce] becomes forbidden although the person did not mention a sacrifice [if he makes any of the following statements]: "[This produce] is considered for me like the donations for the chamber,"<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term <i>terumat halishkah</i> refers to the money collected from the half-<i>shekel</i> donations collected from the Jewish people and used for the communal sacrifices offered in the Temple. See <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i>, ch. 2.</i> "...like the daily sacrifices," "...like the storage rooms,"<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the chambers in the Temple. This and several of the following interpretations are based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 1:3).</i> "...like the wood,"<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">For the altar.</i> "...like the fire-offerings,"<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the portions of the sacrifices offered on the Temple altar.</i> "...like the altar," or "...like any of the utensils of the altar," e.g., he said: "[This produce] is considered for me like the altar rakes,"<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Used to rake the ashes on the altar.</i> "...like the ewers [for the blood of the sacrifices],"<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Used to collect the blood from the sacrifices and then pour it on the altar.</i> "...like the altar forks,"<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Used to move portions of the sacrifices around on the altar's fire, so that they would be consumed by it.</i> or the like. [This law also applies] if he says: "This produce] is considered for me like the Temple,"<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., like the sacrifices offered in the Temple.</i> "...like Jerusalem."<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Like the sacrifices eaten in Jerusalem.</i> [The rationale is that] all of these statements are similar to saying: "[This produce] is considered for me like a sacrifice."
[When there was] sacrificial meat - even meat from a peace offering whose blood had been poured [on the altar] which is permitted to non-priests - before a person and he said: "[This produce] is considered for me like this meat," it is forbidden. [The rationale is that] he attached [his vow] to the fundamental element of the meat, and that was forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since fundamentally, before its blood was poured on the altar, the meat was forbidden, that is the factor that we consider. We do not take into consideration the fact that afterwards it became permitted. This ruling is the subject of an unresolved question in <i>Nedarim</i> 11b. Hence, we rule stringently (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>[Different rules apply if] the meat was from a firstborn sacrifice. If its blood had not been poured [on the altar], [the produce] is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For then it is forbidden to everyone. Hence one might say that just as his designation of the firstborn causes the meat to be forbidden, making a vow using a firstborn sacrifice as a basis is effective.<br>This ruling has created difficulty among the commentaries, because in Halachah 13 the Rambam ruled that a firstborn animal cannot be used as the basis of a vow. Similarly, as the Ra'avad points out, the Rambam's ruling does not appear to be consistent with either of the positions mentioned in <i>Nedarim</i> 12b, the source for this halachah. This leads the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to conclude that there was a printing error in the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and the proper version is "[the produce] is permitted." He states that he found an ancient text that reads this way. Similarly, the Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> read in that manner, omitting the last phrase entirely.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, notes that the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham defends the ruling in the existing text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, explaining that there is a difference between a firstborn sacrifice and the meat of a firstborn sacrifice.</i> If it had been poured, it is permitted.
There are places where people are inarticulate and mispronounce words, calling subjects by different names. [In those places,] we follow the meaning of the local term.<br>What is meant by the statement that all the terms used for the word <i>korban</i>, "sacrifice," are equivalent to the term <i>korban</i>? When one says: "[This produce] is considered for me like a <i>konam</i>," "...a <i>konach</i>," or "...a <i>konaz,</i>" they are all terms referring to a <i>korban</i>. <i>Cherek, cheref,</i> and <i>cherech</i> are all terms referring to a <i>cherem</i> (dedication offering).<br>Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. We follow the language used by people at large in that place and at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For this is representative of the person's intent. Taking this concept further, the Rama <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 207:1) quotes opinions that maintain that this surely applies to vows made in gentile languages. And conversely, he also mentions views that maintain that if someone makes a vow using the wording of our Sages without understanding what he is saying, it does not take effect.</i>
Just as a person can make a vow forbidding entities to himself with such terms, so, too, if he consecrates an entity with such terms, the entity is consecrated. Nicknames for such terms,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 10b gives examples: <i>miknamna, miknachna,</i> and <i>miknasna</i>.</i> however, are not binding<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">For they are very distant from the original wording [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 207:1)]. <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> states that apparently, they also would not have been recognized universally as having the desired intent.</i> whether for vows involving prohibitions or vows involving the consecration of property.
If a person tells a colleague: "Whatever I eat from your [property] will not be like ordinary food," "...will not be kosher," or "...will not be pure,"<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam states this expression twice: once in Aramaic and once in <i>Lashon HaKodesh</i>.</i> it is as if he told him: "Everything that I eat from your [property] will be like a sacrifice,"<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the opposite of ordinary food is sacrificial food that is consecrated. Similarly with regard to his statement about impure food, we assume that his intent is an impure sacrifice in which instance, his vow is effective. Although it is possible that his intent is impure <i>terumah</i> (in which instance, his vow would not be binding), we follow the principle (Chapter 2, Halachah 7): Whenever there is a doubt concerning the effectiveness of a vow, we rule stringently (Rabbenu Nissim).</i> which is forbidden. Similarly, if he tells him: "Everything that I eat from your [property] will be an impure [sacrifice]," "...<i>notar,</i>" or <i>piggul</i>,"<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 11 for a definition of these terms.</i> it is forbidden.
When a person tells a colleague: "Not ordinary food will I not eat from your [property]," it is as if he told him:<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we interpret his statement as the Rambam explains.</i> "What I will eat from your [property] will not be like ordinary food, but instead, like a sacrifice."<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">And hence, forbidden to be eaten (<i>Nedarim</i> 11b).</i><br>Similarly, if he tells him: "The sacrifice if I eat from your [property]," "A sacrifice if I eat from your [property]," or "Like a sacrifice if I eat from your [property]," he is forbidden [to eat from his property].<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Even though none of these expressions is precise, they are still close enough to imply that his intent is that he is forbidding eating with his colleague like a sacrifice is forbidden.</i> If, by contrast, he tells him: "The sacrifice I will not eat from your [property]," "Like a sacrifice, I will not eat from your [property]," "For a sacrifice, I will not eat from your [property]," "A sacrifice I will not eat from your [property]," or "Not a sacrifice, I will not eat from your [property]," he is permitted in all of these instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his oath is not binding, for the reasons the Rambam continues to explain.</i> For all of these expressions do not have any implication other than he is taking an oath by a sacrifice that he will not eat from his [property] and taking an oath on a sacrifice is not binding. Alternatively, [his intent can be interpreted] as taking a vow that he will not partake of a sacrifice with him.
[If he tells him:] "Ordinary food, I will eat from your [property]," "The ordinary food, I will eat from your [property]," "Like ordinary food, I will eat from your [property]," "Ordinary food, I will not eat from your [property]," "The ordinary food, I will eat not with you," "Like ordinary food, I will not eat from your [property]," it is permitted for him [to eat from his property].<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Because he does not mention a sacrifice in any of these expressions. The Ra'avad mentions that from <i>Nedarim</i> 11a, it would appear that some of these expressions would involve a vow. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justify the Rambam's rulings.</i>
If, by contrast, he says: "No impure [sacrifices] will I eat from your [property]," "No <i>notar</i>, will I eat from your [property]," or "No <i>piggul</i> will I eat from your [property]," he is forbidden. [The vow takes effect, because] the intent of his statements appears to be: "What I will eat will be <i>piggul</i> or impure. Therefore, I will not eat from your [property]."<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Nedarim</i> 10b, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that we offer this interpretation, because we assume that a person will not make statements unnecessarily. Hence, since his statements could be interpreted as implying a vow, we offer such an interpretation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> struggles with the meaning of the Rambam's words and suggests that perhaps an error crept into the text.</i>
[If he says:] "By the Temple, I will eat from your [property]," "The Temple, I will eat from your [property]," or "No Temple, I will eat from your [property]," [the vow is effective,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">For he is forbidding himself from eating with his colleague, like he is forbidden to partake of the Temple's sacrifices.</i> and] it is forbidden. "The Temple, I will not eat from your [property]," "Like the Temple, I will not eat from your [property]," or "No Temple, I will not eat from your [property]," he is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Concluding with a negative expression implies that this is his intent, as in Halachah 19 (Radbaz). In this instance as well, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's wording.</i> For this is like taking an oath by the Temple, that he will not eat from his [property]. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person tells a colleague, "I am taking a vow from you," his statement implies that he will not speak with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">This and the subsequent statements of this clause do not imply that he is forbidden to partake of the other person's food.</i> "I am separate from you" implies that he will not do business with him. "I am distant from you" implies that he will not sit within four cubits of him. That same implication is conveyed by telling him: "I am ostracized from you" or "I am banned from you."<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">For this restriction applies when a person is under a ban of ostracism (see <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 7:4).<br>The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 206:1 mentions the opinion of Rabbenu Asher who maintains that these vows are not effective at all.</i><br>If, however, says "I am taking a vow from you in that I will not eat from your [property]," "I am separate from you in that I will not eat from your [property]," or "I am distant from you in that I will not eat from your [property]," he is forbidden to eat from his [property].<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">He may, however, speak to him (Radbaz).<br>Although the person does not mention the terms "prohibition" or "sacrifice" in his vow, since his intent is obviously to prohibit himself from benefiting from the other person, that prohibition takes effect. This reflects the principle (<i>Nedarim</i> 3a): "The handles of vows are as vows." The intent is that even a statement that, like a handle to a cup, is merely an auxiliary to a vow is binding like a vow itself. See also a responsum authored by the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham, which explains that even when the intent of one's statements are not entirely clear, as in the present instance, they may constitute a vow, provided their intent is somewhat clear. This principle is also quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 206:1).</i> If he eats an olive-sized portion [of food] from any of his property, he is liable for lashes for [violating the prohibition]: "He shall not desecrate his word."
If he tells him: "I am ostracized from you in that I will not eat from your [property]," he may not eat from his [property, but] if he does, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Nedarim</i> 7a, it appears that this expression creates an unresolved question whether the one taking the vow was merely promising not to come within four cubits of the other person or whether he intended to forbid partaking of that person's property. Because of the doubt, he is forbidden to partake of the property, but is not given lashes.</i> If he tells him: "I have drifted<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The term the Rambam uses relates to the Hebrew words <i>na</i> and <i>nad</i> which mean "wander" and "roam." Nevertheless, <i>Nedarim</i> 7a states that all authorities agree that this expression creates a binding commitment.</i> from you," he is forbidden to benefit from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Since he does not use the words "eat" or "partake," we assume that he intended to create a more encompassing prohibition.<br>The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the expression means that he is not allowed to partake of his property in his presence. That interpretation is also discussed by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i>
When a person tells a colleague: "Let it be considered for me like the vows of the wicked who make nazirite vows, vows for a sacrifice, and oaths,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to the wording of the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 1:1). The wicked make vows hastily and moreover, obligate themselves for vows which constitute a commitment incumbent on their person (Halachah 2).

If one took a vow by what was written in [the Torah], he is forbidden [to partake of the article mentioned in his vow], for [the Torah] contains statements involving prohibitions and vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's explanation is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 1:3).

When a person tells a colleague: "Let's get up and study a chapter [of Torah]," he is obligated to get up and study.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 8a derives this concept from Ezekiel 3:22-23 which states: "And He said to me: "Arise and go out to the valley and there I will speak to you. I arose and I went out to the valley and there the glory of God was standing." Since God promised to reveal Himself to Ezekiel, He kept his word, appearing even before Ezekiel arrived there.</i> Even though he did not use the wording of a vow, this is comparable to a vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Nedarim</i> 8a, it appears that although this statement establishes a binding commitment, it does not have the full power of a vow. The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 213:2) consider this statement as an actual vow.<br>The Rambam's perspective appears to be that a vow involves making an object forbidden. This instance where the person accepts a commitment upon himself bears a closer resemblance to the obligation incurred when making an oath. Nevertheless, since the person did not employ the wording associated with an oath, it is not binding as an oath. Nonetheless, since a mitzvah is involved, a binding commitment is established.</i>

Chapter 2

[The same laws apply] whether one took the vow on his own [volition] or another person states a vow for him and he answers <i>Amen</i> or says something which like <i>Amen</i> implies that he accepts the matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the parallels in <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:1.</i>
A person who takes an oath is not forbidden [to partake of] the entity which he forbade to himself until he makes a verbal statement to that effect<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., mere thought is not sufficient. With regard to vows, Numbers 30:7 mentions "the expression of her lips," implying that one must express his intent verbally.</i> and his statements must match his intent, as we explained with regard to oaths.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:10-12. The latter point is also implied by the prooftext cited above, for the term "expression" implies bringing out something which exists, i.e., revealing one's thoughts. Thus if a statement does not match one's thoughts, it is not an "expression" (<i>Kiryat Sefer</i>).</i><br>If, by contrast, one intended to take a nazirite vow and instead, vowed to bring a sacrifice, [intended to vow to bring] a sacrifice and instead, took a nazirite [vow], [intended to take] an oath and instead, [took] a vow, [intended to take] a vow and instead, [took] an oath, intended to say "figs" and instead, said "grapes," both are permitted to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The figs, because he did not make a statement concerning them and the grapes, because he did not intend to mention them.</i> There is no vow.
When a person takes a vow dependent on the intent of others, it is like he took an oath dependent on the intent of others.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:15.</i> Similarly, if one takes a vow and retracts<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He must state his retraction verbally. It is not sufficient for him to have this intent in his heart [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 210:3)].</i> immediately thereafter or someone rebuked him immediately thereafter and he accepted their statement, he is permitted [to use the article mentioned].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:17-18. As mentioned there, the term "immediately thereafter" has a specific halachic definition: the time it takes a student to tell his teacher: <i>Shalom Elecha Rabbi</i>. Since he retracts in this short time, it is considered as if the vow was never made.</i> The laws applying to all these matters with regard to vows are the same as those applying to oaths.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For Numbers 30:3 associates the two together (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 239:1).</i>
[The following laws apply when] a person issued a stipulation before he made a vow, saying: "I am retracting from any vow that I will take from now until ten years in the future," "They are nullified," or other similar statements, and then took a vow: If he remembered the stipulation at the time he made the vow, the vow is effective, for by taking the vow, he nullified the stipulation.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For by taking the vow, he is indicating that he no longer desires to uphold the stipulation (see <i>Nedarim</i> 23b).</i> If, however, he did not remember the stipulation until after he made the vow, the vow is nullified<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiryat Sefer</i> explains this ruling as follows: Although Numbers 30:3 states: "He shall not desecrate his word," that applies only to a vow that has taken effect. In this instance, since he forgot his stipulation, it is as if he took the vow in error and it never took effect.</i> even if [immediately after taking the vow], he brought the stipulation to mind and maintained it. Although he did not verbalize his retraction at the time [he made the vow], the retraction preceded the vow and he verbalized it beforehand.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation and bracketed additions are made on the basis of the gloss of the Radbaz.</i> There is an authority who rules stringently and says that he must remember the stipulation immediately thereafter taking the vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, according to that view, the vow takes effect and the fact that he remembers the stipulation afterwards is not significant. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 211:2) mentions the Rambam's view, but also that of the other authority and states that we should give weight to that authority's view. The Ra'avad also differs with the Rambam and offers another interpretation, stating that the nullification is only effective when he willingly accepts the stipulation immediately after remembering it.<br>As <i>Nedarim, loc. cit.</i>, emphasizes, the most common application of this principle is the declaration customarily made after the release of vows on the day preceding Rosh HaShanah, when we nullify all the vows we will take in the year to come. This is also the source for the <i>Kol Nidrei</i> prayer recited at the beginning of Yom Kippur which nullifies all vows to be taken in the coming year. Note, however, the statement of Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 211:1) that we do not rely on this stipulation without going to a sage for a formal annulment of a vow unless a great necessity was involved.</i>
[The following rules apply when] one made a stipulation [similar to that mentioned above]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, he did not nullify all vows that he would make in the future, only those of a certain type, e.g., not to drink wine or eat meat [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 211:3)].</i> for a year or for ten years and afterwards took a vow, remembering at the time that he took the vow that he had made a stipulation, but forgetting the subject of that stipulation or what it involved. If [when taking the vow], he said:<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In one of his response, the Radbaz states that this intent need not be verbalized. It is sufficient that he have the intent at heart.</i> "I am acting according to my original intention,"<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his intent is that if his original statement is discovered to run contrary to his vow, he desires to follow his original statement.</i> his vow is not effective, for he has nullified it. If he does not make such a statement, he has nullified the stipulation and upheld the vow, for, at the time he took the vow, he remembered that there was a stipulation and, nevertheless, took the vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he was aware of the possibility that his vow could run contrary to his original statement and took it nonetheless.</i>
There are some of the <i>Geonim</i> who maintain that all of these statements are applicable only with regard to vows and not to oaths,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For oaths have a more severe dimension, since God's name must be invoked. (See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 12:2.) The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 3:1) would appear to support this approach.</i> but there is an authority who maintains that the laws pertaining to vows and oaths are the same in this regard. Thus one may issue a stipulation nullifying an oath [beforehand] in the same manner as was stated with regard to vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz maintains that the Rambam follows this view as evidenced by the fact that he does not include this in the list of matters in which oaths differ from vows (Chapter 3, Halachah 1). The text for the nullification of vows rite recited on the day preceding Rosh HaShanah and the <i>Kol Nidrei</i> prayer mention oaths as well as vows.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 211:4) adds that the nullification of vows in this manner is possible only when one takes a vow on his own initiative, but not when he agrees to a vow proposed by a colleague, for the colleague does not have that person's original stipulation in mind. Thus by agreeing to his colleague's statement, he implies that he is not concerned with his original stipulation.</i>
[When a person takes] a vow whose object is not clear,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he does not know with regard to which prohibition he associated his vow (Rashi, <i>Nedarim</i> 18b).</i> we rule stringently.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">We say that he associated the vow with an object that causes entities to be forbidden (<i>ibid.</i>). The rationale is that if this was not his intent, he should have remained silent (Radbaz). See also Chapter 9, Halachah 4.</i> If he interprets them, there is room for both leniency and stringency.<br>What does this imply? If one says: "Let this produce be considered as salted meat and as wine poured as a libation for me," we ask him what his intent was. If he explained himself, saying "My intent was that salted meat refers to sacrificial meat<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For it was necessary to salt all the sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13 .</i> and wine poured as a libation refers to libations poured on the Temple altar," he is forbidden [to partake of the produce].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For when one equates produce with a sacrifice the vow is binding (Chapter 1, Halachot 7, 9).</i> If, however, he says: "My intent was a sacrifice offered to a false deity<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For the gentiles would also salt their offerings.</i> and wine poured as a libation to it," he is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For there is no way, he can cause an article to be forbidden as a sacrifice to a false deity through his vow. Hence, when he mentions such an object as the basis of a vow, the vow is not effective (Chapter 1, Halachot 8, 9).</i> If he took the vow without a specific intent, he is forbidden.
Similar principles apply when one says: "This produce is considered as <i>cherem</i> (a dedication offering) for me." If [his intent was] a dedication offering for the upkeep of the Temple, he is forbidden [to partake of the produce].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For in such an instance, the articles dedicated to the upkeep of the Temple become consecrated and forbidden for ordinary use until they are redeemed.</i> If [his intent] was a dedication offering for the priests, he is permitted, because [these offerings] become [the priests'] personal possessions and are not forbidden [to others].<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hence an entity that is made equivalent to them is likewise not forbidden.</i> If [he took the vow] without a specific intent, he is forbidden.
[If he states:] "May they be considered like the tithes for me," [we investigate his intent. If his intent was] the tithe taken from animals, [it becomes] forbidden, because these are sacrifices that he consecrates through his actions, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 13.</i> [If his intent was] the tithe taken from grain, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For the tithe taken from grain is not forbidden to be eaten by ordinary people. Moreover, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir who rules that ordinary people may not partake of these tithes, they are not forbidden due to a vow. Instead, it was forbidden to partake of the grain before they were separated and once, they were separated, they remain forbidden (Ritba, <i>Nedarim</i> 18b).</i> If [he took the vow] without a specific intent, he is forbidden.
[If he states:] "May they be considered like <i>terumah</i> for me," [we investigate his intent. If his intent was] the money donated for the sacrificial offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumat halishkah</i> in Hebrew.

Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">That we explore the person's intention.</i> apply? In a place where the terms used have these two possible meanings. In a place where the term <i>cherem</i> without any further definition is used only to refer to the dedication offerings for the upkeep of the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 18b explains that in the Galilee, it was not common for priests to live. Hence, when a person uses the term <i>cherem</i> there, his intent is a dedication offering for the upkeep of the Temple.</i> if he says: "[This produce is considered] as <i>cherem</i> for me," he is forbidden [to partake of the produce].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For we assume that his intent was a dedication offering to the Temple, even if he says that his intent was an offering to the priests.</i> Similarly, if their custom was to use the term <i>cherem</i> without any further definition to refer only to dedication offerings given the priests, he is permitted. Similar concepts apply in all analogous situations, for with regard to vows, we follow the connotations understood by the people in that place in that era.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 1.</i>
[The ensuing rules apply] in all situations analogous to those exemplified: i.e., situations when a person takes a vow which appears to everyone to involve a prohibition, but he says: "My intent was for this and this specific instance,"<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a situation where the basis for the vow is a permitted entity and hence, the vow does not take effect.</i> for example, he takes a vow based on a <i>cherem</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he said: "Let this produce be like a <i>cherem</i>."</i> but [afterwards] said: "My intent was a sea <i>cherem,</i> i.e., a fishing net,"<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 2:8), the Rambam cites Chabakuk 1:15 which employs such a term.</i> he took a vow based on an offering, but said: "My intent was an offering brought to the king," He told a colleague: "Myself is like a sacrifice for you," and then explained: "My intent was only to forbid him from [benefiting from] a bone<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word <i>atzmi</i> means "myself," but it can also mean "my bone."

Hence, the vow is not effective at all. With regard to the release of vows, see Chapter 4, Halachah 5.</i> If the one who took the vow is a common person, we make it appear to him that it is a vow, yet we give him an opportunity to ask for its release from another vantage point and then release the vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as stated in the following halachah, this is a safeguard to insure that the common people treat vows with the earnestness required.</i> Whether he is a Torah scholar or a common person, we rebuke him and teach him not to conduct himself in this manner with regard to vows and not to take vows as a lark or a caper.
Similarly, when a person tells his wife: "You are considered as my mother to me," or he says: "Let this produce be considered as pig meat for me," the vow is not effective, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 30.</i> If the person who took the vow was a Torah scholar, he is permitted and he need not ask a sage [for the vow to be released].<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For we assume he knows that the vow is of no consequence.

Although declaring property ownerless is not a vow,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This implies that he does not have the potential to retract merely by making a statement (Radbaz, <i>Ketzot HaChoshen</i> 273:1). According to Rabbinic decree, the laws are more stringent with regard to landed property, but this is law in all other instances.<br><i>Ketzot HaChoshen</i> discusses whether declaring an object ownerless is merely a retraction of one's own ownership over or does it involve transferring ownership to the person who will ultimately acquire it.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 6:1) explains that the declaration of property as ownerless is derived from the laws of the Sabbatical Year.

When a person declares his property ownerless [so that it can be acquired by] the poor, but not by the rich, it is not ownerless.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This is one of the indications that this declaration is not a vow. For were it a vow, it could be given to the poor alone (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> He must declare it ownerless for everyone like the produce of the Sabbatical year.<br>When a person declares his servants ownerless, those past majority acquire themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., are set free.

When a person declares landed property ownerless, whoever comes first and manifests his ownership<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Through a formal <i>kinyan</i>, e.g., locking a door or erecting a fence.</i> over it acquires it.<br>According to Scriptural Law, even when a person declares his property ownerless in the presence of one person, it becomes ownerless and one is not required to tithe its produce,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher and the Rama (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 273:7) states that even when one declares property ownerless without anyone else being present, the declaration is binding according to Scriptural Law.</i> as will be explained in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 2:11; <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim</i> 5:27.

Because this is an uncommon matter. [Generally,] a person will not declare [property] ownerless for a limited time.
When a person comes and watches over ownerless property, looking at it so that another person will not take it, he does not acquire it by looking at it.

Chapter 3

There are four differences between a vow and a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>:<br>a) With regard to a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, one oath cannot take effect while another is already in effect,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 4:9-10. The reverse ruling with regard to vows is described in Halachah 2.</i> and with regard to vows, a vow can take effect while another is already in effect.<br>b) When one attempts to extend the scope of an oath taken previously, he is not liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:8-9. The reverse rulings with regard to vows are described in Halachot 3-5.</i> and with regard to vows, one is.<br>c) A <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> can take effect only with regard to actions that are left to one's choice,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 5:14-16. The reverse ruling with regard to vows is described in Halachot 6-9.</i> while vows take effect with regard to mitzvot as well as actions that are left to one's choice.<br>d) A <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> can take effect with regard to an entity of substance and an entity that is not of substance, <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This concept can be explained as follows: As stated in Halachah 6, an oath creates a prohibition on the person taking the oath (the <i>gavra</i>), i.e., the article is essentially permitted, he has accepted a prohibition on himself not to partake of it. Hence, it is not significant whether the article is of substance or not. With regard to vows, by contrast, the article itself (the <i>cheftzah</i>) becomes forbidden. Hence, for that prohibition to take effect, the article must be of substance (Radbaz). See Halachah 10 for an illustration of how this principle is effective with regard to vows.</i> while vows take effect only with regards to entities of substance.
What is meant by the statement that a vow can take effect while another is already in effect? If a person says: "I will be obligated to bring a sacrifice if I eat this loaf [of bread]," [repeats]: "I will be obligated to bring a sacrifice if I eat it," he is liable [to bring a sacrifice] for every vow that he takes. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
What is meant by the statement that one who extends the scope of a vow taken previously is liable? He heard his colleague take a vow and said: "And I am like you" immediately thereafter,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This term refers to a specific span of time, the time it takes to say: <i>Shalom Elecha Rebbi</i> (<i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:17).</i> he is forbidden [to partake of] the substance that his colleague deemed forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is extending the scope of his colleague's vow, so that it includes not only his colleague, but he himself.<br>Here also the concept can be explained according to the above difference. Since an oath involves an obligation on the person taking the oath (<i>gavra</i>), it cannot be extended to include another individual, for each person must take his own oath. With regard to a vow, by contrast, since the prohibition caused by the vow is associated with a substance (<i>cheftzah</i>), another person can also extend the prohibition to himself (Rabbenu Nissim).</i> If a third person heard the second person say: "And I am like you," and he also said: "I am like you," [he is also forbidden]. Even if there are one hundred and each one says: "And I am like you" immediately thereafter the statements of the previous one," they are all forbidden.
Similarly, when one says: "This meat is considered forbidden to me,' and even after several days<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, it is not necessary to make the statement immediately thereafter the first vow. Since the meat is visible before us, one can attach a vow to it. With regard to the previous halachah, by contrast, we are speaking about a subject that cannot be seen. Hence, unless the statements are made immediately after each other, there is no way we can be certain of the meaning of the statement: "And I am like you" (Radbaz).</i> says: "This bread is like this meat," [the prohibition] is extended to the bread and it becomes forbidden. If afterwards, he said: "And this honey is like this bread, and this wine is like this honey," even if he mentions 100 [substances], they are all forbidden.
[The following rules apply when a person's] father or teacher died on a particular day and he took a vow to fast that day<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is a common practice in many communities.</i> and [actually] fasted.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he never fasted on that day, he cannot attach another day to this vow (<i>Chazon Yechezkel</i>).</i> If after years passed, he said: "Let this day<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., any given day.</i> be considered as the day on which my father - or my teacher - died," he is forbidden to eat on that day. For he attached this day [to his existing vow] and caused it to be forbidden as the day which is forbidden for him. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
What is meant by the statement that vows take effect with regard to mitzvot as well as actions that are left to one's choice? When a person says: "<i>Matzah</i> is forbidden to me on Pesach night," "Dwelling in a <i>sukkah</i> on that holiday is forbidden to me," or "I am forbidden to take hold of <i>tefillin</i>," they are forbidden to him. If he ate <i>matzah</i>, dwelled in a <i>sukkah</i>, or took <i>tefillin</i>, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For breaking his vow. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 215:1) mentions a view that maintains that the person should be given corporal punishment for taking such a vow and should be compelled to ask to have the vow released.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. Needless to say, one who says: "I am obligated to bring a sacrifice if I eat <i>matzah</i> on Pesach night," is obligated to bring a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For he can fulfill the mitzvah and bring the sacrifice (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Nedarim</i> 2:2).</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
Why do vows take effect with regard to mitzvot and oaths do not take effect with regard to mitzvot? Because when a person takes an oath he forbids himself from [partaking of] the entity mentioned in the oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prohibition involves the <i>gavra</i>, the person himself. It cannot take effect if he is already bound to act otherwise.</i> When, by contrast, one takes a vow, he causes the entity mentioned in the vow to be forbidden to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prohibition involves the <i>cheftzah</i>, the article. Once it is forbidden, it is forbidden to fulfill the mitzvah by partaking of it or using it, for a positive commandment does not supercede a negative commandment. It would be a mitzvah fulfilled through a transgression which is a forbidden act (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> Thus when a person takes an oath to nullify a mitzvah, he is placing a prohibition upon himself and he is already bound by an oath [to observe that mitzvah] from Mount Sinai, and one oath does not take effect if another is already in effect. When, by contrast, a person causes an entity to be forbidden through a vow, the prohibition involves the entity itself and that entity is not under oath from Mount Sinai.
When you contemplate [the wording of] the Torah, it appears that their interpretation matches the explanation which our Sages received according to the Oral Tradition. For with regard to a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, [Leviticus 5:4] states: "Whether he will do harm or do good," i.e., speaking about permitted activities as we explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 5:16.</i> e.g., whether I will eat or drink today, whether I will fast, or the like. With regard to vows, by contrast, [Numbers 30:3] states: "He shall do everything uttered by his mouth," without differentiating between matters associated with mitzvot and those left to our own volition.
When a person takes a vow to fast on the Sabbath or a festival, he is obligated to fast<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that by doing so he negates the mitzvah of taking pleasure in the Sabbath and festivals. The Ra'avad clarifies that the matter is dependent on the wording he used in his oath. If on the Sabbath, he said: "I will fast today," he is forbidden to keep his vow.</i> for vows take effect even when they involve [the nullification of] a mitzvah as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In the three preceding halachot.</i> Similarly, if a person takes an oath to fast every Sunday or every Tuesday throughout his life and a festival or the day preceding Yom Kippur<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">When it is a mitzvah to eat in preparation for the fast (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 9a; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 604:1).</i> falls on that day, he is obligated to fast. Needless to say, this applies with regard to Rosh Chodesh. If, however, Chanukah or Purim fall [on these days], his vow is superceded by [the celebrations of] these days. Since the prohibition against fasting on them is based on Rabbinic decree, reinforcement is necessary.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the Sabbath and festivals where the obligation to eat is of Scriptural origin. This is a general principle in Talmudic Law. There are times when our Sages gave their decrees greater power than Scriptural Law, for Scriptural Law is revered by the people at large and does not require reinforcement. If, by contrast, Rabbinic Law was abrogated in such instances, it might lead people to take leniencies even when uncalled for (see <i>Ta'anis</i> 17b; <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). The Radbaz explains that if keeping one's vow was allowed to override a Rabbinic decree, then there would be no point in making such decrees. For people could nullify them by taking vows. For example, a person could take a vow to drink ordinary gentile wine.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also explains that although the obligation to eat on Rosh Chodesh and the day preceding Yom Kippur is also of Rabbinic origin, since our Sages found an allusion to it in the Torah, it is less likely that people will treat it lightly.</i> Hence, his vow is superceded by the Rabbinic decree.
What is meant by the statement that vows take effect only with regards to entities of substance? If one says: "My speech is like a sacrifice for you,"<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he takes a vow against the other person listening to his speech.</i> he is not forbidden to speak to him, because speech is not an entity of substance. Similarly, if he tells him: "My speech is forbidden to you," it is not like his saying: "my produce is forbidden to you," or "My produce is like a sacrifice for you," in which instance, [the produce] would be forbidden.<br>Therefore, if a person tells a colleague: "[It is like a vow for] a sacrifice that I will not speak with you," "...that I will not act on your behalf," or "...that I will not go with you," or he told his wife, "[It is like a vow for] a sacrifice that I will not be intimate with you," his vow does not take effect in all these instances. For this is as if he is saying: "My speech, going, actions, or intimacy is like a sacrifice, and none [of these are] entities of substance.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he states: "The satisfaction that I receive from any of the above is forbidden," his vow is effective, for the satisfaction is considered substantial. See Chapter 12, Halachah 9.</i>
When, by contrast, a person says: "Let my mouth be forbidden to speak, my hands to act, my feet to walk, and my eyes to sleep," his vow is effective with regard to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For these organs are objects of substance (<i>Nedarim</i> 13b).</i> Therefore if a person tells a colleague: "My mouth is like a sacrifice with regard to speaking with you, my hands [are so] with regard to acting on your behalf, and my feet [are so] with regard to going with you," he becomes forbidden.<br>Similarly, one who tells a colleague: "I will be obligated to bring a sacrifice if I speak to so-and-so" or "...if I don't speak to so-and-so," he is obligated to bring a sacrifice if he violates this commitment. Similarly, if he took a vow in which he said: "[If] I spoke [to so-and-so, I must bring a sacrifice]" or "[If] I did not speak..." or the like, [he is liable]. For these are not vows in which he accepts prohibitions upon himself<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">And apply only to entities of substance.</i> whose ground rules we are explaining here, but vows of dedication.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Which are described in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>, chs. 6 and 9. See also Chapter 1 where the Rambam makes a distinction between these two types of vows.</i>
Although when a person takes a vow concerning entities that are not of substance and forbids them, the vow does not take effect with regard to them, we do not rule that he should act as if they are permitted. [Instead,] since he willingly [took a vow] forbidding them to him, [according to Rabbinic decree]<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Nedarim</i> 15a. Similarly, in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 2:1), the Rambam writes that the prohibition against desecrating one's word applies with regard to these vows. Compare to Chapter 4, Halachah 4.</i> the vow took effect with regard to them. Although they are not forbidden, we give him an opportunity [to ask for the vow's release] from another vantage point and then release the vow, so that he will not act frivolously with regard to vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachot 12-13.</i>

Chapter 4

Vows taken because of coercion,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained immediately below.</i> vows taken unintentionally,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 3.</i> and vows involving exaggerations are permitted,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Note, however, Halachah 4.</i> as we explained with regard to oaths.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 3:1, 5.</i><br>If men of coercion or customs collectors made him take a vow, saying: "Take a vow to us that meat is forbidden to you if you possess something on which customs duty is due," should he take a vow and say: "Bread, meat, and wine are forbidden to me...", he is permitted [to partake of] all of them<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he possessed items for which customs duty was due. See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 3:2.</i> even though he added to what they asked him [to say].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one might think that since he was not compelled to mention the other substances, the vow would take effect with regard to them. Hence, the Rambam explains that since he was compelled to take the vow, his additions do not change its status.</i> Similarly, if they asked him to take a vow [on the condition] that his wife not benefit and he took a vow [on the condition] that his wife, his children, and his brothers not benefit from him, they are all permitted. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
In all vows of this type, he must have the intent at heart for something that is permitted,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 3:3.</i> for example, that they be forbidden for him for that day alone or for that hour alone or the like. He may rely on the intent in his heart, since he is being compelled by forces beyond his control.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 232:14) emphasizes that the statement he makes may not be a direct contradiction to the intent in his heart. He also emphasizes that the vow may not be broken in a way that the gentile who forced the vow to be taken will be become aware of its violation. For this would lead to the desecration of God's name.</i> Thus at the time he is taking the vow for them, his mouth and his heart are not in concord. [This is required,] as we explained with regard to vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:12.</i>
Similarly, vows of encouragement are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The laws of this halachah do not apply with regard to oaths. Since an oath involves the mention of God's name, taking an oath for this purpose would be taking God's name in vain. A vow does not require the mention of God's name. Hence, this is permitted (Radbaz).</i> What does this imply? One administered a vow to a colleague to eat at his [home] and that colleague took a vow not to eat there, because he did not want to trouble him. Whether he ate or did not eat, they are both exempt.<br>Similarly, if a merchant took a vow that he would not sell an article for less than a <i>sela</i> and a purchaser took a vow that he would not buy it for more than a <i>shekel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., two <i>dinarim</i> which are half a <i>sela</i>.</i> if they agree on three <i>dinarim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 232:2) quotes opinions that maintain that each one can fluctuate slightly past the midway point, but may not accept the other's position completely. He also quotes other more lenient views.</i> they are both exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For neither definitely meant what he said. Taking the vow was just a bargaining technique. See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 232:2) which states that this applies when they continue negotiating after taking the vow. Then it is clear that they were merely bargaining. If, however, they broke off negotiations, the vow is considered binding.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. [The rationale is that] neither of them made a definite conclusion in his heart. He took the vow only to encourage his colleague without making a definite conclusion in his heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it could be said that his heart and his mouth were not in concord (Radbaz).</i>
What is the source which teaches that it is forbidden for a person to take even these four types of vows which are permitted with the intent of nullifying them? It is written [Numbers 30:3 : "He shall not desecrate his word," i.e., he should not make his word an inconsequential matter.
When a person took a vow and then [changed his mind and] regretted his vow, he may approach a sage and ask for its release. The laws pertaining to the release of vows are the same as those applying to the release of oaths.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 6:1.</i> A vow can be released only by a distinguished sage or by three ordinary men in a place where there are no sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 6:1.</i> The same wording is used to release a vow as is used to release an oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 6:4.</i> Similarly, all of the other concepts that we explained with regard to oaths apply to vows in the same way as they apply to oaths.
We do not release a vow until it takes effect, as is the law pertaining to an oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 6:14.</i>
Just as we may ask for the release of vows involving prohibitions and they are repealed, so, too, may we ask for the release of vows involving consecrated property and they are repealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, it is undesirable to do so. One should seek their release only in a pressing situation. See Chapter 13, Halachah 25.<br>Since ultimately, the person did not desire to make the vow, it is as if the article were consecrated in error. In such an instance, the consecration is not effective (Radbaz, based on <i>Ketubot</i> 78a).</i> This applies both to [articles] consecrated for the upkeep of the Temple and [animals] consecrated to [be sacrificed] on the altar. When the holiness of a sacrifice is transferred from one animal to another, that holiness cannot be released.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that the release of vows is based on the principle that after the person changes his mind and regrets having made the vow, it is as if the vow was made in error. Since the transfer of holiness from a sacrificial animal to another animal is binding even if it is done in error (<i>Temurah</i> 17a), there is no reason why a release is possible after such a transfer has been effected (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Nevertheless, if one regrets the original consecration, that can be nullified and then, as a matter of course, the animal to which the holiness was transferred will also lose its status (see <i>Mishneh LeMelech</i>).</i>
Just as a father or a husband can nullify [a woman's] vows involving prohibitions,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See chs. 11-13.</i> so, too, they can nullify vows of consecration that resemble vows involving prohibitions.
When a person takes a vow, a colleague hears and says, "And also me," a third person hears and says, "And also me,"<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The latter two are bound by the vow taken by the first, as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 3.</i> if the first asks for the release of his vow and it is released, all the others are also released.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For the vows of the latter individuals are dependent on the vow of the first. Once the first vow is nullified, they no longer have any basis on which they can stand.</i><br>If [the one who agreed to the vow] last asks for a release and it was granted, he alone is released and the others are still bound by the vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For their vows are not dependent on his.</i> If the second person asks for a release and it was granted, he and all those after him are released,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For his vow serves as the basis for theirs.</i> but the first is still bound by the prohibition.
Similar principles apply when one has attached many entities to a single vow, e.g., he took a vow [forbidding] bread and extended it to meat,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 4.</i> if he asks for release of [the prohibition against] bread and it is granted, the [prohibition against] meat is also released.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For it is dependent on the prohibition against bread.</i> If he asks for release of [the prohibition against] meat and it is granted, the [prohibition against] bread is not released.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For it is not dependent on the prohibition against meat.</i>
When a person takes an oath or a vow saying: "I will not benefit from any one of you," if he asks for the release of his vow or oath concerning one of them and the release was granted, they are all released. [The rationale is that] when a vow is released in part, all of its [particulars] are also released.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., at the outset, his intent was that the oath or vow include all the individuals in the group, once that intent is no longer valid, it is as if the entire vow or oath was taken in error. Hence, it is no longer binding. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 1:1) derives this concept from the exegesis of Numbers 30:3: "He should act according to <i>everything</i> that he uttered from his mouth." Since "everything" he uttered from his mouth need not be fulfilled, nothing must be fulfilled. If part of a vow is nullified, the entire vow is nullified.</i><br>When a person says: "I will not benefit from this person, and from this person, and from this person," if [the prohibition against] the first is released, [the prohibitions against] all of them are released.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since the person said "and" between each one, he made the latter individuals dependent on the first. Nevertheless, in contrast to the first clause, all of the individuals are not considered as being included in the same vow.</i> If the prohibition against the last is released, that prohibition is released, but the others remain binding. If he said: "I will not benefit from this one; nor from this one; nor from this one," he must ask for a release for each one indidivually.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Since he did not associate them by saying "and," it is considered as if he took a vow concerning each person individually. See also <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 7:10.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 6.</i>
When a person took a nazirite vow, a vow to bring a sacrifice, and an oath [forbidding himself from partaking of something], or he took a vow, but does not know concerning which of these he took the vow, one request for release [can release] all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">They are all considered as one vow. Hence, as in the previous halachah, once a portion of a vow is nullified, the entire vow is nullified. Even if he only has a reason to regret the last portion of the vow, the entire vow is nullified (Radbaz).</i>
When a person takes a vow [not to benefit] from the people of a city and he asks for the release of that vow from the sage of that city<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states in Chapter 7, Halachah 9, initially, it is forbidden for the person to ask such a sage to release his vow, for in this way, he is benefiting from the people of the city. After the fact, however, the vow is released, because retroactively, it is as if the vow were never taken.</i> or he took a vow [not to benefit] from the Jewish people and asks for the release of the vow from a Jewish sage,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, he may initially ask a Jewish sage to have his vow released, for he has no alternative. Only a Jewish sage can release a vow. In the previous instance, by contrast, he can ask a sage from another city to release the vow (Radbaz).</i> the vow is released.
If one says: "This produce is forbidden to me today if I go to this-and-this place tomorrow," he is forbidden to partake of them that day. [This is a] decree lest he go to that place tomorrow.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">And then the vow would take effect retroactively.</i> If he transgressed and partook of it that day and then undertook the journey on the morrow, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes to <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 4:16, to be liable for lashes, one must be given a warning. This law indicates that even if the warning was delivered conditionally, the person can be held liable for lashes.</i> If he did not go, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that he violated the advice of our Sages, since he did not violate a Scriptural commandment, he is not liable for lashes.</i>
If one says: "This produce will be forbidden to me tomorrow if I go to this-and-this place today," he is permitted to go that place today and the produce will be forbidden for him tomorrow. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. [The rationale is that] a person is careful about not violating a prohibition,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, we do not fear that he will partake of the produce on the following day.</i> but he is not careful in keeping a condition that will cause a permitted entity to become forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, in the previous halachah, he is forbidden to partake of the produce at the outset.</i>
When a person takes a vow to fast for ten days,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., not consecutively.</i> whenever he desires and he was fasting one day and had [to interrupt the fast] for the sake of a mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to participate in a feast celebrating the observance of a mitzvah, e.g., a circumcision or the completion of a Talmudic tractate (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 568:9).</i> or to honor a person of stature, he may eat and repay [the fast] on another day. [The rationale is that] he did not specify the days [he would fast] when he took the vow initially.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Since he did not stipulate the day on which he would fast, even though he began fasting on a particular day, he can change his mind and switch the fast to another day.</i><br>If he took a vow that he would fast today, but forgot and ate, he must continue to refrain from eating.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since he took a vow against eating that day, the fact that he broke his fast does not make it permissible for him to eat afterwards. This applies even if he is willing to fast another day instead. Compare to <i>Hilchot Ta'aniot</i> 1:14. the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 568:1) quotes the Rambam's ruling. The Rama adds that there are some who accept upon themselves to fast another day to compensate for the fast he did not keep.</i> If he took a vow to fast for a day or two and when he began to fast, forgot and ate, he forfeits his fast and is obligated to fast again.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, since he did not specify a particular day at the time of his vow, once he ate, he may eat on the day he began fasting.</i>

When Reuven tells Shimon: "I [am forbidden] to you like a dedication offering"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 14; Chapter 2, Halachah 8.</i> or "You are forbidden to benefit from me," it is forbidden for Shimon to benefit from Reuven.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It is as if Reuven designated his property as consecrated with regard to Shimon (<i>Or Sameach</i>).</i> If he transgresses and benefits from him, he is not liable for lashes, because Shimon did not say anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">And the prohibition which Reuven established does not make Shimon liable. If, however, Shimon said <i>Amen</i>, he would be liable, as stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 1.<br>See Chapter 10, Halachah 12, from which it is apparent that if Reuven voluntarily allows Shimon to benefit from his property, Reuven is liable for lashes, for he is desecrating his own vow.<br>As indicated by <i>Hilchot Meilah</i> 4:9, even though the person is not liable for lashes, he is liable to bring a sacrifice for atonement, since with regard to him, it is as if he benefited from consecrated property.</i> Reuven is permitted to derive benefit from Shimon, because he did not forbid this to himself.
If he tells Shimon: "You [are forbidden] to me like a dedication offering" or "I am forbidden to benefit from you," Reuven is forbidden to benefit from Shimon. If he derives benefit, he is liable for lashes, because he desecrated his word. Shimon is permitted to benefit from Reuven.<br>If he tells him: "I [am forbidden] to you like a dedication offering and you are [forbidden] to me" or "I am forbidden to benefit from you and you are forbidden to benefit from me," they are both forbidden to benefit from each other. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
If Reuven tells Shimon: "So-and-so's produce is forbidden to you" or "You are forbidden to benefit from so-and-so," his words are of no consequence.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that ordinarily, the son may use the estate to pay a debt or to give it to his brother as a present. If, however, the grandson is a Torah scholar, this is forbidden and it is as if the estate was transferred to him directly and the father cannot use it for other purposes. The Radbaz explains that this is speaking about a situation where the father had two sons and if this son's son was not a Torah scholar, he would give his entire estate to the other son.</i> this is permissible.

When a person was forbidden - either through a vow or an oath - to partake of a type of food, he is permitted to partake of other types of food that were cooked or mixed together with [the forbidden] food, even though it has [acquired] the flavor of the forbidden food.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For his vow involved only the food itself - i.e., something that people would have in mind when using that term - but not its flavor.

Here as well, since the second generation produce was produced by the forbidden produce and also by the earth, it should be permitted.<br>The Radbaz explains that since a vow is involved, we follow the principle mentioned in Halachah 12, that since the prohibition involved can be released entirely, we do not consider it nullified because another factor is also involved.</i> Needless to say, this applies to juices produced by them.
[The following rules apply] if a person took a vow or an oath not to eat [produce] or not to taste it. If it is an entity whose seed decomposes when it is sown like wheat or barley, he is permitted [to partake of] the articles exchanged for it<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For his vow specified only eating or tasting the produce, not benefiting from it.

As the Rambam explains at the conclusion of Halachah 15, we do not say that its flavor will be nullified because the greater portion of the substance of the new produce is permitted, because, as stated in Halachah 12, the forbidden fruit is an entity whose prohibition could be released.</i> In all situations, there is a doubt [whether he is forbidden to drink] the juices they produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 52b leaves unresolved the question whether in this context the juice produced from the fruit is considered as the fruit or not.

Chapter 6

When a person tells a colleague: "Benefit that leads to your food is forbidden to me," or "Benefit that leads to my food is forbidden to you," the person who is forbidden should not borrow from the other person: a sifter, a strainer, a hand mill, an oven, or any other utensil used to prepare food. He may, however, borrow from him bracelets, rings, and other articles that are not used to produce food. He is forbidden to borrow from him a sack or a donkey to carry produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For this also leads to him deriving pleasure from food.</i>
[In the above situation,] in a place where utensils are given out only for a fee, it is forbidden to borrow [without charge] even utensils that are not used to produce food.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For the money that he saved by not paying the fee could be used to purchase food.</i> If they were in a place where a fee is not charged and he borrowed from him utensils that are not used to produce food to look impressive to others because of them so that he will receive benefit from them<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., he lent him attractive clothing which created a favorable impression on others who gave him gifts as a result.</i> or he sought to pass through his property so that he could reach a place where he would derive benefit,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">To attend a feast, but not when going to his business as stated in the notes to the following halachah.</i> there is an unresolved question whether it is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In both cases, he did not give him direct benefit, but he did enable him to receive benefit.</i> Therefore, if he transgresses, he is not liable for lashes.

If he took a vow against benefiting from him, he may not pass through the property, for he is deriving some benefit. Nevertheless, that benefit does not lead to food.

If, however, he wishes to pass through his property to attend a feast, he is forbidden in all instances, as stated in the previous halachah (Radbaz).</i> and borrowing utensils that are not used to produce food in a place where they are borrowed without charge.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is benefit, but not benefit that leads to food.</i>
When Reuven was forbidden to benefit from Shimon, either through a vow or through an oath, Shimon may give the half-<i>shekel</i> which Reuven is obligated to give.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the half-<i>shekel</i> which every Jew is obligated to pay to the Temple treasury as his share in the communal sacrifices. See <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 1:1.</i> Similarly, he may pay a debt that he owes.

And preventing a claim from being lodged is not included in the prohibition against [giving] benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Malveh ViLoveh</i> 26:6 where the Rambam states that if "a person pays a promissory note of a colleague without that colleague's knowledge, even if it is a debt for which security was given, the borrower is not required to pay him anything.

If Shimon was a priest, he is permitted to offer sacrifices brought by Reuven. [The rationale is that] the priests are agents of God and not the agents of the person bringing the sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">And thus he is not considered as having performed a favor for the person bringing the sacrifice.</i><br>Shimon may marry off his daughter who is past maturity to Reuven with her consent.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For then, she is considered as having carried out the marriage.

For example, Reuven said: "Whoever desires to separate <i>terumah</i> [from my produce] may do so." He may not, however, tell Shimon to separate <i>terumah</i> on his behalf, for then he is making him his agent and this is [deriving] benefit from him.
[Shimon] may instruct [Reuven] in the Oral Law,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since Shimon is forbidden to receive a wage from teaching Reuven, he is not giving him tangible benefit.

On this basis, <i>Nedarim</i> 37a teaches that Moses was implying: "Just as I learned at no cost, so, too, you have been instructed at no cost by me. And so, too, should you teach the coming generations at no cost."<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 4:3), the Rambam writes:<br>According to our Torah, there is no way that it is permitted to take a wage for teaching any of the Torah's professions....<br>I am amazed at the men of stature who aroused by desire, denied the truth had wages designated for themselves for giving Torah rulings and instruction, citing flimsy support.<br>See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah <i>Avot</i> 4:7. It must, however, by noted that most authorities [see <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:5) allow a teacher to charge for the time he spends teaching Torah on the basis of the principle of <i>sechar batalah</i>, i.e., he could have spent the time he spends teaching working at another profession which would bring him an income. He is allowed to be reimbursed for the money he loses by choosing to teach Torah instead. For this reason, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 221:2) does not accept the Rambam's ruling and forbids Shimon from teaching Reuven.</i> The Written Law, by contrast, may not be taught by him, because a wage can be charged for teaching it.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 37a gives two reasons why it is permitted for a teacher of young children to charge a wage for his services: a) he is not charging for teaching; he is charging for being a disciplinarian; b) he is not charging for teaching the wordings of Torah; he is charging for teaching the cantillation notes. (For at that time, there were no texts with vowels and the Written Law was studied by memorizing its chants.) The first rationale does not apply with regard to adults, but the second does.</i> If it is not customary [in that community] to charge for instruction in the Written Law, this is permitted. Regardless of [the local custom with regard to payment], [Shimon] may teach [Reuven's] son.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A father is obligated to teach his son the Torah.

If Reuven becomes ill, Shimon may come and visit him.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For this is also a mitzvah. Even though the sick person derives benefit from the person's visit, the benefit is not granted him directly (see <i>Nedarim</i> 39a).</i> In a place where one who sits with a person who is ill to keep him company receives a wage, Shimon should not sit with him.

Since sitting with the sick person is worth money in that community, it is forbidden, by doing so, he will be providing the sick person with a tangible benefit.

See <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 221:19 who writes that if he charges for his time, he may sit and pay the sick person a longer visit.</i> He may personally give him medical treatment, for this fulfills a mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 4:4), the Rambam states that it is a mitzvah of Scriptural origin for a doctor to heal a sick person.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 221:4) states that when medical attention is given without charge, he may treat him without charge.

When an animal belonging to Reuven becomes ill,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In certain manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, this clause is included as the conclusion of the previous halachah rather than at the beginning of this one.</i> Shimon should not give it veterinary attention. He may, however, tell him: "Do such and such for it."<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he may give him advice with regard to which treatments to employ, but may not treat the animal himself. The rationale is that treating a colleague's animal is not considered a mitzvah (<i>Tosafot, Nedarim</i> 41b). The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 221) explains that if there is no one else capable of treating the animal but Shimon, Shimon may do so, because the mitzvah of returning a lost object also includes doing what is necessary to save a colleague's livestock. The Radbaz also adds the rationale that Scriptural Law requires us to alleviate an animal's discomfort.</i><br>[Shimon] may wash with Reuven in a large bath,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For the entrance of one person into a large bath is not significant.</i> but not in a small bath, because he gives him pleasure by raising the water over him.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">And that is considered as pleasurable.</i> He may sleep in the same bed as him in the summer,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Because the increase in warmth is not desirable.</i> but not in the winter, because he warms him.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The more people under the same bed clothes, the greater the warmth produced. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 221:5) states that this applies with regard to a small bed. If the bed is large, even in the winter, it is permitted.</i> He may sit on the same couch as him and eat at the same table,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This alone is not enough to create suspicion that he will offer him food.</i> but may not eat from the same plate or from the same food trough that is placed before workers. [The rationale is that we fear that] Shimon will leave a nice piece of meat and refrain from eating it so that Shimon will eat it or move it closer to him and in this way, bring him benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Meiri explains that even though the two are at odds - and for that reason one has taken a vow not to offer the other benefit - we fear that he might make such a gesture out of good manners.</i> Similar concepts apply with regard to produce in a food trough. It is, however, permitted for Shimon to eat from a plate even though he knows that when he returns it to the host, the host will place it before Reuven. We do not fear that [Shimon] will leave a choice cut of meat for [Reuven].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The custom was that before passing the tray to another person, the host would fill it up again. Hence there would be no need for Shimon to worry about leaving a piece for Reuven [Radbaz; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 221:5)]. The Rama adds that if the serving plate contained a very large amount, there is no prohibition.</i>
It is permitted for Reuven to drink a cup of comfort<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">It was customary to drink wine in the house of mourners to help him overcome his sorrow (see <i>Ketubot</i> 8b).</i> of his own [wine] from Shimon's hand. Similarly, he may give him the cup of the bathhouse,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">A cup of hot water that was provided for bathers by the owner of the bathhouse (i.e., and not one belonging to Shimon).<br><i>Nedarim</i> 38b states that Shimon may give Reuven "the cup of peace" and advances these two interpretations for the term. The Rambam does not consider the interpretations as mutually exclusive, for the same principle - that the satisfaction Shimon gives Reuven is minimal - applies in both instances (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> for this does not involve satisfaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad offers a different interpretation than the Rambam, explaining that the "cup of the bathhouse" is given to save the person's life, lest he dehydrate. Moreover, he explains that since the cup belongs to Reuven, there is no difficulty. And he states that giving the cup of comfort is a mitzvah.</i>
Reuven is forbidden to use Shimon's coal, but he is permitted to use his flame.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For the coal is considered an entity of substance, while the flame is not (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 221:57).</i>
[The following laws apply if] Shimon owned a bathhouse or an olive press that were hired out [to others] in the city. If Shimon retains a hold on them, e.g., he left a portion for himself and did not hire it out, it is forbidden for Reuven to enter that bathhouse or tread in that olive press.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since Shimon retains a certain dimension of ownership, when Reuven makes use of it, he is still considered as benefiting from Shimon's property.</i> [This applies] even if he retains merely one tub in the bathhouse or one press<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Maaserot</i> 1:7) the Rambam defines the term <i>ekal</i> as referring to a container made from ropes in which olives are placed and crushed.</i> in the olive press. If he did not retain anything for himself, but rather hired it out in its entirety, it is permitted [for Reuven to enter].<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Provided Shimon did not specifically forbid Reuven from entering these structures, as indicated by Halachah 14.</i>
It is forbidden for Reuven to partake of the produce of Shimon's field, even during the Sabbatical year when everything is ownerless, for he took the vow before the beginning of the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">And once an entity has become forbidden because of a vow, it remains forbidden.</i> If he took the vow in the Sabbatical year itself, [Reuven] may partake of the produce that hangs outside the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For that is ownerless and is not affected by the vow.</i> He may not, however, enter the field even though the land is ownerless.

When does the above apply? When he told him: "Benefit from this property is forbidden to you."<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For then, benefit from that particular field itself becomes forbidden to Reuven forever. Compare to Chapter 5, Halachah 5.</i> If, however, [Shimon] told [Reuven]: "It is forbidden for you to benefit from my property,"<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In which case, the prohibition involves only property actually owned by Shimon without applying to any particular property individually.</i> or Reuven took an oath or a vow [prohibiting him from benefiting] from Shimon's property, when the Sabbatical year begins, he may partake of the produce of his field, for they have left Shimon's domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For the entrance of the Sabbatical year causes them to be considered as ownerless. Shimon cannot cause the produce to be forbidden for Reuven, for a person cannot cause food that does not belong to him to be forbidden to a colleague (<i>Nedarim</i> 42b). And when Reuven takes an oath or a vow not to benefit from Shimon's property, the oath or the vow does not pertain to this produce, for it does not belong to Shimon.</i> He may not, however, enter his field for the reasons we explained [in the previous halachah].
[Different laws apply if] only benefiting from Shimon's food was forbidden to Reuven,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 1 and 3.</i> If, either because of a vow or an oath, the prohibition took effect before the Sabbatical year, he may enter his field,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Because in such a situation, he is not forbidden to enter Shimon's property.</i> but may not eat his produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since the prohibition took effect before the Sabbatical year, it continues during the Sabbatical year, as stated in Halachah 13.</i> If the prohibition took effect in the Sabbatical year, he may enter his field and partake of his produce, for this produce does not belong to Shimon. Instead, it is ownerless.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Shimon cannot cause it to be forbidden for Reuven, as above.</i>
It is forbidden for Reuven to lend [articles] to Shimon. [This is] a decree, lest he borrow from him although it is forbidden for him to benefit from him. Similarly, it is forbidden for [Reuven] to give [Shimon] a loan. [This is] a decree, lest he borrow from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Reuven is not receiving any benefit from lending out either his articles or his money.

If it happened that [Shimon] was working with [Reuven], e.g., they were harvesting together, he should work far from him. [This is] a decree, lest he help him.<br>When [a father] takes a vow, forbidding his son to benefit from him because the son does not occupy himself in Torah study, the father is permitted to fill up a jug of water [for his son], light a lamp [for him], or roast a small fish. For [the father's] intent was only to forbid [his son] from deriving significant pleasure and these matters are not considered important by the son.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, explaining the source for this law (<i>Nedarim</i> 38b) in another way. The Radbaz explains that halachically, both interpretations are acceptable. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 223:1) quotes the Ra'avad's interpretation, but not of the Rambam. Accordingly, the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> maintains that according to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, the Rambam's interpretation is not accepted.

The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 221) is even more stringent, stating that when it is obvious that he is intending for the person to whom he is forbidden to speak to hear, he may not speak even to another colleague.</i> The <i>Geonim</i> ruled in this manner.

Chapter 7

When two people are forbidden - by vow or by oath - to derive benefit from each other, they are allowed<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">And since they are allowed, they are obligated.</i> to return a lost article to each other, because doing so is a mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For he is not returning it as a favor to him, but instead, in fulfillment of the Torah's command [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 4:2).</i> In a place where it is customary for the person who returns a lost article to receive a reward, the reward should be given to the Temple treasury.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Or, in the present age, to charity. This is preferable to destroying it.</i> For if [the person who returns the lost article] will take the reward, he will be receiving benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he will be returning it for the sake of the reward and not for the sake of the mitzvah (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> If he does not take it, he will be giving the other person benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For ordinarily the person would pay a reward for the return of the lost article.</i>
They are [both] permitted [to make use of] those entities that are owned jointly by the entire Jewish people,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Technically, the other person has a share in these places, for they are owned communally. Nevertheless, since each person's individual share is so small, these places are considered as if they are ownerless and not as communal property (see <i>ibid.</i> 5:4).</i> e.g., the Temple Mount, its chambers, its courtyards, and a well in the midst of a highway.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e.., a well built for the pilgrims' journey to Jerusalem from Babylon for the pilgrimage festivals (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> They are forbidden [to make use of] those entities that are owned jointly by all the inhabitants of that city,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance, each person's share is greater and more distinct.<br>The Ramban and the Ran object to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that this ruling does not apply with regard to an entity like a synagogue that cannot be divided. In such an instance, it is considered as a communal entity and the person who took the vow is allowed to make use of it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 224:1) quotes both views. See the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 224:1 who elaborate in support of the Rambam's position.</i> e.g., its marketplace, its bathhouse, its synagogue, its ark, and its holy texts.
What can they do so that they will be permitted to use these entities? Each one of them should sign over his portion to the <i>nasi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The leader of the Jewish people. He is mentioned, because it is very unlikely that he will forbid a member of the people from using his property (<i>Nedarim</i> 48a).</i> or to another person and have him acquire that portion through the medium of another person.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the person acquiring the portion need not know about his acquisition. We follow the principle that a person can acquire property without his knowledge if it is to his benefit to do so (see <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 4:2).</i> Thus when either of them enter a bathhouse belonging to all the members of the city or to the synagogue, he is not entering the property of the colleague [from whom he is forbidden to benefit], for each of them has relinquished his share of the place and given it away as a present.
[The following laws apply when] they are both partners in a courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In the Talmudic era, it was common that several houses would open up to a courtyard that was the combined property of the homeowners. In this halachah, we are speaking of an instance where two of those homeowners took vows forbidding them to benefit from each other.</i> If it can be divided,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shechenim</i> 2:1 which states that if after the division of a courtyard, each of the homeowners will receive a plot of land four cubits by four cubits as his individual property, the courtyard should be divided if one of the neighbors requests that this be done.</i> they are forbidden to enter it unless it is divided and each person enters his portion. If it cannot be divided,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if it were to be divided, the homeowners would not receive a portion of land that size.</i> each one should enter his house, saying: "I am entering my property."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Nissim explains this ruling based on the principle of <i>bereirah</i>, i.e., retroactively, it becomes apparent that when he enters the courtyard, he is entering property that was designated as his. We are forced to accept this definition (even though generally, the principle of <i>bereirah</i> is not followed in questions of Scriptural Law), for there is no alternative in this instance. The person has a right to the courtyard and he cannot be forbidden from using his own property. See <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 226:4, <i>Turei Zahav</i> 226:1.</i> Regardless,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Whether it cannot be divided or whether it can be divided, but was not divided yet.</i> they are both forbidden to place a mill or an oven there or to raise chickens in this courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 57b relates that partners in a courtyard have the right to prevent each other from performing such activities. Although most partners do not exercise this right, in this instance, by failing to exercise the right, one is providing benefit to the other person (Rabbenu Nissim).</i>
When two people are partners in a courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a courtyard to small for the owners to divide.</i> and one of them takes an oath that the other may not benefit from him, we force the person who took the oath to sell his portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">His vow imposes unnecessary hardship on the other person who has a legitimate right to the property. Hence, we compel him to sell his share of the courtyard rather than put his colleague in a situation where he might transgress.</i><br>If he took an oath not to benefit from the other person, he is permitted to enter his home, for he is entering his own domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 226:2) states that the person who took the vow is forbidden to enter the courtyard. The rationale is that the Rambam's understanding is accepted, except that an additional stringency is applied, lest the person remain in the courtyard for other purposes besides entering and departing his home (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 226:10).</i> He may not, however, make any other use of the courtyard, as explained [in the previous halachah].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">We do not force him to sell his portion of the courtyard because he is causing difficulty only to himself and he is willing to abide by his prohibition (Radbaz).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, citing <i>Nedarim</i> 46a as support for his understanding. He mentions that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 5:2) appears to support the Rambam's interpretation, but states that we should abide by the principle that whenever there is a difference of opinion between the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, the perspective of the Babylonian Talmud should be followed. See the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> who try to reconcile the differences in the positions of the two Talmuds. As mentioned, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> follows the Rambam's understanding, but is even more stringent.</i>
If a person from outside was forbidden to benefit from either of [the owners of the courtyard],<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This is speaking about a courtyard that is too small to require division (Radbaz).</i> he may enter the courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 226:1) states that this applies only when the other owner of the courtyard needs that person. Otherwise, he is forbidden to enter.</i> for he tells [the person from whom he is forbidden to benefit]: "I am entering your colleague's domain, not yours."
When a person forbids himself from benefiting from one of the nations, he is permitted to buy [an article] from them at more than the market price and sell to them at less than the market price.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For thus he is suffering a loss every time he deals with them.</i> If he forbids them from benefiting from him, if they are willing, it is permitted for him to purchase from them for less than the market price and sell to them at more than the market price.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For they are suffering a loss every time they deal with him.</i> We do not issue a decree forbidding him to sell [at less than the market price], lest he purchase [at less than the market price].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As a decree was made with regard to an individual. See Chapter 6, Halachah 16.</i> [The rationale is that] he did not take a vow concerning only one individual, in which instance such a decree would be appropriate, but concerning an entire nation and if it is impossible for him to do business with one person, he will do business with another.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., with regard to one individual, there is room for stringency, but this stringency is not required with regard to an entire nation, for there is (Radbaz).</i> Therefore, if he forbade himself from benefiting from them, he may lend both articles and money to them, but may not borrow either of these from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not make a decree like we do with regard to an individual (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 227:7).</i>
If he forbade them from benefiting from him and himself from benefiting from them, he should not do business with them, nor may they do business with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For one of them, either they or he will be benefiting from the sale.</i> He may not borrow an article from them or lend an article to them, nor borrow money from them or lend money from them.
If he forbade himself from benefiting from the inhabitants of a city, he is forbidden to ask the sage of the city for the repeal of his vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For this is a benefit that he is receiving.</i> If, however, he did ask him and he released the vow, the vow is released, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For when a sage releases a vow, it is as if it never existed. Hence, it is as if he were never forbidden to approach the sage. See Chapter 4, Halachah 13, and notes.</i>
When a person forbade himself from benefiting from any other people, he is permitted to derive benefit from <i>leket, shichechah, pe'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leket</i> refers to crops that drop from a reaper's hand in the field.

When a person forbade priests or Levites from benefiting from his property, they may come and take the gifts [to be separated from his produce]<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the tithes that must be given to the Levites and <i>terumah</i> which must be given to the priests.</i> against his will.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is obligated to give these presents to the priests and Levites, he has no choice in the matter and must make these gifts. Generally, a person is allowed to decide which Levite and which priest, he desires to give these gifts to.

When it is forbidden for a person to benefit a colleague and that colleague has nothing to eat, the person may go to a storekeeper and say: "So-and-so is forbidden to benefit from me and I don't know what to do."<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 221:8) is even more lenient and states that he may say: "Anyone who sustains so-and-so will not suffer a loss," for he is still merely intimating that one should support him. He may not say: "Whoever hears my voice should sustain so-and-so," for that it a direct command. Nor may he tell one person: "If you sustain so-and-so, you will not suffer a loss," for then it appears as if he is appointing him as an agent for this purpose.</i> It is permitted for the storekeeper to go and give [food] to the colleague and take [payment] from that person.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Since the person did not charge the storekeeper with providing the colleague with food, he is not responsible for the account [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 221:8)].

[Similar laws apply]<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the two instances are not entirely analogous, for the first involves providing the person with food necessary for his livelihood, while the second involves the performance of a task that is important, but not vital for him. Perhaps this is the reason why in the preceding halachah, the Rambam stated: "The person may go to a storekeeper," i.e., he is permitted as an initial and preferred option. In this halachah, by contrast, he states: "If the person... approached workers," i.e., the Rambam is describing a law that applies after the fact, but not initially.</i> if it is necessary to build [that colleague's] house, put up a fence for him, or harvest his field. If the person from whom it was forbidden to benefit approached workers and told them: "So-and-so is forbidden to benefit from me and I don't know what to do,"<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that although the previous law was mentioned, it is also necessary to state this law, because it is uncommon for workers to extend credit on money do them. This is, by contrast, a common practice for storekeepers.</i> They may then perform these activities, go back to that person, and he may pay them. For he is paying the debt of the colleague and we already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 6, Halachah 4.</i> that a person [from whom one is forbidden to benefit] may pay a debt for his colleague.
If the two<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a person who took a vow not to benefit from a person and that person.</i> were traveling on a journey and [the person who is forbidden to benefit from his colleague] does not have anything to eat, [that colleague] may give [food] to another person as a present and [the person who is forbidden] is then permitted to partake of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Giving a present is not permitted in the situations described in the previous halachot, because there are other alternatives. Hence it is considered as too great a leniency. In this situation, there is no other alternative and therefore it is permitted. See <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 221:52.</i> If there is no one else with them, [the person whose property is forbidden] should put [food] on a stone and say: "This [food] is considered ownerless for everyone who desires it."<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, according to Rabbinic Law, there must be three people present when an object is declared ownerless. In this instance, however, since there is no other alternative, we do not require anything more than required by Scriptural Law (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 221:53).</i> The other person may then take it and eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For then he is not partaking of the property of the person from whom he is forbidden to benefit, but from ownerless property.</i>
If, [however,] he gives a colleague a present [of a feast] and tells him: "This feast is given to you as a present.

If it is a large feast, it is obvious that a person is not preparing it for the sake of giving it to a colleague. <i>Nedarim</i> 48b gives as an example, an instance where a person's father was forbidden to benefit from him. When he made a wedding feast for his son, he tried to employ this tactic to enable his father to attend.</i> Moreover, even if he gave the present without saying anything, but afterwards<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that there are opinions that maintain that this law applies only when the statements were made immediately after giving the feast. The wording chosen by the Rambam, however, indicates that the law applies even if he makes the statements later. The interpretation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> is borne out by the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 5:5).</i> said: "Do you want so-and-so to come and eat with us?" it is forbidden if it appears that initially, he gave the present solely so that ultimately so-and-so could eat with them. For example, it is a large feast and he wants his father, his teacher, or the like to partake of the feast. For [the size of] the feast indicates that he did not intend to give it to him. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
Any present that, were it to be consecrated [by the recipient], the consecration would not be effective, is not considered as a present.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the giver tells the recipient: "I did not give you the present so that you could consecrate it."<br><i>Nedarim, loc. cit.,</i> states this principle in continuation of the above story. After the son gave the wedding feast to a colleague so that his father could attend, that colleague consecrated it. When the giver, protested saying that he had not given it to him for that purpose, the recipient complained that he was not going to serve as a medium to allow the first person to break his vow. When the Sages were asked to rule about this situation, they stated the principle mentioned by the Rambam here.</i><br>Whenever a person gives a colleague a present with the stipulation that he transfer it to another person, that other person acquires ownership at the time the first [recipient] transfers it to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not say that since the first recipient is going to give to the second, the second acquires it when it is acquired by the first. This is not a situation where the first recipient is acting as an agent for the second. Instead, he acquires it first on his own behalf and then transfers it to the other person.</i> If the first recipient does not transfer it to that other person, neither the first, nor the second [recipient] acquires it.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The first does not acquire it, because it was given to him only on condition that it be transferred to the second. Since that condition was not fulfilled, his own acquisition is not binding (see <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 3:6). The second person does not acquire it, because ownership was never transferred to him.</i>
[The following principle applies when a person's son-in-law is forbidden to benefit from him and he desires to give his daughter money so that she can benefit from it and spend it as she desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Ordinarily, whatever a woman acquires immediately is given to her husband's jurisdiction. While she remains the legal owner, he has the legal right to control it and use the profits as he sees fit. In this instance, this would be forbidden for the son-in-law is prohibited against benefiting from his father-in-law, as the Rambam states in the conclusion of the halachah.</i> He should give her a present and say: "This money<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">If he gives her the food itself, it is not necessary to make any stipulations (Radbaz, <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 222:1).</i> is given to you as a present on the condition that your husband has no authority over it.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Yom Tov (Nedarim</i> 11:8) states that from <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 3:13, it appears that the inclusion of this part of the statement is not an absolute necessity. As long as he specifies that the present is being given for a specific purpose alone, the husband does not acquire rights to it. Rav Yosef Caro does not accept this option, however, in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and quotes the Rambam's wording from this halachah in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 222:1; see <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 222:2).</i> Instead, it shall be used for what you put in your mouth, what you cloth yourself, and the like."<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since the father has designated the money for a specific purpose, it may be used only for that and thus the son never acquires a right to it. The rationale is closely related to the concept of a vow. Just as a vow can determine how property may be used even after it leaves the domain of the person who took the vow, so, too, the father can determine how his property may be used even after it leaves his domain.<br>This ruling teaches that even though it is to the husband's benefit that his wife eats or is clothed - indeed, he is responsible to provide for these needs of hers - the husband is not considered to have benefited from this present (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Nedarim</i> 11:8).</i> Even if he said: "...on the condition that your husband has no authority over it. Instead, it shall be used for whatever you want to do with it,"<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, even though the specific purpose for which the present was given was not stated at the outset, when the woman decides what she desires to do with the present, retroactively, it is as if it was given for that purpose alone.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam concerning this point, noting that although the law stated in the first clause is accepted by all authorities, the one stated in this clause is the subject of a difference of opinion between the Sages Rav and Shmuel in <i>Nedarim</i> 88b. The Rambam's ruling follows the opinion of Shmuel although generally, with regard to matters involving the Torah's prohibitions, the halachah follows that of Rav. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> state that other <i>Rishonim</i> also follow Shmuel's perspective and give logical support for it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 222:1) quotes both views without stating which should be followed.</i> the husband does not acquire it and she may do what she desires with it.<br>If, however, he gave her a present and told her. "...on the condition that your husband has no authority over it," but did not specify the purpose for which the present was being given or even did not say that it was intended for whatever she desires, the husband acquires it to derive benefit from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 3:13. The rationale is that the giver does not have the prerogative of negating the rights given the husband by the Rabbis.</i> This would be forbidden, because he is forbidden to benefit from his father-in-law.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, the present is binding. The husband should purchase something that brings income with the money. That article belongs to his wife. He should give the proceeds to charity, since he is not allowed to benefit from them (Radbaz)</i>

Chapter 8

When a person takes a vow or an oath and at the time of the vow or the oath specifies a stipulation for which he is making the vow, it is as if he made the vow or the oath dependent on that matter. If the stipulation for which he took the oath is not fulfilled, he is permitted [to act as if the oath had never been taken].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He need not seek the release of the oath (Radbaz). This law applies with regard to vows as well.</i>
What is implied? If he took an oath or vow saying: "I will not marry this-and-this woman whose father is evil" or "I will not enter this house, because there is a harmful dog within it," if they died or the father repented, he may [do so]. This is comparable to someone who says "I will not marry so-and-so..." or "...not enter this house unless the harmful factor is removed."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the father dies or repents after the vow was taken, with his death or repentance, the vow is nullified, because the conditions under which it was taken no longer apply.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
[A different rationale applies] when one takes a vow or an oath: "I will not marry so-and-so who is ugly," and it is discovered that she is beautiful,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, she was ugly at the time the vow was taken, but was made beautiful, the vow takes effect [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 232:6)].</i> "...who is dark-skinned," and it is discovered that she is light-skinned, "...who is short," and it is discovered that she is tall, or "I am taking a vow that my wife shall not benefit from me, because she took my wallet and beat my son," and it was discovered that she did not take it or beat him. He is permitted, because the vow was taken in error. It is included among the category of inadvertent vows that are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 1, which states that such vows are not binding.</i> This does not resemble an instance where the vow was made dependent on a stipulation and that stipulation was not kept.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As described in the first two halachot.</i> For the reason for which the vow was taken never applied. Instead, it was an error [of perception].
Moreover,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the previous halachah describes an instance where one explicitly stated the condition under which he took the vow. This halachah, by contrast, describes a situation where the condition is not stated, but is self-apparent.</i> even if a person saw from a distance that people were partaking of his figs and he said [concerning] them: "They are like a sacrifice for you,"<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Which would cause them to be forbidden to eat the figs.</i> but when he came close to them and looked [at them], he saw that they were his father and his brothers, they are permitted [to partake of them]. Even though he did not explicitly state the reason why he took a vow [forbidding] them, it is as if he did. For it is obvious that he forbade his produce to them only because he thought they were people at large.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">And thus the vow was taken in error.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person took a vow or an oath and then a factor came up that was not in his mind at the time he took the oath or the vow, he is forbidden [in the matter] until he requests a sage to release his vow.<br>What is implied? A person forbade himself from benefiting from so-and-so or from entering this-and-this place and that person became the city scribe<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">And everyone in the city needs the scribe to compose legal documents for him. Hence, he no longer desires to be forbidden to benefit from him.</i> or a synagogue was made at that place.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And everyone desires to be able to enter the local synagogue.</i> Even though he said "If I knew that this person would become the scribe or that in this place a synagogue would be made, I would not have taken the vow or the oath," he is forbidden to benefit [from the person] or enter the place until he has his vow released, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 6:5, 12. As stated there, the vow was not made initially in error, for at the outset, he did not desire that the person become the scribe. Hence, the oath takes effect.<br>The Ra'avad suggests that the statement from Halachah 3: "This does not resemble an instance where the vow was made dependent on a stipulation and that stipulation was not kept" should be included here, for this is a different category of vows than those mentioned in the previous halachot.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
Whenever a portion of a vow is nullified, the entire vow is nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Nedarim</i> 1:1 derives this from the exegesis of Numbers 30:3: "He shall do all that he utters from his mouth." Implied is that everything that he utters must be fulfilled or the vow does not take effect. Rabbenu Nissim gives a logical explanation for this concept. At the outset, his intent was that the vow would be kept in its entirety. If a factor arose that prevented that from taking place, it is as if the vow was taken in error.</i> This law also applies with regard to oaths.<br>What is implied? A person saw from a distance that people were partaking of his figs and he said [concerning] them: "They are like a sacrifice for you," but when he came close to them and looked [at them], he saw that they were his father and people at large. Since his father is permitted [to partake of them],<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Halachah 4.</i> they are all permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Because the prohibition against them was mentioned in the same vow.</i> Even if he said: "So-and-so and so-and-so are forbidden and my father is permitted, they are all permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Because the vow was taken against all of the persons together. Hence, it cannot be nullified only in part.</i><br>If, however, when he reached them he said: "If I would have known that my father is with you, I would have said: 'You are all forbidden [to partake of my produce], except my father,' they are all forbidden except his father. For he revealed his intent was not to release a portion of his vow,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For even when qualifying his statement, he still says that all of the individuals are forbidden, indicating that he did not desire to retract his original statement (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 232:8), Rav Yosef Caro appears to follow a slightly different rationale.</i> but to make a vow as he did, but to make a stipulation concerning his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., that the prohibition would not include his father.</i>
Similar [laws apply] when one says: "Wine is like a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., forbidden.</i> for me, because wine is bad for digestion," but he was told: "Aged wine is good for digestion." If he said: "Had I known, I would not have taken the vow" or even: "Had I known, I would have said: 'Fresh wine is forbidden, but aged wine is permitted,' he is permitted [to drink] both fresh wine and aged wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The portion of the vow involving aged wine is nullified, because it was taken in error. And accordingly, the portion involving fresh wine is also nullified, based on the principle stated in the previous halachah.</i> If, however, he said: "Had I known, I would have said: 'All wine is forbidden for me except aged wine,' he is permitted [to drink] only aged wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For he did not seek to nullify his former vow, merely to qualify it, as stated in the conclusion of the previous halachah.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
Whenever a person takes a vow or an oath, we consider the motivating factor for the oath or the vow and extrapolate from it what the person's intent was. We follow his intent, not the literal meaning of his words.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 218:1) emphasizes that this applies when a person takes a vow on his own initiative. If, however, he takes a vow in response to wording chosen by a colleague, we follow the meaning of that wording.</i><br>What is implied? He was carrying a load of wool or of linen and was perspiring, causing a foul odor. If he took an oath or a vow that he would never have wool or linen upon him again, he is permitted to wear woolen or linen clothes and cover himself with them. He is only forbidden to carry them on his back like a burden.<br>If he was wearing woolen clothing and became aggravated because of these garments and took an oath or a vow that he would never have wool upon him again, he is forbidden to wear [woolen clothes], but is permitted to carry wool and to cover himself with woolen spreads. For he intended only [to forbid] woolen clothes. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
[Similar laws apply if] people were asking him to marry his relative,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For it is desirable that a person marry his relatives (see <i>Yevamot</i> 62b).</i> but he refused and they pressured him, so he took a vow or an oath that she could not benefit from him forever. Alternatively, a person divorced his wife and took an oath that she would never benefit from him. These women are permitted to derive [ordinary] benefit from him. His intent was that only [to prevent himself from] marrying them.
Similarly, if a person called to his friend, [inviting him] to eat at his [home] and he took an oath or a vow not to enter his home or even drink cold water of his, he is permitted to enter his home and drink his water. His intent was only that he would not eat and drink with him at that feast.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that he is even permitted to enter his home at the time of the feast.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person takes a vow or an oath, telling a colleague: "I will never enter your house" or "...buy your field," and [that colleague] dies or sells [the property] to someone else, [the person who took the vow] is permitted to enter the house or purchase the field from the heir or from the purchaser.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For it is no longer the colleague's house or field (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 216:10).</i> His intent [when establishing the prohibition] was only for the time they belonged to [the original owner].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As emphasized by the fact that he said: "Your house" and "Your field."</i><br>If, by contrast, he said: "I will never enter this house" or "I will never purchase this field," even if [the original owner] dies or sells [the property] to someone else, [the person who took the vow] is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance, the vow was not associated with the owner of the property, but with the property itself. Compare to Chapter 5, Halachot 4-5.</i>
[The following laws apply when a person] asks a colleague: "Lend me your cow," he answers him: "She is not free," and [the first person] takes an oath or a vow,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As an expression of resentment for the owner's refusal (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> saying: "I will never plow my field with it." If he is accustomed to plowing his field himself, he is forbidden to plow [his field with that cow], but any other person is permitted to plow [his field] with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is accustomed to plowing his field himself, we assume that his vow applied only to his own actions.</i> If he is not accustomed to plowing his field himself, both he and everyone else is forbidden to plow [his field] with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is not accustomed to plowing his field himself, we interpret his vow as meaning that he would never have another person plow the field with it.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person takes an oath or a vow that he will marry a woman, purchase a house,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Although the standard published text of <i>Bava Kama</i> 80a mentions purchasing a house or marrying a woman in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the commentaries [nor the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 219:1)] see no reason why the Holy Land is different from other places in this regard.</i> depart with a caravan, or set out to sea, we do not obligate him to marry, make the purchase, or set out immediately. Instead, he may wait until he finds something appropriate for himself.<br>An incident occurred concerning a woman who took a vow that she would marry anyone who asked her to marry him. Men who were not appropriate for her jumped at the opportunity. Our Sages ruled that her intent was [to marry] anyone from among those appropriate for her who asked her. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person administers a vow to a colleague or takes an oath telling him to come and take a <i>kor</i> of wheat or two barrels of wine for his son, [the colleague] can release the vow without asking a sage to do so. [He need only] say: "Your intent was only to honor me.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">By giving me a present in public.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 332:20) states that the person who administered the vow need not explicitly agree to this interpretation. Even if he remains silent, we accept it. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 332:46 states that if the person specifically says that he administered the vow so that he would receive honor by having the other person receive a gift from him, his word is accepted and a sage must be approached to have the vow released.</i> It is a greater token of respect for me not to take [the gift].<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For people seeing that I demur will respect me more.</i> I already received the honor that you desired to give me through your vow."<br>Similarly, if one took an oath or a vow: "You may not derive any benefit from me until you give my son a <i>kor</i> of wheat and two barrels of wine, he can release the vow without asking a sage to do so. [He need only] say: "It is as if I received them and they reached my hand." Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.

Chapter 9

With regard to vows, we follow the intent of the words people use at that place, in that language, and at that time when the vow or oath was taken.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's rationale is that since everything depends on the person's intent, it is logical to assume that the meaning of his statements follows the usage common at that time and place. See also Halachah 13.<br>One might ask: If so, why in the halachot that follow does the Rambam set out guidelines with regard to vows. The Radbaz (in his gloss to Halachah 13) explains that these guidelines should be followed only in places where there is no clarity regarding the expressions commonly used.</i><br>What is implied? A person took a vow or an oath not [to partake of] cooked food. If it was customary in that place in that language and at that time to call roasted meat and boiled meat<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., boiled without spices (Rav Avraham MinHaHar).</i> also cooked food, he is forbidden to partake of all types of cooked food. If they were accustomed to use the term cooked food only to refer to meat cooked with water and spices, he is permitted [to partake of] roasted meat or boiled meat. Similarly, with regard to smoked food or food cooked in the hot springs of Tiberias. We follow the terminology used by the people of that city.
[The following rules apply if a person] took a vow or an oath not to partake of salted foods. If it is customary to call all salted foods "salted food," he is forbidden to partake of all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam's ruling runs contrary to the statements of the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 6:2), the Rambam relies on the principle that the determinant factor in values is the meaning attached to the terms used by people at that time and in that place. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 217:3) follows the Rambam's approach.</i> If it is customary to use the term "salted food" to refer only to salted fish, he is only forbidden to partake of salted fish.
[The following rules apply if a person] took a vow or an oath not to partake of pickled foods. If it is customary to call all pickled foods "pickled food," he is forbidden to partake of all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam's ruling runs contrary to the statements of the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 6:2), the Rambam relies on the principle that the determinant factor in values is the meaning attached to the terms used by people at that time and in that place.

Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
If some of the people would refer to food with one term and others would not use that term, we do not follow [the practice of] the majority. Instead, it is considered an unresolved question with regard to his vow. And whenever there is an unresolved question with regard to a vow, we rule stringently.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since there is a possibility that a prohibition is involved, we must rule stringently.</i> If one violates the vow, however, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For corporal punishment is inflicted only when we are certain that a prohibition has been violated.</i>
What is implied? A person takes a vow [not to partake] of oil in a place where both olive oil and sesame seed oil are used. When most people from that place use the term "oil" without any modifier, they mean olive oil. When they refer to sesame seed oil, they call it "sesame seed oil." A minority of the populace, however, also refer to sesame seed oil with the term "oil" without a modifier. [Hence,] he is forbidden to partake of both of them, but is not liable for lashes for [partaking of] sesame seed oil. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
Whenever an agent in a given locale would have to question [the principal if that was his intent], it is considered in the category of the substance that was mentioned to the agent when [the term is mentioned] without a modifier.<br>What is implied?

In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 5:7), he uses the same Arabic term to define the two species but explains that the latter is more commonly grown in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i><br>If a person takes a vow [not to partake of] cabbage, he is forbidden to partake of the water cooked with cabbage, for the water in which food is cooked is considered as the food itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For through the cooking process, it takes on the flavor of the food (see <i>Berachot</i> 39a; <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 8:4). In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 5:8), the Rambam maintains that this is the meaning of the first clause of that mishnah. Rashi and others, while accepting this principle, interpret that clause differently.</i> If, however, he vowed not to partake of the water in which a food is cooked, he may partake of the cooked food itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For there is obviously a difference between the food and the liquid in which it was cooked.</i><br>A person who takes a vow [not to partake of] sauce is permitted [to partake of] the spices.

The first term refers to those mushrooms which grow on the earth and the second, to those which grow in trees. The rationale is that, as the Rambam states, these fungi do not have roots. Thus they do not derive their nurture from the earth, but from the atmosphere (see <i>Nedarim</i> 55b; <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 7:4).</i> If he says: "Everything that grows upon the earth is [forbidden] to me," he is forbidden to partake of even fungi and mushrooms. [The rationale is that] although they do not derive their nurture from the earth, they grow upon the earth.
When a person takes a vow forbidding himself from partaking of the produce of a particular year, he is forbidden to partake of all the produce of that year. He is, however, permitted to partake of kid-goats, lambs, milk, eggs, and, chicks.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word <i>peirot</i> can also be interpreted as: "benefit accruing from."

In all of the above - and in analogous instances - follow this general principle: With regard to vows, we follow the intent of the words people use at that place, in that language, and at that time when the vow or oath was taken.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 1. The Radbaz explains that the only reason the Rambam mentioned all the principles in the above and following halachot is to clarify the guidelines set forth by our Sages.

When a person takes a vow [not to benefit] from the water that flows from this-and-this spring, he is forbidden [to benefit] from all the rivers that derive nurture from it. Needless to say, this refers to those that flow directly from it. Although the name [of the body of water] has changed and it is now called "the So-and-So River" or "the So-and-So well," and we do not associate it at all with the name of the spring concerning which a vow was taken, since it is the source for these bodies of water, he is forbidden to benefit from all of them. If, however, a person takes a vow [not to benefit] from this-and-this river or spring, he is only forbidden [to benefit] from those rivers called by that name.

When a person takes a vow not [to benefit] from uncircumcised individuals, he is forbidden [to benefit] from circumcised gentiles,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This includes both gentiles who circumcise themselves for health reasons and those - like the Arabs - who circumcise themselves for religious reasons.

If he takes a vow not [to benefit] from circumcised individuals, he is forbidden [to benefit] from uncircumcised Jews, but is permitted [to benefit] from circumcised gentiles.<br>[The rationale is that] the foreskin is identified with the gentiles, as [Jeremiah 9:25] states: "For all the gentiles are uncircumcised.

Chapter 10

When a person takes a vow or an oath, saying: "I will not taste [food] today," he is forbidden only until nightfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For that is the end of the day in halachic terms.</i> [If he said]: "I will not taste food for one day," he is forbidden [to eat] for a twenty-four hour period after taking his vow. Accordingly, even though he is permitted [to eat] after nightfall, one who takes a vow "not to taste [food] today" should not eat after nightfall until he asks a sage [to retract his vow]. [This is] a decree lest he take an oath another time not to eat for an entire day and eat after nightfall. For people at large do not know the difference between these two situations.
When one takes a vow, saying: "I will not taste [food] a day," there is an unresolved question.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 60a discusses this issue without reaching a conclusion.</i> [Hence] he is forbidden to [eat] for an entire day, as if he had said "for one day." If he eats after nightfall, he does not receive lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for lashes are not given when there is a doubt.</i><br>When one takes a vow, saying: "I will not taste [food] during this week,"<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam uses the Hebrew term <i>Shabbat</i>, which literally means "Sabbath." Nevertheless, his intent (and that of his source, <i>Nedarim</i> 60a) is obviously a week and not the holy day itself.<br>When stating this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 220:3) uses the term <i>shavua</i> for "week," rather than <i>Shabbat</i>. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 220:2 states that the <i>Shulchan Aruch's</i> ruling applies when the person taking the vow speaks in <i>lashon hakodesh</i>, "the holy tongue." If, however, he would speak in Yiddish and say <i>di voch</i>, "this week," the Sabbath is not included, because the term <i>voch</i> implies ordinary, weekdays that are different in nature than the holy Sabbath.</i> he is forbidden to eat during the remainder of the week and on the Sabbath, but he is permitted on Sunday.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Even if a week has not passed since the vow was taken. The Radbaz states that the vow takes effect only when it is made during the week.

For if a person takes a vow that he will not eat at all for an entire week, the vow does not take effect, for it is impossible that he will fulfill it. See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 1:7.</i> for one week," he is forbidden to eat [that type of food] for seven full days. If he says "[I will not eat a type of food] a week," there is an unresolved question. [Hence] he is forbidden to [eat that type of food] for seven full days.

[When one takes a vow, saying:] "I will not drink [wine] during this month," he is forbidden in the remaining days of the month. He is, however, permitted on the day of the following <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> even if the month is lacking.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A month which is lacking is a month of 29 days [as opposed to a month of 30 days; see <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i>, chs. 1-3, which discusses the principles determining when a month is given only 29 days and when it is given 30].<br>The commentaries question why the Rambam (based on <i>Nedarim</i> 60b) speaks of the month being lacking. Seemingly, it is quite obvious that if there are only 29 days in a month, one would be permitted on Rosh Chodesh in the next month. The new month has already begun. A point that has to be made is that even if there are 30 days in a month, one is permitted to partake of wine on the thirtieth day. Since it is Rosh Chodesh of the coming month, the vow has concluded even though the date is the thirtieth of the previous month.<br>The Radbaz explains that this in fact is the Rambam's intent, even though his wording is somewhat difficult to explain in that manner. This interpretation is reflected in the wording of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 220:4). The <i>Or Sameach</i> offers a different interpretation, stating that when a month has only 29 days, sometimes the conjunction of the sun and the moon does not take place until the first day of the new month. Even so, since it is already Rosh Chodesh, the vow is concluded.</i> [If he took a vow, saying]: "I will not drink [wine] for an entire month," he is forbidden for 30 full days. [If he said]: I will not drink [wine] for a month," he is forbidden for 30 full days because of the unresolved question.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous halachah.</i>

When a person forbids himself from benefiting from a substance until Pesach, whether he said "until before Pesach" or "until Pesach," he is only forbidden until the holiday commences. If he says: "while it is Pesach,"<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">We have translated the expression to fit the meaning given it by the Rambam.</i> he is forbidden until Pesach concludes. If he said: "until the wheat harvest" or "until the grape harvest," or "while it is the grape harvest" or "while it is the wheat harvest," he is forbidden only until that time arrives.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this ruling is explained in the following halachah.</i>
This is the general principle: Whenever there is a fixed time<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Like Pesach which lasts for seven days (eight in the Diaspora) as prescribed by the Torah.</i> for a subject mentioned in a vow, he is forbidden only until that time comes. If he words [his vow] "as long as it is," he is forbidden until that time concludes. Whenever a subject does not have a fixed time - like the time of the wheat harvest or the grape harvest<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">There is no fixed time for the harvest's conclusion, for that depends on how plentiful it will be.</i> - whether he said "until" or "while it is," he is forbidden only until that time arrives.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For we do not assume that he took a vow of undetermined length.</i>

[If he vowed] until the <i>katzir</i>, [he is forbidden] until people will harvest wheat, but not barley.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The wheat harvest is several weeks after the barley harvest. Since wheat is the more important crop, it is given prominence (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>If he explicitly said: "...until the <i>kayitz</i> passes," he is forbidden until the majority of the people fold up the mats they have set aside to dry figs and grapes to produce dried figs and raisins.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The figs and grapes would be laid out upon the mats to dry in the sun.</i> Everything depends on the local practice in the place where the person took his vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains in the following halachah.</i>
What is implied? If he took a vow in a valley and forbid himself [from benefiting] from a substance until the <i>kayitz</i> and then moved to a mountainous region,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">A mountainous region is cooler in the summer than a valley and the figs there will ripen later.</i> he should not pay attention to the time whether or not the fig harvest has begun in the place where he is at present. Instead, [he is concerned] with when it begins in the place where he took the vow and that is what he follows.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For that was his intent when he took the vow. It does not matter if this leads to a more lenient ruling or a more stringent one [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 220:13).</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., if he took a vow until the <i>katzir</i> in a place where the primary crop is barley, he is forbidden until the beginning of the barley harvest (<i>ibid.</i>:14).</i>
When a person forbids himself [from benefiting] from a substance until "the rains," he is forbidden until the rainy season which in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> [begins] on Rosh Chodesh Kislev.

If, however, it rained from the seventeenth of MarCheshvan, he is released.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The seventeenth of MarCheshvan begins the first phase of the rainy season. Although it is really an extension of the summer and not the beginning of the winter (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Pe'ah</i> 7:5), rain at that time is not considered a chance occurrence and the vow is released. See <i>Hilchot Ta'aniot</i> 3:1-2 and <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim</i> 1:11 which also discuss these times for rain.</i><br>If he said: "...Until it rains," he is forbidden until it rains, provided it rains from the second phase of the preliminary rainy season.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam interprets the term <i>reviah</i> as referring to the time when rain descends, explaining that it is similar to the term used for impregnating a woman, because in both cases, the potential for life is granted.</i> In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and in the places close to it, this is from the twenty-third of MarCheshvan onward.

When a person has his wife bound by a vow in MarCheshvan, telling her: "You may not benefit from me from now until Pesach if you go to your father's house from now until Sukkot," she is forbidden to benefit from him immediately.

[This applies] even though he made the vow dependent on a time that has already passed. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.

Chapter 11

[The following rules apply with regard to] a male minor who is twelve years and one day old<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained by the commentaries, in this context, we follow the principle: "A portion of a day is considered as an entire day." Thus, directly after his twelfth birthday, as soon as a male child enters into his thirteenth year of life, these laws apply to him. Similar concepts apply with regard to a female minor.</i> and a female minor who is eleven years and one day old who took an oath or a vow, whether a vow forbidding something to them or a vow consecrating an article. We investigate them and ask them [questions]. If they know for Whose sake they took the vow<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For a vow must be taken for God's sake, as Numbers 30:3 states: "When a man will take a vow to God."</i> or for Whose sake they consecrated [the article] or took the oath, their vows and their consecration are binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is a unique concept that <i>Niddah</i> 45b derives from the exegesis of Leviticus 27:2. Although throughout Jewish law, until a male attains the age of thirteen and a female, the age of twelve, their actions are of no consequence according to Scriptural Law, an exception is made in this instance because of the above verse, as stated in Halachah 4.</i> If they do not know, their vows and their statements are of no consequence.<br>It is necessary to make an investigation throughout the entire twelfth year of a female minor and the entire thirteenth year of a male minor.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the following halachah.</i>
What is implied? A minor took a vow or consecrated [property] at the beginning of the year, they were questioned, it was discovered that they knew [for Whose sake the vow was taken], and the vow was maintained. If they took another vow, even at the end of this year, they must be questioned again [for the vow] to be maintained. We do not say: "Since they were knowledgeable at the beginning of the year, they no longer have to be questioned. Instead, we question them throughout the entire year.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's ruling, noting that <i>Niddah, loc. cit.</i>, the source for this halachah, does not lead to such a conclusion. He suggests that perhaps the Rambam had a different version of that text. <i>Yayin Malchut</i> states that this resolution is reflected in the revised version of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Niddah</i> 5:6). In his initial explanation of the mishnah, he appeared to follow the same text as the popular version of the Talmud, but later in life, he revised that interpretation, accepting a different version of the text. The Rambam's rationale is that since we are speaking about a minor, it is possible that his level of understanding will fluctuate.</i>
Before this time, even when they say: "We know for Whose sake we took the vow or for Whose sake we consecrated it," their vows and their consecration are of no consequence. After this time [passes] and a male is thirteen years and one day and a female is twelve years and one day,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., their thirteenth and twelfth birthdays arrive as stated in note 1.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Niddah</i> 5:6), the Rambam writes that the Torah made the age for which women become responsible for their vows less than the age men become responsible, generally, a woman's lifetime is less than that of a man.</i> even though they say: "We do not know for Whose sake we took the vow or for Whose sake we consecrated it,"<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If they manifested signs that they are mentally or emotionally incapable, this law does not apply. If, however, they are merely somewhat slow and do not understand the concept of vows, their vows are of consequence, because they have already reached the age when one becomes responsible for his or her actions.</i> their vows and their consecration are binding even if they did not manifest physical signs of maturity.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., two pubic hairs as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:1.</i> This is the time when vows [take effect] which is mentioned in all sources.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">There are others who maintain that the expression "the time when vows [take effect]" refers to a minor who understands the meaning of his vows as stated in Halachah 1. The Rambam prefers his interpretation, because it is dependent on <i>time</i>, the child's age, while the first interpretation is dependent on the child's knowledge (<i>Yayim Malchut</i>).</i>
Since they reached the age of majority, their vows are binding even if they did not manifest physical signs of majority and [thus] are not considered as adults with regard to all matters. This concept is of Scriptural origin:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is the subject of debate among the <i>Rishonim</i>, for some do not accept the Rambam's view.</i> that when a person close to the age of adulthood utters a vow, his consecration [of articles] and his vows are binding. Nevertheless, although the vows of these individuals are binding, if they desecrate their vows or take oaths and substitute for them, they are not punishable by lashes until they reach the age of majority and manifest signs of physical maturity.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For until the latter age, they are still minors, and minors are not liable for punishment for transgressions that they perform.</i>
If [such a minor] consecrated an article and an adult came and benefited from the article that he consecrated, [the adult] is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For violating the prohibition against benefiting from consecrated property (<i>Hilchot Meilah</i> 1:3).</i> For [the minor's] vows are valid according to Scriptural Law, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous halachah. Since the child's consecration is valid, the article has the status of a consecrated article according to Scriptural Law and a person who misappropriates it is liable.</i>
When does the above statement - that the vows taken by a female twelve years and one day old are binding - apply? When she is neither in her father's domain<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., her father died. Alternatively, she was married as a minor and then she was divorced or widowed (see Halachah 25). Otherwise, she remains in his domain until the age of twelve and a half, as stated in the following halachah.</i> or her husband's domain. If, however, she is in her father's domain, even if she comes of age and she is a maiden,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from the age of twelve until the age of twelve and a half.</i> her father may nullify<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13, Halachah 2, which describes how the father nullifies his daughter's vow.</i> all<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:1) states, this applies even to vows taken dependent on the consent of others which cannot be repealed by a sage.</i> of the vows and oaths she takes on the day he hears of them, as [Numbers 30:6] states: "All of her vows and prohibitions<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>HaEmek HaShaalah</i> interprets this term as referring to oaths.</i>... [shall not stand...] because her father withheld her."
Until when may her father nullify [her vows]? Until she fully comes of age.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., reaches the age of twelve and a half after manifesting physical signs of maturity (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:2).</i> Once she fully comes of age, he may not nullify her [vows].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 30:17 gives him this privilege "during her maidenhood," i.e., and not beyond that time period (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Instead, all of her vows and oaths are like those of a widow or a divorcee, as [implied by Numbers 30:10]: "Everything that she forbade upon her soul [shall remain upon her]."
When may a husband nullify his wife's vows and oaths? From the time she enters the <i>chupah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e, from the beginning of the second sage of the marriage relationship known as <i>nissuin</i>. At that time, he takes her into a private room and from that time onward, the couple live as man and wife (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:1). During the first stage of the marriage relationship (<i>erusin</i>), when the <i>erus</i> has merely consecrated his wife, he does not have the right to nullify her vows alone (see Halachah 9). (In the present era, it is customary to perform both these stages of marriage directly after each other.)</i> He may continue to nullify her vows forever until he divorces her, with the bill of divorce reaching her hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is that if he sends the bill of divorce to her via an agent, he may nullify her vows until the bill of divorce enters her possession (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 234:6, <i>Turei Zahav</i> 234:1).</i><br>If there was an unresolved doubt concerning her divorce,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he had a bill of divorce given to her and our Rabbis could not resolve if the manner in which the bill of divorce was given or written is effective. See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 5:13 for an example.<br>The rationale for this law is that our Sages understood that the reason the Torah gave a husband the right to nullify his wife's vows was so that she would not become unattractive to him (<i>Yevamot</i> 90b). In this instance, he is not concerned that she becomes unattractive (Radbaz).</i> he should not nullify her vows. If he gives her a bill of divorce conditionally<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 8:1.</i> or one that takes effect at a later time,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">He tells her: "Here is your bill of divorce, but it does not take effect for 30 days" (<i>ibid.</i> 9:1).</i> he should not nullify [her vows] in the interim.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the days before the vow takes effect. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 234:8 states that even after the fact, the nullification does not take effect.</i> Similarly, [when a woman] has heard that her husband died and remarried, but [in truth] her husband was alive<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 10:5 which describes this situation at length.</i> or other similar situations [prevail],<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., a woman who went through a divorce and then remarried, but then it was discovered that her divorce was invalid (<i>ibid.</i>:7). In both this and the previous instance, both husbands are required to divorce the woman.</i> neither her first husband, nor her second husband should nullify her vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this and the previous laws is that our Sages understood that the reason the Torah gave a husband the right to nullify his wife's vows was so that she would not become unattractive to him. In this instance, since he is obligated to divorce her, it is desirable that she become unattractive to him (<i>Yevamot, loc. cit.</i>).</i> If she was forbidden [to her husband] by a negative commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a negative commandment that is not punishable by execution, death at the hand of heaven, or <i>karet</i>. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:7.</i> and needless to say, if she is forbidden only by a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., marriages like that of a non-virgin to a High Priest, which are not prohibited by a negative commandment.

When a maiden<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a girl between the ages of twelve and twelve and a half.</i> has been consecrated, her vows may be nullified only by her father and the <i>erus</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>erus</i> means "the man who consecrated her." The Rambam does not use this term, but instead, the term <i>baal</i> meaning "husband."

In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 9:9), the Rambam writes that from the Biblical text, it might appear that both the father and the <i>erus</i> have the right to nullify her vows independently. Hence, it is necessary to clarify that this is not so.</i> If one nullified [a vow] alone, it is not nullified. If her <i>erus</i> nullified [the vow] alone and she violated the vow before her father nullified it, she is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 68a states that since one of the two has already nullified the vow, it is weak and its violation is not punishable by lashes.</i>
If (the <i>erus</i>) dies, she returns to her father's domain.

[The following rules apply when] a consecrated maiden takes a vow, her father heard her vow, but not her <i>erus</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For if her first <i>erus</i> heard her vow and did not nullify it, her father can no longer nullify it together with her second <i>erus</i>.

For if not, the woman's last <i>erus</i> will not have the right to nullify the vow, as indicated by Chapter 12, Halachah 17.</i> Even if [she was divorced and consecrated] 100 times [that day], her father and her last <i>erus</i> may nullify the vows she took before her first <i>erus</i>. [The rationale is that] she never departed into her own domain for one moment,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the laws applying to a married woman, as stated in the following halachah.</i> for throughout the entire time, she is in her father's domain, for she is still a maiden.
When, by contrast, a married woman took a vow and her husband did not nullify it, he divorced her that day, and remarried her that day, he cannot nullify her vows,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Nor may her father nullify her vows, for once she marries, her father no longer has the right to nullify her vows.</i> for she departed into her independent domain after she took her vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Once a woman becomes independent for even one moment, her future husband cannot nullify the vows she took previously.</i> Although she took her vow in his domain and she is now in his domain, since she departed into her own domain in the interim, her vows are binding.
[The following rule applies when] a consecrated maiden took a vow that was not heard by either her father or her <i>erus</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, either her <i>erus</i> or her father heard her vow when it was taken, it cannot be nullified at a later date.</i> she was divorced, and then consecrated to someone else.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Since she remains partially in her father's domain, the divorce does not effect the right of her father and her present <i>erus</i> to nullify her vows.</i> Even several days after [she took the vow], when her father and her last <i>erus</i> hear about the vow that she took while consecrated to her first <i>erus</i>, they may nullify it, since her first <i>erus</i> did not hear it.
[The following rule applies when] a consecrated maiden took a vow, her father alone heard it and nullified it, but the man to whom she was consecrated died before hearing it. If she was consecrated to another man - or to 100 other men - that day<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The consecration and the nullification of the vow must take place on the day that the father heard of the vow and nullified it (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 234:22).</i> her father and her last <i>erus</i> may nullify her vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since her first <i>erus</i> did not hear of her vow, the fact that he died before nullifying it does not deprive her last <i>erus</i> of that right. The father cannot nullify her vow alone, because it was taken when she was consecrated. Since her father nullified the vow, the right of her <i>erus</i> to nullify the vow is weak and of little substance. Accordingly, the right to nullify it cannot be transferred to the father alone, as in Halachah 16.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:16) quotes the Rambam's view, but also that of the <i>Tur</i> which maintains that the second <i>erus</i> can never nullify a vow together with the father.</i>
[The following rule applies when] the <i>erus</i> heard [her vow], nullified it and died and afterwards,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after the death of her <i>erus</i>.</i> her father heard and she was consecrated to another person that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">But not on the following day. The Radbaz explains that this is speaking about a situation when the father heard of the vow on the same day as her first <i>erus</i>, for the nullification must be completed on the same day that he heard of the vow. If, however, her father does not hear about it until the following day and she was consecrated then, he and her new <i>erus</i> may nullify her vow then.</i> Her father and the second <i>erus</i> may nullify her vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 234:13 maintains that the Rambam would also give her father the right to nullify the vow alone, because her first <i>erus</i> also heard the vow and did not maintain it (see the following halachah). The Rambam mentions her being consecrated by another person only to teach that if, this is indeed the situation, the second <i>erus</i> must also nullify the vow.</i>
If her father heard [that she took a vow], but the <i>erus</i> did not and the <i>erus</i> died that day or the <i>erus</i> also heard [about her vow] and nullified it or remained silent<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Since he did not maintain the vow and died before the day was completed, we say that there was a possibility that he would nullify it.

In his gloss to Halachah 19, the Radbaz explains the apparent contradiction between these two halachot by stating that this halachah refers to an instance where the father did not nullify the vow before the <i>erus</i> died. Accordingly, the right of the <i>erus</i> to nullify the vow is not weakened. Hence it can be transferred to the father. Halachah 19 refers to a situation where the father nullified the vow and weakens it, as explained above.</i><br>If the <i>erus</i> heard [about her vow] and maintained it and died that day, or remained silent and died the following day,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since he did not nullify it on the day that he heard it, he cannot nullify again.

If the <i>erus</i>, divorced her after hearing [of her vow], there is an unresolved question whether the divorce is considered as silence and her father may nullify her vow together with a second <i>erus</i> who consecrates her that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., combining Halachah 15 which states that the father and the second <i>erus</i> can nullify the vow and Halachah 16 which states that silence is equivalent to nullification.

When the father heard the vow and nullified it and then died and then the <i>erus</i> heard [of the vow] or even if the <i>erus</i> heard of the vow before the death of the father,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">But did not nullify it then.</i> she is not transferred [entirely] to the domain of her <i>erus</i>.

If the <i>erus</i> heard [the vow], nullified it, and died and then the father heard or the father heard and nullified it and the <i>erus</i> died before he heard it, the father cannot nullify these vows that were in the jurisdiction of the first <i>erus</i> except together with a second <i>erus</i> to whom she is consecrated that day,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he nullifies on a later date it is unacceptable, for the father must nullify the vow on the day he became aware of it.</i> as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 15. In his gloss to this halachah, the Radbaz explains the apparent contradiction between this halachah and Halachah 16 by stating that Halachah 16 refers to an instance where the father did not nullify the vow before the <i>erus</i> died. Accordingly, the right of the <i>erus</i> to nullify the vow is not weakened. Hence it can be transferred to the father. This halachah refers to a situation where the father nullified the vow and weakens it. Hence it cannot be transferred as explained in the notes to Halachah 15. This understanding is reflected in the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:16).</i>
If a woman took a vow, her father nullified it alone, and her husband did not hear [of the vow] until he brought her into his domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., completed the second stage of the marriage, <i>nissuin</i>.</i> he cannot nullify [her vow].

Chapter 12

A father [has the right to] nullify any<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he may nullify all vows, not merely those that a husband may nullify.<br>Rabbenu Asher and other <i>Rishonim</i> differ and maintain that the <i>Sifri</i> states that the father's rights are the same as the husband's.

What is the difference between [the laws governing] vows that involve personal aggravation and those that affect the marriage relationship. With regard to vows that involve personal aggravation, his nullification has bearing for himself and for others.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if he divorces her, the vow is nullified.</i> With regard to those involving the marriage relationship, his nullification has bearing for himself but not for others.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The nullification applies only when they are married.</i>
What is implied? She took a vow not to eat meat. He may nullify it and she will be permitted to eat meat if she is married to any other person forever.

If, however, he dies or divorces her, she is forbidden to engage in intimacy with all other men. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
Whether the aggravation is of a minor nature or a major nature, for a short time or for a long time, the husband has the right to nullify all [such] vows.

When, however, she is not able to partake of the unpleasant food, she has no similar alternative.<br>Alternatively, Rabbenu Asher explains that she is hungry and will be satisfied by eating one loaf.

When a woman takes a vow not to eat figs from her native country, [her husband] may nullify her vow, because this is a matter that affects the marriage relationship.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is not a matter of aggravation, because she may eat figs.

When a consecrated maiden took a vow and her father heard of it and nullified it and after several days her <i>erus</i> heard of it and nullified it on the day he heard of it, it is not nullified, as [implied by <i>ibid.</i>:6-8]: "If her father prevented her on the day that he heard of it.... If she was married to a man with vows incumbent upon her.... If her husband heard of it. On the day, he heard of it...." From this we infer: Since her father nullified it and her <i>erus</i> heard of it, he must nullify it on the day the father heard of it. Similarly, if her <i>erus</i> heard [of the vow] and nullified it and after several days, the father heard of it and nullified it on the day he heard of it, it is not nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to the Rambam, regardless of who hears about the vow and nullifies it first, the father and the husband must both nullify it on the same day.

As long as each one nullifies it on the day he hears of it, it is nullified. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 234:13 quotes the opinion of the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> who rules that we should be stringent and follow the Rambam's decision.</i><br>How do we know that the verse is speaking about a consecrated maiden? Because further on, the passage [<i>ibid.</i>:11-12] states: "If she vows in her husband's home...<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this obviously applies after <i>nissuin</i>, when the woman is living in her husband's home.</i> her husband heard her and remained silent." We can infer that the husband spoken about previously is an <i>erus</i>., as we explained.
When a father or a husband hears of a vow and remains silent in order to cause the woman aggravation,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he intended to nullify her vow afterwards, but desired that she think that the vow is binding so that she will take the matter more seriously.</i> if the day passes without him nullifying or revoking [her vows], they are binding even if he did not have the intent of accepting them.<br>If she took a vow and her father or her husband nullified it, but without knowing of the nullification, she willfully violated her vow or oath, she is not liable.

Concerning this, [<i>ibid.</i>:6] states: "God will forgive her, although her father prevented her."

If a father or a husband heard of [a woman's] vow, but remained silent, because he did not know that a father or a husband has a right to nullify her vows or he knew that he had a right to nullify her vow, but did not know that such a vow required nullification, when he learns of this, he may nullify [the vow]. The time when he gains this knowledge is equivalent to the time of the vow or the time he heard of it and he may nullify it for that entire day.
[When a nullification is made in error,] one must return and nullify it again. [For example,] his wife took a vow and he thought that she was his daughter, and he nullified it with the intent that she was his daughter. She took a nazirite vow and he thought that she had vowed [to offer] a sacrifice and he nullified it with the intent that she had vowed [to offer] a sacrifice. She forbade herself to partake of figs and he thought she said grapes and nullified with the intent that she had forbade grapes. [In all such instances,] he must nullify the vow again when he learns of the vow and the identity of the woman taking the vow for the sake of this woman and this vow. [This can be inferred from <i>ibid.</i>:5]: "Her father did not prevent her"; [this indicates that he must have in mind] the woman taking the vow herself. "And her father heard her vow,"<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, the <i>Sifri</i> derives the same concept from a different verse.</i> i.e., until he knows the vow that she took.

He says: "It is nullified," "It is void," "This vow is of no consequence,"<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:37) mentions the Rambam's view, it also mentions that of Rabbenu Asher who maintains that this last phrase is not effective in nullifying a vow.</i> or uses other terms that imply that the vow is nullified from the outset, whether in the woman's presence or in her absence.<br>If, however, he tells her: "I cannot bear your taking a vow" or "This is not a vow," he did not nullify it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For his wording does not imply that the vow is nullified.</i> Similarly, if he tells his wife or his daughter: "[Your vow] is forgiven," "[It] is released," "[It] is absolved," or the like, his statements are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although these expressions are effective for a sage when absolving a vow, they are not effective for a husband or a father.</i> For a father and a husband do not release a vow like a sage does, but instead, uproot the vow from the outset and nullify it.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 13:8), the Rambam explains the statements he makes here. The term "nullify" implies nullifying an entity to the extent that it is as if it never existed. "Releasing," by contrast, implies that a connection existed, but it was released and will not have any effect in the future.<br>The Rambam's statements have aroused the attention of the commentaries for they appear to run contrary to the understandings of other authorities and the Rambam's own rulings. To explain: From Halachah 15 of this chapter and from Chapter 12, Halachah 19, it appears that until a father or a husband nullifies a vow, the vow is binding. Even when he nullifies it, the nullification affects only the future. See <i>Hilchot Nazirut</i> 9:11. When a sage absolves a vow, by contrast, it is as if the vow was never taken. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 7:8-9, <i>Hilchot Nazirut</i> 3:10.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the terminology employed by the Rambam here can be explained as follows: A sage does not "uproot" a vow, he causes it to be considered as if a vow not taken originally. A father or a husband, by contrast, uproot a vow, causing an entity that did exist to be nullified.</i>
How does one express his acceptance of a vow? He says to her: "I uphold your vow," "It was good that you vowed," "There is no one like you," "Had you not taken the vow, I would have administered it to you," or any analogous statement that implies that he is happy with this vow.
When a person voids the vows of his wife or daughter, it is not necessary for him to say anything<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Rambam is making a distinction between <i>hafarah</i>, "nullification," and <i>bittul</i>, voiding as he proceeds to explain. See also his Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.,</i>, where he elaborates on the distinction between these two activities.</i> and all of the vows are nullified.
What is meant by voiding? That he forces her to do something that she forbade herself to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., if she took a vow not to drink wine, he causes her to drink wine.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, maintaining that there is no concept of voiding a woman's vow by causing her to break it. Such concepts apply only with regard to servants. The Radbaz explains the Rambam's wording, stating that with regard to servants, it is necessary to actually compel them to break their vows. Such conduct is not appropriate with regard to one's wife or daughter. Nevertheless, if a husband or a father gently cause a woman to break their vow, that vow is nullified. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:39) mentions both views though it appears to favor the Ra'avad's view.</i> Nullification, by contrast, does not involve forcing her. Instead, he nullifies the vow verbally and allows her [to do as she desires]. If she desires, she may act [in violation of the vow]. If she desires, she need not.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the vow has been nullified, she is under no obligation to keep it. On the other hand, she is not obligated to perform the act forbidden by the vow..</i>
What is implied? She took a vow or an oath not to eat or not to drink and he told her: "It is nullified for you." It is nullified and she is permitted to eat and to drink. If he took it and gave it to her, saying: "Take this and eat it," "Take this and drink," she may eat and drink and the vow is automatically nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Without him saying anything.</i>
When a person nullifies the vows of his wife or daughter, he must make a verbal statement of nullification. If he nullifies it within his heart, [the vow] is not nullified. When, however, he voids [their vows], he does not have to make a verbal statement. Instead, he nullifies the vow in his heart and compels her to perform [the deed]. Whether she performs it or not, the vow is nullified.
We may nullify vows on the Sabbath, whether for the sake of the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., she took a vow not to wear jewelry or not to partake of a particular food.</i> or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the vow has no connection to the Sabbath and it is forbidden to perform any activity for the weekdays on the Sabbath, we allow him to nullify it. The rationale is that, otherwise, he will not be able to nullify it on Saturday night, because the time for nullification will have already passed. As stated in <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 6:6, on the Sabbath, a sage may absolve only those vows that concern the Sabbath (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> On the Sabbath, however, one should not, however, tell [his wife or daughter]: "[Your vow] is nullified," as one would say during the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is the Sabbath, it is preferable to change the wording one uses. Even if one uses this wording during the week, the vow is nullified, as indicated by Halachah 6.</i> Instead, he should nullify [the vow] in his heart and tell her: "Take this and eat it," "Take this and drink," or the like.
When a person tells his wife or his daughter: "All the vows that you will take from now until I come from this and this place are upheld" or "...are nullified," his words are of no substance.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This concept is also derived from the prooftext cited below. Until a vow comes into existence and can be upheld, it cannot be nullified (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 234:28).</i><br>If he appointed an agent to nullify her vows or to uphold them, his act is of no substance, as [implied by Numbers 30:14]: "Her husband will uphold them, her husband will nullify them." Similarly, her father must act on his own, not through an agent.
[When a woman takes a vow,] forbidding herself to [partake of] figs and grapes, whether through a vow or through an oath, whether she forbade herself from [partaking of] all types of the species or she said: "These figs and these grapes," if [her husband] upheld [the vow] concerning figs and nullified that concerning grapes or upheld [the vow] concerning grapes and nullified that concerning figs, what he upheld is binding and what he nullified is nullified. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. With regard to the nullification of a vow, we do not say that when a portion of a vow has been nullified, the entire vow is nullified, as is said with regard to the absolution of vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 11, Chapter 8, Halachah 6. The rationale is that a sage nullifies the vow from the outset, causing it to be considered as if it were never taken. Therefore the entire vow is considered as a single entity. A husband, by contrast, nullifies a vow as it exists. Hence, each element of the vow can be considered independently.<br>The Rambam's ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:36). The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama differ and maintain that a husband must also nullify the entire vow. Once a portion of a vow is upheld, the vow cannot be nullified.</i>
When a man's wife takes a vow and he hears it and extends the vow to apply to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 3, for an explanation regarding the convention of extending a vow.</i> he cannot nullify it. [The rationale is that] he [already] upheld it.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For by attaching himself to her vow, he shows that he considers it a viable entity.</i> If he took a vow and she extended it and applied it to herself, he may nullify her vow, but his vow is binding.
What is implied? He heard his wife or his daughter say: "I am a nazirite," and said: "And I am also," he cannot nullify [her vow]<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>Nedarim</i> 3a states, the laws that apply to the nullification of other vows also apply to the nullification of nazirite vows.</i> and they are both nazirites.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For the reason mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> If he said: "I am a nazirite," and she heard and said: "And so am I," he may nullify her vow and his vow is still binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For his vow is not at all dependent on hers.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a husband takes a vow and administers an identical vow to his wife, having made a certain decision to administer the vow to her, if she says <i>Amen</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">She must, however, state her consent, for he cannot compel her to take a vow against her will. See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> he may not nullify it. If he took a vow and administered it to her as a question to see what she felt about it, e.g., he asked her "Do you desire to be like me [by taking] this vow or not?" If she says: <i>Amen</i>, he may nullify her vow.
What is implied? He said: "I am a nazirite and so are you," i.e., you are a nazirite just like me. If she says <i>Amen</i>, he may not nullify her vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">He is forbidden to nullify his wife's vow, because by doing so, his own vow would be nullified as stated in the conclusion of the halachah. Since he is forbidden to cause his own vow to be nullified, he is forbidden to nullify her vow (see <i>Nazir</i> 22b).</i><br>If he says: "I am a nazirite. What do you say? Will you be a nazirite like me?" If she says <i>Amen</i>, he may nullify her vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For his commitment is not dependent on hers at all. Even if she refuses to accept a nazirite vow, he is obligated to keep his vow. Hence, his right to nullify her vow is intact.</i> If he nullifies her vow, his vow is also nullified. It is as if he made his vow dependent on her vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first clause. It is as if he made his vow and her vow a single statement. Thus nullifying her vow would cause his vow also to be nullified. This is forbidden, because he is bound to uphold his vow. Nevertheless, after the fact, if he does nullify her vow, his vow is also nullified (Radbaz). See the <i>Nekudot HaKessef</i> [to <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:54)] who explains that the Rambam's version of <i>Nazir</i> 22b follows the Jerusalem Talmud and differs from the standard text of the Babylonian Talmud.</i><br>If she told him: "I am a nazirite.

[The following rules apply when] a woman takes a vow and another person extends the scope of the vow to include himself, saying "And I [as well]." If her father or husband hears of the vow and nullifies it, her vow is nullified, but that of the person who extended the vow is not.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this ruling is that the husband's nullification affects the vow only from the time he made it onward. It does not nullify it from the outset. Hence, any extension of a vow that was made before the vow is nullified is binding [Radbaz; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:51)].</i>
[The following rules apply concerning] a woman who is unmarried and not in her father's domain who says: "Meat will be forbidden to me after 30 days" and she marries within those 30 days. Even though she is in her husband's domain at the time the vow takes effect, he cannot nullify it. [The rationale is that] at the time the vow was taken she was not in his domain. Concerning such a situation, it was said [Numbers 30:10]: "The vow of a widow or a divorcee... shall remain standing." [This applies] even if she was consecrated to [her husband] at the time she took the vow, for a husband may not nullify<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., alone, without the nullification of the father (Chapter 11, Halachah 10).</i> [vows that were taken] before [the marriage is consummated], as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 11, Halachot 20, 22.</i>
[The following rules apply if a woman] took a vow while under her husband's domain that meat will become forbidden to her after 30 days or that she will become a nazirite after 30 days and her husband nullified her vow, but he died or divorced her within those 30 days. Although she will be a divorcee or a widow when the vow will take effect, she is not bound by it, because [her husband] already nullified this vow for her.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., whether or not his nullification takes effect depends on their relationship at the time he nullifies the vow (<i>Nedarim</i> 89a).</i>
When a widow or a divorcee says: "Wine will be forbidden to me when I marry," [if] she marries, her husband cannot nullify the vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Because he cannot nullify the vows that were taken before marriage, as explained above.</i> [If a married woman says]: "I will be forbidden [to eat] meat when I am divorced," her husband may nullify the vow.

When a husband upholds [his wife's vow] in his heart, it has been upheld.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 12, Halachah 18, when a husband remains silent throughout the day, his wife's vow is upheld.

If, however, he voids his wife's vow, her nullification is not binding, as stated in Halachot 4-5.</i> Therefore, if he nullifies it in his heart, he can still retract and uphold it. If, by contrast, he upheld it within his heart, he cannot retract and nullify unless he retracts immediately thereafter.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This term has a specific halachic definition: the time it takes a student to tell his teacher: <i>Shalom Elecha Rabbi</i> (<i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:17).</i> [That leniency is granted] so that his thoughts within his heart should not have greater power than the statements he makes.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since a person can nullify a vow or an oath if he retracts within this time, he may certainly retract his acceptance of his wife's oath in thought.</i>
When a person upholds the vows of his daughter or his wife and then changes his mind, he may appeal to a sage to absolve him of his acceptance [of the vow].<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., just as he can appeal to a sage to absolve him of a vow he took, so, too, he may absolve his acceptance of a vow.</i> He may then recant and nullify it for her that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the day he changed his mind, even if it is several days afterwards, is equivalent to the day he heard of his wife's vow. Since he cannot have his acceptance nullified unless he changes his mind, the days when he does not change his mind are considered equivalent to days when he does not know of the vow [<i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234)].<br>There are other <i>Rishonim</i> who maintain that he can ask the sage to have his acceptance absolved only on the day he heard of the vow. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:49) mentions both views without indicating which one should be favored. The Rama maintains that we should be stringent and follow the second view.</i> If, by contrast, he nullifies it for her and then changes his mind, he cannot appeal to a sage to absolve it so that he can retract and maintain it.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Upholding a vow is considered equivalent to taking a vow. Hence, just as a vow can be absolved, the acceptance of one can be absolved. The nullification of a vow, by contrast, cannot be considered as a vow and cannot be absolved. The Radbaz adds that if the person does not know that he can have his acceptance absolved, the day he finds out that information is equivalent to the day he heard of the vow.</i>
When a consecrated maiden takes a vow and only one of her father or husband upholds her vow, while the other nullifies, even if the one who upheld the vow approaches a sage and has his acceptance absolved, he cannot recant and nullify the vow<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 234:16 states that this applies even if he has the acceptance absolved on the day he hears of the vow.</i> together with the one who has already nullified it.

If a man tells his daughter or his wife: "It is upheld for you. It is upheld for you," [even] if he asks to have the first acceptance absolved, the second one takes effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">At the time he stated his acceptance of the vow a second time, his acceptance was of no consequence, because it was unnecessary. Nevertheless, after he nullifies his first acceptance, the second acceptance becomes significant.</i><br>If he tells her: "It is upheld for you.

It is as if he remained silent and the vow is therefore upheld. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's rationale is that since the nullification cannot take effect after the vow is upheld, it cannot take effect if it is made simultaneously with the upholding of the vow.</i> If he tells her: "It is upheld for you today," it is upheld forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since, as the Rambam states later on, he did not verbally express his nullification of the vow, it remains binding even after the day passes.</i> If he tells her: "It is nullified for you tomorrow," it is not nullified, for he upheld it today and he cannot nullify it on the following day.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For a vow must be nullified on the day, the man heard about it. In his <i>Nekudot HaKessef</i>, the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> explains that the Rambam's wording implies that he may nullify it that day. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 234:39-40, however, infers that he cannot nullify it at all once it takes effect for that day.</i> If he tells her: "It is upheld for you for one hour," and the day passed without him nullifying it, he has upheld it. We do not say that this is like one who said: "It is nullified for you after an hour," because he never verbally expressed its nullification.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The instances cited by the Rambam are questions posed by <i>Nedarim</i> 69b, 70a. Since the Talmud continues asking questions, using one instance as a springboard for another, following the pattern of <i>im timtzeh lomar</i>, the Rambam concludes that each of the instances used as a basis for a further question is accepted as halachah (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>If he told her: "It is upheld for you for one hour," and after an hour, he told her: "It is nullified for you," there is an unresolved question [as to the ruling].<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This is the last of the series of instances concerning which the Talmud asks in that passage.</i> Therefore she is forbidden in [the matters] her vow [concerned].<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Lest her vow in fact be binding.</i> If, however, she violated her vow, she is not punished by lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Because punishment is not given when we are uncertain whether a prohibition exists.</i>
When a person takes vows in order to establish his character traits and correct his conduct, he is considered eager and praiseworthy. What is implied? If a person was a glutton and he [took a vow] forbidding meat for a year or two, a person was obsessed with wine and he [took a vow] forbidding himself from drinking wine for a prolonged period or he forbade himself from ever becoming intoxicated, a person would continually pursue illicit gain and was overexcited about wealth [took a vow] forbidding [accepting] presents or benefit from people in a particular country, similarly, a person who would be proud of his comely appearance and took a nazirite vow,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This requires him to allow his hair to grow untrimmed and thus will prevent him from beautifying his appearance. See <i>Nedarim</i> 9b which relates that Rabbi Shimon ben Shetach would almost never partake of the sacrifices of a nazirite. Once, however, he saw a particularly handsome young man who had taken a nazirite vow. He asked him why he had done so and the young man explained that, because of his good looks, he was being tempted by his evil inclination. To rise above the temptation, he took the nazirite vow. Rabbi Shimon ben Shetach praised him for his actions.</i> or the like - all of these are paths in the service of God and concerning such vows and the like our Sages said:<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 3:13.</i> "Vows are a safeguard for restraint."<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary to that mishnah, the Rambam explains that "taking and maintaining vows to abstain from certain [undesirable] elements [of conduct] ingrains in a person the tendency to bridle the desires he seeks to curb. This tendency will continue and it will be easy for him to acquire the quality of restraint - i.e., the tendency to protect oneself from impurity." See also <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i>, Vol. III, the conclusion of ch. 48, which discusses the Divine service associated with taking and maintaining vows.<br>Nevertheless, the Rambam is not praising restraint as a mode of conduct that is always desirable. On the contrary, in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 3:1, he explains that a nazirite is called "a sinner" because he abstains from wine and states:<br>Our Sages directed man to abstain only from those things which the Torah denies him and not to forbid himself permitted things by vows and oaths. Thus our Sages (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Nedarim</i> 9:1) asked rhetorically: "Are not the things which the Torah has prohibited sufficient for you? [Why] must you add further prohibitions?"<br>In the instances mentioned here, however, the person taking the vow is not doing so because he thinks that abstinence is desirable. Instead, he wishes to develop self-control and inner discipline and feels that taking a vow is an effective means to encourage him to do so.</i>
Although [taking vows] is an element of the service of God, a person should not take many vows involving prohibitions and should not habituate himself to taking them.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Lest he not keep the vow, and in this way transgress.</i> Instead, he should abstain from those things from which one should abstain without taking a vow.
Our Sages stated:<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 22a.</i> "Anyone who takes a vow is considered as having built a private altar."<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">During the time the Sanctuary stood at Shilo and from the time the Temple was built in Jerusalem afterwards, it was forbidden to offer sacrifices on private altars. Similarly, taking a vow is considered undesirable and comparable to building such an altar. Rabbenu Nissim explains the comparison based on the passage from <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> cited above, i.e., just as a person who builds a private altar offers a sacrifice to God in an undesirable manner, so, too, a person who takes a vow adds a restriction that the Torah does not require him to observe.</i> If he transgressed and took a vow, it is a mitzvah to ask [a sage] to absolve it,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in ch. 4.</i> so that he will not have an obstacle before him.<br>When does the above apply? With regard to vows involving prohibitions. With regard to vows involving the consecration of articles, it is a mitzvah to uphold them and not to ask for their absolution unless one is [financially] pressed, as [Psalms 116:14] states: "I will fulfill my vows to God."
