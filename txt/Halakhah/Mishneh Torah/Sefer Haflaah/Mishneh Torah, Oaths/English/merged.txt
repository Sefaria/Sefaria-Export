Mishneh Torah, Oaths



Chapter 1

There are four types of oaths [for which one may be liable]: <i>sh'vuat bitui, sh'vuat shav, sh'vuat hapikadon,</i> and <i>sh'vuat ha'edut.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam proceeds to explain these four types of oath in this chapter.</i><br><i>Sh'vuat bitui</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bitui</i> literally means "expression." I.e., this oath is taken expressing statements concerning the past or the future. See Chapters 4 and 5 where this subject is discussed in detail.</i> is referred to in the Torah [by Leviticus 5:4]: "When a soul will take an oath, expressing with his lips, whether he will do harm<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As evident from Chapter 5, Halachot 16-17, this applies when he takes an oath to harm himself, but not to harm others.</i> or do good." [This category] subdivides into four groupings: two<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one positive and one negative. The concept that a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> has both these forms is derived from the prooftext cited which states: "Whether he will do harm or do good." See Chapter 9, Halachah 18.</i> [involving statements made] concerning the future and two [involving statements made] concerning the past. For example, he took an oath concerning a past event that it occurred or did not occur, or concerning a future event, that he will do it or that he will not do it.
[The concept of] a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> applies with regard to deeds that a person could perform<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">But not with regard to something which he cannot perform. As stated in Halachah 7, that is included in the category of an oath taken in vain.</i> whether in the past or in the future.<br>What is implied? With regard to the past: "I ate," "I cast a stone into the sea," or "So-and-so spoke with so-and-so"; "I did not eat," "I did not cast a stone into the sea," or "So-and-so did not speak with so-and-so." With regard to the future: "I will eat" or "I will not eat," "I will..." or "I will not cast a stone into the sea."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">An oath he takes concerning the future that involves another person is not included in this category, because he has no way of controlling that person's conduct. See Chapter 5, Halachot 1-2.</i> Thus there are two groupings<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">One positive and one negative.</i> concerning the past and two groupings concerning the future.
If a person takes an oath concerning one of these four categories and does the opposite, he has taken a false oath. For example, he took an oath not to eat and he ate, that he would eat and he did not eat, that he ate, when he did not or that he did not eat, when he had eaten. With regard to these matters, [Leviticus 19:12] states: "Do not swear falsely in My name."<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 61) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 227) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> If he willfully swears falsely, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is somewhat of a new concept, because one does not receive lashes for violating a transgression that does not involve a deed and ordinarily, speech is not considered a deed. Nevertheless, taking a false oath is an exception to this principle, for Exodus 20:7 states: "God will not absolve anyone who takes His name in vain." <i>Sh'vuot</i> 21a interprets that to mean that a person who takes an oath in vain is liable for lashes. See also Chapter 4, Halachot 20-21 for more factors concerning this concept.</i> If he does so inadvertently, he must bring an adjustable guilt offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to an ordinary sin-offering, the sacrifice a person liable for such an offering must bring is adjusted according to his financial status as stated in Leviticus, ch. 5. See Chapter 3, Halachot 6-7 for details concerning when one is held liable for such a sacrifice and when he is not.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i> 5:4] states: "And it became concealed from him and he did not know and became guilty."
[The prohibition against taking] a <i>sh'vuat shav</i>, an oath taken in vain,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6 where this subject is discussed in detail.</i> also subdivides into four categories: the first, a person took an oath concerning a known matter<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad explains that the term "a known matter" refers to something known to three people. The Radbaz notes that the Rambam mentions this point in Chapter 5, Halachah 22. See Chapter 3, Halachah 5, and notes from which it is evident that here, the person taking the oath is not speaking facetiously. Although it is known that what he is saying is false, he intends that his words be taken at face value. See also Chapter 5, Halachah 21, and notes.</i> that was not true, e.g., he took an oath that a man was a woman, a woman was a man, that a marble pillar was gold, or concerning other similar factors.
The second: that one takes an oath on a known matter concerning which no one has a doubt, e.g., one took an oath that the sky was the sky, that a stone is a stone, on two [objects] that they are two, and the like. Even though there is no doubt about the matter for a person of sound mind, one takes an oath to strengthen [the appreciation of] the matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Thus since no one else but a fool will have any doubt concerning the matter, there is no need to take an oath. Hence, the oath is considered to have been taken in vain (Radbaz).</i>
The third is one who takes an oath to nullify a mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah and the matter is not dependent on his choice or consent, his oath is considered to be in vain. See also Chapter 5, Halachot 14-15.</i> What is implied? One took an oath not to wrap himself in <i>tzitzit</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz clarifies that we are not speaking about taking an oath not to wear a <i>tallit</i>, for a person is not obligated to wear a <i>tallit</i> by Scriptural Law (see <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:11). Instead, the intent is to take an oath that he will wear a four-cornered garment and not put <i>tzitzit</i> on it.</i> not to put on <i>tefilin</i>, not to dwell in a <i>sukkah</i> throughout the holiday of Sukkot,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 18.</i> not to eat matzah on Pesach night, that he would fast on the Sabbaths and the festivals,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For one must take pleasure in food and drink on these days. It is forbidden to fast (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:12; <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 6:17).</i> or concerning other analogous instances.
The fourth - that one took an oath concerning a matter that he is unable to perform.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is unable to perform the matter, the oath he took is obviously in vain.</i> What is implied? He took an oath that he would not sleep for three consecutive days and nights,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 20.</i> he would not eat for seven consecutive days or concerning any analogous matter.<br>Whenever a person takes an oath in vain by taking one of these four types of oaths, he transgresses a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 62) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 30) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Exodus 20:7] states: "And you shall not take the name of God your Lord in vain." If he [takes the oath] willfully, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See the notes to Halachah 3.</i> If he does so inadvertently, he is exempt entirely.
What is meant by a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon,</i> [an oath concerning an entrusted object]?<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The latter is the literal translation of the term <i>pikadon</i>. Nevertheless, as the Rambam continues to explain, the term has a broader halachic meaning in this context. The Radbaz explains that the mishnah uses the term <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, because it is most common that such a claim will be made with regard to an entrusted object. Alternatively, because the prooftext (Leviticus 5:21  mentions an entrusted object first. See Chapters 7 and 8 where this subject is discussed in detail.</i> [It applies] when a person has money belonging to a colleague in his possession - whether it be an entrusted article or a loan, he stole from him, withheld his wages, he found a loss object belonging to him and did not return it, or any similar situation. If his colleague claims the money that he has in his possession and he denies the claim, he violates a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 248) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 225) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Leviticus 19:11] states: "You shall not deny..."; this is a warning [not to] deny a monetary [claim]. One is not liable for lashes for this transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Either because the transgression does not involve a deed, or because financial compensation must be given and a person is not held liable both for financial restitution and lashes (<i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2).</i><br>If one took a false oath with regard to the financial claim that he denied, he transgresses another negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">He also violates the commandment against taking a false oath [<i>Sh'vuot</i> 20b; <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 249)].</i> as [the above verse] continues: "A person may not lie to his colleague."<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 226) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> This is a warning against swearing [falsely] when denying a financial [obligation].
What is a person's liability for taking a false <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>? He must pay the principle that he denied plus an additional fifth<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains in several instances, the intent is one fifth of the new total. For example, if he denied a debt of 20 <i>zuz</i>, he must pay 25 in restitution.</i> and bring a definite<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This term is used to distinguish this offering from the conditional guilt offering brought by a person who is unsure whether or not he committed a sin.</i> guilt offering as a sacrifice. [This applies] whether he [transgressed] intentionally or unintentionally,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, an ordinary sin offering is brought only when one transgresses inadvertently.</i> as indicated by Leviticus 5:21-23 which] states: "And he will deny his [obligation to] a colleague concerning an entrusted object, a [financial] deposit, a robbery... when he will sin and become guilty." [The verse] does not say: "And it will become concealed from him,"<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As Leviticus 5:4 states with regard to a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.</i> indicating that one who transgresses willfully is liable just as [one who transgresses] inadvertently.
The above applies when the person willfully accepted the entrusted object or the money that he was obligated and knew about it at the time of the oath. If, however, he acted unintentionally, forgot that he had the money in his possession, therefore denied it and took an oath, and then discovered the matter, he is considered [to have transgressed because of] factors beyond his control and is not liable at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Neither for a sacrifice, nor for the payment of an additional fifth of the object's value.</i> Similarly, if the person did not know that it was forbidden to take a false oath in denial of a financial claim, he is considered [to have transgressed because of] factors beyond his control and is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that although such an individual is not liable for a sacrifice or the additional fifth, he is liable for transgressing the prohibition against denying property.</i>
If so, what is meant by acting inadvertently with regard to a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>? For example, he forgot that one is liable to bring a sacrifice for [taking such a false oath], but knew that it was forbidden to do so and that he has the other person's money in his possession. This is considered the inadvertent transgression [of this prohibition].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is unaware of the fact that he must bring a sacrifice and thus does not know the full severity of his act, he is considered to have transgressed inadvertently. Nevertheless, because he is conscious of the transgression and the fact that he has the other person's money in his possession, he is not considered to have transgressed due to forces beyond his control.</i> Willful transgression is when he knows that he is liable to bring a sacrifice [because of the transgression].
What is meant by <i>sh'vuat ha'edut</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The term literally means "an oath [associated with] testimony." See Chapters 9 and 10 where this subject is discussed in detail.</i> Witnesses know testimony associated with a monetary claim<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachot 3-5.</i> and the person affected by the testimony demanded that they testify on his behalf. The witnesses deny knowledge of testimony, do not testify, and take an oath<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This oath is not required by the court, but rather is demanded by the person affected by their testimony. See Chapter 9, Halachah 6.</i> that they do not know any testimony concerning him. This is referred to as a <i>sh'vuat ha'edut.</i> For taking a [false] oath of this nature, one is liable for an adjustable guilt offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See the notes to Halachah 3.</i> [This applies] whether he [transgressed] intentionally or unintentionally, as [indicated by Leviticus 5:1 which] states: "When a person will sin: If he heard a demand for an oath and he had witnessed...." [The verse] does not say: "And it will become concealed from him,"<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachot 3-5.</i> indicating that one who transgresses willfully is liable just as [one who transgresses] inadvertently.
What is meant by acting inadvertently with regard to a <i>sh'vuat ha'edut</i>? For example, he forgot that one is liable to bring a sacrifice for [taking such a false oath], but knew that this oath was forbidden and that he would be swearing falsely. Willful transgression is when he knows that he is liable to bring a sacrifice [because of the transgression]. If he did not know that [taking such an oath] is forbidden or forgot the testimony and took an oath<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In translation, we have used the singular for continuity. The Rambam, however, uses plural forms, because testimony brings about a monetary obligation only when given by two witnesses.</i> and later it was discovered that he knew testimony and took a false oath, he is considered [to have transgressed because of] forces beyond his control and he is not liable to bring a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are not considered to have transgressed at all.</i>

Chapter 2

Whether one takes one of these four oaths [falsely] on his own initiative or he is placed under oath by another person and answers <i>Amen</i> to his statements, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The concept that a person is considered to have taken an oath when he responds <i>Amen</i> to the statements is derived from the Torah's statements with regard to a <i>sotah</i>, a woman suspected of adultery (Numbers 5:22 . For she is required to answer <i>Amen</i> to the oath administered to her by the priest and yet, it is considered as if she took the oath herself.</i> [This applies] even if he is placed under oath by a gentile<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Although in most instances, statements made by gentiles are of no significance according to Jewish Law, this is an exception. Here also there is an allusion to this concept in the Torah itself. Ezekiel 17:13 and II Chronicles 36:13 speak of Nebuchadnetzar having King Tzidkayahu take an oath. <i>Nedarim</i> 65a states that this oath was binding. Similarly, <i>Sh'vuot</i> 36a speaks of an oath Moses took to Jethro, his gentile father-in-law (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> or a minor<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived through a comparison to gentiles.</i> and responds <i>Amen</i>.<br>[The rationale is that] anyone who responds <i>Amen</i> or makes a statement equivalent to responding <i>Amen</i>, e.g., he says "Yes," "I am obligated in this oath," "I accept this oath upon myself," or the like in any language<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., not only in <i>lashon hakodesh</i>, the Hebrew used in the Bible and by the Sages.</i> is considered to have taken an oath with regard to all matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 1, Chapter 8, Halachah 7, and Chapter 9, Halachah 1, which mentions instances where a person is considered to have taken an oath even if he does not respond <i>Amen</i>.</i> whether it be liability for lashes<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If he takes a false <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> or takes an oath in vain.</i> or for a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If he takes a false <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> or <i>sh'vuat ha'edut.</i></i>
[The same laws apply whether] one took an oath - or another person administered an oath to him - with God's ineffable name<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the name <i>Yud-Hei-Vav-Hei</i>. See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 2:7 which states that this term also refers to the name <i>Adonai</i>. The same law holds true for any other of God's names.</i> - or with one of the descriptive terms used to refer to Him,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Note, however, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 6:5, which states that even when these descriptions are used to refer to Him, they are not considered to have the same holiness as one of His names.</i> e.g., he took an oath "on He whose name is Gracious," "on He whose name is Merciful," or "on He whose name is Patient," regardless of the language he used.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., not only in <i>lashon hakodesh</i>, the Hebrew used in the Bible and by the Sages.</i> The statement is considered an oath in the full sense of the term.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam uses the expression "in the full sense of the term" to differentiate between this instance and the law mentioned in Halachah 4. Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the Radbaz who explains that there is a difference of opinion among the <i>Rishonim</i> if a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> must contain God's name for one to be liable as appears to be the Rambam's opinion or whether His name need not be mentioned as is the view of the Ramban, Rabbenu Asher, and others. The Ra'avad takes an intermediate view, stating that one transgresses by taking a false oath and is liable to bring a sacrifice, but he is not liable for lashes unless he mentions one of God's names.<br>All authorities agree that God's name must be mentioned for one to be liable with regard to a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> or a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>. On that basis, the Radbaz supports the Rambam's position, asking why a differentiation should be made between one type of oath and another. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 237:1) and commentaries.</i><br>Similarly, a statement with the terms <i>eleh</i> or <i>erur</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Both these terms mean "curse."</i> is considered as an oath,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sh'vuot</i> 36a derives this concept from the verses cited above with regard to Tzidkayahu's oath, for there he used the term "curse." See also I Samuel 14, 24, 27 which indicate that saying that one will be cursed is equivalent to an oath.</i> provided one mentions one of God's names or one of the terms used to describe Him. What is implied? When a person said: "May one who eats this-and-this entity be cursed unto God," or "...cursed unto He whose name is Gracious," "...cursed unto He whose name is Merciful" and then ate that entity, he has taken a false oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">And is liable for taking a false <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, as indicated by Chapter 1, Halachah 3.</i> Similar concepts apply with regard to the other types of oaths.
Similarly, one who says: "[I am taking] an oath by God...," or "...by One whose name is Gracious that I will not eat," and he ate, "...that this is a woman," and it was a man, "...that I do not owe you anything," and he does, "that I do not know any testimony involving you," and he does,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Rambam is giving an example of all four types of oaths.</i> he is liable.
If a person uses the term <i>eleh</i> or <i>erur</i> or an oath and does not mention God's name or a term describing Him, he is bound by a prohibition with regard to the entity concerning which he [desired to] take the oath. He is not, however, liable for lashes or for a sacrifice if he violated his oath unless it included one of God's names<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 6:2 for a list of the seven names of God.</i> or a term describing Him as explained.
Not only the term <i>sh'vuah</i>, but [the use of] any idiom used to refer to an oath is considered as [taking] an oath. For example, people in a given place were inarticulate and would call an oath <i>shabutah</i> or <i>shakukah</i>, or they were Aramites for whom the term for oath in their language is <i>momata</i>, and the inarticulate idiomatically refer to it is <i>mohah</i>. When a person makes a statement whose intent and meaning is that he is taking an oath, he is liable as if he used the term [in <i>Lashon Hakodesh</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For that reason, when called to take an oath in a secular court or the like, one should refuse. Instead of saying "I swear," he should say, "I affirm."</i>
Similarly, when a person says: "No, no," repeating the negative twice as if he is taking an oath or "Yes, yes," and mentions God's name or a term used to describe Him, it is considered an oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The repetition and the mention of God's name indicate that he is not merely making a statement, but intending that it have the severity of an oath. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that since the person mentioned God's name, seemingly, it is not necessary for him to repeat yes or no, the mention of His name alone should be sufficient for his statement to be considered an oath. He explains that we are speaking about an instance when God's name was not mentioned in direct connection with the statement. Nevertheless, the fact that he repeated no, or yes while mentioning God's name, albeit indirectly, is sufficient for his statements to be considered an oath.</i> Similarly, if he says: "[By God's] right hand," it is an oath, or "[By God's] left hand," it is an oath, as [implied by Isaiah 62:5] "God swore by His right hand and by the arm of His strength."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>2Nazir</i> 3a states that "the arm of His strength" refers to His left arm. Otherwise, the verse would be redundant.</i> Similarly, when someone says "<i>Mivtah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sh'vuot</i> 20a notes that Numbers 30:7 understands this term as referring to an oath.</i> that I will not do such-and-such," and mentions God's name or a term used to describe Him, it is considered an oath.
When one says: "It is forbidden for God's [sake]" or "...for [the sake of] He whose name is Gracious that I will do..." or "...that I will not do [such-and-such]," it is considered an oath, because the wording he used has that implication.
If he heard his colleague take an oath and said: "I am like him," he is not liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro states that the Rambam's choice of wording - "He is not liable" rather than "It is permitted" - implies that although he is not liable, he is forbidden to break the commitment he made. Although other <i>Rishonim</i> differ, he follows this interpretation in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 239:9-10). See the following halachah.</i> for he did not utter an oath, nor did his colleague administer an oath to him. This is "appending" to an oath for which one is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This is one of the distinctions between oaths and vows. One who "appends" - i.e., says "And I will be like him" - to a colleague's vow is liable. See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:3-4.</i>
Similarly, if he took an oath and said: "I will not eat this meat," and then said: "This bread is like this meat," he is not liable for the bread, because he did not explicitly take an oath regarding it. Instead, he appended [the prohibition concerning it to his existing oath]. Although he is exempt from lashes and from a sacrifice, he is forbidden to partake of the bread that he appended to his oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that the Rambam elaborates here - in contrast to the previous halachah - for here there is greater reason to think that he will not be obligated. The explanation is based on a fundamental understanding of the difference between a <i>sh'vuah</i> - oath - and a <i>neder</i> - vow. When a person takes an oath, he places a prohibition upon his person - he is forbidden to perform the activity concerning which he took the oath. When he takes a vow, the article becomes forbidden for him. Hence, since he spoke about the article and not himself, one might think that his statement has no effect at all.</i>
[Although] a person has the intent to take an oath and resolves in his heart not to eat on that day or not to drink and has the intent for that activity to be forbidden for him by oath, [if] he does not actually make such a statement, he is permitted [to eat or drink], as [implied by Leviticus 5:4]: "expressing with his lips." [Implied is that] a person who takes an oath is not liable until he explicitly states the matter the oath concerns with his lips.
Similarly, if he resolved within his heart to take an oath and erred and uttered a statement that did not fit the intent in his heart, [the activity] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For as <i>Sh'vuot</i> 26b implies, one's heart and one's lips must be in concord.</i><br>What is implied? A person had the intent that he would not eat in Reuven's [home], but when he actually came to state the oath explicitly, he swore not to eat in [Shimon's] home. [In such a situation,] he is permitted to eat in Reuven's [home] for he did not explicitly [swear not to eat there]. [And he is permitted to eat] in Shimon's [home] for he did not have the intent [to prohibit that].
Similarly, with regard to the other types of oaths, one is not liable until his mouth and his heart are in concord.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In some authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, this sentence is the conclusion of the previous halachah. The present halachah begins: "Therefore..." Compare to Halachot 15-16.</i> Therefore [the following law applies if] a person took an oath in our presence that he would not eat and ate. He was given a warning [before he ate] and he responded: "My intent was that I would not depart today. I had a slip of the tongue and mentioned eating although that was not my intent."<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if he makes this statement when given the warning, we accept his word and do not hold him liable (<i>Tosefta, Taharot</i> 6:9).</i> is not liable for lashes unless, before he eats, he admits in the presence of witnesses that [his intent in] taking the oath was [not] to eat. Alternatively, [he is liable for lashes] if he accepted the warning and did not protest that he erred at the time of the warning. Even though he protested afterwards, we do not pay attention to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 12:2, to be liable for lashes, a transgressor must acknowledge the warning. Since, at that time, he did not mention the lack of concurrence between his intent and his statements, we assume that he is fabricating the matter.</i> Similarly, [he is liable] if they warned him and he said: "I never took an oath - or a vow - concerning this matter." Despite the fact that after they give testimony that he took an oath or vow, he says: "Yes, that is true, but my mouth and heart were not in concord," or "In my heart, I had a stipulation in mind concerning the vow,"<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">And since the stipulation was not met, the vow is not binding.</i> we do not heed him<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For he has already lied concerning this oath.</i> and he is liable for lashes.
Similarly, if [witnesses] told him: "Your wife took a vow," and he said: "My intent was to nullify the vow and I did so,"<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion among the commentaries with regard to the interpretation of the Rambam's statements. Some explain that the intent is that the husband used the halachic convention of <i>hafarah</i> and made the statement nullifying his wife's vow in a hushed tone. If, however, he did not make a statement of <i>hafarah</i> at all, the vow is not nullified, as stated in <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 13:7). The <i>Tzaphnat Paneach</i> states that the intent is that he used the halachic convention of <i>bittul</i>. In such in instance, a statement need not be made (<i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 13:4).</i> we heed his statements. If he is told, "She took a vow," and he denies it, but when he saw them testify against him, he said: "My intent was to nullify [the vow]," his word is not heeded.
If he resolved within his heart not to partake of bread made from wheat, but took an oath not to partake of bread without qualifying his statement, he is forbidden to partake of bread from wheat. For when bread [is mentioned without qualification, the meaning] is bread from wheat.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the person cannot claim that his statement did not reflect his intent.</i>
When a person takes an oath, saying: "[I am taking] an oath that I will not eat today and my oath is dependent on your intent,"<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this law applies even if the person takes the oath on his own volition, not only if it is administered by others.</i> he cannot [later] say: "I had these-and-these thoughts in my heart." [The rationale is] that the person did not take the oath dependent on his own intent, but rather on the intent of others. Since his statements did concur with the intent of those on whose intent he took the oath he is liable. [The intent in] the heart of those individuals takes the place of his own intent. [This concept also applies] with regard to other types of oaths.
Therefore when judges administer an oath to a person,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., require an oath of a person who denies a plaintiff's claim. See Chapter 11, Halachah 18.</i> they tell him: "We are not administering the oath dependent on your intent, but dependent on our intent.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Thus afterwards the person cannot claim that he had these-and-these thoughts in mind when taking the oath (Radbaz). See also <i>Nedarim</i> 25a.</i>
[The following law applies when a person] took an oath and his statements and his intent concurred at the time he took the oath, but after he becomes forbidden [in the particular activity mentioned in the oath], he changes his mind immediately, directly after he spoke. [The latter term has a specific halachic definition]: the time it takes a student to tell his teacher: <i>Shalom Elecha Rabbi</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">"Greetings to you, my teacher." We have cited the term in transliteration for we are speaking about the amount of time it takes to say these three Hebrew words.</i> [If, in this interim, the person says:] "This is not an oath," "I changed my mind," "I retract," or the like, i.e., statements that imply that he seeks to release the prohibition he took on [himself], it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 87a states that this principle applies with the exception of four situations: a blasphemer, one who accepts a false deity, one who consecrates a woman as a wife, and one who divorces her. Rabbenu Nissim explains that when taking an oath, a person has in mind that he might change his mind in this brief amount of time. Hence, his oath is not binding until this time passes.</i> The oath is eradicated, for this resembles one who made a statement in error.
Similarly, if others tell him: "Retract," "It is permitted for you," or the like and he accepts their view within the above measure of time<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, saying that the objections of others cannot by connected to his oath. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 210:3), Rav Yosef Caro and also the Radbaz explain that since the others protested immediately after his oath and his acceptance also came immediately afterwards, it is as if he never completed taking the oath.</i> by saying: "Yes," or "I retract," he is permitted. After this measure of time, he cannot retract.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if the oath has not taken effect as of yet (Radbaz).</i>
If a person took an oath and retracted within his heart<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., without verbalizing his retraction.</i> within the above measure of time, it is of no consequence. Similarly, if others told him: "Retract," "It is permitted for you," or "It is absolved for you," and he accepted their words in his heart within the above measure of time, it is of no consequence. He must state his retraction explicitly like his oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz emphasizes that he must also make his statements with intent. Just as his mouth and heart must concur when making an oath, so, too, they must concur when retracting it.</i>

Chapter 3

Whenever a person takes one of these four types of oaths under compulsion, he is exempt from all liability. This applies to a person who at the outset took a false oath because of factors beyond his control as we explained, one who took an oath and then was subjected to compulsion and was not given the opportunity to fulfill his oath, or he was compelled to take an oath by a man of force. Therefore one may take an oath when compelled to by robbers, potential murders, and tax collectors.
To which tax collector did we refer? To a tax collector that assumed the position on his own, who takes money without the license of the king or who takes money with the king's license, but takes more for himself than the fixed measure, as explained in <i>Hilchot Gezelah</i>.
When a person is compelled to take an oath, to be exempt, while taking the oath, he must have the intent in his heart for the oath to apply to something for which he is exempt. Although generally, words in a person's heart are of no consequence, since he cannot express his intent because of the forces beyond his control, he can rely on the intent in his heart.
What is implied? One took an oath to a man of force that he would not eat meat without qualifying his statement, it is permitted if in his heart, he had the intent that he was saying that he would not eat the meat of pigs, or that he would not eat meat that day. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
Similarly, one is not liable for oaths involving exaggerations or unintentional oaths. What is meant by oaths involving exaggerations? A person saw vast armies and tall walls and he took an oath that "I saw the armies of King So-and-So and they are as vast as those who left Egypt," "I saw the wall of this-and-this city and it was as high as the heavens," or the like. He is exempt, because he did not resolve within his heart that this was the measure of the subject in question, no more and no less. His intent was only to describe the height of the wall or the multitude of the people.
What is meant by an oath taken inadvertently? With regard to a<i> sh'vuat hapikadon</i> or a <i>sh'vuat ha'edut</i>, it refers to a situation where the person forgot about the entrusted article or the testimony. He is entirely exempt, as we explained. <br>With regard to an oath taken in vain, it refers to a situation where the person took an oath not to wear <i>tefilin</i>, but did not know that <i>tefilin</i> are a mitzvah. With regard to a false oath, it refers to a situation where the person took an oath that he did not eat and then remembered that he did in fact eat, he took an oath that he would not eat and then forgot and ate, he took an oath that he would not give any satisfaction to his wife because she stole his wallet or beat his son and afterwards, he found out that she did not steal it or beat him. Similar concepts apply in all analogous situations.
If so, what is a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> taken inadvertently for which one is liable to bring an adjustable guilt offering with regard to the past? One took an oath that he did not eat although he knew that he in fact had eaten and he knew that it is forbidden to have taken this false oath, but he did not know that he is liable to bring a sacrifice for it. This is the inadvertent violation for which one is liable to bring an adjustable guilt offering for taking a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> with regard to the past.
What is meant by an inadvertent violation for which one is liable for an adjustable guilt offering for breaking an oath involving the future? For example, one took an oath that he would not eat bread from wheat and forgot and thought that he had taken an oath that he would eat bread from wheat and then ate it. In this instance, he became unaware of the content of the oath although he remembered the article concerning which he took the oath. This is an inadvertent violation of a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> involving the future which obligates him to bring a sacrifice.
If, however, he took an oath that he would not eat bread from wheat and he ate bread from wheat thinking that it was made from barley, he is considered to have transgressed due to forces beyond his control and he is exempt. For he did not become unaware of the oath, but instead of the article concerning which he took the oath.
If he lost awareness of the oath he took and he lost awareness of the article concerning which he took the oath, he is not liable for a sacrifice.<br>What is implied? For example, one took an oath that he would not eat bread from wheat and thought that he had taken an oath that he would eat bread from wheat and ate bread from wheat thinking it was barley. He is not liable, because he became unaware of both the oath and the article it concerned. It is considered as if he he transgressed due to forces beyond his control.
The following laws apply if a person took an oath concerning a loaf of bread, swearing that he would not eat it and then suffered discomfort because of it. Should he eat the loaf because of his discomfort, because he thought that it is permitted for him to eat it because of discomfort, he is considered to have transgressed inadvertently. He is exempt from bringing a sacrifice, because he is not repenting because of his new knowledge. Instead, he knew that it was forbidden and ate it in error.

Chapter 4

When a person takes an oath that he will not eat anything on that day and he ate less than an olive-sized portion of food, he is not liable. For "eating" does not involve a quantity less than an olive-sized portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is a principle applying to all of the Torah's prohibitions concerning eating.</i> It is as if he partook of less than the minimum measure of a <i>nevelah</i>, a <i>trefe</i>, or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In such an instance, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 4,:7-8, the prohibition is of Scriptural origin, but the violator is not punished. Accordingly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 238:1) rules that it is forbidden for the person who took such an oath to partake of even the slightest quantity of food.</i><br>If he said: "[I am taking] an oath that I will not eat this substance," and he ate it, he is liable even if the substance concerning which he took the oath is one mustard seed or smaller.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Because he singled out a specific article and by partaking of it broke his oath.</i>
If he took an oath that he would not taste anything and partook of even the smallest amount of food, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For tasting does not imply eating a full measure of food. Since he used that expression, it is clear that his intent was to forbid partaking of even the slightest measure of food.</i>
When a person takes an oath that he will not eat on a specific day and drinks, he is liable, because [a prohibition against] eating includes drinking.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sh'vuot</i> 22b derives this concept from Deuteronomy 14:23: "And you shall eat before God, your Lord... the tithes of your grain, your wine, and your oil." Implied is that partaking of wine and oil is also eating.</i> Therefore, if he both ate and drank, he is liable only for one set of lashes<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As in Halachah 5.</i> if he acted willfully or one sin offering if he transgressed inadvertently.
When a person took an oath not to drink on a given day, he is permitted to eat, because [a prohibition against] drinking does not include eating. How much must he drink for him to be liable? It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This expression indicates a conclusion derived by the Rambam from logic without any explicit Talmudic or Midrashic source.</i> that he is not liable unless he drinks a <i>revi'it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a fourth of a <i>log</i>. In contemporary measure, a <i>revi'it</i> is equivalent to 86 cc. according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 150 cc. according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> as is the case with regard to other prohibitions.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that since this is the measure which the Torah considered significant in other contexts, one can extrapolate that anything less is not considered significant enough to warrant liability. Alternatively, with regard to oaths and vows, we follow the commonly accepted implications of the terms used and people do not consider partaking of a smaller measure as "drinking."</i>
When a person takes an oath that he will not eat on a particular day and partook of many types of food, or he takes an oath that he will not drink on a particular day and partakes of many types of beverages, he is only liable once.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for one set of lashes or one sacrifice. As will be explained, this applies only when the transgressor did not become aware of his oath between eating.</i> Even if he said: "[I am taking] an oath that today I will not eat meat, bread, or beans," and he eats all [these types of food]. He is only liable once. All [of these foods] can be joined together to reach the measure of an olive-sized portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The minimum measure for which one is liable as stated in Halachah 1. The Radbaz states that the superficial implication of the Rambam's words is that it is not necessary for one to partake of such a portion of each of the foods separately to be liable. He differs and maintains that the person must partake of all of them to be liable.</i>
When a person takes an oath that he will neither eat nor drink and then eats and drinks, he is liable twice. Although drinking is included in eating, since he specifically said: "And I will not drink," he revealed his intention not to include drinking in eating.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, it would be considered as eating as stated in Halachah 3.</i> Thus it is as if he took an oath on this independently and this independently. Therefore he is liable twice.
Similarly, if a person said: "[I am taking] an oath that I will not eat bread from wheat, bread from barley, or bread from buckwheat," he is liable for each one individually if he partakes of them. He mentioned "bread" three times<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he mentioned "bread" only once, he is liable only once. See Halachah 5.</i> to make a distinction and cause him to be liable for each one individually.
[The following laws apply when a person's] colleague was persistently imploring him to eat at his [home], telling him: "Come and drink with me, wine, milk, and honey." If he answers: "[I am taking] an oath that I will not drink wine, milk, and honey," he is liable for each one individually if he partakes of them. [To be liable only once,] he should have said: "[I am taking] an oath that I will not drink anything," or "...[that I will not drink] what you said." Since he repeated the phrase, stating each one individually,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the emphasis is one repeating his colleague's words, while stating each one individually. That shows that his intent is focused on each one individually. If, however, he made such a statement on his own initiative, without repeating his colleague's words, they are not considered to have been singled out [Rav Kapach's edition of the Rambam's Comemntary to the Mishneh (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 3:4)].</i> he revealed his intention that he obligated himself with an oath for each and every type [of beverage] individually. Therefore [the beverages] are not combined with each other [to reach the minimum measure]<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if he drank half of a <i>revi'it</i> of wine and half of a <i>revi'it</i> of milk, he is not liable.</i> and the person is liable only when he eats the minimum measure from each one individually. Since a sin offering is required for each one individually, they are like fat and blood which cannot be combined for [the measure of] an olive-sized portion as explained in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 4, Halachah 16.</i>
[When one says: "I am taking] an oath that I will not eat this loaf," or "...that I will not eat it," once he eats an olive-sized portion of it, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that his intention when taking the oath was to interpret the term eating according to its halachic definition (Radbaz).</i> [If he says:] "[I am taking] an oath that I will not eat it up,"<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since he spoke in a colloquialism, we assume that he was not referring to the halachic meaning and instead, meant the entire loaf.</i> he is not liable until he eats the entire loaf.<br>If he says: "[I am taking] an oath that I will not eat this loaf; [I am taking] an oath that I will not eat it up," should he eat it,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Whether an olive-sized portion or the entire loaf.</i> he is liable only once.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Because once eating an olive-sized portion of the loaf is forbidden by an oath, a second oath concerning that same loaf cannot take effect, as the Rambam states in the following halachah.</i>
Similarly, if one said: ["I am taking] an oath that I will not eat today,"<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that he would not eat an olive-sized portion of food that day.</i> and then took an oath concerning a loaf that he would not eat it up, [even though] he eats the entire [loaf] that day, he is not liable only once.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad accepts the principle stated by the Rambam, but explains that this is not a good example of it. For in this instance, the second oath does take effect, for it applies not only on the day that the first oath applies, but for all time. The Radbaz explains that the Rambam would agree that the second oath will take effect as soon as the day on which the first oath is in effect ends. This he maintains is why the Rambam mentions eating it "that day."</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For example, that mentioned in Halachah 12.</i> [The rationale is that] an oath does not take effect when another is already in effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this principle is that a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> applies only with regard to matters that are dependent upon one's volition, not on those forbidden by the Torah (Chapter 5, Halachah 17). Accordingly, once something is forbidden by an oath, it is no longer a matter dependent on one's volition. Hence, a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> cannot take effect (<i>Kiryat Sefer</i>).<br>As stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 17, if the person has the first oath nullified, the second oath takes effect.</i><br>If, however, one took an oath that he would not eat up a loaf and afterwards, took an oath that he would not eat anything or that he would not eat this loaf, he is liable twice. [The rationale is that] at the time he took the oath that he would not eat it up, he would not be liable unless he ate the entire loaf. Thus when he took a second oath that he would not eat anything or that he would not eat the loaf, he is liable [for the latter oath,] when he eats an olive-sized portion. And when he eats the entire [loaf], he is liable for his first oath.
[When a person takes] an oath not to eat figs and afterwards, takes an oath not to eat figs and grapes, he is liable twice for [eating] figs. [The rationale is that] he included the figs which were forbidden in the first oath with grapes that were permitted. Since the second oath took effect with regard the grapes, it also took effect with regard the figs and he becomes liable for two oaths, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 8:6 states that although one prohibition does not take effect when an object is already prohibited, there are exceptions. One of them is when the second prohibition includes other entities that were not included in the first prohibition (<i>issur kollel</i>). Similarly, in this instance, since the second oath includes something which is not prohibited by the first oath (grapes), it takes effect.</i>
[If one said: "I am taking] an oath that I will not eat eight [of this item]," "...an oath that I will not eat nine," and "...an oath that I will not eat ten," he is liable only once whether he ate eight, nine, or ten.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For he cannot eat nine or ten without first eating eight. Hence, the second and third oaths do not take effect, for one oath does not take effect when the objects it concerns are already forbidden. As mentioned in the Radbaz and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 238:12), there are instances where the second oath can take effect according to the principle of <i>issur kollel</i>, a more inclusive prohibition.</i>
[If one said: "I am taking] an oath that I will not eat ten," "...an oath that I will not eat nine," and "...an oath that I will not eat eight," if he eats ten, he is liable three times, one for each oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For each oath was separate. After he took the oath forbidding ten, nine were still permitted. And after he took the oath forbidding nine, eight were still permitted. Hence, the later oaths take effect.</i> Similarly, if he eats nine, he is liable twice. If he eats eight, he is liable once.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 238:13) states that if the person specifies 10 specific items in his oath, he is not liable if he later reduces their number to eight, for all ten have become forbidden to him.</i>
[The following rules apply when a person says: "I am taking] an oath that I will not eat figs," and then takes another oath that he will not eat figs and grapes together.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he takes an oath against eating an olive-sized portion of each type of fruit. He does not violate his oath unless he eats both of these portions. Since the second oath also includes grapes, it takes effect with regard to the figs based on the principle of <i>issur kollel</i>.</i> If he forgot, ate figs, and set aside a sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For breaking his first oath.</i> afterwards, forgot, and ate grapes, he is not liable for the grapes. [The rationale is that] this is like half the measure [for which one is liable]<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For to be liable he must eat grapes and figs together. By realizing his transgression, he makes a distinction between the figs he ate and the grapes.</i> and one does not bring a sacrifice for half the measure.
Similar [laws apply if] one took an oath that he would not eat ten, and then took an oath that he would not eat ten and nine.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his first oath involved ten specific items. His second oath involved nine additional items from a larger group. The Ra'avad claims the Rambam's ruling is a distortion of <i>Sh'vuot</i> 28b. See also Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> who discuss the proper wording of that source.</i> If he ate ten, separated a sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For breaking his first oath.</i> and then forgot and ate nine, this is like half the measure and one does not bring a sacrifice for half the measure. For the final oath concerned not eating nineteen.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This version, slightly different from that of the standard printed text, is based on authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The intent is that the second oath included the original ten, plus a second nine.

[When a person says: "I am taking] an oath that I will not eat this large loaf if I eat this small loaf," if he forgets this stipulation when he eats the smaller loaf and afterwards willfully eats the larger [loaf], he is liable [for lashes].<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling follows the version of <i>Sh'vuot</i> 28a suggested by Rabbenu Chananel. The standard published text of the Talmud reverses the ruling. Thus in the instance stated by the Rambam, one would be exempt as the Ra'avad notes. The ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 239:16) follows that of the standard printed text of the Talmud.<br>The Rambam's rationale can be explained as follows: Since the person willfully transgressed by eating the larger loaf, he is liable for lashes. The fact that he inadvertently caused the oath to take effect is not of consequence.<br>The person is liable for lashes only when he is given a warning before transgressing. From this we see that even if a warning is given conditionally, it is effective.</i>
If he ate the small one while he remembered the stipulation and knew that by eating it, the larger one would become forbidden and then forgot and ate the larger one while thinking that it was not forbidden yet, he is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">He is exempt for lashes. Nor is he required to bring a sacrifice, for as explained in Chapter 3, Halachah 6, and notes. This is considered as violated an oath due to forces beyond one's control.<br>The Rambam's rationale is that he did not perform the transgression knowingly. At the time, he partook of the larger loaf, he was not aware that it was forbidden. In this instance as well, the Rambam's ruling does not follow the standard printed text of the Talmud. Hence there are authorities who differ.</i> If he ate both of them unintentionally,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., without awareness of the oath.</i> he is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For both lashes and a sacrifice as in the previous clause.</i> [If he ate them] both willfully, he is liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">For lashes (Ra'avad).</i> regardless of whether he ate the larger one first<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">And thus it becomes forbidden only retroactively.

Similarly, if he made the two loafs dependent on each other,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., not only the large loaf dependent on the smaller loaf as in the previous instance, but each one was dependent on the other as the Rambam continues to explain.</i> taking an oath saying: "[I am taking] an oath that I will not eat one of these [loaves] if I eat the other." If he forgot the stipulation and ate one of them and then willfully ate the other, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For lashes as in Halachah 16. Again, this runs contrary to the standard published text of the Talmud and there are other authorities who differ.</i>
If he ate the first one willfully, but the second one inadvertently, he is exempt. [If he ate them] both willfully, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 17.</i>
[When a person says: "I am taking] an oath that I will eat this loaf today," and the day passes without him eating it, should he have acted unintentionally, he must bring an adjustable guilt offering. If he acted willfully, he is not liable for lashes, because he did not perform a deed,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2. Note the following halachah.</i> even though he violated [the prohibition against] taking a false oath.
Why is a person who took an oath that he ate liable for lashes [if] he did not eat and one [who took an oath] that he did not eat [liable] if he did eat, even though he did not perform a deed. Because at the time he took the oath, he was taking a false oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he is liable for lashes, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachot 3, 7.</i> If, however, a person takes an oath that he will perform [a particular activity], it is not a false oath at the time it was taken.
[The following laws apply when] a person tells a colleague: "[I am taking] an oath that I will not eat at your [home],"<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew, the Rambam restates this phrase using slightly different wording.</i> or [his colleague] was persistently imploring him to eat at his [home] and he refuses.

See <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Sh'vuot</i> 36b.</i> these all bring about prohibitions. [It is considered that] he took an oath that he would not eat at his [home]. If he used all of these expressions [together] and transgressed and ate, he is only liable once.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is not considered as if each one is an independent oath, because an oath cannot take effect when an object is already forbidden by another oath.<br>The Radbaz explains that the Rambam is interpreting <i>Nedarim</i> 16a. One might think that the passage means that the person took an oath that he would not eat at his colleague's home. Afterwards, his colleague implored him to eat and to appease him, he took an oath that he would eat at his home. Seemingly, this resembles an oath taken in vain, for he is taking an oath to nullify the observance of a mitzvah - the fulfillment of his previous oath. For this reason, the Rambam explains that all of these expressions should be interpreted to mean that he is taking an oath not to eat. Only one of them takes effect, because one oath does not take effect when an object is already forbidden.</i>

Chapter 5

When a person takes an oath that so-and-so threw a stone into the sea and he did not do so, or [he took an oath that] he did not throw it and he did, he is liable for taking a [false] <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>. [This applies] even though there is no [possibility of him taking such an oath] with regard to the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Although the concept of a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> applies both with regard to the past and the future (Chapter 1, Halachah 2), it is not necessary that every <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> have both a past and a future component.</i> For he cannot take an oath that so-and-so will throw [an article] or will not throw it.<br>[Indeed,] any person who takes an oath with regard to other people's [conduct - that they will or will not perform a particular activity is not liable for taking a [false] <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>. [This applies even if the person concerned] is his son or wife. For it is not within his potential to keep or nullify the oath. He is given stripes for rebellious conduct since it is not within his potential to keep this oath. Thus he is causing an oath to be taken in vain.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam continues to explain, the oath is not necessarily false, because the other people may do what he postulated. Rashi (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 25a) considers this a false oath. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 236:4 quotes Rashi's view.</i>
Why isn't he liable for lashes for taking an oath in vain? For it is possible for those other people to heed his [words] and keep his oath. Thus when he is given a warning at the time he takes the oath, the warning is of doubtful status. In such an instance, one is not given lashes because of it unless the prohibition is explicitly stated in the Torah, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> point out several difficulties with the Rambam's words. Firstly, in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i>, the Rambam does not make such statements explicitly. The only mention of a warning of a doubtful status is in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 16:4. From those statements and those here, it appears that the Rambam considers such a warning as significant. There he does not explain the distinction of whether the prohibition is explicitly mentioned in the Torah or not. Also, the prohibition against taking a false oath is explicitly mentioned in the Torah. The Radbaz explains that the intent is that the concept that such an oath is considered as having been taken in vain is not explicit in the Torah and may not be known by an ordinary person.</i> Other people are not bound to fulfill the words of the person who took the oath unless they responded <i>Amen</i>, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 1, whenever one responds <i>Amen</i> to a colleague's oath, he is bound by it.</i>
If they fulfilled his words,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 236:2) mentions two opinions. One emphasizes that the one who took the oath must certainly fulfill it. For example, if one takes an oath to marry a woman, the oath is considered as having been taken in vain, because the woman may not consent. Nevertheless, if she does consent, the man should keep his word and marry her. The other, however, does not consider this as an oath taken in vain, but rather as a false <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.</i> they are praiseworthy, for [in this manner,] they did not habituate [the person who took the oath] to take an oath in vain.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> maintains that even if the involved parties fulfill the oath, the person taking it is given stripes for rebellious conduct, for he should never have taken such an oath.</i>
When does the above apply? When he took an oath concerning a matter that was not in his domain. For example, Reuven took an oath that Shimon would not go on a commercial journey, not eat meat, or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For in these instances, he has no control over the other person's actions.</i> [Different laws apply,] however, should Reuven take an oath that Shimon may not enter his home and may not derive any benefit from his property. If Shimon transgressed and entered Reuven's house and benefited from his property without Reuven's knowledge, Reuven is exempt, for [his oath was violated] due to forces beyond his control.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For he did not know of Shimon's actions.</i> Shimon is liable, for he performed a deed prohibited to him. For Reuven took an oath only with regard to a matter within his property.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> questions the Rambam's ruling, focusing on the difference between an oath (<i>sh'vuah</i>) and a vow (<i>neder</i>). When taking an oath, a person causes his own person to be prohibited against performing a particular action. To use <i>yeshivah</i> terminology, it is an <i>issur gavra</i>; the prohibition is on the person. When taking a vow, by contrast, he places the prohibition on the object. It is an <i>issur cheftzah</i>.<br>Now when a person takes a vow against a colleague benefiting from his property, there is no difficulty, because he is placing the prohibition on the property. How can he, however, place a prohibition on a colleague's person? How can his oath take effect?<br>The Rambam's ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 236:3; albeit using slightly different wording). The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 236:7 explains that the Rambam follows the principal stated by the Ramban that an oath expressed using the wording of a vow and a vow expressed using the wording of an oath is binding. The Radbaz, puzzled by the same difficulty, states that this refers to an instance where the colleague answered <i>Amen</i> to the oath.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
[When a person says: "I am taking] an oath that I will not eat," and he ate, but he ate articles that were not fit to be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., earth or spoiled foods.</i> or drank beverages that were not fit to be drunk, he is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that he is eating them, not because he considers them as food, but in order to quench his pangs of hunger.</i> If he partook of foods that are forbidden to be eaten by the Torah, for example, he ate an olive-sized portion of a <i>nevelah,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">An animal that died without ritual slaughter.</i> a <i>trefe</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">An animal with a blemish that would cause it to die within twelve months.</i> teeming animals, or creeping animals, he is not liable for a [false] <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is already forbidden to partake of these entities by the oath taken by the Jewish people as a whole at Sinai, the oath he takes is of no significance (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 22b). See Halachah 11.<br>The Radbaz emphasizes that this exclusion applies only with regard to entities forbidden by Scriptural Law, but not those forbidden by Rabbinic Law. For in such an instance, he is not bound by the oath taken by our people at Sinai.</i><br>[When a person says: "I am taking] an oath that I will eat," and he ate articles that were not fit to be eaten or drank beverages that were not fit to be drunk, or he partook of a <i>nevelah,</i> a <i>trefe</i>, or the like, he is not liable for a false <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>. He is considered to have fulfilled [his commitment to] eat. Since they are important in his eyes, eating them is considered as eating.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Nissim explains the difference between this and the first clause as follows: In the first clause, we assume that the not eating, he referred to in his oath was not eating foods that people usually eat. These articles were not included in his oath, for there is no reason to forbid them. In the second instance, he included everything that he considers as food in his oath.</i>
[When a person said: "I am taking] an oath that I did not eat," and he ate articles that were not fit to be eaten or he partook of a <i>nevelah</i> or a<i> trefe</i>, he is liable. Eating them is considered eating, because they are important to him, as evidenced by his having eaten them.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even before he took his oath.</i> With regard to the future, by contrast, i.e., he took an oath that he would not eat and then in an extraordinary instance, he ate them, this is not considered eating, as we explained [above].
[When a person says: "I am taking] an oath that I will not eat even the slightest amount of a <i>nevelah</i> or a <i>trefe</i>," and he ate less than an olive-sized portion, he is liable for taking a [false] oath, for he is not bound by an oath from Mount Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As the Torah states: "Cursed is the man who will not observe the words of this Torah" (Deuteronomy 27:26 .</i> for half the measure [which makes him liable].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that although the Rambam maintains that there is a Scriptural prohibition against eating even less than the measure for which one is liable (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 14:2), this is not considered a matter for which one is bound by an oath from Sinai. For that oath includes only those matters which are explicitly mentioned by the Torah and this prohibition is not. There are, however, other <i>Rishonim</i> who do not makes such a distinction. See <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 238:6.</i>
[When a person says: "I am taking] an oath that I will eat even less than an olive-sized portion of a <i>nevelah</i> or a <i>trefe</i>," he may be liable for taking a false <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The oath takes effect, because, as stated in the previous halachah, for this quantity, he is not bound by an oath from Sinai. The Radbaz states that preferably, he should have this oath nullified. Nevertheless, if that is not possible, it is preferable for him to keep the oath and violate the Scriptural commandment.</i><br>[When a person says: "I am taking] an oath that I will not eat earth and the like from substances that are not fit to be eaten," if he eats an olive-sized portion, he is liable. If he ate less than an olive-sized portion, there is a doubt [concerning the ruling]. Perhaps he is liable even for [eating] the smallest amount. Since these substances are not usually eaten so that a full measure must be eaten [for him to be held liable].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">On the other hand, perhaps, he is not liable, for since he mentioned "eating" in his oath, we assumed that he meant an olive-sized portion.</i>

[When a person says: "I am taking] an oath that I will not eat dates, a <i>nevelah</i> or a <i>trefe</i>," and he ate an olive-sized portion of a<i> nevelah</i> or a <i>trefe</i>, he is liable also<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in addition to violating the prohibition against forbidden foods.</i> for [taking] a [false] <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">We do not say he is required to eat the two together.</i> For he included forbidden entities together with permitted entities.

His oath is repealed and he is permitted to perform the matter that he took the oath not to do or not to do the matter that he took an oath to do. This is called the release of an oath.
This provision has no source in the Written Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Chagigah</i> 10a which states: "The release of vows is hanging in the air and they have nothing to depend on."</i> Instead, we learned from Moses our teacher through the Oral Tradition that the phrase [Numbers 30:3]: "He should not desecrate his word" means that he himself should not abuse it in a frivolous and brazen manner, as [Leviticus 19:13] states: "[For] you will desecrate the name of Your God."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">That verse begins: "You shall not take a false oath in My name."</i> Nevertheless, if a person changed his mind and retracted, a sage may release him [from the oath].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See also Chapter 12, Halachah 12.</i>
It is not possible for a person to release himself from his own oath. A person does not have the license to release an oath or a vow in a place where there is a person whose knowledge surpasses his own.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is an expression of respect for the greater scholar. The Radbaz states that he has not seen this restriction observed and question why this leniency is taken. If the greater scholar grants permission, the lesser scholar may release the oath [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 228:2)]. Nevertheless, after the fact, if a lesser scholar releases an oath even without permission, the release is binding.</i> In a place where his teacher is found, he may only release a vow with the consent of his teacher.
The person who took the oath - whether male or female - must himself come before the sage to be released. He may not appoint an agent to seek that he be released from his vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Nor may he send a written request to the court (Radbaz). He may, however, use a translator [Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 10:8); Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 228:16)].</i> A husband may, however, become an agent to express his wife's regret and we release [the oath] for her.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For a husband and his wife are considered as the same person.</i> [This applies] provided the three judges had already gathered together. He should not, however, gather them together at the outset to release her [oath].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 8b explains that if a person takes the effort to gather a court together, we fear that he will also exaggerate his wife's statements and the court's cross-examination of him will not be effective.</i> Nor may he serve as an agent to have his wife's vow released.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he may not serve as one of the three judges who release the vow [Radbaz; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 234:57)]. This interpretation resolves the objection raised by the Ra'avad. Since he is identified with his wife to the extent that he is considered as the same person, he cannot act objectively with regard to her issues.</i>
How do we release [an oath]? The person who took the oath must come before the distinguished sage or three ordinary people if there is no expert.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 1.</i> He says: "I took an oath concerning this and this and I have changed my mind. If I knew that I would feel such discomfort concerning this, I would not have taken the oath. If, at the time of the oath, my understanding was as it is now, I would not have taken the oath."<br>The wise man or the foremost among the three asks: "Have you already changed your mind?"<br>He answers: "Yes."<br>He then tells him: "It is permitted for you," "It is released for you," "It is absolved for you," or the like with this intent in any language.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he need not make a formal statement in Hebrew.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Nedarim</i> 10:8, the Rambam elaborates on this rite:<br>He tells [the sage or the three ordinary people]: "I took a vow... and I changed my mind."<br>They ask him the reason he changed his mind and he tells them.... The foremost among the three asks: "At the time, you took the vow, had you known that this and this would occur to you, would you have taken the vow?" And he says: "No."...<br>He asks him: "Do you regret this oath?" and he says: "Yes."<br>The foremost of the three addresses him with this wording: "It is permitted for you; it is permitted for you; it is permitted for you. It is absolved for you in the heavenly academy and the earthly academy as it is written (Numbers 15:26 : 'And it will be forgiven for the entire congregation of Israel and the stranger who dwells among them for the entire nation has acted inadvertently.'<br></i><br>If, however, he says: "[The oath] is nullified for you," "Your oath is uprooted," or anything with that intent, his statements are of no consequence, because only a husband or a father can nullify an oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah gave them this power. See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, Chapter 13, for an explanation of this issue.</i> A sage, by contrast, may use only an expression conveying release or absolution.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that the term "nullify" or "uproot" imply being overpowered by a stronger authority without reason. For the woman is placed under the control of her husband or father and with or without reason, he may nullify her oath even against her will. His authority overpowers the oath, as it were. "Permit," "release," or the like, by contrast, imply that a decision is made on the basis of logic and the oath is revoked as if it never existed. See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.</i>, where he discusses the differences between these two terms.</i>

Rabbenu Nissim explains that taking an oath based on the understanding of others reinforces the severity of the oath and prevents it from being repealed.

[The following laws apply when] a person took an oath, did not regret it, and came to the court to carry out his oath. If the judges saw that releasing this oath will lead to a mitzvah and to peace between a husband and his wife or between a man and his associates and carrying it out will lead to transgression and strife, they encourage him [to take] the option [of having the oath released].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they try to influence him to change his mind and express his regret.</i> They discuss the matter with him, pointing out the consequences of his oath until he regrets [having taken it].<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> explains that we are talking about a situation in which the person feels uncomfortable with keeping the oath in the future, but does not regret having made it. In such a situation, the oath cannot be repealed (see <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 228:7). Therefore the court, as the Rambam illustrates, explains the negative consequences of the oath so that the person will feel genuine regret.</i> If he changes his mind because of their words, we release his oath.

To support his argument, he refers to <i>Nedarim</i> 64b which states that God encouraged Moses to nullify his vow not to return to Egypt, telling him that the people who caused him to flee had died. The Talmud explains that the individuals concerned, Datan and Aviram, had not actually died; they merely became impoverished and "a poor person is considered as if he died." Since poverty is a frequent occurrence, it was appropriate for God to encourage Moses to ask to have his oath repealed. The Radbaz explains that the Rambam would also accept this principle, but the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differs.</i><br>What is implied? One took an oath not to derive benefit from so-and-so and that person became the city scribe. Since the person did not regret taking the oath, we do not encourage him [to take] the option [of having the oath released]. Even if he himself said: "If I knew that [he would be given this position], I would not have taken this oath," we still do not release him from it. For he does not regret [having taken the oath]. Instead, his desire is that he should not derive benefit from him, but that person not to be appointed the scribe. If, however, on his own initiative, he regretted because of what took place and his intent changed,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he regretted taking the oath not to benefit from him, because he realized that he could become the city scribe.</i> we do release the oath. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person takes an oath concerning a matter and then takes a [second] oath that he will never ask to have the [first] oath repealed, [if] he changes his mind, he must first ask that the second oath - that he would never ask to have the oath repealed - be repealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, asking for the repeal of the first oath would violate the second oath (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Afterwards, he may ask that the first [oath] be repealed.
[The following laws apply if] one took an oath that he would not speak to so-and-so and afterwards, took an oath that if he asks for the repeal of this oath and has it released, he will be forbidden to drink wine forever.

For we may not have a vow or an oath repealed before it takes effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">And the second oath will not take effect until the first oath is released. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 228:30 writes that even after the fact, an oath cannot be nullified until it takes effect.<br>This refers to the repeal of a vow or an oath by a sage. A father or a husband, by contrast, may nullify a vow before it takes effect.

[Similarly,] if he asks for the repeal of the second oath,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam maintains that since this oath is prevented from taking effect only because of another oath, one can ask for it to be repealed. Based on this view, the Radbaz maintains that one may have all the relevant oaths repealed with one request.

When a person issues a financial claim against a colleague which would require the latter to pay were he to admit [liability]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The qualifications the Rambam mentions here make a distinction between <i>mammon</i>, a financial claim, for which one is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> and <i>k'nas</i>, a fine, for which one is not liable, as stated in the following halachah.</i> and [the colleague] denies [his obligation] and takes an oath or the plaintiff administers an oath to him and he denies [any obligation]. [If he is lying,] the defendant is liable for an oath concerning a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The term literally means "an oath concerning an entrusted object." Its meaning in a halachic context is explained in this and the subsequent halachot.<br>If one takes such an oath falsely, he is liable to pay an additional fifth of the principal and bring a guilt offering as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 9.</i><br>[The above applies] even if [the defendant] does not respond <i>Amen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to other oaths, it is necessary for the person to answer <i>Amen</i> as stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 1. Nevertheless, a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> is a unique instance, as the Rambam continues to explain.</i> For with regard to a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, one is liable whether he took the oath on his own initiative or another person administered the oath to him and he denied [any obligation], even though he did not respond <i>Amen</i>. For denying the claim after the plaintiff administered the oath is equivalent to responding <i>Amen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he remains silent in response to the oath administered by the plaintiff, he is not liable even if he had denied his claim beforehand (Radbaz).</i>
[This does not apply] when [the plaintiff] lodges a claim which if acknowledged by the defendant, i.e., if he would admit that it is true, would not require him to make payment, e.g., he lodged a claim concerning a <i>k'nas</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A fine. In <i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i> 2:8, the Rambam defines a fine as an instance where a person pays more or less than the monetary value of the damage he caused.</i> For a person is not required to pay a <i>k'nas</i> based on his own admission.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Genevah</i> 1:5. See also Chapter 8, Halachot 1-3, for illustrations of this concept.</i> [In such an instance,] if a person denied [an obligation], he is exempt from a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, but liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For he is taking a false oath regarding his past activity.</i>
Similarly, if [the plaintiff] lodged a claim concerning landed property, a servant, or a promissory note, and [the defendant] denied [the claim] and took an oath, he is exempt from a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, but liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, for he took a false oath.
Why is one [who took an oath concerning such claims] exempt from [the obligations of a false] <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>? Behold, were he to have acknowledged [his obligation], he would have been held liable and [required] to pay what he denied. Because [Leviticus 5:21-22] states: "Concerning an entrusted object, a [financial] deposit, a robbery; he oppressed his colleague, or discovered a lost object." All of this concerns movable property which if he would admit his liability he would have to make financial restitution from his own domain.<br>This excludes landed property for it is not movable property. For landed property is always revealed before its owner<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to movable property which can be concealed.</i> and is always in their possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to movable property where possession may determine ownership in a situation of doubt, with regard to landed property, a person must display proof of ownership. See also <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nit'an</i> 5:1; <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 8:14; 9:1.</i> [Similarly,] it excludes servants, for an equation is established between servants and landed property.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nit'an, loc. cit.</i></i> And it excludes promissory notes, for their actual substance is not of financial value.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, they only serve as proof of an obligation (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
[The above laws apply] whether one took an oath after the plaintiff lodged a claim against him or whether he took it on his own initiative even though a claim was not lodged against him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast to an oath concerning testimony (Chapter 9, Halachah 6-7). The gloss of the <i>Torah Temimah</i> to the prooftext explains that since the verse speaks of "deny his [obligation to] a colleague," he is liable whether his colleague demands an oath of him or not.</i><br>What his implied? He took the initiative and said: "Why are you following me? Do I have any money belonging to you? I am taking an oath that I am not in possession of any of your money." Since he denied [an obligation] and took an oath, [he is liable,] even though [the plaintiff] did not lodge a claim against him.
[One is liable] whether he took an oath to the person to whom he owes the money or to his agent who was given power of attorney. For a person's agent is equivalent to his own self.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shluchim</i> 3:5, 7. See the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> who emphasizes that the principal must have given the agent power of attorney to require an oath of the defendant. If, however, he merely gave the agent the authority to prosecute the claim, he may not require him to take an oath.</i>
One is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> unless he requires him to take an oath in a language that he understands.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For an oath can be taken in any language. <i>Sotah</i> 33a derives this from the exegesis of Leviticus 5:1.</i>
When a person consciously takes a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, even though he takes a false oath and is warned by witnesses at the time he takes the oath, he is not liable for lashes, but instead must merely bring a guilt offering. For the Torah excluded him from those who are liable for lashes<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Neither is one who takes such a false oath liable for lashes for taking a false <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.</i> and obligated him to bring a guilt offering whether he transgressed willfully or inadvertently, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 9, which explains that one is liable for a sacrifice whether he transgressed willingly or inadvertently. As mentioned in the notes to Chapter 1, Halachah 8, one is not liable for lashes either because the transgression does not involve a deed, or because financial compensation must be given and a person is not held liable both for financial restitution and lashes.</i>
If one denied [an obligation] and took an oath [concerning it] four or five times or the plaintiff administered an oath to him four or fives times and he denied each one of them, he is liable for a guilt offering for each individual oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast to an oath concerning testimony, as stated in Chapter 10, Halachah 18. He is also liable to pay an additional fifth of the principal for each false oath, as stated in Halachah 15.</i> [This applies] whether this took place in a court or outside the court.<br>[The rationale is that] were he to have admitted his obligation after making his denial, he would be liable to make restitution even though he made the denial in a court. Thus with each denial, he is making himself exempt from payment. Hence, he is liable for each individual oath.
If five different people were lodging claims against him and telling him: "Give us the entrusted article of ours that you have in your possession," and he responds: "[I am taking] an oath that I do not have anything of yours in my possession," [should his oath be false,] he is liable for only one sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since his response included all of them in one statement, it is considered only as one oath.</i><br>[If he answers: "I am taking] an oath that I don't have anything of yours, or of yours,... or of yours, in my possession," he is liable for each [statement].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since he addressed each one individually, each statement is considered as an independent oath.</i>
If his colleague told him: "Give me the entrusted object, [financial] deposit, stolen object, and lost object [of mine], that you have in your possession," and he responds: "[I am taking] an oath that I do not have anything of yours in my possession," [should his oath be false,] he is liable for only one [sacrifice].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Since his response included all of these items in one statement, it is considered only as one oath.</i> Even if the total of all the claims is [merely] a <i>p'rutah</i>, they are all included together and he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, were they to have been considered individually, he would be exempt, for since each of the claims are less than a <i>p'rutah</i>, they are not significant individually. Nevertheless, since he included them in one statement, the sum is totaled as one and he is liable.</i>
[If he answers: "I am taking] an oath that I don't have an entrusted object, [financial] deposit, stolen object, and lost object of yours in my possession," he is liable for each [statement].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since he mentioned each item individually, each statement is considered as an independent oath and it is necessary that each claim concern the worth of a <i>p'rutah</i>.</i>
[If the plaintiff says:] "Give me the wheat, barley, and buckwheat of mine that you have in your possession," and [the defendant responds]: "[I am taking] an oath that I do not have anything of yours in my possession," [should his oath be false,] he is liable for only one [sacrifice].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Although they are different species of grain, since he included them all in one statement, he is liable only once. Even though buckwheat is a subspecies of wheat, since it is mentioned individually, he is liable for it individually (Radbaz).</i> [If he answers: "I am taking] an oath that I don't have any wheat, barley, and buckwheat of yours in my possession," he is liable for each [statement].
If five different people were lodging claims against him and telling him: "Give us the entrusted article, [financial] deposit, stolen object, and lost object [of mine], that you have in your possession," and he responds to one of them: "[I am taking] an oath that I don't have an entrusted object, stolen object, lost object, and [financial] deposit of yours, or of yours,... or of yours in my possession," he is liable for each claim [made] by each individual. Thus he is liable for 20 guilt offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this combines the principles stated in Halachot 10 and 12.</i>
If [the defendant] claims that he lost an entrusted object or denies [receiving it], he took an oath, and afterwards admitted [that it was in his possession], and then claimed that it was lost, took an oath, and then admitted [that it was in his possession], he must pay the principal and an additional fifth for each oath that he took.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, he is liable for a guilt offering for each oath as stated in Halachah 9.</i> [This is derived from Leviticus 5:24 which literally translates as] "its fifths,"<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">It says <i>chamishitav</i> rather than <i>chamishoto</i>.</i> [implying that] the Torah took into account several fifths for [one sum of] principal.<br>What is implied? The principal was [worth] four [<i>zuz</i>]. One denied [receiving an entrusted article], took an oath, and then admitted [that he possessed it]. Afterwards, he claimed that it was lost, took an oath and then made a second admission, and then claimed that it was lost, took an oath and then made an admission another time. He is required to pay seven [<i>zuz</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This figure can be explained as follows: The principal is four. He must pay an additional three, for each fifth is one fifth of the new total and not one fifth of the original principal (Chapter 11, Halachah 20). He is not, however, required to pay more than one for the second and third oaths, for one is required to pay one fifth of the principal and not a fifth of the fifths (Radbaz). Note, however, <i>Hilchot Gezelah</i> 7:12 which explains that if he already was held liable by a court for the additional fifth, it becomes considered as part of the principal.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
A value less than a <i>p'rutah</i> is not considered as financially significant.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This principle is also reflected in <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nit'an</i> 3:1 and <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 20:11.

Chapter 8

A person is exempt [from liability for] a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> [in the following situation]: He stole an ox belonging to a colleague and slaughtered it or sold it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, he is obligated to pay five times the value of the ox (Exodus 21:37 .</i> His colleague lodged a claim against him, telling him: "You stole my ox and you slaughtered it or sold it." [The defendant] responded: "I stole it, but did not slaughter it or sell it" and took an oath to support his claim.<br>[The reason for his exemption is that] were he to have acknowledged that he slaughtered or sold [the ox] on his own accord, he would not have been required to pay four and five times its worth for this is a fine, as explained in <i>Hilchot Genevah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Genevah</i> 1:5. See also Chapter 7, Halachah 2 above.</i> Thus it is as if he did not deny a financial obligation. Therefore he is exempt [from liability for] a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, but liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, for he took a false oath, saying that he did not slaughter [the ox], when [in fact] he did.
Similarly, a person is exempt [from liability for] a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> [in the following situations]. A person lodged a claim against him saying: "Your ox killed my servant," and he denied the incident and took an oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the owner of the ox is liable to pay a fine of 30 <i>shekalim</i> to the owner of the servant (Exodus 21:32 .</i> A servant lodged a claim against his master saying: "You knocked out my tooth" or "You blinded my eye."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the owner is required to free the servant (Exodus 21:26-27).</i> For if he acknowledged the claim, he would not be obligated to pay because it is a fine.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For in these instances, the person is not paying the worth of the damage, but an arbitrary amount that could be either more or less.</i> He is, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a person lodges a claim against a colleague concerning a matter that involves both a fine which he would not be obligated to pay if he admits his liability on his own initiative as explained [above] and a financial claim which he is liable to pay on his own admission, he denies the entire claim, and takes an oath, he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For he is denying a financial claim.

A rapist must also pay for the pain he causes. The embarrassment and the damages are considered as financial obligations.</i><br>Similarly, if a person tells a colleague: "You stole my ox," and he says, "I did not steal it" and takes an oath, he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>. Although he would not obligated to make the double payment [for a stolen object] on the basis of his own admission,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For that is a fine.</i> he would be obligated to pay the principal on the basis of his own admission.
When a person tells a colleague: "You inflicted a wound upon me,"<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For the damages (more particularly, the unemployment assessment, the medical fees, and the allocation for embarrassment) he must pay his colleague for the wound are considered as a financial obligation and not as a fine (see <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 5:7; <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nitan</i> 1:16).</i> and [the defendant] denies it, or "Your ox killed my ox,"<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Here as well, the damages one ox causes another are considered as a financial obligation. This applies with regard to an ox that has been distinguished as one which gores. If an ox is not known to have such a tendency, the half-payment for the damages that it causes is considered as a fine (see <i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i> 2:8).</i> and [the defendant] denies it, taking an oath, [the defendant] is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>. Had he admitted [his act], he would be obligated to make restitution.
[A watchman] is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> [in the following instance]: A person entrusted his ox to an unpaid watchman, the ox died, and he lodged a claim against the watchman, saying: "Where is the ox I entrusted to you?" The watchman responded: "You did not entrust anything to me," "You entrusted it, but it was stolen," or "...lost"<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since he would not have been liable had he told the truth, the fact that he took a false oath does not obligate him for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>.</i> and took an oath [to that effect]. [The rationale is] that had he admitted and related the matter as it occurred, he would not have been liable to make financial restitution, because he is an unpaid watchman.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">He is not liable in cases involving death or other losses due to forces beyond his control.</i> He is, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, for he took a false oath. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
[Similarly, a person] is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> [in the following instance]: A person lent his ox to a colleague and then demanded its return, saying: "Where is the ox you borrowed from me?" Now the ox had died, but the borrower said: "It was stolen" or "...lost" and took an oath to this effect. [The rationale is that] he did not free himself from making restitution by his denial and is nevertheless liable to pay whether the animal died, was stolen, lost, or taken captive because he was a borrower, as will be explained in the appropriate place.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 1:2; <i>Hilchot Sheilah Ufikadon</i> 1:1.</i> He is, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, for he took a false oath. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
This is the general principle: Whoever does not free himself from financial responsibility unless he makes this denial is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> if he takes an oath. [This applies] whether he took the oath on his own initiative or the plaintiff administered the oath and he stated his denial even though he did not answer <i>Amen</i> nor utter the oath himself.
[A thief] is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> [in the following instance]: He stole his colleague's ox. [The colleague] demanded payment, telling him: "You stole my ox."<br>[The thief] responded: "I did not steal it."<br>Why, then, is it in your possession?"<br>"You entrusted it to me [for safekeeping]" and he took an oath to that effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">On his own volition; he is under no obligation to do so.</i><br>[The rationale is that] had he admitting stealing it, he would have been liable to pay the value in any case.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if it dies or is destroyed by forces beyond his control.</i> By saying now that it is an entrusted object, he exempts himself from liability for theft and for loss,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since he reduces his liability through his statements, he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>.</i> i.e., were the ox to be lost or stolen after this admission, he is not obligated to pay.
Similarly, if he were to claim that he rented it and took an oath to that effect, he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, for he freed himself for liability in the cases of injury or death. Similarly, if he claimed: "You lent it to me" and took an oath to that effect, he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, for he freed himself for liability if it dies while performing its work, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot Sheilah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sheilah UFikadon</i> 1:1.</i>
Therefore if one says: "I did not steal it. Instead, you entrusted it to me...", "...hired me to watch it...", or "...lent it to me. Here is your ox. Take it." If he took an oath to that effect, he is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">He is, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> since he took a false oath.</i> for he admitted owing the principle and did not exempt himself from any liability with this denial.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For he told the owner to take his ox.</i>
Similarly, he is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> if he uses any of the following excuses and takes an oath to that effect: "You sold it to me, but I have not paid for it yet. If you want, take the money for it. If not, here is your ox," "You gave it to me as payment for work which I will perform for you. If you desire, I will perform the work. If you do not desire, take it and depart," "I found it wandering on the road and did not know that it was yours. Now that I know, take it and depart," or "It chased after my ox. Here, it's yours." He is, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, for he took a false oath.
When a person is financially obligated to two partners, one demands payment from him, he denies his obligation and takes an oath, he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if he admits owing a portion of the debt to the other partner.

He is, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.
Similarly, if there was a person who owed a debt supported by a promissory note, but he denied it and took an oath to that effect, he is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>. [The rationale is that because of] the promissory note, [the person's] landed property is placed under lien. Thus the person is denying [an obligation involving] landed property. And as we have already explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 7, Halachot 2-3.</i> a person who denied a claim involving landed property is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>. He is, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, for he took a false oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz notes that this statement is seemingly redundant; it is made more than ten times in this and the previous chapter. He explains that it would appear that taking a false <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> is more severe than taking a false <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, yet the punishment for a false <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, lashes, is more severe than that for a false <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, bringing a sacrifice. Hence, it is necessary for the Rambam to state the point explicitly each time.</i>
If a person owed a debt to which there were witnesses, he denied [his obligation], and took an oath [to that effect], he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>. For by denying his obligation, he freed himself from the liability of paying immediately. When the witnesses will come, he will be obligated to pay and thus his denial will not be effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And thus there is room to say that he is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, as indicated by Halachah 7.</i> It is, however, effective in that perhaps the witnesses will not come, they will come and their testimony will not be substantiated,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it will be disqualified through the process of cross-examination.</i> or they will be disqualified.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">And thus be prevented from testifying.</i> Therefore<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because his denial has an immediate - and perhaps long-term - effect, he is liable.</i> he is liable.

As stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 12, a person who takes this oath falsely is liable to bring an adjustable guilt offering.</i> for they caused the plaintiff a financial loss through their denial.<br>Similarly, if the plaintiff administered an oath to them and they denied the matter, [they are liable] even though they did not take an oath or answer <i>Amen</i> to the oath he [administered]. Since they denied the matter, they are liable, provided he administered the oath to them in court.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected by Halachah 10, when the oath is administered by the plaintiff and the witnesses do not answer <i>Amen</i>, the oath must be administered in court. If, however, the witnesses take the oath on their own accord or they answer <i>Amen</i>, they are liable even if this takes places outside a court, provided the denial takes place within a court, as stated in the following halachah (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>; see also Chapter 10, Halachah 7 and notes).</i>
The witnesses are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> unless they deny [knowing testimony] in court. Whether they took the oath or the oath was administered to them in court or outside the court, the denial must be in court alone, as [can be derived from Leviticus 5:1]: "If he will not testify, he will bear his sin."

See Halachah 10 and notes where this concept is discussed.</i> there, if he does not testify, he will be liable.
When the plaintiff demands [that the witnesses] testify concerning a claim that does not involve a financial obligation,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., he demanded that they testify that he was a priest or a Levite (Chapter 10, Halachah 3).</i> concerns landed property, servants, or promissory notes, they deny [knowing testimony], and take an oath to that effect, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. For they are liable when denying testimony concerning financial claims that resemble an entrusted object, a [financial] deposit, a robbery, or a lost object which the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:21-22; see the explanations in Chapter 7, Halachah 4, and notes.</i> mentions in this passage. This refers to moveable property which is itself of financial worth<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to promissory notes.</i> that were they to testify on [the plaintiff's] behalf, [the defendant] would have to pay.
Similarly, when one administers an oath to witnesses who [can testify regarding] a fine and they deny [knowledge] of the matter, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. [The rationale is that] were the defendant to come and acknowledge his liability for the fine first,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i> 2:8.</i> he would not be liable to pay even though the witnesses came afterwards and testified accordingly. Thus the witnesses did not make him liable through their testimony alone. Instead, it was their testimony together with the denial of the defendant that made him liable. Since their testimony would not be effective if he acknowledged [his liability], if they denied [knowing of] the matter and took an oath, they are not liable.
[When a plaintiff administers an oath to witnesses, saying:] "I am making you take an oath that you come and testify on my behalf that so-and-so owes me a double payment"<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For a theft.</i> or a four- or five-fold payment<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For the theft and slaughter or sale of a sheep or a cow.</i> and the witnesses deny [knowledge of the matter], they are liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> because of the principal which is a financial obligation,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For this must be paid even if he admits stealing himself.</i> but not because of the double payment which is a fine.<br>Similarly, if he administered an oath that they testify that so-and-so raped or seduced his daughter and they deny [knowledge of the matter], they are liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> because of the [payment due] for embarrassment and damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 3, and notes.</i> For if the defendant acknowledged his obligation, he would have to pay these obligations, but not because of the fine. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
Witnesses are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> until they deny [knowledge of the matter] and take an oath after the plaintiff or his agent<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This applies to a person who has been given power of attorney (see Chapter 7, Halachah 6).

If, however, they take an oath first, before a demand is made of them, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>.
What is implied? [The witnesses] saw the plaintiff following after them, they told him: "Why are you following us? We are taking an oath that we do not know any testimony involving you," they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. [The rationale is that] the plaintiff did not make a demand of them. Instead, they took the oath first on their own initiative.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam writes in his Commentary to Mishnah (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 4:12), Leviticus 5:1 states "If he does not tell" but the word "not" is written <i>lamed alef vav</i>. This implies both <i>lamed alef</i> "not," and <i>lamed vav</i> "to him." Implied is that he must say no to him, i.e., in response to his demand.</i><br>Similarly, if the defendant administered an oath to them that if they knew testimony involving the plaintiff they should come and testify and they deny [knowledge of the matter], they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> unless the plaintiff makes them take the oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This can also be derived through the process of exegesis mentioned above. One can infer that when the witnesses refuse to testify, they must speak to the plaintiff himself.</i> Needless to say, if he administered an oath that they should come to testify that so-and-so owes so-and-so money and they deny [knowledge of the matter], they are not liable. For the person making this demand is not the plaintiff himself. Similarly, if the oath preceded [their knowledge of] the testimony, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>, as [implied by Leviticus 5:1]: "And he heard the voice of an oath [when] he was a witness." [It can be inferred that knowledge of] the testimony preceded the oath and not that the oath preceded the knowledge of the testimony.
What is implied? [The plaintiff says:] "I am administering to you an oath that if you will know of testimony concerning me that you come and testify," and the witnesses responded <i>Amen</i> and afterwards they observed a matter concerning him.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., at the time the oath was administered, they did not have knowledge of testimony concerning the plaintiff, but afterwards they observed the matter under investigation.</i> If he demands that they testify and they deny [knowledge of the matter], they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>.
Witnesses are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> until the plaintiff singles them out and administers an oath to them or they take an oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">From the exegesis of the prooftext cited above, <i>Sh'vuot</i> 35a understands that the verse is speaking, not of people in general, but of persons singled out to serve as witnesses.</i><br>What is implied? A person stood up in a synagogue and said: "I am administering an oath to anyone who knows testimony concerning me to come and testify on my behalf." They all - including his witnesses - responded <i>Amen</i>. Afterwards, he demanded of his witnesses that they testify and they denied [knowledge of the matter]. They are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>, because he did not single out the witnesses individually. If, however, he said: "I am administering an oath to all of those standing here that if they know testimony concerning me to come and testify on my behalf."

Similarly, if he told the witnesses: "Come and testify on my behalf that so-and-so owes me a <i>maneh</i>" and then stands in a synagogue and said: "I am administering an oath to anyone who knows testimony concerning me to come and testify on my behalf," should they not come and testify, they are liable, because he made a demand of them previously.

Similarly, the Ra'avad also differs with the Rambam's postulate that if the witnesses do not answer <i>Amen</i>, the oath must be administered in a court.<br>The Radbaz justifies the Rambam's position, explaining that since the witnesses did not take the oath themselves or respond <i>Amen</i>, it is their denial of knowledge of the testimony that constitutes acceptance of the oath. Accordingly, just as the denial must be made in court, the oath must be administered in court. For it is inappropriate that the oath itself be administered outside the court, while its acceptance is required to be in court. See also Chapter 10, Halachah 17 and notes.</i> If they did not answer <i>Amen</i>, they are not liable.
Whether one administers an oath to his witnesses or tells them "I am commanding you with an oath" or "I am binding you with an oath," they are liable provided he administers the oath<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Or includes God's name in any of the other expressions (Radbaz).</i> with God's name or with one of the terms used to describe Him as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachot 2-4.</i>
The witnesses are not liable unless the oath is administered to them in a language that they understand.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 7. This applies even if they answer <i>Amen</i> to the oath (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Sotah</i> 7:1).</i>
Thus you have learned that witnesses are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> unless ten conditions are [met]. They are:<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">All of these points have been discussed in the previous halachot.</i><br>a) [The witnesses] must be charged [with testifying] by the plaintiff;<br>b) [The matter] must involve a financial claim;<br>c) It must involve movable property;<br>d) Their testimony alone, had it been given, would be sufficient to require the defendant to pay;<br>e) They must deny [knowledge of the matter] after the plaintiff charges them;<br>f) They must issue their denial in court;<br>g) God's name or a term used to describe Him must be mentioned in the oath;<br>h) The knowledge of the matter must precede the oath;<br>i) The witnesses must be singled out at the time of the oath or at the time they are charged;<br>j) The oath must be in a language that they understand.
Whenever we have used the expression "they are not liable" [in this chapter], the intent is that they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. They are, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, provided they take the oath or answer <i>Amen</i> to an oath administered by a colleague, because they took a false oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam's position is shared by many other <i>Rishonim</i>, there are others (e.g., Rashi, <i>Sh'vuot</i> 25b), who differ and maintain that since the oath involves testimony, one is never liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> even when he is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. See Halachah 18 and notes.</i><br>When, by contrast, one is liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>, he is only liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> and is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, even though he took a false oath and did so intentionally. [The rationale is that] the Torah removed a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> from the category of <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> to make a person who deliberately [takes a false oath] liable for a sacrifice for its violation just as one who took it inadvertently.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sh'vuot</i> 30a notes that with regard to all the other types of oaths, the Torah uses the expression "and it became concealed from him," but it does not use that expression with regard to a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. Implied is that even if the matter is not concealed, i.e., he transgresses deliberately, he is liable for a sacrifice. The Radbaz questions - without resolving - why the Torah gives the person a lesser punishment - a sacrifice - instead of lashes, when he purposefully violates this transgression.</i> He is not, however, liable for lashes, as [can be derived from Leviticus 5:5 which] states: "For one of these."<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The same passage mentions both a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> and a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>. This verse teaches that one can be held liable for only one of these types of oaths. This also applies with regard to the other false oaths for which the Torah holds one liable. One can be held liable only for one.</i> A person who takes a [false] oath is liable for one type of oath, but not two. [We do not hold him liable for both] a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> and a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.
[When the plaintiff says: "I am administering] an oath to you unless you come and testify that so-and-so has an entrusted object, a [financial] deposit, stolen property, and a lost object of mine in his possession," [and the witnesses respond: "We are taking] an oath that we do not know of any testimony concerning you," they are liable for only one [sacrifice].<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Because they included all the obligations in a single statement.

[When the plaintiff says: "I am administering] an oath to you unless you come and testify that so-and-so has wheat, barley, and buckwheat of mine in his possession," and [the defendant responds]: "[We are taking] an oath that we do not know of any testimony concerning you," they are liable for only one [sacrifice].<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Although they are different species of grain, since he included them all in one statement, he is liable only once.</i> [If they answer: "We are taking] an oath that we do not know of any testimony concerning any wheat, barley, and buckwheat of yours in his possession," he is liable for each [statement].
Similarly, if many people charged them with testifying and they said: "[We are taking] an oath that we do not know of any testimony concerning you," they are liable for only one [sacrifice]. [If they said:] "...concerning you, and you, and you," they are liable for each [statement], as explained with regard to <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Because they included all the obligations in a single statement.

When a person administers an oath to a colleague that he knows testimony concerning him and ultimately, it is discovered that he does not know testimony, [the colleague] is not liable, neither for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">For a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> involves a situation when the witnesses refuse to testify.</i>, nor for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.

Hence since the negative dimension of the statement is not a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, the positive dimension, taking an oath that one knows testimony, is not a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he is totally absolved from liability.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that one could raise a question based on <i>Sh'vuat</i> 25b. From that passage, it would appear that this and the concept stated in Halachah 14 are conflicting positions and one cannot accept both as halachah. Nevertheless, he explains that it is only in the preliminary stage of the Talmud's argument that the positions appear conflicting. After the Talmud cites the teaching derived from the prooftext, "for one of these," the two rulings can be reconciled. He cites other <i>Rishonim</i> who interpret the passage in this manner.</i>
It is clear that when a person takes an oath to a colleague that he testified on his behalf and he did not testify or that he did not testify and he testified, he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For he is taking an oath regard a specific activity which he performed or did not perform in the past.

The fact that this oath does not have a future dimension - for if one takes an oath that he will not testify, he is negating a mitzvah, and hence, it is an oath in vain (Chapter 5, Halachah 15) and not a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> - does not prevent one from being liable for the oath referring to the past.</i> there is no connection to a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> involves only the future.</i>

Chapter 10

If [both] or one of [the plaintiff's] witnesses was unacceptable, a relative,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Relatives are also among these unacceptable as witnesses. See <i>Hilchot Edut</i> from ch. 9 onward for a detailed discussion of which witnesses are not acceptable.</i> or even one of those disqualified from testifying by Rabbinic decree, the king - who is not fit to give testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 3:7) which explains that since we are required to hold the king in awe, he is not allowed to testify.

The same law applies with regard to the subsequent halachot. See Chapter 9, Halachah 14.</i> for had they testified, they would not have obligated [the defendant] to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since their testimony is not effective, they are not liable.</i>
[If the plaintiff said:] "I am administering an oath to you that you come and testify on my behalf that so-and-so promised to give me 200 <i>zuz</i>, but he did not," and [the witnesses] denied [knowledge of the matter] and took an oath, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. For even if they would testify concerning the matter, the defendant would not be liable financially because of his statement.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Making such a statement does not create a binding financial obligation (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 35a).</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
If one charged [witnesses] with testifying that he was a priest or a Levite, or that he was not the son of a woman who underwent divorce or <i>chalitzah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., were his mother to have undergone either divorce or <i>chalitzah</i>, he would be disqualified from the priesthood.</i> and [the witnesses] denied [knowledge of the matter] and took an oath, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. For this is not a financial claim.
[Similarly, although the witnesses] denied [knowledge of the matter] and took an oath, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> [if the plaintiff] charges them with testifying [with regard to the following claims]:<br>his son inflicted a wound upon him,<br>so-and-so kindled his grainheap on the Sabbath,<br>so-and-so raped or seduced his virgin daughter who had been consecrated.<br>[The rationale is that] if they were to give this testimony the defendant would be liable for execution by the court<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The son is liable for execution for wounding his father (<i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 5:5), the kindler is liable for desecrating the Sabbath, and the seducer or rapist for adultery.</i> and not for making financial recompense as we explained in <i>Hilchot Na'arah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Na'arah Betulah</i> 1:13 explains that this concept is derived from the exegesis of Exodus 21:22.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
If there was [only] one witness, he denied [knowledge of a financial claim], and an oath was administered to him, he is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. [The rationale is that] the testimony of one witness does not obligate financial payment.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nitan</i> 1:2, one witness does not make one liable financially, but it does require an oath. There are times when this requirement will also lead to financial payment, for the defendant may chose to pay rather than to take the oath. Nevertheless, since the matter depends on the defendant's choice and not the witness's testimony, he is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. See Chapter 8, Halachah 1. Nevertheless, as stated in Halachot 8-10 of this chapter, when the testimony of one witness does create an obligation for financial payment, the witness is liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>.</i>
If one charged two witnesses with testifying that his wife committed adultery and they denied [knowledge of the matter] and took an oath to that effect, they are liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. For if they had testified, they would have caused her to forfeit [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For a woman who commits adultery forfeits all the privileges granted her in her <i>ketubah</i> (ante nuptial agreement). See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:6.<br>Generally, a person who is guilty of a transgression that involves capital punishment is not held liable for any financial responsibility. This case, however, is an exception, because the woman is not paying anything. It is just that her conduct voids her husband's obligation to pay her.</i> Thus the one who charged them with testifying would be freed from liability. Hence the witnesses have denied a financial claim.
If [a husband] charges witnesses - [either witnesses] who observed him administering a [<i>sotah</i>] warning<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In the era of the Temple, when a man suspected his wife of committing adultery, he would warn her not to enter into privacy with the suspect. Two witnesses had to observe that warning being given. If she in fact entered into privacy with him afterwards as verified by two witnesses, she would have to drink the special <i>sotah</i> waters. If she had indeed committed adultery, the water would cause internal hemorrhaging and she would die. If she was innocent, she would be granted blessings. Here we are speaking of the husband charging either of these two pairs of witnesses to testify.</i> or those who observed her entering into privacy with the man concerning whom she was warned - with testifying, and they denied [knowledge of the matter] and took an oath to that effect, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. [The rationale is that] even if they had testified, [the testimony] would not result in a financial claim only in the obligation to have her drink [the <i>sotah</i>] waters. Although this testimony [can] cause her to forfeit [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> if she does not drink [the <i>sotah</i> waters],<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 2:1.</i> a matter that could lead to a financial claim is not considered as a financial claim. For it is possible that she will drink the waters and not invalidate her <i>ketubah</i>.
[A witness] is liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> [in the following situation. A man] issued a [<i>sotah</i>] warning to his wife. She entered into privacy [as observed by] two witnesses and then committed adultery, [as observed by] one witness after being warned and entering into privacy. If [the husband] administered an oath to this witness that he come and testify and he denied knowledge [of the matter], he is liable. Although he is only one witness, if he would have delivered this testimony, the woman would have been divorced without receiving [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> as explained in <i>Hilchot Sotah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 1:14. Since there are witnesses who testify that she received a warning and that she entered into privacy with the man who was singled out, there is basis to assume that she committed adultery with him. Hence the testimony of one witness is sufficient.</i>
Similarly, in any other instance where the testimony of one witness creates a financial obligation, if that witness denies knowledge [of the matter] and took an oath or an oath was administered to him in court supporting his denial, he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>.
What is implied? Both the plaintiff and the defendant were reputed [to take false] oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nitan</i> 2:1 that mentions the individuals placed in this category: those who took false oaths in the past and those disqualified from testifying because of transgressions they performed.</i> and hence they are not given the opportunity to take oaths, [the plaintiff] administered an oath to one witness that he should come and testify that so-and-so owes him a <i>maneh</i> and he denied [knowledge of the matter], he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. For were he to have testified, the defendant would have been required to pay because of his testimony, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot To'en</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot To'en V'Nitan</i> 2:4.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a woman administers an oath to one witness that he testify regarding the death of her husband and he denies [knowledge of the matter], he is liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. Were he to have testified, she would have married and received [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 12:15 which states that our Sages were lenient and accepted the testimony of only one witness in order to allow a woman to remarry. And since they allowed her to remarry on that basis, they also allowed her to collect [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.</i>
When does the above apply? When she could have collected [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> from movable property.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., she took possession of movable property during the lifetime of her husband and after his death, sought to collect the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i> from it. Otherwise, the moveable property left by her husband is not under lien to his obligations and she must expropriate his landed property. This applies according to the ruling of the Talmud. At present, however, our Rabbis have ordained that a person's movable property is on lien to all of his debts (Radbaz; see <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 16:8).</i> If, however, she could only have collected [this sum] by expropriating landed property, [the witness] is not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. This also applies if there are two witnesses, for when one administers an oath [to witnesses for claims] involving landed property, they are not liable [for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>,] as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 9, Halachah 3. This ruling also applies to the situation described in Halachah 11.</i>
When a person administers an oath to witnesses in a court and both denied [knowledge of the matter] at once, e.g., the second witness began his denial immediately after the statements of his colleague,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The term the Rambam uses has a specific halachic meaning: the time it takes to say: "<i>Shalom Elecha Rabbi</i>, as stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 17.</i> they are both liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. Each one of them must bring a sin offering<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">More specifically, an adjustable guilt offering, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 12.</i> for his oath. If the first one denied [knowledge of the matter] and the second witness waited longer than the appointed time period and then denied [knowledge of the matter], the first [witness] is liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> and the second is exempt. For even if the second had acknowledged [the obligation], his testimony would not have obligated [the defendant] financially.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since the first witness denied knowledge of the matter, the testimony of the second witness will not be effective, for he is only one witness.</i>
If one of the witnesses acknowledged [the claim] and the other denied [knowledge of it], the one who denied is liable whether he made his denial before [the other witness' acknowledgement] or afterwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">He is liable, for had he testified, his testimony would have obligated the defendant.</i> If they both denied [knowledge of the matter] at the same time and then one took the initiative and acknowledged [the matter] immediately thereafter,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., within the time period, <i>toch k'dei dibbur</i>, mentioned above. Even if he completed his own statements, his colleague spoke, and then he made the denial, he is exempt.

When a person administered an oath to two pairs of witnesses who are both fit to deliver testimony and the first group denied [knowledge of the matter] and then the second pair denied knowledge of the matter, the first are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>. [The rationale is that] they are relying on the testimony of the second pair and that testimony is sufficient to expropriate money. Hence the defendant would not be liable to make financial restitution because of the testimony of these [witnesses] who denied [knowledge of the matter] alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And hence they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> as stated in Chapter 9, Halachah 1.</i><br>If the second pair of witnesses were related to the plaintiff or to the defendant by marriage and their wives were on their deathbeds, the first pair of witnesses are also liable. For at the time the first pair made their denial, the second pair were not fit to give testimony even though they will soon be fit to give testimony when [the women] on their deathbeds die.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As long as a person is alive, he or she is considered as alive with regard to all the halachic ramifications of that state.<br>This and the following clause apply when the witnesses observed the testimony before they married the women in question.

When a person charges his witnesses with testifying on his behalf and they deny [knowledge of the matter], he administers an oath and they answer <i>Amen</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This constitutes acceptance of the oath. If, however, they remain silent outside the court, they are not considered to have accepted the oath.</i> he administers an oath four or five times and they respond to each oath outside the court, and when they come to the court, they acknowledge [the matter] and testify, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 9, Halachah 2, for witnesses to be liable, they must make their denial in court.<br>They are, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> for every oath they accepted outside the court (Radbaz).</i><br>If [when] they came to court, they persisted in their denial, they are liable for every one of the oaths [administered] outside the court.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For the same denial applies to all of them. Since they never denied the matter in court, each denial they make is still significant (in contrast to the instance mentioned in Halachah 18).</i>
When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">That they are liable for an oath administered outside the court.</i> apply? When they answered <i>Amen</i>. If, however, they did not answer <i>Amen</i>, but [merely] denied [knowledge of the matter] after every oath, they are not liable unless the oath is administered in court, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 9, Halachot 1, 10.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam concerning this issue, stating that he has made a great error in interpreting the difference of opinion between Rabbi Meir and the Sages mentioned in <i>Sh'vuot</i> 30b. The Ra'avad maintains that their difference of opinion concerns only whether the denial of knowledge of the matter must be made in the presence of the court or outside of it. Both, however, agree that an oath is significant, whether made in the presence of the court or outside of it. The Rambam, however, maintains that since the witnesses did not take the oath themselves or respond to it, they are not liable. It is only when the oath is administered in court that the oath is significant even though the witnesses do not respond to it.</i> [The rationale is that] they did not utter the oath themselves or answer <i>Amen</i>.
If [the plaintiff] administered an oath to [the witnesses] in court and they denied [knowledge of the matter] and then he administered an oath again four or five times and they deny [knowledge of the matter] each time, they are liable only once for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">They are, however, liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i> as stated in the following halachah.</i> [This applies whether the oath was administered] in court or outside the court and even if they answered <i>Amen</i> or took the oath on their initiative time after time. [The rationale is that] after they denied [knowledge of the matter] in court, were they to retract and admit [knowledge of it], their testimony would no longer be effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 3:5, once witnesses testify in court, they cannot change that testimony. Since their testimony would no longer have an effect, they are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut.</i></i>
It can thus be derived that all the oaths that they take after denying [knowledge of the matter] in court involve a denial of testimony that would not obligate [the defendant] financially. [In that instance, the witnesses] are not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>, but they are liable for a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 9, Halachah 14. This also applies to all the other instances in this chapter where it was stated that the witnesses were not liable for a <i>sh'vuat haedut</i>.</i>

Chapter 11

Just as there is a negative commandment forbidding an oath taken in vain and a false oath,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachot 7-8.</i> so, too, there is a positive commandment for a person who is obligated to take an oath in court<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 5 which mentions the oaths required by the court.</i> to take that oath in God's name,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 8-9.</i> as [Deuteronomy 6:13] states: "And you shall take an oath in His name."

See also <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:4 which states that there is a positive Scriptural commandment for a person to carry out an oath or vow he took.</i> For taking an oath in His great and holy name is one of the paths of His service. It is a great measure of glorification and sanctification to take an oath in God's name.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For this reveals the reverence and awe in which God's name is held.</i>
It is forbidden to take an oath on any other matter together with God's name.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For that implies drawing a certain equation between that other entity and God.</i> Whoever combines another matter with the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, in an oath will be uprooted from this world.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See the Radbaz who explains why the expression: "As God lives and by the life of your soul" (II Kings 2:4, 4:30) is not a contradiction of this principle.</i> For there is no one who is fit to give honor by taking an oath in his name except the [Absolute] One, blessed be He.
It is permitted for a person to take an oath to fulfill a mitzvah in order to encourage himself [toward its performance]. Although he is under oath [to observe] it from Mount Sinai [onward],<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">When the Jewish people were compelled by God to accept the Torah by oath. One might think that we would apply the principle (see Chapter 5, Halachah 11, and notes) that one oath does not take effect when another is already in effect. Hence, taking the oath would be taking God's name in vain. This is not so as the Rambam continues to explain.</i> [he may take an oath, as implied by Psalms 119:106]: "I took an oath and I will uphold it - to observe Your righteous judgments."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if David - a paradigm of pious conduct - could take an oath for this purpose, so can others.</i>
The oath which the judges administer to individuals who are obligated to take an oath is called: "The oath of the judges." [This applies whether the person] is liable for an oath according to Scriptural Law or according to Rabbinic Law.
There are three types of oaths for which one is obligated according to Scriptural Law:<br>a) A claim involving movable property<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to landed property, servants, and promissory notes (<i>Hilchot To'en V'Nitan</i> 5:1).</i> was lodged against a person by a colleague. He admitted liability for a portion and denied liability for a portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This situation is referred to by our Sages with the term <i>modeh bimiktzat</i>: "one who admits a portion." See <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nitan</i> 1:1.</i><br>b) [The defendant] denied liability for all the movable property, but one witness testifies against him, contradicting his statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">"Whenever [the testimony of] two [witnesses] would require him to make financial restitution, [the testimony of] one [witness] obligates him to take an oath" (<i>Ibid.</i>).</i><br>These two oaths come in response to a definite claim and a denial.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the plaintiff suspects the defendant is liable, but is unsure of his claim, he cannot require the defendant to take an oath (<i>ibid.</i>:7). Similarly, if the defendant is unsure whether he is liable or not, he may not take a Scriptural oath to absolve himself of responsibility.<br>The Rambam's statements here are significant in another context. There is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if a plaintiff who makes a claim that is supported by the testimony of one witness must be certain of the veracity of the claim himself or whether he can be doubtful, but rely on the testimony of the witness. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (in his gloss to <i>Hilchot Gezelah</i> 4:17 and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (in his gloss to <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nitan</i> 3:6) maintain that the Rambam follows the latter view. Here, however, it appears otherwise.</i><br>c) When a watchman claims that the article entrusted to him was lost, stolen, died, or the like, he is required to take an oath, because of the doubt, for the owner of the entrusted article does not know if the watchman is making a true claim or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>:2; <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 1:2; 2:8.</i> This oath is of Scriptural origin, as [Exodus 22:10] states: "The oath of God will be between them." <sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> states that the word <i>Shema</i> שמע serves as an acronym for the names of these three oaths: <i>Shomrim, Modeh bimiktzat, eid echad,</i> שומרים, מודה במקצת, עד אחד</i>
All oaths which the judges require aside from these three are of Rabbinic origin. They are also called "the oath of the judges." Within these oaths of Rabbinic origin, there are also two categories:<br>a) Oaths administered because of a definite claim and denial: e.g., the oath [taken by] a hired worker,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 11:6 which explains that when an employer denies owing a worker his wage, the worker may take an oath and collect his due.</i> [the oath taken by] one who impugns his promissory note,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i> 14:1.</i> and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For example, <i>Sh'vuot</i> 44b mentions several other instances when such an oath is required of a defendant: a person who claims that property was stolen from him and there is substantial circumstantial evidence corroborating his claim (see <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 4:2), a storekeeper who disputes a client's claims with regard to payment (<i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 20:8).</i><br>b) Oaths taken when [the plaintiff] has a claim of a doubtful nature, e.g., the oaths taken by partners, sharecroppers, and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shluchim V'Shutafim</i> 9:1.</i><br>In the laws of financial matters, the obligation of all these types of oaths and the associated laws will be explained.
There is also another oath which was ordained by the Sages of the Talmud.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in contrast to the oaths mentioned in the previous halachah which were established by the Sages of the Mishnah. <i>Sh'vuot</i> 40b states that this oath was ordained by Rav Nachman, one of the leading Sages in the midst of the era of the Gemara. See <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nitan</i> 1:3.<br>A defendant is required to take this oath whenever he denies entirely a claim registered against him by a plaintiff.</i> It is called a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Seifer Meirat Einayim</i> 75:16 interprets the term <i>heset</i> as meaning "placed upon," i.e., it is an oath which our Sages placed upon a person. Others interpret it as relating to the root <i>meisit</i>, meaning "entice." The purpose of this oath is to entice a defendant to admit an obligation.</i> Although it is administered by the court in the present era, it is not referred to by the term "the oath of the judges."
An oath of the judges, whether of Scriptural or Rabbinic origin, whether stemming from a definite or an indefinite claim is [administered in] the following [manner]: The person taking the oath holds a Torah scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This will impress him with the seriousness of the matter.</i> in his arm.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 87:15) quotes opinions stating that the defendant should not hold the scroll. Instead, it should be placed before him and he should place his hand on it.</i> He must stand<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he may not sit. Note, however, Halachot 11-12.</i> and take the oath or recite a curse using God's name or one of the terms used to describe Him. [Either] he pronounces the oath himself or it is pronounced by the judges. My masters<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This term is used to refer to Rav Yosef Migash, the Rambam's teacher, and Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, Rav Yosef's teacher.</i> ruled that an oath of the judges is administered only in <i>Lashon HaKodesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">"The Holy Tongue," i.e., the Hebrew of the Tanach and the Mishnah. With regard to this ruling, see Halachah 14.</i>
What is meant by an oath pronounced by [the defendant] himself? For example, he says: "I am taking an oath by God, the Lord of Israel...",<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quote Rashi (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 38b) who states that it has become customary not to administer oaths using God's name, for the awesomeness of the punishment for taking His name in vain would lay waste to the world. This principle is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 87:19).</i> "...by He whose name is graciousness...", "...by He whose name is mercy that I am not liable to this person at all." Similarly, if he says: "May one<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">He is referring to himself.</i> be cursed to God..." or "...cursed to He whose name is graciousness if I owe anything to that person."
What is meant by an oath pronounced by the judges? For example, they tell him: We are administering an oath to you by God, the Lord of Israel...", "...by He whose name is graciousness that you are not liable to this person at all" and [the defendant] answers <i>Amen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> Or they say: "May so-and-so be cursed to God..." or "...cursed to He whose name is graciousness if he owes money to that person and does not acknowledge the debt" and [the defendant] answers <i>Amen</i>. This is the oath of the judges.
When the judges administer an oath without the defendant holding a [sacred] article in his hand, they have made an error. He must take the oath again while holding a Torah scroll in his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For this is equivalent to a judge making an error in a law explicitly stated in the Mishnah, in which instance the law is that the judgment is revoked (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 38b).<br>The Rama (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 87:15) quoutes an opinion that states that a Torah scroll is not required. Any sacred text with God's name is sufficient. Similarly, in one of the Rambam's responsum, he writes that a <i>Chumash</i> is sufficient.</i> If he was holding <i>tefillin</i> when they administered the oath to him, he is not required to take the oath again. For he held [an article equivalent to] the Torah in his hand,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For Exodus 12:9 says of <i>tefillin</i>: "So that the Torah of God will be in your mouth."</i> for they are like a scroll. If they administered the oath while [the defendant] was sitting, he does not have to take the oath again.
At the outset, an oath should be administered to a Torah scholar while seated and while holding <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This is a token of respect for him. See <i>Sh'vuot</i> 38b.<br>The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 87:41 quotes Rav Hai <i>Gaon</i> who states that the term Torah scholar has been given many definitions, but that employed today is "anyone who puts on <i>tefillin</i>." On this basis, the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> writes that in the present day, there is no difference between Torah scholars and ordinary individuals.</i> He need not hold a Torah scroll. Holding <i>tefillin</i> in his hand [fulfills the requirement of] a sacred article. He takes an oath in <i>Lashon HaKodesh</i>, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 8.</i>
There is no difference between a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> and an oath of the judges except that [the latter] must be taken [while] holding a sacred article and a person who takes a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> does not hold a Torah scroll. Instead, an oath is administered to him by God's name or using one of the terms used to describe Him,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that it is not customary to administer a <i>sh'vuat hesit</i> with God's name in the present age, for we fear that people will take false oaths. Hence to reduce the punishment that might be incurred, God's name is not mentioned. To compensate for that omission, the court should employ various techniques to impress the person taking the oath with the seriousness of the matter. As the Radbaz states, his argument with the Rambam appears to be practical, but not theoretical. In the era of the Talmud, the Rambam's ruling would be followed.<br>Other authorities do not accept the Rambam's view even theoretically. They maintain that even in the era of the Talmud, a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> was not administered with God's name. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 87:18) mentions the Rambam's view, but follows that of the other authorities.</i> either an oath or a curse which he utters or which the court states, as is the practice with regard to the oath of the judges. It has already become the universal custom for the synagogue attendant or another person to hold a Torah scroll while a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> is being administered to cast fear [into the heart of the defendant].
The judges administer the oath to the person taking it in any language that he understands.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even languages other than <i>Lashon HaKodesh</i>.</i> The <i>Geonim</i> ruled in this manner. My masters, however, ruled that an oath should be administered only in <i>Lashon HaKodesh</i>. This ruling should not be relied upon.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>Sh'vuot</i> 38b, 39a and the <i>Tosefta, Sotah</i> 7:1 states that an oath can be administered in any language.</i><br>Although it has become customary to administer oaths in <i>Lashon HaKodesh</i>, the person taking the oath should be familiarized with the matter until he understands the wording of the oath. [The rationale is that] the oath of the judges is a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">And a person is liable for a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> only if he understands what he is saying, as stated in Chapter 7, Halachah 7.</i> People have even adopted the custom of administering a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> in <i>Lashon HaKodesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 20.</i>
Everyone who is obligated to take an oath of the judges that comes about because of a definite claim and denial,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 6.</i> whether it is of Scriptural or Rabbinic origin, is subjected to an admonition, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In the following two halachot.</i> Everyone who is obligated to take an oath, whether of Scriptural or Rabbinic origin, because of a doubtful claim need not be subjected to an admonition.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For the prooftext from Zechariah cited in the admonition is speaking about a definite claim. See also Halachah 19.</i>
How is an admonition administered to the person taking the oath? We tell him: Know that the entire world trembled at the time the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses [Exodus 20:7]: "Do not take the name of God, your Lord, in vain." For with regard to all the transgressions in the Torah, as [Exodus 20:7] states: "[God] will not cleanse one who takes His name in vain."<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See also Chapter 12, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 1:2.</i><br>With regard to all the transgressions in the Torah, retribution is exacted from him [alone], but with regard to [a false oath], retribution is exacted from him and from his family who conceal the matter for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sh'vuot</i> 39a derives this concept from Ecclesiates 5:5 which states: "Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin." "Your mouth" refers to taking a false oath and "your flesh" to one's family."</i> Moreover, this causes retribution to be exacted from "the enemies of the Jews,"<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Here the intent is the Jewish people themselves. Our Sages (see <i>Sukkah</i> 29a) use this expression as a euphemism.</i> for the entire Jewish people are responsible for each other,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sefer Meirat Einayim</i> 87:58 notes that this concept applies, not only with regard to a false oath, but to all the transgressions mentioned in the Torah. Nevertheless, there is a stringent aspect that applies with regard to a false oath, for with regard to other transgressions, the interrelation affects one when he has the opportunity to rebuke the transgressor and with regard to a false oath, it applies even when one does not have such an opportunity.</i> for [Hoshea 4:2-3] states: "Swearing, denying, murdering.... Therefore the land will mourn and all who inhabit it will be forlorn."<br>With regard to all the transgressions in the Torah, [retribution] is suspended for two or three generations if he possesses merit, but with regard to [a false oath], retribution is exacted immediately, as [Zechariah 5:4] states: "'I have let loose [the curse],' declares God, the Lord of Hosts, 'It will come into the house of the thief and the house of he who took an oath in My name falsely.'"<br>"I have let loose" implies immediately. "It will come into the house of the thief" - this refers to deceiving people, i.e. one who does not have money owed to him by a colleague and yet lodges a claim against him to require him to take an oath. "He who took an oath in My name falsely" - this should be interpreted literally. [The verse continues:] "It shall destroy it, its wood, and its stones." Entities that cannot be destroyed by fire and water will be destroyed by a false oath.
The concept [conveyed] by this admonition is told [to the person taking the oath] entirely in a language that they understand, so that they will understand the matter and the sinner will repent and correct [his conduct].<br>If he says: "I am not taking the oath," he is released,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sefer Meirat Einayim</i> 87:60 interprets this as meaning that he is sent away from the court. For once he leaves the court, he cannot change his mind and decide to take the oath.</i> but he must pay what his colleague demands. Similarly, if the plaintiff says: "I will not subject him to an oath and I release him," they may depart.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Once the plaintiff has retracted his request for the defendant to take the oath, he is considered to have waived his claim and can no longer prosecute it again. See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 5:1.</i>
If [the defendant] says: "I will take the oath," and [the plaintiff] persists in the claim, the people there say to each other: "Turn away from the tents of these wicked men."<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This malediction refers to the plaintiff as well. For as <i>Sh'vuot</i> 39b states, the negative repercussions of taking the oath affect them both. The Radbaz explains that the plaintiff shares in the responsibility, for he should have been more careful and not entered into a business arrangement without having the matter observed by witnesses. And if the oath is true, he should have been more careful with his accounts, so as not to require God's name to have been employed for such matters.<br>The <i>Sefer Meirat Einayim</i> 87:61 explains that when the plaintiff sees that the defendant is prepared to take a false oath, he should have offered a compromise rather than continue to pressure him and thus cause God's name to be taken in vain.</i><br>[The court] tells [the defendant]: "We are not administering the oath to you according to your understanding, but according to our understanding and the understanding of the court."<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 15-16, this measure is employed so that later, the defendant will not try to absolve himself saying: "I had this-and-this intent in my heart when taking the oath." Since the oath is being administered to him according to the understanding of others, it is their interpretation that is upheld. See <i>Sh'vuot</i> 29a and <i>Nedarim</i> 25a which speak of a defendant employing deception while taking an oath.</i>
Although this admonition is not administered for an oath taken because of a claim involving a doubt or a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Although he does not dispute the Rambam's ruling, the Radbaz questions why an admonition is not administered in these instances. The Meiri and the <i>Sefer Meirat Einayim</i> 87:61 explain that when the plaintiff is making a definite claim, it is one person's word against the other's. Thus there is reason to think that the defendant's oath is false and to prevent him from doing so, we issue this warning. When, however, an oath is taken because of a doubt, the defendant is not being challenged. Hence, there is less reason to suspect that he would take a false oath.</i> the judges should implore the litigants exceedingly [before administering these oaths] perhaps they will retract and so there will be no oaths taken at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">For in all situations, it is preferable that an oath not be taken. For this reason, courts have adopted the policy of trying to negotiate compromises in all litigation (Radbaz).</i>
It is a clear and obvious fact that anyone who takes an oath of the judges or a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> falsely, is liable for taking a [false] <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i>, the details of which have already been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapters 7 and 8.</i> Even though he willfully [took the false oath], he does not receive lashes. [Instead,] he is obligated to pay what he owes plus an additional fifth. [The fifth] is one fourth of the principal, so that the principal and the fifth are equal to five.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is one fifth of the new total and not one fifth of the original principal.</i> And he must bring a guilt offering if the oath was taken in court, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 9.<br>The Ra'avad writes that at present since God's name is not mentioned in the oath administered by the judges, there is no liability for a guilt offering or to pay the additional fifth.</i>

Chapter 12

Although a person who took a false oath or an oath in vain is given lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachot 3,7.</i> and similarly, one who takes a [false] <i>sh'vuat haedut</i> or <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> brings a sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">But are not subjected to lashes, Chapter 1, Halachah 8.</i> they do not receive complete atonement for the sin of taking a [false] oath, as [Exodus 20:7] states: "God will not cleanse [one who takes His name in vain]." He will not be absolved from the judgment of heaven until he receives retribution for his desecration of [His] great name, as [Leviticus 19:12] states: "[You shall not take a false oath in My name, for] you will desecrate the name of Your God." Therefore a person must be very careful with regard to this sin, more than with regard all other sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:10.<br>The Ra'avad differs and maintains that lashes are sufficient to atone for a person's sin entirely. The Radbaz explains that the sin of taking a false oath is two dimensional, involving not only the particular transgression of taking a false oath, but also the desecration of God's name. The lashes atone for the particular transgression of the false oath, but not for the desecration of God's name. That requires more severe retribution as the Rambam explains.</i>
This sin is considered one of the severe transgressions, as explained in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 1:2.</i> Although it does not involve <i>kerait</i> or execution by the court, it involves the desecration of [God's] holy name which is more severe than all other sins.
When a person takes an oath by the heaven and earth, by the sun, or the like, this is not an oath,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that although one is not liable for a sacrifice or lashes for such an oath, it is forbidden to take such an oath. At first, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that it is possible that this is also the Rambam's intent, but afterwards, states that the Rambam's wording implies that such statements are not considered oaths at all.<br>The Radbaz writes (and this understanding is borne out by one of the Rambam's responsa) that according to the Rambam, such an oath is not binding and need not be released. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that such oaths must be released and if they are false, one transgresses the prohibition against taking a false oath. See also the notes to the following halachah.</i> even though his intent is He who created them. Similarly, one who takes an oath by one of the prophets or by one of the texts of the Holy Scriptures, this is not an oath, even if his intent is He who sent the prophet or gave the commandments in this text.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachah and notes.</i><br>Although these are not oaths, those who take them are subjected to a severe warning and we teach the people not to act frivolously in this manner. [Indeed,] we make it look as if these are oaths and give them an opening [to ask for their absolution] and absolve them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6, Halachah 10; <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 2:12.</i>
When does the above apply? With regard to other holy texts. [Different rules apply,] however, when one takes an oath by the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with this principle, maintaining that there is no difference between the Torah and the other books of the Holy Scriptures with regard to their fundamental holiness. Thus a person who takes an oath by the contents of any of the other books of the Bible is also liable.<br>The difference between these two understandings depends on whether one understands the passage from <i>Nedarim</i> 14b as referring to only vows (as is explicitly stated, and as is the Ra'avad's understanding) or as apply also to oaths (as the Rambam maintains). The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 212:1) quotes the Rambam's view.</i> If one takes an oath by what is written in [the Torah],<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he states that explicitly.</i> his intent is by the names of God [it contains].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance the person is liable for taking an oath, as stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 2.</i> If one takes an oath by it without any further definition, his intent is on the parchment [of the scroll] and it is not considered as an oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For he is not taking an oath by God's name.</i> If he took [the scroll] in his hand and took an oath by it,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Chatam Sofer</i> (in his commentary to <i>Nedarim</i> 14b) states that the Rambam is referring to an instance where the person specifically picked up the Torah scroll for the purpose of taking an oath. Otherwise, even if he was holding the scroll in his hand before taking the oath, this law would not apply. Rashi understands the passage differently.</i> it is as if he took an oath by what was written in it and [the matter] is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For by taking the Torah scroll in his hand, the person is implying that he is considering the matter with the seriousness of an oath (<i>Nimukei Yosef</i>).</i>
[The following rules apply when] a person takes an oath by the Torah without any further definition. If he is a Torah scholar, he does not need to be released by a sage.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For he knows the distinction mentioned in the previous halachah and thus understands that the oath is not effective and does not intend for it to be binding. Note, however, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 212) who severely criticizes scholars who take an oath by the Torah, knowing that it is not effective to deceive the people to whom they are taking the oath.</i> If he is a common person,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Who does not know the above distinction.</i> it is necessary that he asked to be released by a sage so that he will not treat oaths frivolously.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Halachah 3.</i>
When a servant takes an oath, his master does not have to compel him [to break the oath to nullify it].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast to the law that applies when a servant takes a Nazirite vow (<i>Hilchot Nazirut</i> 2:7).</i> Instead, his [status] is the same after taking the oath as it was before he did so.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad, however, maintains that the Rambam's ruling applies only to oaths that will affect the servant's capacity to work. If that is not the case, the oath can take effect. As the Rambam writes in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nazirut</i> 9:1), there is a difference between vows and oaths in this regard. The Ra'avad's statement will apply with regard to vows, but not to oaths (<i>Or Sameach</i>).</i> [The rationale is that] his body is not his property for the oath he takes to be effective. With regard to oaths, [Numbers 30:3] states: "To forbid something upon one's soul." [Implied is that the verse applies to] someone whose soul is his property. It excludes a servant who is someone else's property. Thus [a servant's taking an oath] is comparable to taking an oath regarding someone else's property.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Which is not effective as stated in <i>Nedarim</i> 47a. See also Chapter 5, Halachah 1.</i>
Minors<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Boys under 12 and girls under 11. See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 11:1.</i> who take an oath are not obligated [to maintain their commitment, even though] they understand the significance of an oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For they are not liable for any of the Torah's commandments.</i> [Nevertheless,] we compel them to uphold their word to train them [in the observance of mitzvot] and to impress them with fear so that they do not act frivolously with regard to oaths. If the matter concerning which they took the oath is such that a minor could not maintain without suffering injury,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that we are not speaking about a person in mortal danger, for that would apply with regard to an adult as well. Instead, the intent is aggravation or sickness.</i> e.g., he took an oath that he would fast or that he would not eat meat for a long time, his father or his teacher should beat him and rebuke him, and create the appearance that his oath [took effect, but] was released, so that he will not be habituated to treat oaths frivolously.
We must be very careful with children and train them to speak words of truth without [resorting to] an oath so that they will not be habituated to swear at all times like gentiles do. This matter is tantamount to an obligation for their parents and for those who teach young children.
When one hears a colleague mention God's name in vain, take a false oath in his presence, or recite a blessing that is unnecessary in which instance [his colleague] transgresses<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question whether the Rambam's intent is that he has transgressed a Scriptural commandment or merely a Rabbinic one. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 30) states that the transgression is Scriptural in origin and the violator should be punished by lashing. This opinion is also mentioned by the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 215:6. From the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to <i>Hilchot Milah</i> 3:6, it appears that even the Rambam would consider the prohibition as Rabbinic in nature. The latter understanding is shared by many other <i>Rishonim</i>. Their position is - as explained by the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 215:3 - since he is reciting a blessing, his mention of God's name is not entirely frivolous.</i> because he takes God's name in vain,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See the gloss of Rabbi Akiva Eiger who questions the Rambam's statements, based on the ruling that a person who is unsure whether or not he recited the Grace After Meals must recite the blessing again. Seemingly, the recitation of that blessing would be problematic, because there is a doubt whether or not he is required to do so or not. Thus it is possible that he is transgressing a Scriptural commandment.<br>In resolution, Rabbi Akiva Eiger explains that since the person is obligated to recite the blessing, even if that obligation stems from a doubt, he is not considered to be taking God's name in vain.</i> as we explained in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 15.</i> he must place him under a ban of ostracism.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See the concluding chapters of <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> for a description of the implications of this ban.</i> If he does not, he himself should be ostracized. The ban should, however, be lifted immediately so that it will not present an obstacle to others, for they will not know that he was placed under a ban. And if one would say, "Make it known that he [is under ostracism]," the entire populace will be under ban for [people] have already habituated their tongues to iniquity<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Jeremiah 9:4.</i> and oaths at all times.
When does the above apply? When the person taking this oath or reciting this blessing in vain does so intentionally? If, however, he does so inadvertently or does not know that this is forbidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 334:18 mentions that the Rambam's view is more lenient than that of the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> who maintains that this leniency applies only when one does not know of the prohibition at all. According to his view, one who knows of the prohibition, but accidentally recites a blessing in vain must be placed under a ban.</i> [a listener] is not obligated to place him under a ban of ostracism. Indeed, I maintain that it is forbidden to place him under a ban of ostracism, for the Torah did not [prescribe] punishment for an inadvertent transgressor. Instead, one should caution him and warn him not to repeat [the transgression].
It is not only a false oath that is forbidden. Instead, it is forbidden to mention even one of the names designated for God<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the seven names for God mentioned in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, ch. 6.</i> although one does not take an oath. For the verse [Deuteronomy 28:58] commands us, saying: "to fear the glorious and awesome name."<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 4) which quotes <i>Sanhedrin</i> 56a and <i>Temurah</i> 4a as deriving this concept from another prooftext (Deuteronomy 6:13 .</i> Included in fearing it is not to mention it in vain.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For one does not treat something that is truly revered with such carelessness.</i><br>Therefore if because of a slip of the tongue, one mentions [God's] name in vain, he should immediately hurry to praise, glorify, and venerate it so that it will not have been mentioned [entirely] in vain. What is implied? If he mentions God's name, he should say: "Blessed be He for all eternity," "He is great and exceedingly praiseworthy,"<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 4:10 which states that when a person recites a blessing in vain, he should say <i>Baruch shem kevod malchuto leolam va'ed</i>, "Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever."</i> or the like so that it will not have been [mentioned entirely] in vain.
It is permitted to approach [a sage] to have an oath released as we explained<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 6, Halachah 1.</i> and there is no fault [in doing so]. [Indeed,] one who has hesitations about the matter is [showing] traces of heresy.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">For this indicates that he does not accept the Oral Tradition that Moses communicated. For the release of vows is not explicitly stated in the Torah, but instead communicated by the Oral Tradition, as stated above.</i> Nevertheless, it is appropriate to show care in this regard. One should not respond [to a request] to release [an oath] unless it involves a matter concerning a mitzvah or a great need.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6, Halachot 9-10 which gives examples of such situations.</i> It is of great benefit for a person never to take an oath at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">For it is possible that unwittingly, he could take a false oath and thus bring severe retribution upon himself and others. See <i>Gittin</i> 35a which explains how a woman unknowingly took a false oath and caused one of her sons to die.</i>If, however, one transgressed and took an oath, he should endure great difficulty and keep his oath,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:4 which states that keeping an oath or a vow fulfills a Scriptural mitzvah. Nevertheless, there is a difference between oaths and vows. As the Ra'avad (see also <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 13:25) mentions, it is desirable to have vows released. Oaths, by contrast, should be observed and not released.</i> as [Psalms 15:4-5] states: "One who takes an oath to his own detriment and does not nullify it..., he who acts in this manner will never falter."<br>Blessed be God who grants assistance.
