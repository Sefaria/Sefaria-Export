Mishneh Torah, Sales



Chapter 1

Title to an article purchased is not acquired by verbal agreement alone, even if witnesses have testified to such an agreement. If, for example, one said to a person: "I am selling you this house, I am selling you this wine, I am selling you this slave," and both agreed on the price: the purchaser was pleased and said "I have bought it," and the seller was pleased and said "I have sold it"; then they said to witnesses: "You be our witnesses that A has made a sale and B has procured a purchase," this counts as nothing, as if there had never been an oral agreement between them. The same applies to donor and donee in the case of a gift.
But if the article purchased was acquired by one of the modes of acquisition, the purchaser has gained title to it; they need no witnesses, and neither of them may retract.
In what manner is title acquired to anything bought? In the case of landed property, by one of the following three things: by money, by deed, or by undisturbed possession.
How is title acquired by money? If A sold a house or a field to B, and B paid the price to A, then B has acquired title. This applies only in a place where it is not customary to write a deed of sale ; where, however, it is customary to write a deed of sale, the purchaser acquires title only after the seller has written a deed of sale. Landed property cannot be acquired by less than a penny's worth [as a nominal consideration].


How is title acquired by deed? If the seller wrote on a paper or a potsherd or on a leaf: "My field is given to you, my field is sold to you," as soon as the deed has reached the hand of the transferee, he has acquired title.— —
How is title acquired by undisturbed possession? If A sold a house or a field to B, or gave it to him as a gift, as soon as B locked, fenced, or tore down something, for the improvement of the property, he has acquired title to it.— —
If a man sold a house to a person and handed him the key, it is as if he told the transferee: "Go, take possession and acquire title."— —
How can a man acquire title by locking? If, for example, a man sold a house or a courtyard with an open door, and the purchaser locked it and then reopened it, he has thereby performed an act of possession and acquired title, since he has made effective use of the property.

Chapter 2

A Canaanite slave is like landed property as to acquisition of title, and is acquired by money or by writ of sale or by an act of possession.
What constitutes an act of possession in the acquisition of slaves? By using them in the manner slaves are employed.— —


An animal, large or small, is acquired by drawing [it into possession].— —
How is an animal acquired by drawing? Needless to say that if the buyer pulled the animal and it moved along, or he mounted it and it moved with him, he has thereby acquired title to it; but even if he merely called the animal and it came, or he struck it with a stick and it ran before him, the moment it moved its legs to go, he acquired title to it, provided he performed the act of drawing in the presence of the owner. If, however, he performed the act of drawing in the absence of the owner, it is necessary that the owner should have told him before the drawing: "Go, draw and acquire."

Chapter 3

According to biblical law, title to both cattle and movable goods is acquired by the payment of cash; as soon as the buyer has paid the cash he has acquired title, and neither party can retract. The sages, however, have ruled that title to movable goods can be acquired only by lifting, or by drawing where lifting is not feasible.



Why did the sages institute this rule about movable goods? It was a preventive measure in a case where the object that was bought and paid for by the purchaser has been lost by accident. If, for example, a fire broke out and the object was burned, or robbers came and took it away, the seller might delay and make no effort to save the object, if the title to it should be vested in the purchaser. The sages therefore placed the object in the ownership of the seller, in order that he should strive to save it, since he is held liable to pay for it if it is lost.

Chapter 4











Be mindful of this important general rule: In buying movables, if a man agreed on the price and then performed the act of lifting up, he has acquired title; but if he first lifted the object, replaced it, and then agreed on the price, he has not acquired title by that lifting. He should lift, or pull the object that is not liftable, after agreeing on the price.



It is immaterial whether one performs the act of pulling or that of lifting or that of taking possession by himself, or he tells another to lift or take possession for him, title is thus acquired by him. So too, in other modes of acquisition.

Chapter 5

All movable property acquires other movable property. If, for example, a person has bartered a cow for a donkey or wine for oil, even though the parties are particular about the price and have made the exchange following an assessment of the worth of each article, as soon as one of them performed the act of pulling or lifting, the other has acquired title to the movables given in exchange wherever they may be at the time; they become his possession, though he has not pulled them.
If one has bartered a donkey for a cow and a lamb, and he pulled the cow and not yet the lamb, he has not acquired title, because the act of pulling has not been complete. And so in all similar cases.


Landed property, slaves, cattle and all the rest of movables may be acquired by a symbolical form of barter, known as <i>kinyan.</i> The principle of this method is that the buyer transfers to the seller an object of no matter how small a value and says to him: "Acquire this object in exchange for the courtyard or the wine or the cattle or the slave that you sold me for so much." Thereupon the moment the seller lifted the object and acquired it, the buyer has acquired title to the land or all the aforementioned movables even though he has not pulled them or paid their price, and neither party may retract.
A <i>kinyan</i> can be made only by means of objects, even if they are not worth a penny. It cannot be made with anything from which it is forbidden to derive a benefit, nor with fruit products, nor with a coin. A <i>kinyan</i> cannot be made with objects owned by the seller; instead, objects owned by the buyer must be used.
If a third person made a <i>kinyan</i> by transferring an article to the seller so that the buyer should thereby acquire title to the object for sale, then the buyer has acquired title to it. Even though the third party transferred the article to the seller on condition that the latter should return it to him, the transaction has been consummated and the buyer has acquired title, because a present made with the condition that it must be returned is legally considered a valid gift.— —

Chapter 6

Although fruit products cannot be used as a means of <i>kinyan</i>, as we have explained, they may be acquired by <i>kinyan.</i> Coins, however, can neither serve as a means of <i>kinyan</i> nor be acquired by <i>kinyan.</i> Hence, a coin is not to be acquired by <i>kinyan</i> [in terms of a commodity], and should not be used as a means of <i>kinyan</i> to effect the acquisition of other objects.
Lumps of gold or silver are like bars of iron or copper, all of which are like any other movable property and may be acquired by <i>kinyan</i>, and acquire each other in a form of exchange, as we have explained. But silver coins, gold denars, or copper small change are all regarded as purchasing money in relation to any other movable property. Thus, if one has given any of these as the price of movables, he has not acquired title to the movables unless he pulled or lifted them, as we have explained. None of the coins can be acquired by <i>kinyan</i> or used as a means of <i>kinyan.</i>
This applies only where one intends to acquire other movables, slaves and landed property, by means of the aforementioned coins. However, gold denars in relation to silver coins have the status of fruit products; so too, copper small change is comparable to fruit products with regard to silver coins.
If, for instance, one gave to a person a gold denar in exchange for its equivalent twenty-five silver denars, he has acquired title to the silver even though it has not yet reached him, and the other party is obligated to deliver the twenty-five silver denars, according to the bargain made. If they agreed on new coins, he must deliver new coins; if old coins, he must deliver old coins. If, on the other hand, he gave him twenty-five silver denars in exchange for a gold denar, he has not acquired title to the gold denar unless he has taken it in his hand ; otherwise, either party may retract.

So too, disused currency that the government or the state has canceled, or denars that are not current in that state and are not used as a means of transaction unless they are recast into another coin, are regarded as fruit products in every respect and can be acquired by <i>kinyan;</i> they can acquire title to money, but money cannot acquire title to them, just as all fruit products [cannot be used as a means of <i>kinyan</i>].

Chapter 7

If a man paid the price but has not drawn the product [from the seller into his possession], even though title to the article has not been acquired, as we have explained, the one who retracts, whether the buyer or the seller, does not act properly as a Jew should, and must receive the curse expressed in the formula "He who punished…" Even if the man gave only the earnest money, the one who retracts receives the curse beginning with the phrase "He who punished…"
How is he to receive this curse? They speak a curse against him as follows: "He who punished the generation of the flood and the generation of the tower of Babel, the men of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the Egyptians who were drowned in the sea, will punish him who does not stand by his word." Then the money is refunded.

If a person to whom a debt was due said to the debtor: "Sell me a cask of wine for the debt you owe me," and the seller agreed, it is as if the creditor paid the money now, and therefore the one who retracts must receive the curse formula. Accordingly, if one has sold a piece of land to a person for a debt he owed him, neither of them can retract, even though the money of the debt is not available at the time of the sale.
If one buys from a person land or slaves or other movable property, both having agreed on the price, and the buyer has deposited a pledge for the money, he has not acquired title ; and either of them may retract without being required to receive the curse [against one who fails to keep his word].
If one sold an article to a person merely by verbal agreement, both having agreed on the price, and the buyer has marked the purchased article in order to have a distinct sign indicating that it is his, even though he has not yet paid any money, then either one who retracts must receive the curse formula.— —

Anyone who transacts business by verbal agreement alone should keep his word, although he has received no money, made no mark, and left no pledge. If either of them, purchaser or seller, retracts, he belongs to the class of dishonest men and the sages are displeased with him, although he is not required to receive the curse formula.

If one gave money to a person to buy for him land or movable property, and the person put away the other's money and went ahead and purchased the property for himself with his own money, what he has done is done, and he is included among the cheats.

Chapter 11

If one has transferred land or movable property and stipulated conditions that are possible of performance, title to the object is acquired if the conditions are fulfilled, whether they were stated by the transferor or the transferee. The latter cannot acquire title if the conditions are not fulfilled. We have already explained the rules of conditions in the section dealing with the laws of matrimony.






If one sold his courtyard or his field and specified at the time that he was selling it in order to make a journey to a certain place, or owing to want of rain, — — it is as if he made the sale on condition. Accordingly, if rain fell after he had made the sale — — or it became impossible for him to make the trip to that particular country, — — he may refund the money and the land will be restored to him, because he stated explicitly that he was selling only to accomplish a specific thing, and it was not accomplished. And so in all similar cases.
If, however, one sells unconditionally, even though he has in mind the reason why he is making the sale, and although circumstances make it clear that he is selling merely to accomplish a certain thing, he cannot retract if it is not accomplished, because he has not specified it, and mental reservations are not effective.


It once happened that a woman appointed Reuben as her agent to buy her a courtyard from Simeon who was her relative. Simeon, the seller, said to Reuben, the agent: "When I will have money, will that lady who is my relative return this land to me?" And Reuben replied: "You and that lady are as close as brother and sister," as if he meant to say: "It is very likely that she will restore it to you, since she does not care much for it." When this case reached the sages, they declared: "This agent had acquired no title, because the relative had not relied on the words of the agent who had given him no definite reply; hence, he had not resolved to sell." And so in all similar cases.


If a person has obligated himself unconditionally to pay an amount of money to another person, whom he owes nothing at all, he must pay it.— — If, for example, a man said to witnesses: "Be witnesses that I owe that person one hundred shekels," — — or, in the presence of witnesses, he said to another: "I owe you one hundred shekels by writ," he must pay; even though he omitted saying "be my witnesses," it is as if he said it, because he used the phrase "by writ." Even though both parties admit, and the witnesses know that he owes him nothing, he has obligated himself like one who has made a guaranty. The majority of the Geonim have decided the case in this manner.

Chapter 12

Both seller and buyer are forbidden to defraud each other, as it is written : "When you sell to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong each other" (Leviticus 25:14).— — Whether one has deceived deliberately or has not been aware of the fraud in a particular sale, he must repay.
What are the legal limits of deceit requiring repayment? A sixth of the value of the article. If, for example, one has sold an article worth six denars for five, or worth seven for six, or worth six for seven, or worth five for six, it is a fraud where the transaction is valid but the defrauder has to repay the defrauded amount to the person deceived.
If the fraud has amounted somewhat less than that, — — the defrauder is not required to restore anything, since it is generally customary to forego anything less than a sixth.
If the fraud has amounted somewhat more than a sixth, — — the transaction is void and the defrauded party may return the article and not buy it at all. The defrauder, however, cannot retract if the other person is pleased and accepts the deal.— —



The law against defrauding applies to an ordinary purchaser and a merchant alike, even though he is an expert. The law against defrauding applies to coins as well as to fruit products and cattle.
If, for example, a golden denar was valued at twenty-four silver denars and he exchanged it for twenty or twenty-eight denars, he must refund the amount defrauded. If it was more than this, the exchange deal is invalid; if less than this, it is remitted.

Chapter 13





If one transacts business on word of honor, the law against defrauding does not apply to him. If, for example, one says : "I have bought this article for so much and I make so much profit on it," the purchaser can have no claim of fraud against him.


The law of defrauding does not apply to the following items : real estate, slaves, deeds, and Temple property. Even if one has sold them for one denar when they are worth a thousand, or for a thousand when they are worth one denar, the law against defrauding does not apply to them, as it is written: "… or buy from your neighbor's hand" (Leviticus 25:14), meaning something transferred from hand to hand. Real estate is excluded, and so are slaves who are compared to landed property; deeds are excluded, since they have no intrinsic value and serve only for the evidence they contain. The term "your neighbor" excludes Temple property.

Chapter 14

We have already explained that if one transacts business on word of honor and has said: "I am making so much profit," the law against defrauding does not apply to him. Even if he said: "I have bought this article for one <i>sela</i> and am selling it for ten," it is legitimate. The courts, however, are required to fix prices and appoint officers for that purpose, so that any merchant should not make all the profit he desires; the law courts should establish one-sixth of the price as the merchants' profit; and let the seller not profit more than one-sixth.
This rule applies only to commodities that are necessary to life, such as wines, oils, kinds of flour; but for spices such as costus roots, frankincense, and the like, no market price should be fixed, and let the merchant make all the profit he desires.









Just as there is a law against defrauding in buying and selling, so there is a law against wronging a person by means of words, as it is written: "You shall not wrong each other, but you shall fear your God; I am the Lord" (Leviticus 25:17). This refers to wounding the feelings of another by words.
If, for instance, someone is a repentant sinner, one must not say to him: "Remember your former deeds." If a proselyte comes to study Torah, one must not say to him: "Shall the mouth that ate unclean and forbidden food study Torah which has been given by the Lord?" If a person has been afflicted with disease and suffering, or if he has buried his children, one must not say to him in the words used by Job's companions in addressing Job: "Let your piety reassure you… Think now, what guiltless man has ever perished?" (Job 4:6-7).




A wrong inflicted by means of words is worse than a wrong inflicted in financial dealings, because restitution can be made for one and not the other; one is financial, while the other is personal. Concerning the wrong we do by means of words, the Torah says: "You shall fear your God" (Leviticus 25:17), since it is a matter entrusted to the heart [over which the legal authorities have no control]. Indeed, anything that is left to the conscience of the individual is referred to by the biblical expression <i>you shall fear your God.</i> Whoever cries out to God on account of a wrong done by means of words is answered immediately, as it is written: "… for I am the Lord" (Leviticus 25:17).

Chapter 15



Chapter 16



Chapter 17



Chapter 18

It is forbidden to deceive people in business dealings, as well as by false pretenses; non-Jews and Jews are all alike in this respect. If one is aware of a defect in the article he is selling, he must let the purchaser know about it. It is forbidden to cheat people even by the use of mere words.

Chapter 19

One cannot tranfser title to what does not yet exist whether by sale, or by gift, or by bequest of a person who is critically ill. If, for example, a person says to another: "What this field will yield is sold to you, what this tree will yield is given to you, give to so-and-so what this animal will bear," no title is acquired thereby. And so in all similar cases.

If one sells the soil itself for a specified time, it is a valid sale and the purchaser may use the land as he pleases, enjoying its fruit products throughout the period of the sale. At the end of the period, the land reverts to its original owner.
What difference is there between a person who sells land for a specified period and one who transfers it for the use of its fruit products? One who buys land for the use of its fruit products may not alter the shape of the land and may not build or demolish anything on it; on the other hand, one who buys it for a specified period may build or demolish on it, doing with it during the entire specified time as one who buys it in perpetuity.
What is the difference between one who sells a field for the use of its products and one who sells only the products of that field to another? When one merely sells the products of the field, the buyer may not make use of that field at all, not even enter it, except for the purpose of removing the products, while the owner of the field may use it as he pleases. But the owner of a field who sells it for the use of its products may enter it only with the consent of the purchaser, while the purchaser may make use of it as he pleases.
What is the difference between one who buys a field for the use of its products and one who rents a field from another? One who buys a field for the use of its products may plant it or sow it whenever he pleases, or leave it untilled ; but the person who rents it may not do so, as it will be explained in connection with leasing. Besides, the person who rents something may not rent it out to a third party; but one who buys may transfer to others whatever he has bought.
If one sells the products of a dovecot or the products of a beehive to another, the latter has acquired title ; and it is not considered as if he were selling something nonexistent, because he is not selling doves that will be born or honey that will come into the hive, but he is selling the dovecot for the use of its products or the beehive for the use of its honey. It is like one who leases a pond to another person, where the latter may benefit from whatever he catches there. So too, the person who transfers this dovecot for the use of its products is like one who sells a tree for the use of its fruit.— —

Chapter 29

There are three whose purchase or sale is invalid according to biblical law: the deaf-mute, the imbecile, and the minor. The sages, however, have enacted that the deaf-mute or the minor may have valid business dealings for his livelihood.
How does a deaf-mute make a transaction? If one neither hears nor speaks, or speaks but hears nothing, he can buy movable goods by signs, but not landed property. Even with movable goods, his transactions are valid only after he has passed many tests and the court has duly deliberated the case.
A speechless person who hears though he cannot speak, or one who has been paralyzed and rendered speechless, both his purchase or sale is valid, and so are his gifts valid in every respect, both in movable goods and in landed property, provided he has been examined by the court in the manner that tests are given in divorce cases, or if he can write with his own hand.
Neither the purchase nor the sale of an imbecile is valid, nor are his gifts valid. The court appoints an administrator for imbeciles as it does for minors.
One who is alternately insane and sane, as in the case of epileptics, the rule is that when he is sane all his dealings are valid and he may acquire ownership for himself and for others like any sensible person. The witnesses should investigate the matter thoroughly to be sure that he did not perform the act toward the end or at the beginning of his lapse into insanity.


The minor should be tested whether or not he is familiar with the nature of business. Sometimes a seven-year-old youngster is clever and intelligent, while another as old as thirteen knows nothing about the nature of a transaction. If a youngster, knowing the nature of business and having no guardian, has made a deal in movable goods and committed an error, his legal status is that of an adult : less than one-sixth is remitted ; one-sixth, the difference is refunded ; [an overcharge of] more than one-sixth, the transaction is invalid, as we have explained.









The purchase or sale by a drunken man, and his gifts, are valid. If, however, he has reached the drunken condition of Lot, being too drunk to know what he is doing, his transactions mean nothing, since he has the legal status of a youngster less than six years old.
