Mishneh Torah, Ownerless Property and Gifts



Chapter 1

Whoever takes possession of ownerless property gains title to it. Similarly, whatever is available in deserts, rivers and streams, is ownerless property ; whoever comes first, gains title to it; for example, grass, wood, fruit of forest trees, and the like.
If one catches fish in lakes and rivers, or if he catches birds and various wild animals, he gains title, because they are ownerless. However, one should not catch them in another's field ; but if he did catch them there, he has gained title. If the fish, animals and birds, are kept in vivariums owned by others, even if it is a large vivarium where they still must be hunted, they belong to the owner of the vivarium, and whoever hunts there is a robber.

Chapter 2



Chapter 3

If one presents a gift to a person, the donee acquires title to it only by one of several ways whereby a buyer acquires title to the object he has purchased. If, for example, one wishes to make a gift to a person of some movable property, the donee acquires title after lifting it, or drawing it [to his possession] where lifting is not feasible, or by other means whereby movable goods are acquired. If it is landed property or slaves that he gives him, the donee acquires title only after performing an act of possession as a buyer would, or after obtaining the deed of gift. The donee does not gain title by mere words, in which case either of the two may still retract.




Whoever has made a gift conditionally, regardless of whether the donor or the donee has imposed the condition, and the donee has taken possession and title, then the gift is valid if the condition has been fulfilled; if not, the gift is null and void, and the donee must restore the products he has consumed; provided the condition is properly phrased.
We have already explained that all conditions in connection with gifts, purchases and sales, must contain a double stipulation; the affirmative must be stated before the negative; the condition must precede the act: and the condition must be possible of performance. If one of these provisions is missing, the condition is null and void, as if there has been no condition.
Anyone who says "on condition" is as if he were to say "from now on," and is not required to use a double stipulation. I am inclined to agree with some Geonim who formulated this decision. My teachers, however, have taught that only in cases of divorce and marriage is it required to state a double stipulation, where the affirmative should precede the negative. But there is no proof that this is so.

Chapter 4



Chapter 5

If one presents a gift, whether in a state of good health or in illness, it should be open and publicized. If a person said to witnesses: "Write a deed of gift secretly and give it to him," it is not effective, because he may be acting subtly so as to cause a loss to others by selling it to someone after having presented it as a gift.



It once happened that a man wanted to marry a certain woman, who told him: "I will not be wedded to you unless you deed all your property to me." His adult son heard of this and complained that he was leaving him without anything. The father thereupon said to witnesses: "Go hide yourselves and deed all my estate to my son as a gift." Then he deeded all his estate to the woman and married her. When the case came before the sages, they said: Neither the son nor the woman acquired title, since the man manifested his unwillingness to deed it to her when he first presented it to his son, even though the gift was invalid because it was concealed. It is as if he had acted under compulsion [when deeding his entire estate to his future wife]. And so it is in all similar cases.

Chapter 6

We should always appraise the intention of the donor. If circumstances show his final intention, we should act according to the appraisal, even though he failed to specify. To illustrate: A man whose son had gone abroad heard that he died, so he deeded his estate to another person as a completely undisguised gift, and then his son arrived home. The gift in such a case is invalid, because the circumstances make it evident that had he known that his son was alive he would not have given away his entire estate. Accordingly, if he has reserved some of his estate for himself, whether landed or movable property, his gift would be valid.
So too, if one deeded his entire estate as a gift to one of his sons, it is immaterial whether he was at the time in good health or dangerously ill, then even if the son is only an infant lying in the cradle, [it is assumed that] the father has appointed him merely as an administrator, and he shares the entire estate equally with his brothers. It is assumed that the father merely intended to have his brothers submit to his authority. However, if he had reserved anything for himself, whether land or movables, the son would have gained title to the gift.
This applies only where he deeded the gift to one of his sons. If, however, he deeded his entire estate to a son among daughters or to a daughter among daughters or to one heir among other heirs, then even if he has not reserved anything for himself his gift is valid.

Chapter 7

There is a widespread custom in most countries that when a man marries, his friends and acquaintances send him money whereby to recover from the strain of expense in providing for his wife. Those friends and acquaintances who have sent him money come to eat and drink with the groom during the seven days of celebration, or some of them, all in accordance with local custom. The money they send is referred to as wedding gifts, and those who send the money and eat and drink with the groom are referred to as groomsmen.
A groomsman's gift is not a perfect gift. It is well known that he has not sent ten denars to eat and drink for it ; he has sent it only with the intention of having his friend send it back to him upon the occasion of his own marriage. Hence, if he got married and the other failed to restore his wedding gift, he can sue him and collect.
He cannot sue him unless he marries in the same manner as the other did. If, for instance, Reuben married a maiden and Simeon sent him a wedding gift, and then Simeon married a widow. He cannot sue Reuben to restore the wedding gift to him, because Reuben may plead: "I will return it to you only if you marry a maiden, as when you gave me a gift." Similarly, if a man sent a groomsman's gift to one who married a widow, he cannot claim it back when he marries a maiden.
If Reuben made a public feast and Simeon made one privately, or if Reuben made a private feast and Simeon made one publicly, they cannot claim anything from each other, because each may plead: "I will do for you only as you have done for me."








Five things have been asserted about a groomsman's gift: it is collectible through the court, because it is only a loan; it is paid at the proper time only, when the donor marries in the same manner as has the donee, because it is considered as if he had sent the gift on that condition, although he did not explicitly say so; the law against usury does not apply here; that is, even if he sent one denar and the other repaid ten denars it is permissible, because he did not send the denar on condition that the other should return it with an increase; the sabbatical year does not cancel it, because the donor cannot press for its return unless he himself gets married in the manner of the donee ; the firstborn does not obtain a double share of it if it is repaid to the heirs, because it is only prospective, and the firstborn does not take a double share of what is expected to fall due to the father's estate, as it will be explained in the right place.

Chapter 8

A blind man, a lame man, a one-armed man, or a person with a headache, or one with a sore eye, or one whose hand or foot hurts, or the like, is legally considered in sound health in reference to everything : his buying, selling, and transfer of gifts [are valid].
However, a sick person whose entire body has weakened and whose strength has given way owing to disease, so that he cannot walk in the street but is confined to bed, is referred to as critically ill ; the rules governing his gifts are unlike those that govern the gift of a healthy man. If, for example, a person who is critically ill bequeaths a certain amount to a certain individual, then regardless of whether he stated this on a weekday or on the Sabbath, in writing or not, the donee acquires title to whatever the man has left him upon his death ; no <i>kinyan</i> is required, since the verbal statement of one who is critically ill is like a deed written and delivered. This is one of the rabbinic enactments. Even though it is merely a rabbinic enactment, it has been given the force of a biblical law, that the patient's mind might not become deranged knowing that his words are invalid.




















If a moribund person made a bequest because of imminent death, as when he intimated that he felt sure he was dying, he may retract if he has recovered, even though part of his estate was acquired by means of a symbolical <i>kinyan.</i>
If a man departs on a sea voyage or sets out with a caravan or is led out in chains or is on the verge of death, having been suddenly overwhelmed by a sickness which worsened, his instructions in each of the four situations are deemed orders of a man on the verge of death, and his words are like a deed written and delivered ; they are made valid if he dies. If he has been saved or has recovered, he may retract even if there has been a <i>kinyan</i> for part of his estate, in keeping with the legal status of anyone who makes a bequest because of imminent death.

Chapter 9















If a dying man deeded his estate to one person and then to another, the last one has acquired it, because the moribund can retract until he dies.— —




If a dying person has made a sale, it is as valid as that made by a healthy man.

In the case of a gift deed made out indefinitely, in which it was not specified whether the donor was in sound health or on the verge of death, if the donor claims: "I was critically ill, and now that I have recovered I retract my gift," and the donee declares: "He was in good health and he cannot retract," then the donee must bring proof that the donor was in good health. If he has found no proof, the donor takes an exemption oath whereby he is freed, and the land remains in the possession of the donor.

Chapter 10



Chapter 11



Chapter 12

If a dying person said: "This son of mine shall be my heir," then that son alone is his heir and the other sons are not. So too, if he said this in reference to one of his daughters or one of his brothers or other heirs, his words are valid.
However, if a man in good health makes such a statement, his words are invalid.











If a deed of gift made by a person in sound health contains the phrase <i>from today and after death</i>, it is like a gift of a moribund person, title to which is acquired only ofter the donor's death, because the meaning of these words is that, though the donee has acquired the substance as of today, he obtains possession of it and may eat its products only after the donor's death.
If it is written in a deed of gift that a certain party shall acquire title to a certain piece of land after the donor's death, it is immaterial whether or not the deed contains a <i>kinyan</i>, and the beneficiary acquires title now to become effective after the donor's death. Since the deed contains a date, and on that date the donor was alive, the date proves that he transferred title to the donee while still alive. Had the donor intended to transfer title by this document [not while alive but] after his death, he would not have stated the date. Accordingly, even if it is not written in the document <i>from today and after death</i>, the beneficiary has the right of ownership after the donor's death. The reason that we do write in all gift and sale documents <i>from now</i>, even if they are dated, is only to expatiate by inserting what is not absolutely necessary.
If a man in sound health gave a gift and wrote in the deed <i>in life and in death</i>, it is a perfectly valid gift in life, since <i>in life</i> is written in the document. The phrase <i>and in death</i> means about the same as <i>henceforth and forever</i>, and it is one of those embellishments inserted in the texture of a deed.
Sincerely upright men of good works do not accept gifts from men; they trust in God, blessed be he, and not in philanthropists. Indeed, it is written: "He who hates gifts will live" (Proverbs 15:27).
