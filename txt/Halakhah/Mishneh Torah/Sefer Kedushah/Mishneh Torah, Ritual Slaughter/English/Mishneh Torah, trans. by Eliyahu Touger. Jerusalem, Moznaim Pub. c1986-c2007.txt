Mishneh Torah, Ritual Slaughter



Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 146) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 451) include this among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. As mentioned at the beginning of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Ra'avad differs and does not consider this a mitzvah.</i> for one who desires to partake of the meat of a domesticated animal, wild beast, or fowl to slaughter [it] and then partake of it,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording echo his statements in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:2: "There are other mitzvot that are not obligations, but resemble voluntary activities, for example, the mitzvah of <i>mezuzah</i>.... A person is not obligated to dwell in a house that requires a <i>mezuzah</i> in order to fulfill this mitzvah." Similarly, in the instance at hand, a person is not obligated to slaughter. If, however, he desires to eat meat, he must fulfill this mitzvah.</i> as [Deuteronomy 12:21] states: "And you shall slaughter from your cattle and from your sheep." And with regard to a firstborn animal with a blemish,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> who elaborates, explaining that although Rashi does not interpret the verse in the same manner the Rambam does, there is support for the Rambam's interpretation.</i> [<i>ibid.</i>:22] states: "As one would partake of a deer and a gazelle." From this, we learn that a wild beast is [governed by] the same [laws] as a domesticated animal with regard to ritual slaughter.<br>And with regard to a fowl, [Leviticus 17:13] states: "that will snare a beast or a fowl as prey... and shed its blood." This teaches that shedding the blood of a fowl is analogous to shedding the blood of a wild beast.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in both instances, ritual slaughter is required. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that <i>Chulin</i> 27b derives this equivalence from another source and explains why the Rambam cites this verse instead.</i>
The laws governing ritual slaughter are the same in all instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> who explains that there are some differences between the laws governing the slaughter of each of these types of animals.</i> Therefore one who slaughters a domesticated animal, beast, or fowl should first<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For the blessings for all mitzvot must be recited before their observance (<i>Pesachim</i> 7b).</i> recite the blessing: "[Blessed...] who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">We do not, however, say "to slaughter," for, as above, the mitzvah to slaughter is not obligatory. It is dependent on the person's desire (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15).</i> ritual slaughter." If he did not recite a blessing, either consciously or inadvertently, the meat is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For after the fact, the recitation of the blessings is not essential (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>It is forbidden to partake of a slaughtered animal throughout the time it is in its death throes.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Partaking of the meat at this time does not, however, represent a transgression of the prohibitions against eating a limb or flesh from a living animal (see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>, ch. 5). For once the animal has been slaughtered, these prohibitions no longer apply.</i> When a person partakes of it before it dies, he transgresses a negative commandment. [This act] is included in the prohibition [Leviticus 19:26]: "Do not eat upon the blood." He does not, however, receive lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This prohibition is considered as a prohibition of a general nature (<i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3), i.e., prohibitions that include several diverse and unrelated acts, and lashes are not given for the violation of such prohibitions.</i><br>It is permitted to cut meat from it after it has been ritually slaughtered, but before it dies. That meat should be salted thoroughly, washed thoroughly,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's words provoke a question: Of course, this meat must be salted thoroughly as must all meat so that its blood will be removed (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 6:10). Why would one think that this meat is different?<br>It would appear that the explanation is that other meat may be eaten if it is roasted or its blood sealed by being cast into vinegar (<i>ibid.</i>:12) and these options do not apply with regard to the meat in question.</i> and left until the animal dies. Afterwards, it may be eaten.
Fish and locusts need not be slaughtered. Instead, gathering them causes them to be permitted to be eaten. [This is indicated by Numbers 11:22]: "Can sheep and cattle be slaughtered for them that will suffice them? If all the fish of the sea would be gathered for them...." This indicates that gathering fish is like slaughtering cattle and sheep. And with regard to locusts, [Isaiah 33:4] states: "the gathering of the locusts," i.e., gathering alone [is sufficient]. Therefore if fish die naturally in the water, they are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">One might think that man would have to gather them alive for them to be permitted. Hence the Rambam emphasizes that this is not so (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). The general principle is: Whenever the mitzvah of ritual slaughter does not apply, the prohibitions against eating flesh from a living animal and eating a dead animal do not apply.</i> And it is permitted to eat them while they are alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that <i>Shabbat</i> 90b states that one who eats a live locust violates the prohibition: "Do not make your souls detestable." [See also Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 13:1) who issues a similar warning with regard to partaking of live fish.) How then can the Rambam say that it is permitted?<br>Among the resolutions of this question are:<br>a) The passage in <i>Shabbat</i> refers only to a non-kosher locust, not a kosher one.<br>b) The Rambam, here, is saying that one may cut off part of a living locust and eat it, but not that one may eat an entire locust alive.<br>c) Here the Rambam is speaking with regard to the laws regarding ritual slaughter. He is not focusing on those involving other prohibitions.</i>
The slaughter which the Torah mentions without elaboration must be explained so that we know: a) which place in the animal is [appropriate] for ritual slaughter?, b) what is the measure of the slaughtering process?, c) with what do we slaughter?, d) when do we slaughter?, e) in which place [on the animal's neck] do we slaughter? f) how do we slaughter, g) what factors disqualify the slaughter? h) who can slaughter?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In the following chapters, the Rambam proceeds to answer all of these questions.</i><br>We were commanded concerning all of these factors in the Torah with the verse [Deuteronomy 12:21]: "And you shall slaughter from your cattle... as I commanded you." All of these factors were commanded to us orally as is true with regard to the remainder of the Oral Law which is called "the mitzvah," as we explained in the beginning of this text.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the Introduction that precedes <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>. There the Rambam explains that the Oral Law is called "the mitzvah," because it gives us instruction concerning the observance of the mitzvot. Without it, we would not know how to fulfill them.</i>
The place where an animal should be slaughtered is the neck. The entire neck is acceptable for slaughtering.<br>What is implied? With regard to the gullet,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained in Halachah 9, ritual slaughter involves cutting the gullet and the windpipe. In this halachah, the Rambam defines where the gullet may be cut.</i> from the beginning of the place where when it is cut, it contracts until the place where hair grows<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the surface of the gullet which is smooth.</i> and it begins appearing fissured like the stomach, this is the place of slaughter with regard to the gullet.
If one slaughters above this place - in the area called the entrance to the gullet<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the end of the throat, where it is attached to the jaw..</i> - or below this place - i.e., the beginning of the digestive system, the slaughter is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The animal is considered a <i>nevelah</i> and it is forbidden to partake of it. See Chapter 3, Halachah 18 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, note <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 20:5).</i><br>The measure of the entrance to the gullet above which is unfit for slaughter in an animal or a beast is so one can grab it with two fingers.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Chulin</i> 44a. Rashi interprets that passage as referring to a space the size of four fingers. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 20:2) follows the Rambam's understanding, while the Rama cites that of Rashi.</i> With regard to a fowl, it depends on its size. The lower limit extends until the crop.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The first of the fowl's stomachs. The crop is not considered part of the gullet and it is forbidden to slaughter there.</i>
Where is the place of slaughter with regard to the windpipe? From the slant of its cap<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The windpipe is made up of a series of rings. Above the top ring, there is a slanted covering that is called the cap.</i> downward until the beginning of the flank of the lung when the animal extends its neck to pasture,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">When the animal extends its neck, the flanks of its lungs rise upward.</i> this is the place of slaughter with regard to the windpipe. The area opposite this place on the outside is called the neck.
When the animal strained itself and extended its neck exceedingly or the slaughterer applied exertion to the signs and extended them upward, but slaughtered in the neck at the place of slaughter, there is an unresolved doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Chulin</i> 45a which discusses these questions but leaves them unresolved.</i> whether [the animal] is a <i>nevelah</i>. For the place where the gullet and windpipe were cut is not the place where [the animal] is [usually] slaughtered.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the place of slaughter on the neck should be aligned with the place of slaughter on the windpipe and the gullet in their natural position. In this instance, the external place of slaughter - the position on the neck - was correct, but the signs were not cut in the usual place.</i>
The slaughterer must slaughter in the center of the neck. If he slaughters to the side, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This applies only after the fact. At the outset, one must slaughter in the center of the neck.</i><br>What is the measure of slaughter? That one [cut] the two identifying marks, the windpipe and the gullet.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Since the acceptability of the slaughter is dependent on them, they are referred to as the <i>simanim</i>, "signs," i.e., indications that the slaughter is acceptable.</i> Superior slaughter involves cutting both of them, whether for an animal or a fowl and a slaughterer should have this intent. [After the fact,] if one cut the majority of one of them for a fowl and the majority of both of them for an animal or a beast, the slaughter is acceptable.
When one cut one sign entirely and half<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">But not the majority.</i> of the other sign when slaughtering an animal, his slaughter is unacceptable. If he cut the majority of both signs, even though in each instance he cuts only a hair's breadth more than half, it is acceptable. Since he cut even the slightest amount more than half,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 21:2 who emphasizes that the difference in size need not be significant. As long as more than half is cut, the slaughter is acceptable.</i> he has cut the majority.
If he cut half<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">But no more than half.</i> of one and half of the other - even in a fowl - the slaughter is unacceptable. When a windpipe is half slit<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This is speaking about a situation where the animal is alive. The fact that an animal's windpipe is slit slightly does not cause it to be considered as a <i>trefe</i>. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 21:5) adds that we must be careful that the gullet has not been punctured, for that would render the animal <i>trefe</i>. See the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 21:4 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 21:5 who debate whether it is possible to rely on this leniency at present. See also Chapter 3, Halchot 6-7.</i> and one cut a little more on the place of the slit, making the cut a majority, the slaughter is acceptable. [This applies] whether one begins [on a portion of the windpipe] that is intact and reaches the slit or one inserts the knife into the slit and [increases its size until it] reaches the majority.
Every slaughterer must check the signs after he slaughters.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">To make sure that the minimal measure for slaughter was slit.</i> If he did not check and the animal's head was cut off before he could check,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, once the head is cut off, it is no longer possible to check.</i> [the animal] is [considered] a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the doubt involved. See the following halachah.</i> [This applies even] if the slaughterer was adroit and expert.
During its lifetime, every animal is considered to be forbidden until it is definitely known that it was slaughtered in an acceptable manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This is the rationale for the stringency stated in the previous halachah (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
With what can we slaughter? With any entity, with a metal knife, a flint, glass, the edge of a bulrush,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that many marsh plants splinter easily and they are unacceptable for they will perforate the gullet.</i> or the like among the entities that cut. [This applies] provided its edge is sharp and does not have a barb. If, however, there was a spike at the edge of the entity with which one slaughters, even if the spike is very small,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, it is accepted that a spike that can be detected by a fingernail disqualifies an animal. Nevertheless, the Rambam appears to be referring to an even smaller measure. His approach is followed by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 18:2) which speaks of a spike that is even the size of a hairsbreadth being sufficient to disqualify a knife.<br>Alternatively, it can be understood that the two are synanomous. This understanding is reflected by <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:14 which speaks about "a stone being blemished so that a fingernail would become caught in it like a knife used for ritual slaughter."</i> the slaughter is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For the spike will perforate the gullet, rendering the animal <i>trefe</i> before the slaughter was completed (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>
If the spike was on only one side of the knife, one should not slaughter with it [at the outset]. [After the fact,] if one slaughtered with it using the side on which the blemish was not detectable, the slaughter is acceptable.
What is implied? There was a knife that was checked by passing it [over one's finger] and no blemish was felt on it, but when one drew it back, one felt that it had a blemish. If one slaughtered with it by passing it forwards and did not draw it back, the slaughter is acceptable. If one drew it back, the slaughter is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries offer two explanations for this ruling. The Rambam's position is that when the spike is felt only on one side of the knife, one may slaughter with that side. Others add that the blemish must be positioned to the very far end of the knife, either near its point or near its handle. In such an instance, it is possible that the blemish never actually touched the signs and thus did not disqualify the ritual slaughter. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> [<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> and Rama (18:4)].</i>
When a knife ascends and descends [in a curve] like a snake<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Who raises his head and tail, creating a curve for its body (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> but does not have a blemish, one may slaughter with it as an initial and preferred option. When the edge of a knife is smooth, but is not sharp, one may slaughter with it, since it does not have a blemish.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since it does not have a blemish, it will not disqualify the signs.</i> Even though one passes it back and forth the entire day until the slaughter [is completed], the slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Provided one does not interrupt the slaughter in the middle as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 2.</i>
When a sharp knife has been whetted, but its [blade] is not smooth, instead, touching it is like touching the tip of an ear of grain which becomes snarled on one's finger, [nevertheless,] since it does not have a blemish, one may slaughter with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>18:6) writes that since it is difficult to understand what exactly is meant by such a knife, we do not permit this leniency.</i>
When a person uproots a reed or a tooth or cuts off a flint or a nail, if they are sharp and do not have a blemish, one may slaughter with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">As apparent from Halachah 14.</i> If one stuck them into the ground, one should not slaughter with them while they are stuck into the ground. [After the fact,] if one slaughtered [in such a situation],<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For example, by passing the animal's neck back and forth below the knife [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 6:4)].</i> one's slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by the following halachah, an entity may not be used for ritual slaughter if it is connected to its source. When an entity is stuck into the ground, it is not connected to its source and hence, after the fact, the slaughter is acceptable. Nevertheless, because of the similarity to the forbidden situation, initially, one should not use such an entity for slaughter.</i>
When one slaughtered with these entities when they were connected from the beginning of their existence, before they were uprooted, the slaughter is unacceptable<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 16a states that it is a Scriptural decree that the cutting edge used for slaughter must be a separate entity, something that one could take in his hand.</i> even if they do not have a blemish.
If one took the jawbone of an animal that had sharp teeth and slaughtered with it, it is unacceptable, for they are like a sickle.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a blade with a jagged edge which is unacceptable as stated above.</i> When, however, only one tooth is fixed in a jaw, one may slaughter with it as an initial and preferred option, even though it is set in the jaw.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since the jaw as a whole is moveable, we are not concerned with the fact that the tooth is in a fixed position (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
When one made a knife white-hot in fire and slaughtered with it, the slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">We do not say that rather than cut the signs, the knife burnt them. The latter would disqualify the slaughter.<br>It must be noted that the <i>Tur</i> (see also the gloss of the Radbaz) quotes the Rambam as ruling that the slaughter is unacceptable for the above reason. This approach is also followed by many other <i>Rishonim</i>. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro states that the Rambam rules that the slaughter is acceptable. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 9:1), however, he quotes both views without stating which should be followed. All authorities agree that such a knife should not be used as an initial and preferred option.</i> If one side of a knife is [jagged-edge like] a sickle and the other side is desirable, [i.e., smooth,] one should not slaughter with the desirable side as an initial and preferred measure. [This is] a decree lest one slaughter with the other side. If one slaughtered [with it], since one slaughtered with the desirable side, the slaughter is acceptable.
A slaughterer must check the knife at its tip and at both of its sides [before slaughtering]. How must he check it? He must pass it over and draw it back over the flesh of his finger and pass it over and draw it back<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Using the same motions as he would use to slaughter an animal.</i> over his fingernail on three edges, i.e., its tip and both of its sides so that it will not have a blemish at all. [Only] afterwards, should he slaughter with it.
It must [also] be inspected in this manner after slaughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, maintaining that after ritual slaughter, no inspection is necessary unless the person desires to use the knife to slaughter another animal immeidately. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro justifies the Rambam's ruling and he cites it in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 18:3).</i> For if a blemish is discovered on it afterwards, there is an unresolved doubt whether the animal is a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling also depends on the principle stated in Halachah 13, that during its lifetime, an animal is forbidden. Hence it is not permitted unless we are certain that it was slaughtered in a proper manner (Radbaz; <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 18:2).</i> For perhaps [the knife] became blemished [when cutting] the skin and when he cut the signs, he cut them with a blemished knife.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">And this would cause the slaughter to be unacceptable as mentioned above.</i><br>For this reason, when a person slaughters many animals or many fowl,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that since the skin of a fowl is soft, it is not very probable that this caused the blemish on the knife. Nevertheless, our Sages adopted this stringency.</i> he must inspect [the knife] between each [slaughter]. For if he did not check, and then checked [after slaughtering] the last one and discovered [the knife] to be blemished, there is an unresolved doubt whether all of them - even the first - are <i>nevelot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 18, for the ramifications of this ruling.</i> or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is possible that the knife could have become blemished when cutting the skin of the first animal. Hence, that animal - and all the subsequent ones - were slaughtered with an unacceptable knife.</i>
When one inspected a knife, slaughtered with it, but did not inspect it after slaughtering, and then used it to break a bone, a piece of wood, or the like, and afterwards, inspected it and discovered it to be unacceptable, his slaughter is acceptable. [The rationale is that] the prevailing assumption is that the knife became blemished on the hard entity which it was used to break.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Since he checked the knife at the outset and it was acceptable, we rely on probability. As long as we have a way of explaining how the knife was blemished, we do not say it was blemished on the animal's skin, for the likelihood of that happening is very low.</i> Similarly, if one was negligent and did not check his knife [after slaughtering] or the knife was lost before it could be checked, the slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, since the knife was inspected initially, there is no reason to suspect that the slaughter was unacceptable, we do not disqualify it [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 18:12)] .</i>
Whenever a slaughterer<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This is referring to a slaughterer who slaughters on behalf of people at large, not only for his own private purposes.</i> does not have the knife with which he slaughters inspected by a wise man<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz notes that the Rambam's words appear to differ slightly from the simple meaning of <i>Chullin</i> 18a, his source. From <i>Chullin</i>, it appears that the necessity to show the knife to the wise man is a mere token of respect, while from the Rambam it appears that it is a necessary safeguard to check that the slaughter is kosher.<br>The difference between these approaches can lead to a variance in practice. If we say that this inspection is merely for the sake of respect, then the sages may forgo the respect due them and allow an expert to slaughter even though he does not present his knife. If, however, it is a necessary precaution to insure that the slaughter is performed correctly, an inspection is always necessary.<br>Both of these perspectives have continued to be given emphasis throughout the Rabbinic literature, although the halachah as prescribed by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 18:17) is that a sage may forgo the honor due him. The present custom in many slaughtering houses today is for the slaughterers to work in pairs and for one to check the knife of the other. At times, a visiting Rabbinic authority comes and he inspects the knives of all of the slaughterers.</i> and uses it to slaughter for himself, we inspect it. If it is discovered to be desirable [and passes] the examination, we, nevertheless, place him under a ban of ostracism [lest] he rely on himself on another occasion and then the knife will be blemished, but he will still slaughter with it. If [upon examination] the knife is discovered to be blemished, he is removed from his position and placed under a ban of ostracism. We pronounce all the meat that he slaughtered to be unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we assume that not only on this occasion, but on others, he slaughtered using an unacceptable knife, thus disqualifying the meat.</i>
How long must the knife with which one slaughters be? Even the slightest length, provided it is not [overly] thin to the extent that it pierces and does not slit<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained, ritual slaughter is accomplished by drawing the knife back and forth across the neck. If a knife is two small to enable this, it should not be used [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 8:1)].</i> like the head of a blade or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 24:2) who quotes opinions that require a knife used to slaughter a animal to be twice the length of the animal's neck. The custom is also to use a knife of such measure for a fowl.</i>
When can one slaughter? Any time, whether during the day or during the night, provided that [at night] he has a torch<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Two candles are considered a torch [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 11:1)].</i> with him so that he sees what he is doing.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, it is possible that the animal will be slaughtered incorrectly without him realizing.</i> If a person slaughters in darkness, his slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, it is forbidden to do so as an initial and preferred option [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 11:1)].</i>
When a person inadvertently slaughters on Yom Kippur or the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he was not aware that the day was either the Sabbath or Yom Kippur; alternatively, he did not know that it was forbidden to slaughter on these holy days.</i> his slaughter is acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 11:2 states that one must, nevertheless, wait until the conclusion of the Sabbath or Yom Kippur before partaking of the meat, as is the law when one cooks on the Sabbath.</i> even though were he to have been acting willfully he would be liable for his life<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">For slaughtering on the Sabbath.</i> or for lashes [for slaughtering] on Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">If he does so intentionally, he is considered as an apostate who desecrates the Sabbath and his slaughter is disqualified (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Chullin</i> 1:1; see Chapter 4, Halachah 14). The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 11:3 states that in certain instances the leniency would also apply if he slaughters intentionally.</i>

Chapter 2

It is permitted to slaughter an animal in any place except the Temple courtyard. For only animals consecrated for [sacrifice on the altar] may be sacrificed in the Temple courtyard. Ordinary animals, by contrast, whether domesticated animals, beasts, or fowl, are forbidden to be sacrificed in the Temple courtyard. Similarly, [Deuteronomy 12:21] states with regard to meat [which man] desires [to eat]:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the term the <i>Sifri</i> to the above verse and other Rabbinic texts use to describe ordinary meat in contrast to animals offered as sacrifices.</i> "When the place that God will choose will be distant from you... and you shall slaughter from your cattle and your sheep... and you shall eat in your gates." One may infer that meat [which man] desires [to eat] may be slaughtered only outside "the place that God will choose."
[Meat from animals] slaughtered outside this [holy] place is permitted to be eaten everywhere. If, however, one slaughters an ordinary animal in the Temple courtyard, that meat is ritually pure,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since the slaughter was acceptable, the animal is not considered as a <i>nevelah</i>. Hence it does not impart ritual impurity.</i> but it is forbidden to benefit from it like meat mixed with milk and the like.

If, however, one cuts off an animal's head in the Temple courtyard, one rips the signs from their place, a gentile slaughters, [a Jew] slaughters, but the animal was discovered to be <i>trefe</i>, or one slaughters a non-kosher domesticated animal, beast, or fowl in the Temple courtyard, it is permitted to benefit from all of the above.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For the prohibition is only against slaughtering ordinary animals in the Temple courtyard, for this resembles the slaughter of the sacrifices (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

Others, however, interpret the Rambam as implying that the prohibition is entirely Rabbinic. The verse cited previously is merely an <i>asmachta</i>.<br>The above applies to the prohibition against slaughetring in the Temple Courtyard.

[The following rule applies when] a person says: "This animal is [consecrated as] a peace offering, but [the fetus it is carrying] remains of ordinary status."

One may slaughter into murky water in which an image may not be seen. Similarly, one may slaughter outside a pit and allow the blood to flow and descend into a pit.

How does one slaughter? One extends the neck and passes the knife back and forth until [the animal] is slaughtered. Whether the animal was lying down<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">And thus the knife was above its neck.</i> or it was standing and one held the back of its neck, held the knife in his hand below, and slaughtered, the slaughter is acceptable.

Even though the throat of the animal is cut, it is not considered ritual slaughter. Ritual slaughter involves bringing the knife back and forth across the neck or bringing the neck back and forth across the knife.

When two people hold unto a knife together - even when one is holding from one side and the other from the other side - and they slaughter together, the slaughter is acceptable.

When a person slaughters for the sake of mountains, hills, seas, rivers, or deserts, his slaughter is unacceptable even when he does not intend to worship these entities, but merely for curative purposes or the like according to the empty words related by the gentiles, the slaughter is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to partake of the animal, because this resembles bringing a sacrifice to a false deity.

Chapter 3

There are five factors that disqualify ritual slaughter and the fundamentals of the laws of <i>shechitah</i> are to guard against each of these factors: They are: <i>shehiyah, dirasah, chaladah, hagramah,</i> and <i>ikur</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam describes each of these terms in the subsequent halachot in this chapter.</i>
What is meant by <i>shehiyah</i>? A person began to slaughter and lifted up his hand before he completed the slaughter and waited. Whether he did so inadvertently, intentionally, or because of forces beyond his control, [the following rules apply] if he or another person completed the slaughter. If he waited the amount of time it would take to lift up the animal, cause it to lie down, and slaughter it, his slaughter is not acceptable. If he waited less than this amount of time, his slaughter is acceptable.
With regard to a small domesticated animal:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a sheep or a goat.</i>, the measure of <i>shehiyah</i> is the amount of time it would take to lift up the animal, cause it to lie down, and slaughter it. With regard to a large domestic animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a cow.</i> the measure of <i>shehiyah</i> is the amount of time it would take to lift up the animal, cause it to lie down, and slaughter it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., each animal is considered according to its category. It will take more time to deal with a large animal than a smaller one and the time factor is adjusted accordingly.</i> With regard to a fowl, the measure of <i>shehiyah</i> is the amount of time it would take to lift up a small animal, cause it to lie down, and slaughter it.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling favors the opinion of Shmuel over Rav. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro explains that generally, we follow the principle that the halachah follows Rav's approach with regard to the Torah prohibitions. Nevertheless, in this instance, since there are other Sages who support Shmuel's view, the Rambam favors his opinion. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 23:2), in addition to the Rambam's view, Rav Yosef Caro quotes Rashi's position which rules much more stringently with regard to <i>shehiyah</i> for a fowl. The Rama states that the common custom is to disqualify any ritual slaughter involving <i>shehiyah</i> of the slightest time for both animals and fowl.</i>
When a person cut [the signs] for a while, waited for a while, cut for a while, waited for a while until he concluded the slaughter without waiting the measure that disqualifies an animal at any one time, but over the times he waited over the entire period would equal the measure of <i>shehiyah</i>, there is an unresolved doubt whether [the animal is considered] a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Ra'avad and Rav Moshe HaCohen dispute the Rambam's ruling, it is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>23:3). The Rama reiterates the stringency stated above.</i><br>Similarly, if he waited the amount of time it takes to lift up the animal, cause it to lie down, and cut only a portion of the signs, but not to slaughter it entirely, there is an unresolved doubt whether [the animal is considered] a <i>nevelah</i>.
If he slaughtered the majority of one of the signs for a fowl or the majority of both signs for an animal, the slaughter is permitted even if he waited half the day and then returned and finished cutting the signs.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the Rambam's view, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 23:5) quotes the view of Rashi cited by the <i>Tur</i> that as long as the cutting of the signs is not completed, <i>shehiyah</i> can disqualify an animal. Hence, as an initial and preferred option, one should show respect for this view. The Rama rules even more stringently, stating that even after the fact, the slaughter is disqualified. For that reason, he continues, if the majority of the signs are cut, but the animal is lingering alive, rather than cut the signs further, one should hit it on its head to kill it.</i> For since the minimum measure for slaughter was met, it is as if he is cutting slaughtered meat.
If one cuts half or less of the windpipe and waits an extended period, he may return and complete the slaughter; [his previous acts] are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For until half of the windpipe is cut, the animal is not considered as <i>trefe</i>.</i> If, however, he cut the majority of [an animal's] windpipe or perforated the gullet even slightly and then waited the [disqualifying] measure, [the slaughter] is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He cannot return and correct the slaughter, for the animal is already considered as a <i>nevelah</i>.</i> [This applies] whether he returned and completed cutting where he began or slaughtered the animal entirely in a different place. [The rationale is] that when the majority of the windpipe is slit or the gullet of either an animal or a fowl is perforated even slightly, the animal is comparable to a <i>nevelah</i> and ritual slaughter is not effective for it, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 19.</i>
It is thus explained for you that the concept of <i>shehiyah</i> does not exist with regard to the windpipe of a fowl at all. For if he slit the majority of the windpipe and waited, he has already completed the slaughter of [the fowl]. When he goes back and completes it, it is as if he is cutting meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 5.</i> If he slit less than half the windpipe and waited, he may return and [complete the] slaughter whenever he desires,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 6.</i> for it is not disqualified as a <i>nevelah</i> unless the majority of the windpipe has been cut.
[The following rules apply when] one slaughtered a fowl and waited, but does not know whether the gullet was perforated or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">If the gullet was perforated, the slaughter is unacceptable. If not, it is acceptable.</i> He should return and cut the windpipe alone in another place,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Theoretically, he could also cut the windpipe in the same place and complete the slaughter in that manner. Nevertheless, our Sages advised against doing so, for in this way, it is much easier to perforate the gullet when cutting the windpipe and thus he might disqualify the slaughter unnecessarily (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). See the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 23:6 who offers another rationale. As mentioned above, the Rama rules that whenever one waits during the slaughter of a fowl or an animal, the slaughter is disqualified.<br>A parallel law - slaughtering the animal in a different place - does not apply with regard to an animal. For to slaughter the animal, he must slit the gullet and we fear that he will cut at a place where it had been perforated previously (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> let [the fowl] be until it dies, and then check the gullet from the inside.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he should cut the gullet off at its top and/or bottom and turn it inside out. If he is able to find a drop of blood, he can assume that it is perforated and it is unacceptable. An external examination of the gullet is not sufficient for the surface of the gullet is red and a drop of blood will not be noticeable. Its inner surface, however, is skin-colored and the blood will be noticed (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> If a drop of blood was not found on it, it is apparent that it was not perforated and it is acceptable.
What is meant by <i>chaladah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 20b states that this term is derived from the word <i>chuldah</i> meaning "weasel," i.e., an animal that hides in the foundation of homes. Similarly, <i>chaladah</i> involves "hiding" the knife when slaughtering; i.e., inserting it in a way that the blade is not open to the eye. Implied is that the proper way to slaughter is for the slaughterer to hold the animal or fowl with its neck upward and to draw the knife back and forth across the neck.</i> For example, one inserted the knife between one sign and another.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Certainly, this applies when he inserted the knife below both signs and slaughtered the animal by moving the knife back and forth while pointed upward (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 24:6).</i> Whether one then slits the upper sign above or cuts the lower sign below in the manner of ritual slaughter, [the slaughter] is unacceptable.
If he inserted the knife beneath the [animal's] skin and slit both the signs in the ordinary fashion, hid the knife under tangled wool, or spread a cloth over the knife and the neck<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro quotes other authorities who explain that this is referring to a situation where the person tied the cloth around the animal's neck, attached it with wax, or the like. If, however, he merely loosely spread the cloth over the animal, the slaughter is acceptable. He concludes, however, that the Rambam's opinion should be respected. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 24:8), he rules according to the other views, but states: "One should show concern for his (the Rambam's) opinion at the outset."</i> and slaughtered under the cloth, since the knife is not openly revealed, there is an unresolved doubt whether [the animal is considered] a <i>nevelah</i>. Similarly, if slaughtered less than half the signs with <i>chaladah</i> and completed the slaughter without <i>chaladah</i>, there is an unresolved doubt whether [the animal is considered] a <i>nevelah</i>.
What is meant by <i>dirasah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>doreis</i> means "prey" or "strike," i.e., killing with a blow, rather than drawing back and forth as is required for ritual slaughter.</i> For example, one struck the neck with a knife as one strikes with a sword, cutting the signs at one time, without passing [the knife] back and forth or one placed the knife on the neck and pressed, cutting downward like one cuts radishes or squash until he cuts the signs, [the slaughter] is unacceptable.
What is meant by <i>hagramah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> gives two interpretations of the term <i>hagramah</i>:<br>a) "lift up," as in II Kings 9:13; i.e., he lifted the knife above its proper place; and<br>b) "tip," as in <i>Bava Batra</i> 88b; i.e., he tipped the knife upward.</i> This refers to one who slaughters at a high point on the windpipe<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam speaks only with regard to the windpipe, because he defines <i>hagramah</i> as slaughtering the animal in an improper place. If one would slit the gullet above the proper place, the animal would become disqualified as a <i>trefe</i> immediately (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> where it is not fit to slaughter. There are two [nodes, like kernels of] wheat at the top of the windpipe, at the large ring.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that the windpipe is made up of many rings. Over the top ring, there is a flap (cap) of flesh which is slanted. (This is the area of the larynx. See also Chapter 1, Halachah 7, and notes.) At the top of this flap, there are two kernel-like buttons of flesh. As long as the slaughterer leaves some portion of these kernels intact, the slaughter is acceptable.</i> [The following rules apply if] one slaughtered in the midst of these kernels. If he left even the slightest portion of them intact above [the place of slaughter], it is acceptable, for he slaughtered from the slanting cap [of the windpipe] or lower. This is within the place that is fit for ritual slaughter. If, however, he did not leave any portion of them intact, but instead cut above them, this is considered as [being slaughtered with] <i>hagramah</i> and it is unacceptable.
If one slit the majority of one sign [for a fowl] or the majority of both signs [for an animal] and then completed the slaughter through <i>dirasah</i> or <i>hagramah</i>, it is acceptable, for the minimum measure was slaughtered in the proper manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam derived this concept from a comparison to the laws of <i>shehiyah</i> mentioned in Halachah 5. The same concept applies if one slaughters more than half the signs appropriately and then completes the slaughter through <i>chaladah</i>. Indeed, it can be explained that the Rambam does not mention this law with regard to <i>chaladah</i>, because it is obvious. For in <i>chaladah</i>, the slaughter is essentially correct; it is only the manner in which one inserts the knife that is unacceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>As mentioned in the notes to Halachah 5, there are opinions who differ and disqualify the slaughter. Similarly, with regard to the laws at hand, there are opinions that are more stringent, except with regard to <i>hagramah</i>. In that instance, they accept the leniency mentioned by the Rambam. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 24:12) quotes both of the views without stating which should be followed. The Rama goes further and states that it is customary to rule stringently even with regard to <i>hagramah</i>, and even with regard to fowl.</i><br>If at first, he slit a third [of the windpipe]<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This addition is necessary, for as stated above, if the gullet is perforated, the slaughter is disqualified.</i> through <i>hagramah</i>, and then cut two thirds in the appropriate manner, the slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For the majority of the windpipe was cut in an acceptable manner and the preliminary cutting did not cause the animal to be considered as a <i>trefe</i>.</i> If he cut a third in the appropriate manner, cut a third through <i>hagramah</i>, and then cut the last third in the appropriate manner, the slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, the majority of the windpipe is cut in an acceptable manner.

The Rivosh (Responsum 187), the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 24:18 all offer lengthy - and somewhat forced - explanations to attempt to resolve the apparent contradiction. The core of the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> is that since the majority of the windpipe was slit in the proper place, it is not disqualified because a portion was not.<br>Needless to say, if one cuts the last third in either of these fashions, according to the Rambam, the slaughter is not disqualified, for it has already been completed (through slitting more than half of the sign[s] in an acceptable manner). The Rama, however, would disqualify the slaughter as stated above.</i>
What is meant by <i>ikur</i>? That the gullet and/or the windpipe were displaced<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>ikur</i> means "uproot." The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that, according to the Rambam, the fact that the signs have slipped from their place does not cause the animal to be deemed a <i>trefe</i> (see, however, Chapter 9, Halachah 21, and notes). Nevertheless, such a condition disqualifies the animal, for it is impossible for the ritual slaughter to be carried out in the proper manner.</i> and slid [from their place] before the conclusion of the slaughter. If, however, one slit an entire sign or its majority in a fowl, and then the second sign slipped, the slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For the slaughter was already completed in an acceptable manner. Compare to the following halachah.</i>
If one of the signs was displaced and afterwards, one slit the other, the slaughter is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even with regard to a fowl. Although it is only necessary for one of the signs of a fowl to be cut in the appropriate manner, the other one must be fit to be slit in an appropriate manner (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> If one slit one of the signs [of a fowl] and then discovered that the other one was displaced, but it is unknown whether it was displaced before slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance it would disqualify it.</i> or after slaughter,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, it would be acceptable.</i> there is an unresolved question whether [the fowl] is a <i>nevelah</i>.
If the sign that was cut for ritual slaughter is discovered to have been displaced, [the fowl or animal]<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to a fowl, the sign in question is the only sign slit. With regard to an animal, the other sign must have been slaughtered effectively.</i> is acceptable, for certainly, it was displaced after the slaughter. For if it had been displaced before ritual slaughter, it would have hung loosely and it would not have been able to be slaughtered [effectively].<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 24:18) rule more stringently and maintain that it is necessary to slaughter another animal, displace its signs afterwards, and compare the two. Only if they are similar is the slaughter accepted. Moreover, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> continues stating that, at present, we are not expert at making this comparison and hence, forbid an animal whenever such a condition arises.</i>
When does the above apply? When [the slaughterer] did not hold the signs in his hand when he slit them. If, however, he held the signs and slaughtered, it is possible that [the signs] could have been slit [effectively even] after they were displaced.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Because the slaughterer will hold the signs in the proper position by hand.</i> Therefore, if a sign is discovered to be displaced and slaughtered,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">And we do not know whether the slaughterer held it by hand or not.</i> there is an unresolved question whether [the animal or the fowl] is a <i>nevelah</i>.
Whenever we have used the term "unacceptable," the animal is a <i>nevelah</i> and if a person partakes of an olive-sized portion of it, he is liable for lashes for partaking of a <i>nevelah</i>. For only an acceptable slaughter as commanded by Moses our teacher of blessed memory prevents an animal from being considered a <i>nevelah</i> as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachot 1 and 4.</i> Whenever there is an unresolved doubt whether slaughter [is acceptable], there is an unresolved doubt whether the animal is a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Since an animal is forbidden during its lifetime, its meat is permitted only when we are certain that the slaughter was acceptable (Radbaz).</i> A person who partakes of it is liable for stripes for rebellious conduct.
When the thigh of an animal and [the meat<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The addition is made on the basis of the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>.</i> of] its hollow were removed and thus it appears lacking when it crouches, it is a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even though the animal still has a certain vestige of vitality, it is considered as if it has died already and it imparts ritual impurity as a <i>nevelah</i> does (<i>Hilchot Shaar Avot HaTumah</i> 2:1).</i> [It is] as if half of it was cut away and it was divided into two bodies. Thus slaughter is not effective with regard to it.<br>Similarly, if [the animal's] backbone was broken together with the majority of the meat, its back was ripped open like a fish, the majority of the windpipe was been severed,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In this and the following instance, the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 33:4 rules that the animal is a <i>trefe</i> and not a <i>nevelah</i>.</i> or the gullet was perforated in a place fit for slaughter,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the gullet was perforated at a higher point in the neck (see Halachah 12), it is considered as a <i>trefe</i> and not a <i>nevelah</i>.</i> it is considered as a <i>nevelah</i> while alive and slaughter will not be effective with regard to it. The same laws apply to both an animal and a fowl with regard to all these matters.
The gullet has two membranes: the external membrane is red and the inner membrane is white.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., skin-colored.</i> If only one of them is perforated, [the animal] is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For the one that is not perforated is sufficient to protect the animal sufficiently for it to survive.<br>This leniency applies when the inner membrane is perforated due to sickness. If, however, it is perforated due to a thorn, we fear that the outer membrane may also be perforated, but that perforation cannot be detected [see Halachah 22; Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 33:4)].</i> If they are both perforated even to the slightest degree in a place fit for slaughter, it is a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As above, if the gullet was perforated at a higher point in the neck (see Halachah 12), it is considered as a <i>trefe</i> and not a <i>nevelah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> [This applies] whether it was slaughtered in the place of the perforation or in another place, slaughter will not be effective with regard to it. If they were both perforated, [even when] one [hole] does not correspond to the other, the animal is a <i>nevelah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to other organs which have two membranes, e.g., the brain and the lungs, the animal is not considered as <i>trefe</i> unless the holes correspond to each other.

Thus even if the place of the holes do not correspond, they can match each other at times [<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 33:4)].</i>.
When the gullet is perforated and a scab forms which covers it, the scab is of no consequence and it is considered perforated as it was beforehand.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For as the gullet expands, it is possible that the scab will open (Rashi, <i>Chullin</i> 42a).</i> If a thorn is detected standing in the gullet, there is an unresolved doubt whether the animal is a <i>nevelah</i>.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 1:3) accepts this ruling, but the Rama does not.</i> it is forbidden for him and others to partake [of the animal that] he slaughtered.

Similarly, if a person tells his agent: "Go out and slaughter an animal on my behalf," and he finds a slaughtered animal, but does not know whether his agent or another person slaughtered it, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to questions of business law, we rely on the presumption that an agent will perform the mission with which he was charged. We do not, however, accept this principle with regard to questions involving the Torah's prohibitions (<i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 4:6). Nevertheless, even if we know for certain that the agent did not slaughter the animal, we consider it as permitted because of the reason stated by the Rambam.</i> [The rationale for both these laws is] that the majority of people who slaughter are expert.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And when there is no alternative we can rely on this presumption.<br>From the statements of the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 1:1), it appears that there is a slight difference between the present age and the Talmudic period. In the Talmudic era, most people were proficient in both the laws and practice of ritual slaughter. In the present age, this applies only to those who are occupied professionally in this field. Nevertheless, the laws remain the same, for we assume that only a person who is knowledgeable will actually slaughter animals.</i>
[The following rules apply when a person] loses a kid or a chicken. If he finds it slaughtered at home, it is permitted. [The rationale is that] the majority of people who slaughter are expert. If he finds it in the market place, it is forbidden; perhaps [it was slaughtered improperly and] became a <i>nevelah</i> and was therefore cast into the market place.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">We are not speaking about a waste dump in the market place. In such an instance, all opinions would agree that the animal is forbidden. Instead, we are speaking about a situation where it was found in the marketplace at large. <i>Chullin</i> 12b records a dispute between two Sages concerning this matter and the Rambam chooses the more stringent ruling.</i> Similarly, if he finds it on the waste dump at home, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For the circumstances indicate that it was discarded.<br>As mentioned, there is a difference of opinion in the Talmud regarding this issue. Most <i>Rishonim</i> follow the more lenient view and rule that if the slaughtered animal is found in an ordinary place in the marketplace or in a waste dump at home, it is permitted. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 1:4) also follows this view.</i>
When an expert [slaughterer] loses his power of speech, but he is [still] capable of understanding, he can hear and he is of sound mind, he may slaughter as an initial and preferred option.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Another person should recite the blessing for him [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 1:7)].</i> Similarly, a person who does not hear,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As long as he has the ability to speak, he is not considered to be intellectually underdeveloped.<br>Rabbenu Asher explains that such a person should not slaughter as an initial and preferred option, because there is a difficulty with his recitation of the blessing. For a person must recite a blessing in a manner that enables him to hear it and that is impossible for such an individual. Indeed, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Terumot</i> 1:6) rules that a person who is dumb should not separate <i>terumah</i> at the outset for that reason [<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 1:6)].</i> may slaughter.
A blind man should not slaughter as an initial and preferred option unless others supervise him.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For we fear that he will err and not detect his error. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 1:35 quotes opinions that rule that a blind person should not slaughter even when others are watching him.</i> If he slaughters, his slaughter is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 1:36 mentions views that maintain that a person who was never able to see should not slaughter. Even after the fact, one should not partake of his slaughter.</i>
When a gentile slaughters, even though he slaughters in the presence of a Jew, [using] a finely [honed] knife,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">And is well-versed in the laws of ritual slaughter [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 1:1)].</i> and even if he was a minor,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">One might think that the slaughter of a minor has an advantage, because a minor's worship of idols is not significant.</i> his slaughter is a <i>nevelah</i>. According to Scriptural Law, one is liable for lashes for partaking of it,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Thus a gentile's slaughter is not recognized by Scriptural Law. See, however, the following halachah.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that the reason the animal is forbidden is that, in general, when a gentile slaughters, his intent is that the animal is an offering to his false deity, it is, however, permissible to benefit from the animal. We do not consider it as a sacrifice to idols (<i>Chullin</i> 13b; see Chapter 2, Halachah 2), because we assume the gentile is not really sincere in his worship, he is merely mimicking his ancestors.<br>Rabbeinu Asher differs and explains that the Scriptural command for ritual slaughter states: "And <i>you</i> shall slaughter," implying that the slaughtering must be a Jew. Hence, a gentile is inherently disqualified; his thoughts are of no consequence. See the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 2:2 and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 2:1 who discuss this issue.</i> as [implied by Exodus 34:15]: "[Lest] he shall call you and you shall partake of his slaughter." Since the Torah warns lest one partake of his slaughter, you can infer that his slaughter is forbidden. He cannot be compared to a Jew who does not know the laws of ritual slaughter.
[Our Sages] established a great safeguard concerning this matter, [decreeing] that even [an animal] slaughtered by a gentile who does not serve false deities<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., a resident alien who accepts the Seven Universal Laws Commanded to Noah and his descendants (see <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 14:7).</i> is a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, if he does not serve false deities and knows the laws of ritual slaughter, his slaughter is acceptable according to Scriptural Law.<br>One might ask: If so, why is an animal slaughtered by a child a <i>nevelah</i>? A child is not liable for the service of false deities. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> answers that ultimately, the child will grow up and worship false deities.</i>
If a gentile began to slaughter and slit the minority of the signs and a Jew completed the slaughter or a Jew began the slaughter and a gentile completed it,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 2:27 maintains that if the Jew slit the majority of the gullet and windpipe, the slaughter is acceptable even if the gentile completed it.</i> it is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if a gentile slit the majority of the windpipe or any portion of the gullet, the slaughter is disqualified [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 2:10)].</i> [The rationale is that] slaughter [is considered an integral act, a single continuity] from the beginning to the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 1:18 for another application of this principle.</i> If, however, a gentile slit [a portion of] an organ that does not cause the animal to be considered a <i>nevelah</i>, e.g., he slit half the windpipe and a Jew completed the slaughter, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 11, even if the windpipe is half slit because of other factors, it can be slaughtered acceptably.</i>
A Jew who is an apostate because of his transgression of a particular transgression<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:9, there is a concept of an apostate with regard to one transgression, i.e., "a person who has made a fixed practice of willfully violating a certain transgression [to the extent that] he is accustomed to transgressing and his deeds are public knowledge... provided he does so with the intent of angering God."</i> who is an expert slaughterer may slaughter as an initial and preferred option.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Although he repeatedly violates that particular transgression, we do not assume that he will not slaughter correctly.<br>In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro cites <i>Chullin</i> 4a which states that as long as if given a choice whether to eat kosher meat or non-kosher meat, the person would choose the kosher meat - even if he would partake of the non-kosher meat if kosher meat was not available - it is permitted to partake of an animal he slaughtered. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> continues, explaining that as long as one does not transgress with the intent of angering God, one may partake of an animal he slaughtered. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 2:5), he rules that an apostate who transgresses with the intent of angering God resembles a gentile and his slaughter is inherently unacceptable.<br><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes that there is some difficulty with the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> interpretation, because <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> specifically states that a person is deemed an apostate only when his transgression is performed with the intent of angering God.</i> A Jew of acceptable repute must check the knife and afterwards give it to this apostate to slaughter with, for it can be presumed that he will not trouble himself to check [the knife].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Although we do not assume that he will definitely transgress, it is logical to presume that he will not be careful in his observance.<br>Although it also cites the Rambam's view, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 2:6) mentions the opinion of the <i>Tur</i> and others who rule that if the person is not an apostate with regard to partaking of non-kosher meat, it is not even necessary to check his knife. He may slaughter in private. If, however, he is an apostate with regard to partaking of non-kosher meat, his knife must be checked. Moreover, if he shows no concern for kashrut at all, his slaughter is not acceptable [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 2:5].</i><br>If, by contrast, he was an apostate because of worship of false deities, one who violates the Sabbath in public,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>.</i> or a heretic who denies the Torah and [the prophecy of] Moses our teacher, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8.</i> he is considered as a gentile and [an animal] he slaughters is a <i>nevelah.</i>
[Even though] a person is disqualified as a witness because of his violation of a Scriptural prohibition,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 10:1-3.</i> he may [still] slaughter in private if he was an expert.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, the Rambam does not even require him to have another person observe him. Since his disregard for Jewish observance is not as severe as that of an apostate, he is allowed to slaughter on his own.</i> For he would not leave something which is permitted and partake of something that is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he would not slaughter the animal in an invalid way when it would be just as easy for him to slaughter it in an acceptable way.</i> This is a presumption that applies with regard to all Jews, even those who are wicked.
These Tzadukkim, Beotosim, <sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Tzadok and Beotus were two of the greatest students of Antigonus of Socho. As the Rambam states in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Avot</i> 1:3), after they heard Antigonus teach: "Do not be as servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a reward," they forsook Jewish practice, saying: "Is it just that we labor without receiving a reward?"<br>They began splinter sects with the intent of swaying the people after them. At first, they sought to abandon Jewish practice entirely. They saw, however, the people would not accept this and so they focused their complaints on the Oral Law, arguing that although the Written Law was of Divine origin, the Oral Law was not. Their intent, however, was to deny the entire Torah.</i> their disciples and all that err, following their path, who do not believe in the Oral Law - their slaughter is forbidden. If, however, they slaughtered [an animal] in our presence, it is permitted. For their slaughter is forbidden only because it is possible they blunder. Since they do not believe in the laws of ritual slaughter, we do not accept their word when they say, "We did not blunder."<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam appears to be saying that there is no inherent difficulty with these individuals slaughtering an animal. The only question is whether or not they slaughtered correctly. Hence, when it is possible to verify that the slaughter was performed correctly, the animal is permitted. They are not placed in the same category as apostates. <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> adds that, based on the previous halachah, these <i>Tzadukim</i> must also be Sabbath observant.</i>
When the Jews were journeying through the desert, they were not commanded to slaughter non-sacrificial animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion concerning this point among the Sages (<i>Chullin</i> 17a). The Rambam follows Rabbi Akiva's perspective.</i> Instead, they would cut off their heads or slaughter them and eat as the other nations do. In the desert, they were commanded that everyone who desires to slaughter an animal [in the prescribed way] should slaughter only for the sake of a peace offering, as [Leviticus 17:3-5] states: "When a man from the house of Israel will slaughter an ox... and he will not bring it to the Tent of Meeting... [it will be considered as (spilled) blood]... so that the Children of Israel will bring their sacrifices... and slaughter these sacrifices as peace-offerings." If, however, a person desired to cut an animal's head off and partake [of the animal], in the desert, this was allowed.
This mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The obligation to offer as a sacrifice an animal which one desires to ritually slaughter.</i> is not observed forever, nor in the desert alone, at the time it was permitted to kill animals [and partake of them]. There they were commanded that when they would enter <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, killing animals [for food] would be forbidden and ordinary animals could only be eaten after ritual slaughter. They would be allowed to slaughter in every place except the Temple Courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> as [Deuteronomy 12:20-21] states: "When God your Lord will expand your boundaries... and you shall slaughter from your cattle and your sheep which God your Lord gave you." This is the mitzvah to be observed for generations - to slaughter and then to eat.

Chapter 5

We have already explained in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 4:8-9.</i> that the term <i>trefe</i> employed by the Torah refers to an animal that is on the verge of death. The term <i>trefe</i> - which literally means "torn apart" - was employed only because the Torah speaks with regard to prevalent situations, e.g., a lion or the like attacked it and wounded it, but it had not died yet.
There are other maladies which if they affect an animal will cause it to be considered <i>trefe</i>. They were transmitted as a halachah to Moses at Sinai. [In particular,] eight [conditions that cause an animal to be considered as] <i>trefe</i> were transmitted to Moses at Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">All the 70 conditions the Rambam mentions in Chapter 10 are included in these eight general categories.</i> They are <i>derusah, nekuvah, chaseirah, netulah, pesukah, keru'ah, nefulah,</i> and <i>sheburah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These terms are defined in this and the following chapters.</i>
Although they were all transmitted as halachot to Moses at Sinai,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And thus all are judged with the severity appropriate for questions of Scriptural Law.</i> since only <i>derusah</i> is explicitly mentioned in the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:30 speaks of "meat torn apart in the field."</i> [our Sages] ruled more stringently with regard to it. Any questionable situation that arises with regard to <i>derisah</i> [causes the animal] to be forbidden. There are, by contrast, questionable situations that may arise with regard to the seven other conditions [that render an animal] <i>trefe</i> in which [the animal] is permitted as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 29) questions the Rambam's statements, for since these other conditions are considered questions of Scriptural Law, whenever a doubt arises, we rule stringently. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 29:1 explains that the severity involving <i>derisah</i> concerns a <i>sefek seifkah</i>, a condition of multiple doubt. See also the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> which offers several resolutions to this question.</i>
<i>Derusah</i> refers to a situation where a lion or the like will attack an animal and assault it with its paw or a hawk, an eagle, or the like will assault a fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained in the following halachot, the laws of <i>derisah</i> do not concern only the wounds to the victim's organs that the attacking animal causes. Instead, the concern is that even a superficial wound can cause the victim to die, because there is poison in the attacker's claws that will affect the victim. (Exactly, what that means in contemporary terms is difficult to understand. Some have suggested that the attacker's claws are infected with bacteria which could be considered comparable to poison. That explanation, however, cannot be easily resolved with some of the points in the subsequent halachot.)<br>The intent of this and the following halachah is that "the poison" of certain animals or fowl is effective in harming some and not in harming others.</i> [The laws of] <i>derisah</i> apply with regard to a large domesticated animal<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">An ox.</i> or a large wild beast only when it is attacked by a lion.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, it is attacked by smaller animals of prey, even a tiger, we assume that its strength will enable it to defend itself (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:1) follows a more stringent opinion which rules that the laws of <i>derisah</i> apply when any predator larger than a wolf attacks a large animal.</i> [The laws of <i>derisah</i> apply with regard to] a small domesticated animal<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A sheep or a goat.</i> or a small wild beast only when it is attacked by a wolf or a larger animal. [The laws of] <i>derisah</i> apply with regard to kids and lambs even when attacked by cats, foxes, martens,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">We have quoted the definition of this term given by Rashi. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bava Batra</i> 2:5), the Rambam defines the term in Arabic as <i>alnamas</i>, a small predator.</i> and the like. Needless to say, this applies with regard to fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:5) which discusses the question whether leniency can be granted when a cat enters a chicken coop.</i>
When a hawk attacks, the laws of <i>derisah</i> apply even with regard to a larger fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For it can harm fowl larger than itself.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:3) qualifies this matter, saying that these laws do not apply when a hawk attacks a chicken. The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama, however, state that this applies only to large chickens, but not to smaller ones.</i> With regard to other birds of prey the laws of <i>derisah</i> apply only with regard to fowl their size and not with regard to fowl which are larger than they are.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, the <i>Tur</i> and the Rama (<i>loc. cit.</i>) add a further point, stating that the laws of <i>derisah</i> apply with regard to a falcon regardless of the size of the bird it attacks.</i>
[The laws of] <i>derisah</i> apply [when] a weasel attacks a fowl. [The laws of] <i>derisah</i> do not apply at all when a dog attacks, not when it attacks a fowl, an animal, or a beast. [The laws of] <i>derisah</i> apply [when] a hawk attacks kids or lambs should its claws penetrate to [the animal's] inner cavity.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Compare to the following halachah. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that in this halachah, the Rambam is not concerned with the question of whether the attacker perforated one of the organs whose perforation disqualifies an animal. For if so, it would not have been necessary for the Rambam to mention <i>derisah</i>. If such an organ was perforated, even a large animal is disqualified. Instead, the intent is whether the "poison" of the attacker is sufficient to kill the victim.</i>
[The laws of] <i>derisah</i> apply only [when] the attacking animal [strikes its victim] with its forelegs. If it strikes it with its hindlegs,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a beast. The laws of <i>derisah</i> apply, by contrast, when a fowl attacks with its feet (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 57:10; <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 57:19).</i> we show no concern.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, if it delivers a mortal wound with its hindlegs, the victim is disqualified. Here, however, we are speaking about "poisoning" an animal through <i>derisah</i> and that applies only when it attacks with its foreleg and with its claws [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:6)].</i> [Similarly, the laws of] <i>derisah</i> apply only [when the attacking animal strikes its victim] with its claw. If it bites it, we show no concern unless it penetrates to its internal cavity.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to this and wounding with its legs, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states, "they are no different than a thorn," i.e., there is no question of "poison."</i> We then check if it perforated one of the organs [that cause an animal to be considered <i>trefe</i> if] even the tiniest perforation was made.<br>[The laws of] <i>derisah</i> apply only [when] the attacking animal has that intent. If, however, the beast of prey fell and its claws became lodged in the other animal, [the laws of] <i>derisah</i> do not apply.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For then it will not release its poison.</i> [Similarly, the laws of] <i>derisah</i> apply only [when the attacking animal] is alive. If, however, it attacked and was killed, but its claws remained lodged in the victim and were not removed until after [the attacker's] death, we are not concerned.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For it releases its "poison" only when it withdraws its claws and only when it is alive.<br>For this same reason, if ritual slaughter is performed on the animal that is being attacked before the attacking animal removes its claws, the slaughtered animal is permitted [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:8)].</i>
What are the laws applying to an animal that was attacked? Whenever we stated that "we show concern," the attacked animal should be slaughtered and its entire internal cavity - from its thigh fracture to its forehead - must be checked. If it is found to be flawless with regard to all the factors [that render an animal] <i>trefe</i> and there is no sign that it was attacked,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the following halachah.</i> it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:18) mentions a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if such an examination can be relied upon in the present age. The Rama rules that we should be stringent, not rely on the examination, and hence, declare any animal that was attacked - or there is a question whether it was attacked - forbidden.</i> If there is a sign that it was attacked, it is <i>trefe</i> and forbidden by Scriptural Law.
What is meant by "a sign that it was attacked"? That the flesh above the intestines turns red.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro explains that the fact that the flesh turns red indicates that the poison from the predator has penetrated the animal's flesh and will ultimately, cause the intestines to be perforated. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions, however, why the Rambam mentions only the intestines. Since - as mentioned in the previous halachah - it is necessary to inspect the entire body, seemingly (and indeed, the <i>Tur</i> rules accordingly), the same laws would apply if red marks were found on the flesh above any organ whose perforation can disqualify the animal. He explains that perhaps this is indeed the Rambam's intent and he mentions the intestines only because there are many disqualifying factors involved with them. Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:16), he quotes the Rambam's wording without emendation. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 57:38) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> ruling.</i> If the flesh above the intestines decays to the extent it becomes like flesh which a doctor would scrape from a wound, we consider that flesh as if it were lacking and [rule that the animal is] <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Here also we assume that the poison will ultimately cause the organ below the flesh to become perforated (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
If [the predator] attacked the "signs" [which must be cut for ritual slaughter, the animal is] <i>trefe</i> if they turn red.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Here too the rationale is that once the poison has begun to have an effect, it will ultimately penetrate through and perforate the entire organ. There is, however, a difference between the signs and the other organs. With regard to the other organs, as soon as the flesh above the organ is affected, the animal is considered <i>trefe</i>. With regard to the signs, they themselves must be affected. It is possible to explain that the signs are tougher and more resilient than the other organs. Hence, the fact that the flesh above them is affected is no proof that they will also be affected (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> The slightest wound [is significant]. If even the smallest portion of them becomes red because of an attack, [the animal is] <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even when a small portion of the windpipe becomes red. Although a perforation in the windpipe does not disqualify it unless it is the size of the majority of its cavity (Chapter 3, Halachah 23), we assume that the poison of the predator will ultimately cause such a perforation (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 57:40).</i>
When there is a question whether [an animal] has been attacked or not, we do not permit it unless it is checked as one would [an animal] that had definitely been attacked.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 8. As stated in the notes to that halachah, there are authorities - and this is the custom cited by the Rama - it is customary in the present era not to rely on this examination and to regard any animal that was attacked - or even if there is a doubt whether it was attacked - as <i>trefe</i>.</i><br>What is implied? When a lion enters among oxen and a claw was found in the back of one of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">An animal does not release its poison until the claw is removed (Halachah 7), and is this instance, it is implanted in the animal. We, nevertheless, disqualify it, for in this instance, we say that the animal released its poison when it lost its claw (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 57:21). Alternatively, we fear that it was also attacked with another claw and that claw was removed (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>).</i> we suspect that the lion attacked it. We do not rationalize and say: "Maybe it scratched itself on a wall."<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">And the claw which had been implanted in the wall became stuck in it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:14) emphasizes that this ruling is followed even if the claw is dried out (and thus is unlikely to have come from an animal recently).</i><br>Similarly, if a fox or a marten enters among fowls, [the predator] is silent and they crowing, we fear that he attacked.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">And that is why they are clamoring.</i> If, however, the predator is roaring and they are crowing, [we assume that] they are crowing out of fear of him and his roaring. Similarly, if he cuts off the head of one of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama 57:9 states that this applies when we do not see that he attacked others. If, however, we see that he attacked others, we do not assume that his rage subsided.</i> we assume his fury has subsided. Similarly, if both [the predator] and [the fowl] are silent, we do not suspect [anything]. For if he had harmed them, they would crow.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:11) states that this applies only when we see that he did not attack any animals. If, however, we saw an attack, the fact that he and the victims were silent is not significant.</i>
When there is a question of whether or not a predator entered [a place where animals are kept] or we saw [an animal] enter [such a place], but were unable to see if it is one of the predators or not, we do not harbor suspicions.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For there is a multiple doubt involved. Perhaps the predator entered and perhaps it did not. Even if it entered, perhaps it wounded the animal and perhaps it did not (see <i>Chullin</i> 53b).</i><br>Similarly, if a fowl entered a woods or reeds and came out with its head or neck dripping blood, we do not suspect that it was attacked.

Many <i>Rishonim</i> - and this is the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 31:10) - rule that the animal is considered <i>trefe</i> in such a situation, for that membrane is the primary protection for the brain.<br>There are those who maintain that this is alluded to in the Rambam's wording: "If the lower one near the brain is perforated, it is <i>trefe</i>," i.e., its perforation alone causes the animal to be considered <i>trefe</i>. Others maintain that this is not the Rambam's intent and some even maintain that the proper version of the text is "If also the lower one...," which would imply that both membranes must be perforated.<br>[The more stringent ruling is also stated in the popular translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 3:1). However, Rav Kappach - while not disputing the ruling - maintains that the translation there is in error.]</i> With regard to the portion where the brain extends to the spinal cord, i.e., the portion below the glands where the neck begins, the laws governing [the perforation of] its membranes change.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, it is governed by the laws pertaining to the breach of the spinal cord, as described in Chapter 9, Law 1.</i> If they are perforated beyond the glands, [the animal] is permitted.

When there is a perforation of the heart to its inner cavity - whether to the larger cavity on the left or the smaller cavity to the right - [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. If, however, the flesh of the heart is perforated, but the perforation does not reach the inner cavity, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 40:2) follows the opinion of the <i>Tur</i> who accepts the Rambam's ruling with regard to a perforation stemming from sickness, but rules more stringently with regard to a perforation caused by a thorn or a needle. In such an instance, even if the perforation does not extend to the cavity of the heart, the animal is <i>trefe</i>.</i> The arteries leading from the heart to the lung is considered as the heart itself. If there is a perforation of the slightest size that reaches its inner cavity, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.
When the gall-bladder is perforated and the liver seals it, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For flesh will cling to flesh .</i> If, however, the perforation is not sealed, it is <i>trefe</i> even if the perforation is located close to the liver.

When there is a perforation of the slightest size in one of the arteries of the liver where the blood develops, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and other <i>Rishonim</i> take issue with the Rambam, maintaining that this ruling applies only with regard to the arteries leading to the liver, but not with regard to those within the liver itself. The Rivosh (Responsum 189) supports the challenge to the Rambam by citing the ruling (Chapter 8, Halachah 21) that if the liver is removed entirely except for a small portion, the animal is not <i>trefe</i>.<br>In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro explains the Rambam's position as follows: Even when the liver is removed, its blood vessels must remain intact. A parallel to that concept exists with regard to the lungs (see Chapter 7, Halachah 9). Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, he follows the position of the other <i>Rishonim</i> and does not mention a perforation in the liver as a factor that disqualifies an animal.</i> Accordingly, [the following rules apply] if a needle is found in the lobes of the liver. If it was a large needle and its pointed edge was facing inward, it can be assumed that it perforated [the liver] when it entered. If its rounded edge was facing inward, we say that it entered through the blood vessels and [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Here also the Ra'avad and other <i>Rishonim</i> take issue with the Rambam, maintaining that his understanding of <i>Chullin</i> 45b, the source for this halachah, is in error. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 41:6) follow their understanding.</i>
If it was a small needle, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>, because both of its heads are sharp and it certainly perforated [the liver].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., regardless of the direction it entered.</i> If it is found in the large blood vessel, the wide artery through which food enters the liver,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., blood from the stomach; for food does not enter the liver.</i> it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since this blood vessel is large, it cannot be taken for granted that the needle perforated the blood vessel.</i> If the flesh of the liver became wormridden, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">We do not suspect that the blood vessels of the liver were perforated.</i>
When the maw is perforated and kosher fat<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>, ch. 7, for an explanation which fat is kosher and which is forbidden.

Similarly, whenever a perforation is sealed by flesh or fat that is permitted to be eaten, [the animal] is permitted. The [only] exceptions are the fat of the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Concerning this point, there is a difference of opinion among the <i>Rishonim</i>.

In these organs, we do not say that they shield [the perforation] because they are firm.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And thus they will not bend in a manner that will seal the perforation. Kosher fat and flesh, by contrast, are pliable and will seal any perforation over which they are located.</i> A perforation that is sealed with one of these is not considered as sealed.<br>A portion of fat from a beast that corresponds to a portion of forbidden fat in a domesticated animal does not seal [a perforation] even though it is permitted to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">All fat in a wild beast is permitted to be eaten. Hence, in this instance, the general principle stated above is not followed and we determine which fat can seal a perforation by comparing it to the corresponding situation in a domesticated animal.<br>With regard to a fowl, all its kosher fat will seal a perforation beneath it [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 46:1)].</i>
When the stomach is perforated, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. There is nothing that can seal it for the fat upon it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 48:2 questions: Seemingly, the spleen should be able to seal it, for the spleen may be eaten and lies on the stomach.

[The following rules apply when] a needle is found in the folds of the gut: If it was from one side,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">From the following clause, it appears that according to the Rambam, this refers to a needle lodged in the outer side of the gut.

Moreover, they explain that we are speaking about a needle lodged in the inner side of the gut. If a needle is lodged in the outer side of the gut, according to this view, the animal is <i>trefe</i>.<br>According to the Rambam, as mentioned above, we are speaking about a needle that comes from the outside. As the Rambam states in Chapter 11, Halachah 4, in such an instance, all of the inner organs of the body must be checked (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Thus this halachah is speaking only with regard to the gut. Since the perforation does not breach the digestive system, the animal is not considered <i>trefe</i>.<br>Both perspectives are based on a comparison of two Talmudic passages (<i>Chullin</i> 50b and 51a) that are difficult to reconcile. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 48:8,10) follows the perspective of the other authorities. The Rama cites the Rambam's perspective with regard to a hole made on the inside that does not pass from one side to the other and states we may rely on it in a situation where a severe financial loss is involved.</i> If it caused a complete perforation extending [from the outer side] to the cavity of the gut and a drop of blood was found at the place of the perforation, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. For we are certain that the perforation occurred before the slaughter. If there is no blood at the place of the perforation,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and the other authorities state that the drop of blood must be found on the outer side of the gut.</i> [the animal] is permitted. For we are certain that after the slaughter, under pressure the needle caused the perforation.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since the animal was slaughtered, its blood was not flowing and it is unlikely that there will be sufficient pressure to force it outside the gut.</i>
When an animal swallowed a substance that will perforate the intestines, e.g., the root of the asafetida<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A yellow-brown, bitter, offensive-smelling resinous material used for medicinal purposes in the ancient Middle East.</i> plant or the like, it is <i>trefe</i>, for we can be certain that it perforated them. If there is a question whether or not a perforation was made,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 51), and others quote a different version of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> concerning which questions are raised. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the version translated here and the Frankel edition of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> states that it is followed by most of the authoritative manuscripts.</i> [the animal] must be inspected.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that the inspection of the intestines is difficult. That position is reflected in the ruling of the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 51:4) who rules that in such a situation, because of its questionable status, the animal is considered as <i>trefe</i>.</i><br>When one of the organs of the digestive system through which the food waste passes, i.e., the intestines, are perforated, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. Among them are those which are curved and surrounded by each other like a snake that is coiled, they are referred to as the small intestines. If one of them was perforated [on the side where] another [is located], the animal is permitted, for the other [intestine] will shield [the perforation].
When the digestive organs were perforated and viscous body fluids seal them, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i> for this seal will not endure.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">When the digestive system is under pressure, the vicious fluids will not seal effectively. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 46:1 states that the same ruling applies even if a scab has developed over the wound.</i><br>When a wolf, a dog, or the like, snatched [an animal's] intestines<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after the animal was slaughtered.</i> and they were perforated after they were abandoned, we surmise that [the predator caused the perforation and the slaughtered animal] is permitted. We do not say that perhaps [the predator] made a perforation in a place where one already existed.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 9a explains that, unless there is a known factor that certainly indicates otherwise, we assume that an animal that has been slaughtered is acceptable. In this instance, the perforation would lead us to rule stringently. Nevertheless, since the fact that it was snatched by a predator can serve as an explanation, we rely on the original assumption. Accordingly, for this ruling to apply, we must know that the animal was slaughtered properly [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 25:3)].</i><br>If [an intestine] was discovered to be perforated<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by the Rambam's explanation, in this instance, we do not know how it was perforated.</i> and it was not known whether it was perforated before [the animal's] slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the animal would be considered as <i>trefe</i>.</i> or afterwards, we perforate it again and compare the two. If the first perforation resembles this one, [the animal] is kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 50:1) rules that in the present generation, we are not knowledgeable regarding the making of such a comparison and hence, forbid the animal because of the doubt.</i> If there was a difference between them, [we presume that the first] occurred before the slaughter and [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. If the perforation in doubt was handled, the perforation to which it is being compared must also be handled before the comparison is made.
When [an animal's] digestive organs protrude outside [its body] without having been perforated,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the animal's belly was cut open while it was alive. It could no longer support the digestive organs and they protruded beyond the skin. Nevertheless, the digestive organs themselves were not blemished.</i> [the animal] is permitted. If they were turned upside down,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">As might happen if a person was trying to reinsert them into the animal's belly.</i> [the animal] is <i>trefe</i> even if they were not perforated. [The rationale is that] once [the digestive organs] have been turned upside down,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 46:2) rules that if an animal's digestive organs are discovered to have turned upside down, the animal is <i>trefe</i>, even if the organs did not fall out of its belly.</i> they will never return to their ordinary functioning and [the animal] will not live.
The final digestive organ that is straight and not curved from which feces are excreted in the genital area and is joined [to the body] between the thighs is called the colon. If it is perforated even slightly, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the fat upon it is kosher, it does not seal it [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 46:1); see also Halachah 10].</i> as applies with regard to the other digestive organs.<br>When does the above apply? When the perforation faced the cavity of the belly. When, however, it was perforated at the point where it is joined between the thighs, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For the thighs will support it (<i>Chullin</i> 50a).</i> [Indeed,] even if the entire place where it is joined between the thighs is removed, [the animal] is permitted, provided a length of at least four fingerbreadths<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam (based on Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi) considers this the meaning of the term "in order to grasp it" used by <i>Chullin, loc. cit.</i> Although there are more lenient views, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 46:5) follows the Rambam's ruling.<br>According to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> , a fingerbreadth is 2 cm, according to <i>Chazon Ish</i> 2.48 cm.</i> remains in an ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For other animals, the minimum measure is calculated proportionately (<i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>).</i>
A fowl does not have a stomach, an abdomen, or a gut. Instead of them, it has a crop and a craw.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike a domesticated animal that has four stomachs, a kosher fowl has two.</i><br>All the factors that render an animal <i>trefe</i> apply equally to a domesticated animal, a wild beast, and a fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., though the laws above were stated with regard to a domesticated animal, they apply equally to a beast and to a fowl if they possess the same organs.</i><br>When the roof of the crop receives even the slightest perforation, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.

That which becomes extended with the gullet when the fowl extends its neck.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Hence just as the perforation of the gullet disqualifies a fowl; so, too, the perforation of this portion of the crop (see <i>Chullin</i> 58b).</i> If, however, the remainder of the crop becomes perforated, [the fowl] is permitted.
The craw has two [membranes] covering it. The outer one is red like meat; the inner one is white like skin. If one was perforated and not the other, [the fowl] is permitted unless they are both perforated, even slightly. If they are both perforated, but in places that do not correspond, [the fowl] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Compare this entire halachah to Chapter 3, Halachah 20, concerning the gullet, noting the similarities and differences.</i>
The spleen is not one of the limbs which is disqualified because of a perforation of even the slightest size. Therefore our Sages did not include it in that category. Instead, a perforation that disqualifies it has a measure which is not uniform throughout it.<br>What is implied? One of the ends of the spleen is thick and the other thin, like the shape of the tongue. If the thick end was perforated by a hole that extends from side to side, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. If the hole does not extend from side to side, [more lenient rules apply]: If a portion the thickness of a golden <i>dinar</i> remains,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This is less than half the thickness of the spleen (Rashba as quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> [the animal] is permitted. If less than that remains, [the perforation] is considered as if it extends from side to side and [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. If the thin side is perforated, [the animal] is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">This applies with regard to an animal and a beast. More lenient rules apply with regard to a fowl and the perforation of its spleen never causes it to be considered as <i>trefe</i>, as stated in Chapter 10, Halachah 10.</i>
[The following principle applies with regard to] all of the organs concerning which our Sages said that even the slightest perforation [causes the animal to be considered] <i>trefe</i>. If [that organ] was removed entirely, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since the perforation of an organ impairs its functioning to the point that the animal is <i>trefe</i>, the implication is that the organ must function excellently for the body to be maintained. Hence, we can certainly assume that an animal will be considered <i>trefe</i> when the organ does not exist at all.</i> This applies whether it was eliminated through sickness, removed by hand, or [the animal] was created lacking the organ.<br>The same laws also apply if it was created with two of that organ, for any extra limb or organ is considered as if it was lacking.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that since the organ is duplicated, neither one of the two organs will be able to function satisfactorily. Thus it is as the animal is lacking that organ entirely.</i><br>What is implied? If one of an animal's or fowl's digestive organs, its gall-bladder,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that if we do not see a gall-bladder, we have the liver tasted. If its taste is bitter, we assume that the gall-bladder was absorbed by the liver. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 52:3).</i> or the like was removed, it is <i>trefe</i>. Similarly if it was discovered to have two gall-bladders or two of a [particular digestive] organ, it is <i>trefe</i>. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. If, however, the spleen was removed or two spleens were found, [the animal] is permitted, for [that organ] is not among those listed [by our Sages in this category].
[The statement that] an extra digestive organ causes an animal to be considered <i>trefe</i> applies only when there is an entire extra organ from its beginning to its end and thus two digestive organs are found next to each other as is [sometimes found in] the digestive organs of a fowl<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Thus this phenomenon does not render a fowl <i>trefe</i>, only an animal (<i>Chullin</i> 58b).</i> or the extra organ projects outward like a branch from a bough and it is a separate entity.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 47:1 rules that this applies only when the extra organ branches off from the stomach. If it branches off from the intestines, it is acceptable.</i> [The latter applies] whether in a fowl or in an animal. If, however, the extra organ returns and becomes combined with the main organ and they are fused at the two ends<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, each of the organs branches off from a different place in the animal's digestive system, the animal is <i>trefe</i> even if the organs merge at their end (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> even though they are separate in the middle, [the animal] is permitted and the organ is not considered as extra.

Chapter 7

The lungs have two membranes.

If there was even a slight perforation in the portion of windpipe in the chest<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from the beginning of the ribcage.</i> or lower, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. For this is a place in the lower portion of the windpipe that is not fit for ritual slaughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 7 defines the portion of the windpipe acceptable for ritual slaughter. If, however, the windpipe is perforated in a such a place, the animal is kosher.</i>
If a person began slaughtering the animal and slit the windpipe entirely, then perforated the lung, and afterwards, completed the slaughter, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>, for [the lung] was perforated before the completion of the slaughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Although the functioning of the lung is dependent on the windpipe, since a perforation in the lung causes an animal to be considered <i>trefe</i>, it is given that status (<i>Chullin</i> 32b).</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
If one of the bronchioles<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The small extensions of the windpipe that convey air within the lungs itself.</i> was perforated, even if the perforation is covered by another bronchiole, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Because the walls of the bronchioles are firm and not pliant.

See also the comments of <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 36:20. As the Rama states (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 39:18), the custom in the Ashkenazic community is to rule that an animal is <i>trefe</i> if its lungs are perforated even if they are sealed closed by other inner organs.</i> If one saw that it was perforated and then it developed a scab, [the scab] is of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For ultimately it will open (Rashi, <i>Chullin</i> 47b).</i><br>If the mass of the lung is perforated, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>, even if one of the ribs seals the perforation.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since this portion of the lung is located below the ribs, the perforation will never be sealed thoroughly.</i> If it was perforated in a place where the lung breaks into lobes and the lobe lies on [a rib, the animal] is kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For the lobes lie on the ribs themselves and the seal will be maintained.<br>One of the issues related to the question of whether a lung is perforated or not is <i>sirchaot</i>, adhesions, where the lung becomes attached to the ribs and/or other portions of the body.

Keep this encompassing general principle in mind: Whenever air was blown into a lung that was placed in lukewarm water and the water did not bubble, [the lung] is intact, without a perforation.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This principle is significant with regard to the discussion concerning <i>sirchaot</i>, adhesions, in Chapter 11.

The same principle cannot be applied as a leniency. The Rambam - and his approach is shared by Rabbenu Tam, Rashba, Rabbenu Nissim, and others - maintains that this principle was instituted as a leniency.</i>

According to those views (and they are accpeted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>), there is no need for the inspection the Rambam requires.</i>

If the lung degenerated, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. What is implied? For example, it was discovered intact and when it is hung up, it will break apart and fall into separate pieces.<br>When a lung was discovered to be perforated in the place where it was handled by the butcher's hand, the animal is permitted.

We do not compare the lung of a small domesticated animal to the lung of a large domesticated animal.

Rashi interprets the passage slightly differently. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 36:5) follows Rashi's understanding and states that we do not compare a lung from one animal to that of another one at all. And even within one animal, we do not compare a perforation in a large lobe to one in a small lobe.</i><br>If a perforation is found in one of the boils of a lung, [the animal] is <i>trefe. </i>We do not say: "Perforate another boil and compare them,"<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">With the intent of seeing whether the perforation was made before or after the slaughter.</i> because the matter is not clearly apparent.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in this instance, it is not easy to differentiate based on the comparison.</i>
When a needle is found in the lung, we blow up the lung. If no air is released from it, it is apparent that this needle entered via the bronchioles and did not perforate [them].<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the liver where some authorities make a distinction in the ruling depending on the direction it is facing (see Chapter 6, Halachah 8), no such contrast is made with regard to a needle found in the lung.

For there is a high probability that it perforated [the lung] when it entered.
When there is a worm in the lung and it perforated the lung and emerged and we see the lung perforated by the worm, [the animal] is permitted. We rely on the prevailing assumption that it perforated [the lung] after ritual slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For while the animal was alive, the lung was continually expanding and contracting and it would be very hard for the worm to perforate it (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 36:8).</i> and emerged [then].<br>There are ways that certain organs appear [that can disqualify the organ].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The remaining halachot in this chapter are expressions of this principle. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 48:5) rules that we are not knowledgeable with regard to the correct appearance of the lung.

It is as if the flesh whose appearance changed does not exist. Similarly, [Leviticus 13:10] states: "And there is a spot of living<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">We have translated the verses literally to convey the meaning mentioned by the Rambam. In its ordinary context, the terms would be translated as "healthy flesh."</i> flesh in the blemish...," and [<i>ibid.</i> 13:10] states: "On the day when he will present living flesh...." Implied is that flesh whose appearance has changed is not "alive."
[The following principles apply if] the color<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is dependent on the following halachah.</i> of a lung changes, whether part of its color changes or its entire color changes. If it changes to a permitted color, even if its entire color changes, it is permitted. If, however, even the slightest portion of it changes to a forbidden color, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. [The rationale is that] the forbidden color is considered equivalent to a perforation as explained [above].<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">And even the slightest perforation of the lung disqualifies the animal.</i>
There are five forbidden hues for the lung: black like ink, greenish-yellow<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the translation the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 38:1) offers for the Talmudic term <i>yerok</i> quoted by the Rambam.</i> like hops, [yellow] like the yolk of an egg, or like safflower,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 3:2).

It is comparable to hairs that are slightly red, leaning towards gold.
If the lung is discovered to be the color of the branches of a date palm, we forbid it because of the doubt involved, because this is very close to a forbidden color. We do not forbid any of these colors until the lung is inflated and massaged by hand. If it changes to a permitted color, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">For during the animal's lifetime, the lung is repeatedly inflated.</i> If it retains the [forbidden] color, it is forbidden.
There are four permitted hues [for the lung]. They are: blackish blue, green like a leek, red, or the color of the liver. Even if the lung was entirely colored in these four hues patch by patch, spot by spot, [the animal] is permitted.

For whenever a fire causes organs that were green to turn red or those which were red to turn green, it is considered as if the organ was removed and [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.

Chapter 8

What is meant by the term <i>chasairah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chasairah</i> means "lacking." This category disqualifies an animal if it lacks one of its fundamental organs.</i> There are two organs that render [an animal] <i>trefe</i> if it is lacking the proper number. They are the lungs and the feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It is true that there are more organs that render an animal <i>trefe</i> if they are lacking. Nevertheless, the lack of these organs is not placed in this category. Instead, the organ is considered as <i>nekuvah</i>, "perforated." As stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 20, if the perforation of these organs will disqualify an animal, surely, it will be disqualified when the organs are lacking entirely.</i><br>The lungs have five lobes. When a person will drape them over his hand with the inner portion of the lung facing his face,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he will be holding the animal from behind. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 35:2).</i> there will be three [lobes] on the right and two on the left. In addition, at the right of [the lung], there is a small ear-like attachment. It is not in the row of the lobes. It has a pocket of its own and it is located in the pocket. This [attachment] is called a rose, because that is what it looks like.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is small and red.</i> It is not counted as one of the number of lobes.<br>Accordingly, if [an animal] does not possess this "rose," it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 35:2 states that it is customary within the Ashkenazic community to declare an animal <i>trefe</i>, if it lacks this "rose" or if there is an extra "rose."</i> For this is the pattern with regard to [this organ], there are some animals in which it is found and some in which it is not found. If it is perforated, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i> even though its pocket seals it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For it does not seal it thoroughly.</i>
If the number of lobes was lacking and one was discovered on the left side or two on the right side, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. If, however, there were two on the right side and this "rose," [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For the "rose" functions in place of the missing lobe. If, however, the "rose" is found on the left and there is only one lobe, the animal is not acceptable. Since it is not in its proper place, it cannot replace a lobe (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 35:7) quotes the Rambam's ruling, but the Rama differs.</i>
If the position of the lobes was switched and three were found on the left and two on the right without a "rose" or the "rose" was found together with three on the left side, it is <i>trefe</i>, for it is lacking on the right side.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, the "rose" does not compensate for the lack of the lobe, because it is not on the right side.</i>
[The following rules apply if] the number of lobes was increased.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 35:3) accepts the Rambam's ruling.The Rama quotes more stringent views that state that any extra lobe that is not found in the row of the lungs is <i>trefe</i>.

When one lobe is found clinging to the one next to it, [the animal] is permitted. If, however, [the lobes] became attached out of the ordinary order, e.g., the first lobe became attached to the third, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">If the portions of the lungs that follow their natural pattern become attached to each other, all authorities agree that the animal is acceptable, for this attachment will not create any difficulties. And if the third lobe becomes attached to the first, all agree that it is unacceptable, because as the lungs inflate, the attached portions will separate, cause the attachment to tear, and in doing so, perforate the lobe.<br>The commentaries question - and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> actually maintains that the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> reads in this manner - whether if the back of one lobe is attached to the back of the lobe next to it, the animal is also <i>trefe</i>. For in this instance as well, since the lobes are attached in an unnatural order, the attachment will tear and perforate the lungs. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro maintains that the Rambam's wording implies that as long as the attached lobes are next to each other, the lung is acceptable, even if they are attached back to back. He does note, however, that there are authorities who rule stringently. He concludes in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and also rules accordingly in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 39:4), that the attachments do not disqualify an animal only when the lobes are attached side to side - and not back to back - in the natural order. If they are attached in such an order, however, the lungs need not be checked. The Rama differs, requiring an examination. He also states that there are authorities who maintain that we are not knowledgable regarding how to make such an examination and therefore such an animal should be considered as <i>trefe</i>. Nevertheless, his ruling also leaves room for leniency if less than half of the body of the lobes are attached. See <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 39:11.</i>
[The following laws apply if] there are two lobes [that appear] as one lobe and do not appear as two lobes joined together.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they appear as one flush mass, without differentiation. If they are distinct, but attached, they are governed by the laws stated in the previous halachah.</i> If there was a space about the size of a myrtle leaf<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">From Halachah 4, it appears that this is the size of a lobe that is significant. Hence, just as it is significant in disqualifying an animal, it is significant in causing it to be deemed kosher (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The Rambam's ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 35:8). The Rama cites authorities that maintain that even if a smaller portion is distinct, the lobes are considered as separate and the animal, kosher. The Rama states that we may rely on these opinions if there is a significant loss involved.</i> between them - whether at their root, in their center, or at their end - so that it is clear that they are two which are attached, [the animal] is permitted. If not, it is lacking [one of the lobes] and is <i>trefe</i>.
If the entire lung appears like two rows and it is not divided into lobes, it is <i>trefe</i>. Similarly, if the body of the lung itself<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is lacking part of its ordinary mass.</i> was lacking, even if it was not perforated, it is considered as if the required number of lobes were missing and [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that in Chapter 7, Halachah 9, the Rambam rules that if a lung has decayed, it is kosher as long as its bronchioles and outer membrane are intact despite the fact that it has lost a large amount of its substance. He explains that this is not necessarily a contradiction to the ruling here. In that instance, since the lung has decayed significantly and yet, the brochioles have not been perforated, we assume that they will not be perforated. In this instance, by contrast, we suspect that the lack within the lung will cause it to become perforated.<br>Many other <i>Rishonim</i>, however, do not make such a distinction and maintain that a lung is acceptable if it is lacking some of its inner substance. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 36:8) quotes both views. The Rama states that certain circumstances call for leniency and others, for stringency.</i> Therefore if a dried portion that could be chipped away with one's nail of even the slightest size was discovered within it, it is considered as lacking<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that others explain that it is considered as if the dried portion is perforated and therefore the animal is <i>trefe</i>.</i> and [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.
When a lung was discovered to be inflated like the leaves of a palm tree, we rule that it is forbidden because of the doubt involved. For this is an abnormal addition to its body and perhaps an addition to its body is considered as equivalent to a lack in its body, as stated with regard to the number of lobes.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in law 4, an extra lobe is considered as a missing lobe and disqualifies a lung. Similarly, there is reason to think that an increase in the size of a lung is equivalent to a decrease in its size and disqualifies it in a similar fashion.</i>
[The following rules apply when] an animal became frightened and was terrified to the extent that her lung<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 36:14) speaks of an "entire lung" shriveling.</i> shriveled and came closer to becoming dried out: If it became frightened through the hand of heaven, e.g., it heard a thunderclap, saw lightening, or the like, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For in the near future, it will regain its natural size, as indicated by the following halachah.</i> If it became frightened through human activity, e.g., another animal was slaughtered in its presence or the like, it is considered as if it were lacking and it is <i>trefe</i>.
How do we inspect it? We place the lung in water for an entire day. In the winter, we place it in lukewarm water, in a container which will not cause the water to condense on its back<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 55b states that earthern-ware utensils made of white clay will have water condense upon them easily.</i> and flow so that they will not become cold rapidly. If the season was hot, we place it in cold water in a container on which the water will condense on its back so that the water will remain cold. If [the lung] returns to its natural state, [we assume that the animal was frightened] by the hand of heaven and it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin, loc. cit.</i>, also debates what the ruling would be if one animal is frightened by another animal. The Rambam does not discuss the issue for seemingly, it would be able to be resolved by the same test mentioned here. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 36:14 considers being frightened by other animals as equivalent to being frightened by the hand of heaven.<br>The Radbaz also states that if the lung returns to normal, it is acceptable even if the animal was frightened by human activity. Other authorities differ and maintain that if we know that the animal was frightened by human activity, this examination is not acceptable (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 36:30).<br>See also Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 36:15) who rules that in the present era, we are not knowledgeable with regard to the various inspections that our Sages spoke about and hence, should not employ them. If, however, it appears that an animal's lung shrunk due to the hand of heaven, it should not be permitted without undergoing this examination.</i> If it does not return, we [we assume that] it happened due to mortal causes and [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.
An animal that was lacking a foot<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The category of <i>chasairah</i> involves two organs: the lungs and the feet. Having discussed the lungs, the Rambam proceeds to discuss the feet. As the Rambam continues to explain, here the intent is the hindlegs.</i> from the time it came into being is <i>trefe</i>. The same ruling applies if it possesses an extra foot, for an extra limb or organ is considered as if it was lacking. If, however, it has three forefeet or only one forefoot, [the animal] is permitted. Accordingly, if [an animal's] forefoot is cut off, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The severed foot itself, however, is forbidden.</i><br>If its leg is cut off from the joint and above,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">There are three segments of an animal's leg between its trunk and its hoofs. We are speaking about the joint between the highest and middle portions of the leg.</i> [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. From the joint and below, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Note, however, Halachah 15.</i> Which joint are we speaking about? The joint that is at the end of the hip close to the body.
When the bone<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the highest of the three bones of the animal's legs.</i> is broken above the joint, if it emerges outward entirely or in its majority, it is considered as if it were cut and fell off,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For it will never heal.</i> and [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. If the flesh or the skin<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Even the covering of the skin alone is sufficient. This represents a revision of the Rambam's thinking. The initial text of his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 8:13) stated "there was flesh and skin covering it" and he altered it to read "flesh or skin covering it."</i> was covering both the majority of the thickness and the majority of the circumference of the broken bone, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For the leg will heal. Not only is the animal permitted, the leg itself is permitted. We do not consider it as if it had been severed and removed during the animal's lifetime.</i> This applies even if part of the broken bone fell off and no longer is present. Soft sinews are not considered as flesh.
The juncture of the sinews is a place in an animal and in a beast which is above the heel, at the place where the butchers hang the animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is customary for the butchers to make a hole in the lowest bone of the leg and hang the animal head downwards so that they can skin it and cut off its meat. The definition of "the juncture of the sinews" is important, as reflected in Halachot 15-18.</i> There are three white sinews there, one thick and two thin. From the place where they begin and are firm and white until [the place] where the whiteness is removed from them and they begin to become red and soften is considered the juncture of the sinews. It is approximately sixteen fingerbreadths<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A fingerbreadth is approximately 2 cm according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 2.4 cm according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.<br>Together with the Rambam's view, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 56:5) also quotes Rashi's view that the juncture of the sinews is four fingerbreadths long.</i> [long] in an ox.
In a fowl, there are sixteen such sinews. They begin on the lowest bone, from the extra talon and [continue] until the conclusion of the foot which is [covered by a series of] crusted scales.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam's statements, admitting that the sinews of a fowl - as do those of an animal - begin in its actual feet. Nevertheless, he states, it is only from the joint between the second and third bone of the leg that they are considered halachically significant. For the laws of <i>trefot</i> that govern a fowl parallel those which govern an animal.<br>In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro cites authorities that maintain that the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> is in error and it should be amended to parallel the Ra'avad's comments. He cites a responsum attributed to the Rambam sent to the Sages of Provence which also follows this understanding. And in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 56:8), he rules in this manner.</i>
When an animal's feet are cut off at the juncture of the sinews, it is<i> trefe</i>. Do not be amazed and say: "How is it possible that [an animal] will be permitted if its [legs] are cut off above the juncture of the sinews - indeed, it is permitted unless its [legs] are cut off above the highest joint as we explained<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 11.</i>- but forbidden if they are cut off at a lower point, at the juncture of the sinews?<br>[The resolution is as follows: With regard to the designation of an animal] as <i>trefe</i>, [there are times when] one will cut from this point and it will live, but if [one would cut] from this point, it would die. We have not forbidden this animal, because its feet were cut off at a particular point,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Thus according to the Rambam - and his position is cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 55:1) - if an animal's leg is severed in the top bone, it is <i>trefe</i>. If it is severed in the bottom bone, it is kosher, and if it is severed in the middle bone, the ruling depends on whether it was severed above the juncture of the sinews or not.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also cites a more stringent view - and the Rama states that it should be followed - that if the middle bone was severed, even above the juncture of the sinews, the animal is <i>trefe</i>. Moreover, even if it is severed at the lower joint, above the cartiledge called the <i>irkum</i>, the animal is <i>trefe</i>.</i> but rather because its sinews were severed<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam is explaining that a severed leg causes an animal to be considered <i>trefe</i>, because it is in the category of <i>chasairah</i>. When the juncture of its sinews is lacking, it is considered <i>trefe</i>, because it is in the category of <i>netulah</i>, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> and this renders it <i>trefe</i>, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 16-17.</i>
What is meant by the term <i>Netulah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netulah</i> is one of the eight types of <i>trefot</i> mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 2. The term literally means "removed."</i> There are three limbs and organs which even though they do not [cause an animal to be deemed <i>trefe</i>] when they are perforated or if they are lacking [when the animal is born],<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there are many organs besides these three that cause an animal to be deemed lacking if they are removed. The disqualification of these other organs, however, is not included in the category of <i>netulah</i>, rather that of <i>nekuvah</i>, perforated, or <i>chasairah</i>, lacking, i.e., the organ's removal is the greatest perforation or lack that could be. See Chapter 6, Halachah 20.</i> cause the animal to be deemed <i>trefe</i>. They are: the juncture of the sinews,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad notes that seemingly, the disqualification of an animal because the junction of its sinews was severed would cause it to be placed in the following category, <i>pesukah</i> (Chapter 9, Halachah 1). He and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explan that since our Sages (<i>Chullin</i> 57a, 76a) uses the expression: "If the juncture of the sinews was removed," it should be placed in this category and not in the other. Note the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 56:1 who interprets the Ra'avad slightly differently.</i> the liver, and the upper jaw-bone.
We already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 15.</i> that when an animal or a fowl has had its legs cut off at the place of the juncture of the sinews, it is deemed <i>trefe</i> only because the sinews were cut.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the fact that this portion of the leg is missing is not significant.</i> Therefore if the sinews alone were severed even though the foot remains intact, the animal is <i>trefe</i>, because the juncture of the sinews has been removed.
In an animal, if the thick sinew alone was severed, [the animal] is permitted, for the two [thin] ones remained. If both thin ones were severed, [the animal] is permitted, for the one thick one is larger than both of them. [In both cases,] the entire juncture was not removed, only its smaller portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As long as a majority - either a majority in number or the larger portion - remains intact, the animal is permitted (<i>Chullin</i> 76b).</i> If the majority of each of them was severed, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. Needless to say, this applies if they were all severed or removed.
With regard to a fowl, even if the majority of one of the sixteen were severed, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains this ruling as follows. Since we are stringent with regard to a fowl and require that all sixteen be intact, we extend that stringency and disqualify it if the majority of one is impaired. For when the majority of a sinew is impaired, it is as if the entire sinew is impaired.</i>
When a fowl's wings are broken, it is permitted like an animal whose forelegs have been cut off.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 11. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 53:2-3) which explains details about this situation.</i>
When the entire liver has been removed, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. If an olive-sized portion remains at the place from which it is suspended<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., near the kidneys. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i>3:1) refers to it as the place attached to the blood vessels from which blood from the liver is dispersed throughout the body. <i>Chullin</i> 46a refers to this as "the place from which it derives its nurture." See the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 41:1 and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 41:1 which quote authorities that interpret this as meaning the place to which it is attached on the diaphragm.</i> and there is an olive-sized portion at the place of the gall-bladder, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For these are fundamentally necessary for its functioning.</i><br>If the liver slipped from its place and it is [in disarray, as long as it is still] connected with the diaphragm, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Because it - and its two fundamentally necessary portions - are still intact.</i> If the place from which it is suspended and the portion at the place of the gall-bladder were removed, it is <i>trefe</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For these two portions are of primary necessity.</i> even if the remainder is intact as it was previously.
If there remained an olive-sized portion at the place of the gall-bladder and an olive-sized portion at the place from which it was suspended, [the animal] is kosher. If, however, the portions of the liver which remain intact were scattered, some here and some there, flattened, or elongated like a strap, there is a doubt concerning its status. It appears to me that it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 46a raises questions regarding these situations and does not resolve them. The commentaries question why the Rambam rules definitively that the animal is unacceptable. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this applies even if there is one olive-sized portion that is entirely intact.</i>
When the upper jaw-bone is removed, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 33) objects to the Rambam's ruling, stating: "I am amazed at his prohibition [of the animal] when the upper jaw is removed since this is not explicitly stated. Are we to add to the <i>trefot</i>?"<br>To explain: <i>Chullin</i> 54a states that if the lower jaw is removed, the animal is permitted. The Rambam deduces that the implication is that if the upper jaw is removed, the animal is<i> trefe</i>. The <i>Tur</i> claims that this deduction is not explicitly stated and hence, we have no right to make this deduction on our own. The sages of Provence wrote to the Rambam, voicing similar objections and he replied to them, explaining that the upper jaw is necessary for an animal's breathing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 33:2) states that it is proper to show respect for the Rambam's ruling.<br>Based on the gloss of the Rogatchover <i>Gaon</i>, it is possible to explain why this defect is not mentioned by the Sages of the Talmud. This defect is not in and of itself a direct cause for an animal's death, it is only a side factor that will lead to its death. Hence our Sages did not mention it, for they mentioned only those factors whice are direct causes (<i>Yayin Malchut</i>).</i> If, however, the lower jaw-bone is removed,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this ruling, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 33:1) adds that the animal must be able to continue to survive by being force-fed.</i> i.e., it was cut away until the place of the gullet and the windpipe, but they were not uprooted [from their connection to the throat, the animal] is permitted.
Whenever it is said that an animal is <i>trefe</i> if a limb or organ is lacking,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the lungs and the hindlegs as stated in Halachah 1.</i> so, too, it is <i>trefe</i> if that organ is removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above (Chapter 6, Halachah 20), all the organs which render an animal <i>trefe</i> if they are perforated, also render it <i>trefe</i> when they are lacking or removed. Nevertheless, the Rambam places them in the category of <i>nekuvah</i> for that is the most inclusive classification.</i> If, however, it is said that an animal is <i>trefe</i> if an organ is removed, [the animal] is not forbidden unless that organ was cut off. If, however, the animal was created lacking that organ, it is permitted. For if not, the categories of <i>chasairah</i> and<i> netulah</i> would be identical.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">And our Sages listed them as separate categories, as stated in Chapter 5, Halachah 2.<br>The Rashba (as quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Chapter 6, Halachah 20) differs and maintains that an animal is also <i>trefe</i> if it is lacking a liver from the beginning of its existence. Why then did our Sages mention <i>chasairah</i> and <i>netulah</i> as two separate categories? Because if they were not listed so, one might argue that an animal is <i>trefe</i> only when an organ is removed and not when it was lacking from the beginning of the animal's existence or vice versa. The <i>Tur</i> follows the Rashba's view. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 50:72 quotes both opinions, but appears to favor the Rashba's view. The Rama states that we may rely on the Rambam when a significant loss is involved.</i> Whenever it is said that [an animal] is permitted if a limb is removed, it is certainly permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For the ruling is more lenient if at the outset, it was not created with this organ, as above.</i> if this organ was lacking from the beginning of the animal's existence and was never created.
When the uterus of an animal, i.e., its womb, was removed or its kidneys were removed,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if both kidneys were removed. Even though according to medical knowledge, there is no way such an animal can live, our Sages did not deem this condition <i>trefe</i>. See Chapter 10, Halachah 12.</i> it is permitted. Therefore if it was created with only one kidney or with three kidneys<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For we follow the principle that any extra organ is considered as if it was removed.</i> it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">It is, however, considered a blemish and the animal may not be offered as a sacrifice (<i>Hilchot Issurei HaMizbe'ach</i> 2:11).</i> Similarly, it is permitted if a kidney was perforated.
Although [an animal] is permitted despite the fact that a kidney was removed or it was created without it, if its kidney is extremely undersized, it is<i> trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro states that many <i>Rishonim</i> disqualify an animal only when its kidneys shrank because of illness. If, however, it was born with an undersized kidney, it is acceptable. And in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 44:5), he accepts this ruling as law.</i> For a small animal, this means the size of a bean, for a large one, the size of a grape.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 44:12 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 44:13 quote authorities who explain that the grapes of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> were very large during the Talmudic period. At that time, a grape was significantly larger than a bean.</i> Similarly, [an animal could be deemed trefe] if a kidney became afflicted, i.e., its flesh became like the flesh of a dead [animal] that decayed after several days, [degenerating] to the extent that were one to take hold of a portion of it, it would decompose and fall apart. If this condition reached the white portion<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The white fat from the loins enters the kidneys, because the different sinews are all interwoven there, causing a split to appear within the kidney. This is located in the midst of the kidney (Rashi, Rabenu Nissim, <i>Chullin</i> 55b).</i> in the kidney, the animal is <i>trefe</i>. Similarly, if moisture - even if it is not putrid - is found in the kidney or murky or putrid fluid is found there, it is <i>trefe</i>. If, however, clear water is found there,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Even if it reached the white portion [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 44:2)].</i> [the animal] is permitted.

What is meant by the term <i>pesukah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesukah</i> is also one of the eight categories of <i>trefot</i> mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 2.

[This applies] provided the majority of the circumference [of the skin] is severed. If, however, the skin is split lengthwise or perforated, [the animal] is permitted. Similarly, if the backbone was broken, but the spinal cord was not split or the marrow within the cord was crushed and it would wobble, [the animal] is permitted because its skin is still intact.
If the marrow decomposes and it can be poured like water or like molten wax to the extent that the spinal cord cannot stand when it is lifted up, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.

The question is whether this state results from sickness or not.</i>
To where does the spinal cord extend? It begins behind the two glands at the beginning of the neck and extends until the second divider.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachah for a definition of this term.</i> Thus nothing remains after it except the third divider which is close to the beginning of the tail.
There are three dividers. They are three bones that cleave to each other below the vertebrae of the backbone.

For the majority [of its length] was torn.
[The following rules apply if] a circular or oblong portion of this flesh was cut.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The previous halachah was speaking about a slit where the flesh was not necessarily cut away.

When the skin of an animal was removed from it entirely - whether it was torn off by hand or [decomposed due to] sickness - the animal is <i>trefe</i>. This is called <i>geludah</i>.

Perhaps the place from which the skin was removed was in fact not the vital area (for the halachah could follow one of the other views). Even if it was the vital area, perhaps the fact that the skin on the remainder of the body is intact is enough for the animal to be permitted.<br>In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 59:1), Rav Yosef Caro quotes the Rambam's ruling.

He also cites this view in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 58:1).<br>Moreover, in both those sources, Rav Yosef Caro also quotes views that state that this law applies only when the animal fell on its own or knew that it was being pushed by others. If, however, it was pushed suddenly by others, it is considered <i>trefe</i> even if it fell from a lesser height.</i> - and one of its organs was crushed, it is <i>trefe</i>.<br>To what extent must it be crushed? It must be smashed and become ailing because of the fall to the extent that its form and appearance have been destroyed. Even though [the organ] is not perforated, cracked, or broken, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. Similarly, if one struck it with a stone or a staff and crushed one of its organs, it is <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, the distance of ten handbreadths is not significant.

The Ra'avad states that every organ that would render the animal <i>trefe</i> if crushed must be inspected.<br>The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 58:6) writes that in the present era, we are not knowledgeable with regard to conducting these examinations and an animal that falls should be permitted only if it walks, as stated in the next halachah.</i>
If an animal walks after falling from a roof, we do not suspect [that it became <i>trefe</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Walking is adequate proof that the animal was not injured by the fall to the extent that it would no longer survive.

Similarly, he quotes authorities who maintain that it must walk in an ordinary manner. If it limps as it proceeds, an inspection is required. See Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 58:6).<br>In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 58:5), Rav Yosef Caro quotes the opinion of the Rashba who writes that even if an obvious change was seen in its organs, as long as it was able to stand and walk, we do not suspect that it has become <i>trefe</i>.</i> If it stood, but did not walk, we harbor such suspicions.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">And require an inspection.</i> If it jumped [from the roof] on its own [initiative], we do not harbor suspicions.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For we assume that it prepared itself and jumped in a manner that would not cause injury.

When thieves steal lambs and throw them outside the corral, we do not suspect that their organs were crushed, because they throw them only with the intent that they will not be broken.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, the stolen animal will not be of any benefit to them.</i> If they returned them and threw them back to the corral because of fear,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the fear of being caught.</i> we suspect that they [may have become <i>trefe</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For the thieves will not show any care for the animal while throwing it back into the corral.</i> If they returned them out of a desire to repent, we do not harbor suspicions about [the lambs], because [the thieves] have the intent of returning them intact and therefore they will be careful when throwing them back.
When an ox was forced to lie down for slaughter, we do not suspect [that its internal organs were crushed]. [This applies] even if it fell considerably to the extent that it made a great noise<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Chullin, loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as meaning that the ox bellowed, but this does not appear to be the Rambam's understanding.</i> when it fell.

The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 58:10) writes that if the ox's feet are tied when it is pushed to the ground, we do suspect that it may have become <i>trefe</i>. For when its feet are tied, it cannot control its fall.</i>
If one struck an animal on its head and the blow extended toward its tail or [one hit it] on its tail and the blow extended toward its head - even if one struck it on the entire backbone - we do not suspect [that it became <i>trefe</i>].

[The following rules apply if] it is knocked against water.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">It was snared and fell unto a river.</i> If it swam for its full height upriver, against the current, we do not suspect [that it became <i>trefe</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For this exertion indicates that the animal is fundamentally healthy.

In all situations where we said: "We do not harbor suspicions," it is permitted to slaughter [the animal] immediately and it is not necessary to check whether an organ was crushed.

Otherwise, it would not be necessary to single out the uterus. Moreover, he explains that crushing an organ can be more painful and more injurious to an animal than removing it.</i> e.g., the spleen or the kidneys, is crushed, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. [There is] an exception, the uterus; if it is crushed, the animal is permitted.
[The gullet and the windpipe] do not require examination in these situations, for a fall will not crush them.
When an animal fell from a roof and did not stand [afterwards],<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if it stands - even if it does not walk - it can be slaughtered immediately and deemed acceptable through an examination, as above.</i> it is forbidden to slaughter it until one waits an entire day.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For sometimes the effects of a fall are not immediately evident. It is possible that an animal would be inspected and no difficulty found, but in truth, the effects of the fall would be enough to kill it. To reduce the possibility of such an occurrence, <i>Chullin</i> 51b requires waiting an entire day before slaughtering the animal. See <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i> If one slaughtered it during this time, it is <i>trefe</i>. When one slaughters it after a day has passed, an examination is required, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 17.</i>
Similarly, if a person treaded on a fowl<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 56a describes such a situation with regard to an animal.

What is meant by the term <i>sheburah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sheburah</i> is also one of the eight categories of <i>trefot</i> mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 2.

[This applies] provided it is the half that faces the backbone<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the portion close to the backbone. If the ribs are broken there, the animal's functioning can be impaired. If they are broken closer to the chest, the impairment will be less severe.</i> and not the half that faces the chest.
When six [ribs] were broken on either side, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i> [only] when they are large ribs that have marrow. If not, even though they represent the majority of the animal's ribs and they were broken facing the backbone, [the animal] is permitted.<br>Similarly, if the majority of the ribs were uprooted, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>. [Moreover,] if even one rib is uprooted together with half of the vertebra in which it is lodged, it is <i>trefe</i>. Similarly, if even one vertebra was uprooted from the backbone, it is <i>trefe</i>, even if was a vertebra that is below the flanks where there are no ribs.
[The following rules apply when] the thigh of an animal has slipped from its place and has left its socket. If its sinews, i.e., the peg-like projections from the bones of the socket which extend toward the bone that enters the socket<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Speaking in analogy, the Rambam refers to this as "the male" bone.</i> and holds it have degenerated, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad states that if the thigh is dislocated from its upper socket, the animal is <i>trefe</i> even if the sinews have not degenerated. According to the Ra'avad, the law stated by the Rambam applies when the thigh is dislocated from its lower socket. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 55:2) follows the Rambam's perspective. The Rama mentions that there are opinions that maintain that in the present age, we are not knowledgeable with regard to the determination of whether the sinews have degenerated and we should rule an animal <i>trefe</i> whenever its thigh has dislocated.

As long as the bone is in its socket, we assume that the sinews will regenerate [<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 55:2)].</i>
Similarly, with regard to a fowl, if its hip is dislocated,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">And the sinews have degenerated (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> it is <i>trefe</i>.

When the foreleg of an animal is dislocated from its socket, it is permitted.

If a skull was perforated by a number of small holes that [detract from the skull's] substance, they are all added together [to see if their combined size equals] a <i>sela</i>.
Similarly, if the majority of the height<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the majority of the portion of the skull from the eyes up (Rashi, <i>Chullin</i> 52b).</i> and the majority of the circumference of a skull was crushed, [the animal] is <i>trefe</i>, even though its membrane is intact and it is not lacking any substance.

One places his hand next to the hole and applies pressure or he inserts his hand into the fowl's mouth and applies pressure upward.

In that situation, the animal wounded it with a blow that caused it to die."</i> If it ate a poison that could kill a human or it was bitten by a snake or the like, it is permitted with regard to the laws of <i>trefe</i>, but it is forbidden because of the mortal danger [partaking of it could cause].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For the poison or the venom could kill the person who partakes of the animal's meat.

For example, the degeneration of the bronchioles is considered a separate category even though it is a derivative of the category of the perforation of the bronchioles.</i>

These seventy conditions of infirmity which cause a domesticated animal or a wild beast to be forbidden as a <i>trefe</i> were each explained together with all the particular laws. All of the possible parallels that can be found with regard to a fowl in the organs that are common to an animal and a fowl are the same with regard to an animal and a fowl. The only exceptions are the conditions that render an animal <i>trefe</i> in the kidneys, the spleen, and the lobes of the lung. For a fowl does not have a division of lobes like an animal does. If there is such a division, there is no fixed number. The spleen of a fowl is round like a grape and is not the same shape as that of an animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore the distinction between its thick and thin end that applies with regard to an animal does not apply with regard to a fowl. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 43:6) rules that a perforation of the spleen does not render a fowl <i>trefe</i>. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 43:10, however, quotes opinions that rule that a perforation does render it <i>trefe</i>.</i> [The conditions of infirmity] concerning the kidneys and the spleen [that render] an animal <i>trefe</i> were not mentioned in order to find parallels with regard to a fowl. Therefore no set measure was given concerning a fowl with regard to a kidney whose size was reduced. Similar concepts apply in other analogous situations.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., other factors concerning a kidney which render an animal <i>trefe</i>, as mentioned in Chapter 8, Halachah 26. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 44:10) states bluntly: "There are no factors involving the kidneys of a fowl that render it <i>trefe</i>."</i>
There are two conditions that render a fowl <i>trefe</i> in addition to those that render an animal [<i>trefe</i>] despite the fact that [an animal] also possesses these organs. They are: a) a fowl whose digestive organs have changed color because of [exposure to] fire;<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachot 20-21. An animal will not be affected in this way, because his ribs will protect him and the skin of his digestive organs are stronger than that of a fowl. The Ra'avad differs and states that if an animal is subjected to heat and it burns its internal organs to this degree, it will surely die immediately. Therefore, our Sages did not mention it as a <i>trefe</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that there are two other conditions that render a fowl <i>trefe</i>. They involve perforations in the stomachs. Since parallel - albeit not identical - conditions apply with regard to an animal, the Rambam does not list them as separate categories.</i><br>b) a water fowl whose skull bone has been perforated.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 7 of this chapter. This stringency applies only to a water fowl, because its membrane is very soft.</i>
One should not add to these conditions that render an animal <i>trefe</i> at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 54a makes this statement, implying that in the Talmudic era, these rulings were already established.</i> For any condition that occurs with regard to a domesticated animal, wild beast, or fowl aside from those listed by the Sages of the early generations and which were agreed upon by the courts of Israel can possibly live. [This applies] even if it is known to us according to medical wisdom that ultimately it will not live.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> cites <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 17:24 which states:<br>Nevertheless, since these concepts can be proven in an unshakable manner, leaving no room for question, the identity of the author, be he a prophet or a gentile, is of no concern. For when the rationale of a matter has been revealed and has proven truth..., we do not rely on [the personal authority of] the individual who made the statement... but on the proofs he presented.<br>From that perspective, it would appear that the empirical evidence with which science presents us should be followed. Nevertheless, in this source, the Rambam is very adamant in following the Rabbinic perspective. See Chapter 8, Halachah 25, as a clear example.</i>
Similarly, with regard to those [conditions] which [our Sages] listed as [causing an animal to be] deemed <i>trefe</i> even though it appears from the medical knowledge we possess that some of them will not kill and it is possible for the animal to live - we follow only what the Torah says,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:18) states that even if the animal survives for over a year, it is still deemed <i>trefe</i> and it is forbidden to partake of it.</i> as [Deuteronomy 17:11] states: "According to the Torah in which they will instruct you."<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> cites <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 17:24 which states:<br>Nevertheless, since these concepts can be proven in an unshakable manner, leaving no room for question, the identity of the author, be he a prophet or a gentile, is of no concern.

Nevertheless, in this source, the Rambam is very adamant in following the Rabbinic perspective. See Chapter 8, Halachah 25, as a clear example.</i>
Whenever a butcher is knowledgeable about these [conditions that cause an animal to be deemed] <i>trefe</i> and he has established a reputation for observance, he may slaughter [animals], inspect them himself, and sell them without any suspicion. [The rationale is the word of] one witness is accepted with regard to the Torah's prohibition whether his testimony will lead to benefit for him or not.<br>We already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 8:7-9.</i> that we do not purchase meat from a butcher who slaughters and inspects [the animal] himself in the Diaspora or [even] in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in the present age unless he established a reputation as an expert. If he sold an animal that was <i>trefe</i>, we place him under a ban of ostracism and remove him from his position.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> writes that although he is not permitted to sell meat on his own, he is permitted to sell under the supervision of a trustworthy expert.<br>The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 2:2) rules leniently concerning this manner and allows such a person to continue slaughtering in certain situations. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 2:11 questions this leniency.</i> He cannot reestablish his credibility until he goes to a place where his identity is not recognized and he returns a lost article that is very valuable or [slaughters an animal] for himself and declares it <i>trefe</i> even though it involves a significant loss.

Chapter 11

[The following principles apply] whenever a situation arises that creates a doubt that an animal or fowl should be deemed <i>trefe</i> because of one of the above conditions - e.g., an animal that fell and did not walk, it was attacked by a wild beast and we do not know whether the flesh near the intestines turned red or not, its skull was crushed and we do not know if the majority of the skull was crushed or not, or other similar circumstances: If the animal was male and it remained alive for twelve months, we operate on the assumption that it is intact like all other animals. If it was female, [we wait] until it gives birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if it gives birth successfully, that is a sign that it is intact. There is no need for an inspection or waiting twelve months. Even the Rama who maintains that in the present age, we are not knowledgeable with regard to inspections will consider an animal acceptable if it lives this amount of time (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:18).</i><br>With regard to a fowl: If it is male, [we wait] twelve months. If it is female, [we wait] until it lays all the eggs that it is carrying, spawns a new load, and lays them.
During this course of time, it is forbidden to sell an animal concerning which doubt has arisen whether it is a <i>trefe</i> to a gentile lest he sell it to a Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Without informing him of the doubt involved.<br>The Rama quotes the <i>Sha'arei Dura</i> who writes that if a condition that renders an animal <i>trefe</i> is obvious, we permit its sale to a gentile. For a Jew who seeks to purchase it will immediately become aware of the difficulty.<br>The Rama also mentions the ruling of the <i>Terumat HaDeshen</i> that if there is merely a question of whether an animal is <i>trefe</i>, it may be sold to a gentile. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 57:51 accepts this leniency only with regard to an animal regarding which there is a question whether or not it was attacked, but not with regard to other conditions.</i>
We operate under the presumption that all domesticated animals, wild beasts, or fowl are healthy<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 11b explains that this is based on the principle that we follow the majority. Since most animals are healthy we assume that this is an animal's condition unless there is reason to suspect otherwise. Note, however, Halachah 7.</i> and we do not suspect that they possess conditions that would render them <i>trefe</i>. Therefore when they are slaughtered in the proper manner, they do not require an examination to see whether they possess a condition that would render them <i>trefe</i>. Instead, we operate under the presumption that they are permitted unless a situation arises that arouses suspicion.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Chullin</i> 51a, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> goes further and states that even if the animal possesses a condition that is somewhat problematic, if we can find a commonplace explanation for it that will not render an animal <i>trefe</i> and the factor that will render it <i>trefe</i> is uncommon, we do not require an examination.</i> Afterwards, we inspect it with regard to that condition alone.
What is implied? For example if the wing of a fowl is displaced, we check the lung to see if it was perforated.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachah 4.</i> If an animal fell, we check it to see if its organs were crushed.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 17.</i> If the skull was crushed, we check the membrane of the brain to see if it was perforated.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachah 7.</i> If it was struck by a thorn or shot by an arrow, a javelin, or the like and it entered its inner cavity, our suspicions are aroused and we require an inspection of the entire inner cavity lest it have perforated one of the organs whose perforation renders an animal <i>trefe</i>. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
Therefore when there are growths on a lung or <i>sirchos</i> upon it - i.e., strands or adhesions - hanging from it to the ribcage, the heart, or the diaphragm, we suspect that it was perforated and require an inspection.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the strands and similarly, the other conditions the Rambam proceeds to mention, are abnormal factors that lead us to the supposition that there was a perforation in the lung. See Chapter 7, Halachot 5-11 that mention several situations of this nature.</i> Similarly, if a swelling was found that contained fluid, we fear that a bronchiole below it was perforated and [the lung] must be inspected.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that even if the swelling is an indication that the bronchiole has been perforated, that does not disqualify the animal, for it is possible that it is sealed by flesh. The Radbaz explains that the Rambam would also accept that ruling and one of the points that one must inspect is whether there is flesh under the swelling or not.</i>
[Following the logic] of this law, [the following rules] would apply if it was discovered that <i>sirchos</i> like strands were hanging from the lung, whether they extended from the body of the lung to the ribcage or to the heart or to the diaphragm. We cut the <i>sirchah</i>, take out the lung, and [place it] in lukewarm water, and blow it up.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 8. As mentioned in the notes to that halachah, there is a difference of opinion among the <i>Rishonim</i> concerning this issue.<br>The Ra'avad also mentions that the Rambam's ruling here appears to contradict his ruling in Chapter 7, Halachah 5. For there, the Rambam differentiates between whether or not there is a bruise on the chest, and there he does not speak of inspecting the lung in warm water. In a lengthy discussion in his gloss to Chapter 7, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that there is no contradiction between the two rulings.</i> If it is discovered to be perforated,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the water bubbles.</i> [the animal] is<i> trefe</i>. If the water does not bubble, it is intact, without any perforations, and [the animal] is permitted. For [the <i>sirchah</i>] was not at the place of a perforation<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion among the halachic authorities if this situation is possible or not.</i> or perhaps only the outer membrane [of the lung] was perforated. Nevertheless, I never saw anyone who ruled in this manner, nor did I hear of a place that follows such practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as the Rambam proceeds to explain in the following halachah, the common custom is more stringent.</i>
Even though this is what appears [to be the ruling] from the words of the Sages of the Gemara, the widespread custom among the Jewish people is as follows: When a domesticated animal or a wild beast is slaughtered, we tear open the diaphragm and check the lung in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 39:1) which states that we must check the lungs for <i>sirchot</i> and concludes: "Whoever breaks ranks and eats without checking [the lung] should be bitten by a snake."</i> If a <i> sirchah</i> is not discovered hanging between the one of the lobes and the flesh where it lies, whether on the flesh that is between the ribs or the flesh on the breastbone,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in Chapter 7, Halachot 3-4, even a perforation found in this place does not render the animal <i>trefe</i>.</i> or a <i>sirchah</i> was found, extending from one lobe to the other in order,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in Chapter 8, Halachah 5, an adhesion of such a type does not render the animal <i>trefe</i>.</i> or from the body of the lung to the lobe which is next to it,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See the notes to Halachah 9. Depending on the version of that text, the Rambam's ruling concerning this matter may be questioned.</i> we permit [the animal].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama 39:18 writes that it is common custom in the Ashkenazic community to rule that all<i> sirchot</i> in the lung cause an animal to be deemed forbidden except those extending from a lobe to the lobe next to it or those from the body of the lung to the lobe next to it. He does, however, permit leniency if it is possible to rub out the <i>sirchah</i> and then examine it to see that there is no perforation.</i>
If a strand is discovered leading from the lung to any place which it is extended, even if it is thin as a hair, we forbid [the animal].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., except to the lobe that is near it (Radbaz).</i>
Similarly, if there was a strand extending from the lung to the heart, the diaphragm, the protective covering of the heart, or the rose,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 1, which explains that this is a tiny lobe found on the right side of the lung.</i> we forbid [the animal]. [This applies] whether the strand came from the body of the lung or whether it came from a lobe and [applies regardless of its size], even if it was a hairsbreadth.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For we fear that it will cause a perforation in the lung. See the gloss of the Radbaz to Halachah 6.</i><br>Similarly, when the rose is attached to its pocket or a strand extends from it to its pocket, we forbid it. And when a strand extends from lobe to lobe in improper order, we forbid [the animal].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> which the Ra'avad had seemed to apply that even a strand extending from the body of the lung to the lobe is unacceptable. The Ra'avad therefore protests and maintains it is acceptable. The <i>Migdal Oz</i> states that he also saw texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with this version, but that the authoritative manuscripts do not follow that reading. This is also the position of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i>
There are places where the custom is that if a <i>sirchah</i> is from the lobe to the flesh and the bones of the ribs and the <i>sirchah</i> is attached to both of them, they forbid it.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>sirchah</i> is attached to the flesh alone, it does not cause an animal to be considered <i>trefe</i> (see Chapter 7, Halachah 4). Here, however, it is attached to both the flesh and the bone and that creates the problem.</i> My father and teacher is from those who forbid it. I, by contrast, am one of those who permit it.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 39:18) cites the Rambam's position.<br>Parenthetically, the commentaries have questioned the Rambam's statements here from the standpoint of <i>kibud av</i>, "honoring one's father." Seemingly, after mentioning his father, he should have stated - as he himself rules in <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 6:5 - "May he be remembered for the life of the world to come." Also, that same source (Halachah 3) forbids "offering an opinion that outweighs [that of his father]."</i> In a small number of places, they permit it even when it is attached to the bone alone, and I forbid it.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad follows the more lenient view. Here also the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) cites the Rambam's position.</i>
There are places where a lung is [always] blown up to see whether or not it is perforated. In most places, however, it is not blown up, because there is no factor that raised a suspicion [concerning it].

He concludes that the Rambam's position should be given primacy.</i>
All of these factors<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the stringencies forbidding an animal because of certain <i>sirchot</i> and requiring the lungs to be blown up.</i> are not dictated by law, but rather are a result of custom, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Halachot 6 and 7.</i> I never heard of anyone who had a fowl's lung inspected unless a factor that raised suspicions arose.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">At present, there are certain Rabbinic authorities who require that the lungs of a chicken be inspected, because in the present age, since chickens are raised in a manner very different from their natural circumstances, it is common for there to be difficulties with regard to their lungs.</i>
If, [after] a person slaughtered an animal and cut open its belly, a dog or a gentile came, took the lung, and departed before [the slaughterer] checked the lung, [the animal] is permitted. We do not say that perhaps it was perforated or perhaps it was attached [to the bone], for we do not presume that [an animal] was forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">If there is no evidence that a factor existed that caused the animal to become <i>trefe</i>, we do not assume that one existed. Even according to the custom that requires an animal to be checked, we are assuming only the possibility that it might have a disqualifying factor. If there is no way to check it, we assume that the animal is kosher.<br>The Ra'avad differs and maintains that since disqualifying factors involving the lung are common, if a lung was not inspected, we cannot consider the animal as kosher. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 39:2) quotes the Rambam's view. The Rama mentions the position of the Ra'avad and states that the Rambam's position may be followed only when there is a possibility of severe financial loss.</i> Instead, we operate under the presumption that the animal is kosher unless we know what factor caused it to become <i>trefe</i>. Just like we do not suspect that the membrane of the brain was perforated, the backbone [was severed], or the like, we do not raise suspicions over a lung that has been lost. There are no customs regarding such a situation, because customs are not instituted with regard to factors that are not commonplace.
If a gentile or a Jew comes and takes out a lung before the lung was inspected, but the lung [still] exists, we blow it up.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Normally, we would not blow up a lung unless there was a factor that aroused suspicion. Nevertheless, in this instance, since we did not see it in its natural situation - and the possibility exists that there were such factors there - we require an examination. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 39:2 states that, according to our custom [see Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 39:4)] that we do not rely on an examination in a situation where there is a clearly problematic situation, we do not rely on an examination in this instance as well.</i> [This applies] even if we do not know whether there were growths or not, because of the widespread custom.
There are places who rule that we forbid [an animal] if there are<i> sirchot</i> hanging from the lung, even if they are not attached to the chest or to another place. This practice causes great loss and the forfeit of Jewish money. This was never the custom in France or in Spain and it was never heard in the West. It is not proper to follow this custom. Instead, all that is necessary is to blow up [the lung]. If it is discovered to be intact without a perforation, [the animal] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 39:8) rules that such an animal is permitted without the lung being inspected. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 39:12 states that an examination must be conducted to see whether the lung is perforated or not.<br>This represents the difference between <i>glatt</i> meat and meat that is not <i>glatt. Glatt </i>means "smooth," i.e., i.e., there are no <i>sirchot</i>, adhesions, or growths, extending from the animal's lungs. Thus there is no need to inspect it. When meat is not <i>glatt</i>, there were<i> sirchot</i> and/or the like extending from the lungs. They were inspected and no perforation was discovered. Hence, the meat is kosher. Nevertheless, there are many who follow the stringency of not partaking of it.<br>(It must be emphasized that, at present, <i>glatt</i> is sometimes used as a general term to connote a higher level of punctilious observance of the details of kashrus in general without specifically referring to questions concerning the lungs.)</i>

Chapter 12

When a person slaughters an animal and its offspring on the same day, the meat is permitted to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 16:3) mentions a difference of opinion concerning this matter, for some authorities forbid partaking of the meat. The Rama clarifies that the difference of opinion applies only with regard to the second animal. The first animal is permitted. Moreover, even the more stringent authorities maintain that the prohibition applies:<br>a) only that day, and<br>b) only for the transgressor himself. It is a penalty imposed upon him by the Sages and not a prohibition of Scriptural Law. See <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; <i>Turei Zahav</i> 16:23.</i> The slaughterer, however, is punished by lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 101) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 294) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>See <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i>, Vol. III, ch. 48, that states that this prohibition was given to us to prevent cruelty. For an animal will be severely aggrieved if its offspring or its mother is slaughtered before its eyes. Note, however, <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 9:7 where the Rambam emphasizes that the Torah's mitzvot were not given to us for the sake of any particular rationale. Note, however, the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Temurah</i> which explains that there are two dimensions to every mitzvah: that it is God's decree and that He issued that decree for a particular rationale. (See also Halachah 3 which indicates that the prohibition is a Divine decree, not limited to that rationale.)</i> as [Leviticus 22:28] states: "Do not slaughter [an ox or a sheep]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah (and the Rambam) use the masculine although the prohibition applies primarily to a mother and its offspring. See Halachah 11.</i> and its offspring on one day." He receives lashes only for slaughtering the second animal. Accordingly, if one person slaughtered one of such a pair and another person slaughtered the second, [the one who slaughtered the second alone] receives lashes.
The prohibition against slaughtering [an animal] and its offspring applies in all times and in all places, with regard to ordinary animals and sacrificial animals. [With regard to the latter category, it applies] with regard to sacrifices of which we partake and with regard to sacrifices of which we do not partake.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For the prohibition concerns slaughter.</i> Therefore if one slaughtered the first animal in the Temple courtyard and the second outside of it or the first outside the Temple courtyard and the second inside, the one who slaughtered the second animal receives lashes [for violating the prohibition against slaughtering] an animal and its offspring. [This applies] whether they were both ordinary animals,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">And it is forbidden to slaughter an ordinary animal in the Temple courtyard.</i> they were both sacrificial animals,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">And thus may not be sacrificed outside the Temple courtyard.</i> or one<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., either the one that was sacrificed inside the Temple or the one sacrificed outside.

The prohibition against slaughtering [an animal] and its offspring applies only with regard to ritual slaughter, as the verse states: "Do not slaughter." [Implied] is that the prohibition involves the slaughter of both animals. If, however, one chopped off the head of one of them or it became a <i>nevelah</i> in his hand,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the slaughter was unacceptable. If, however, it was discovered that the animal was <i>trefe,</i> it is considered to have been slaughtered and it is forbidden to slaughter the second animal (Halachah 6, <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 16:18).</i> it is permitted to slaughter [the other]. Similarly, if he slaughtered the first and chopped off the head of the second or it became a <i>nevelah</i> in his hand, he is not liable.
When a deaf-mute, an intellectually or emotionally incapable person, or a minor slaughtered the first animal privately,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, they slaughtered under the supervision of a knowledgeable adult, their slaughter is acceptable (Chapter 4, Halachah 5). Hence, this prohibition applies. See Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 16:9).</i> it is permitted to slaughter the second animal afterwards because their slaughter is not considered as slaughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is equivalent to cutting off the head of the animal and the previous halachah applies.</i>
When one slaughters the first animal, but a question arises whether it is a <i>nevelah</i> or not, it is forbidden to slaughter the second [animal].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For perhaps the animal was kosher and one would be violating the prohibition.</i> If one slaughters it, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Because there is a doubt involved.</i>
Slaughter from which it is not fit to eat is, nevertheless, considered slaughter. Therefore if the first person slaughtered an ordinary animal in the Temple courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rambam LeAm</i> questions why this concept is mentioned. It was already stated in Halachah 2.</i> one which is <i>trefe</i>, an ox condemned to be stoned, a calf whose neck is to be broken, a red heifer, or slaughtered for the sake of a false deity,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In all these instances, it is forbidden to benefit from the slaughtered animal. (See <i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i> 11:9; <i>Hilchot Rotzeach</i> 10:6, <i>Hilchot Parah Adumah</i> 1:7; <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 7:2.)</i> a person who slaughters the second animal is liable. Similarly, if one slaughtered the first animal and another slaughtered the second though it is an ordinary animal in the Temple courtyard, an ox condemned to be stoned, a calf whose neck is to be broken, or a red heifer, [the second person] is liable for lashes.
When [the second animal] is slaughtered for the sake of a false deity,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Seemingly, the same principles stated in the previous halachah would apply in this instance. Nevertheless, in this case, there is another factor involved as the Rambam continues to explain.</i> [the slaughterer] is not liable because of [the prohibition against slaughtering] an animal and its offspring, for he is liable for capital punishment.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As befits one who sacrifices to a false deity. One is not liable for both capital punishment and lashes for the same act. Since he is liable for capital punishment, he is not held liable for lashes. (See <i>Ketubot</i> 33b; <i>Chullin</i> 81b.)</i> If, however, he was given a warning for [the prohibition against slaughtering an animal] and its offspring and was not given a warning for the worship of false deities,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when the witnesses administered the warning, they mentioned the lesser transgression and not the more severe one.</i> he receives lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance, he is not liable for the more severe punishment. There is a difference of opinion among the Sages of the Talmud concerning whether one is absolved from liability for lashes in such a situation or not and the halachah follows the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan who maintains that one is liable. See <i>Ketubot</i> 34b-35a, <i>Chullin, loc. cit.</i></i>
The prohibition against slaughtering [an animal] and its offspring applies only with regard to a kosher domesticated animal. [This is derived from the exegesis of Leviticus, <i>loc. cit.</i>]:<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Sifra</i> to the verse which states that the first excludes wild beasts and fowl.</i> "Do not slaughter [an ox or a sheep] and its offspring on one day."<br>[This prohibition] does apply with regard to hybrid species. What is implied? When a [male] deer mates with a [female] goat and one slaughters the goat and its offspring, one is liable. When, however, a [male] goat mates with a [female] deer and one slaughters the deer and its offspring, it is forbidden to slaughter [the deer and its offspring], if one slaughters them, however, one is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 16:11 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 16:16 who debate the rulings of the Rashba and the Maharshal who permit one to slaughter the deer and its offspring even as an initial and preferred option.</i> The Torah forbade slaughtering a cow<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a kosher domesticated animal.</i> and its offspring and not a deer and its offspring.
If the offspring of this deer was female and it gave birth to offspring, one is liable for lashes should he slaughter the female offspring of this deer and its offspring [on the same day].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since ultimately, the ancestor of the hybrid deer was a domesticated animal, we hold the slaughterer liable (see <i>Chullin</i> 80a). Although in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro quotes the opinion of the Rashba who does not hold the slaughtered liable for lashes, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 16:8), he cites the Rambam's view. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 16:12 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 16:17 debate this issue and side with the more lenient views, questioning the Rambam's ruling in light of his position in Halachah 11.</i> Similarly, if a hybrid species is produced by mating a sheep and a goat - regardless of which is male and which is female - [the slaughterer can be held liable for] lashes for [violating the prohibition against slaughtering] an animal and its offspring.
It is permitted to slaughter a pregnant animal. The fetus is considered as a limb of its mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">And not a separate entity for whose slaughter one is held liable.</i> If the fetus emerged alive after the slaughter of its mother and stepped on the ground,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If the fetus does not step on the ground, it need not be slaughtered (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 5:14).

If one did, one is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tosefta</i> states: Since it is not required to slaughter such an animal, one is not liable for slaughtering it together with its mother.</i>
The prohibition against slaughtering [an animal] and its offspring applies with regard to a mother, for the offspring is certainly its own. If one knows with certainty that a male fathered offspring, the two should not be slaughtered on the same day. If one slaughtered [them together, however,] he is not liable for lashes, for there is a doubt whether or not the prohibition applies with regard to males.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This issue was apparently a matter of uncertainty for the Rambam, for in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 5:6) he revised his interpretation several times. His final text (see Rav Kapach's version which differs from the standard published text) parallels the text here. Note, however, <i>Bechorot</i> 7:7 which appears to refer to this prohibition with regard to males.</i>
When a person slaughters a cow and afterwards slaughters two of its offspring, he is liable for two sets of lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For he violated the prohibition twice.</i> If he slaughters [several of] its offspring and then it, he is liable for [only] one set of lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For he performed one forbidden act.</i> If he slaughtered it, its female offspring and the offspring of its offspring, he is liable for two sets of lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance as well, he violated the prohibition twice.</i> If he slaughtered it, the offspring of its offspring and its female offspring, he is liable for [only] one set of lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Although the same act caused two violations of the prohibition, since it was only one deed, the majority opinion in <i>Chullin</i> 82a only holds the person liable for set of lashes.

When two people [each] purchased an animal: one the mother and one the offspring and they brought the matter for judgment,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they both desired to slaughter their animal that day.</i> the one who purchased [the animal] first is allowed to slaughter it first,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 16:6) states that this law applies only when the two purchased the animals from the same person.

If the second purchaser slaughtered [his animal] first, he gains and the first must wait until the next day.
Four times a year, it is necessary for a person who sells an animal to a colleague to inform him that he already sold the mother or the daughter of the animal to another person for the sake of slaughtering it so that the latter purchaser will wait and not slaughter until the next day.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In other situations, it is not necessary to notify him, for it is not certain that either purchaser will slaughter the animal on that day.</i> They are: the day preceding the final holiday of Sukkot,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This is the holiday of Shemini Atzeret/Simchas Torah, a day of great rejoicing.

When does the above apply? When he saw that the person who purchased it last was anxious to buy and it was at the end of the day, [in which instance,] it can be presumed that he will slaughter it immediately. If, however, there was ample time during the day, he is not required to inform him, for perhaps he will not slaughter until the following day.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that he shows repose indicates that he may be purchasing the animal for a later date. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the person's repose is taken into consideration only when he purchases the animal on the day before the day preceding the festival.

Chapter 13

When a person takes a mother together with its young and slaughters it, the meat is permitted to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that he violated a transgression in taking the mother does not cause the meat to be prohibited.</i> He is, however, liable for lashes for slaughtering the mother,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 306) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 544) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>The person transgresses the prohibition when he takes the mother and the offspring. Nevertheless, as long as the mother is alive and he can correct his deed by sending her away, he is not liable for lashes. This follows the principle of <i>lav hanitak li'asai</i>, a prohibition that can be corrected by a positive commandment, as stated in the following halachah.</i> as [Deuteronomy 22:6] states: "Do not take the mother together with its offspring." Similarly, if it died before he sent it away, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For he can no longer fulfill the positive commandment.</i> If he sent it away after he took it, he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For he corrected his actions through the positive commandment.

Similarly, [with regard to] all negative commandments that can be corrected by a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The positive commandment to send away the mother bird is also considered as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah [<i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 148); <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 545)].<br>See the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (to Halachah 19) which explains that <i>Chullin</i> 141a mentions a difference of opinion concerning this mitzvah between Rabbi Yehudah and the Sages. Rabbi Yehudah maintains - and this is the simple meaning of the verse - that the positive commandment requires one to send away the mother bird only before taking it. Thus according to his view, sending away the mother after it was taken does not fulfill a mitzvah and hence, does not correct the transgression. The Sages differ and maintain that the halachic definition of the mitzvah also includes sending away the bird after it was taken. Therefore, if one took the mother together with its young, he can correct his transgression by sending away the mother.

The other view, which as above is accepted as halachah by the Rambam, is that the person becomes liable for lashes when he violates the transgression. It is just that the punishment is suspended as long as he has the opportunity to correct the matter. Once, however, that opportunity no longer exists, even if it is not his fault - e.g., in the matter at hand, the bird dies - that punishment is meted out.</i>
If another person comes and seizes the mother bird from his hands and sends it away or it took flight from his possession without his knowledge, he is liable for lashes. [This is implied by <i>ibid.</i>:7]: "You shall certainly send away [the mother]," i.e., he must send away [the mother bird] himself.

When a male fowl is resting on a nest, one is not obligated to send him away [before taking the young].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 140a emphasizes that the verse mentions a mother, implying "and not a father."</i> When a non-kosher bird is resting on the nest of the eggs of a kosher fowl or a kosher fowl is resting on the eggs of a non-kosher fowl, one is not obligated to send away [the fowl that is resting].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>Chullin</i> 138b states that the verse forbids taking the bird and its offspring "for yourself."

When a [kosher fowl] was resting on kosher eggs of a different species, one should send [the bird] away. If, however, one fails to do so, one is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">There is an unresolved question concerning this issue in <i>Chullin</i> 140b.

A mother from a non-kosher species is excluded because the prooftext uses the term <i>tzipor</i> which indicates a kosher species. A bird which is <i>trefe</i>, though forbidden, is still a <i>tzipor</i> (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 292:1).</i>
When one slits a portion of the gullet<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of the Rambam's words is "If he cut a portion of the signs." We have translated the Rambam's words as above because as obvious from the conclusion of his ruling, there is a doubt whether he is obligated to send away the mother bird. And with regard to the windpipe there is no doubt that he is obligated to send away the mother.<br>To explain: <i>Chullin</i> 140b questions: "Do we say that since after slitting a portion of the signs the animal will be <i>trefe</i>, is there a need to send it away?" Now, if a person slits less than half the windpipe, the fowl is not <i>trefe</i> and if he slits more than half of it, its slaughter is completed. Hence, we are forced to say that he is speaking about cutting a portion - but less than half - of the gullet. If he does not complete the slaughter, making such a slit will render the fowl <i>trefe</i>.</i> [of the mother]<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The fact the Rambam uses the term <i>sheyikachenah</i>, "before he takes her," implies that he is speaking about the mother bird. This understanding is also acknowledged by the <i>Tur</i> and Rabbenu Nissim. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro questions that interpretation, noting that even if the mother bird was made <i>trefe</i> by slitting its gullet, it would have to be sent away as stated in the previous halachah. Therefore, he suggests amending the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> to imply that the signs of the chicks were slit and the question is, since he is involved in the slaughter of the chicks and stopping to send away the mother would render them <i>trefe</i>, must he stop and send her away or not. He follows this interpretation in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 292:10).</i> before he took her, he is liable to send her away. If he did not send her away, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Talmud does not resolve the question it raises, one cannot be held liable for lashes because of the doubt.</i>
[The following laws apply if the mother bird] was hovering [over the nest]: If her wings were touching the nest, one is obligated to send her away.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah uses the expression "resting on the nest." <i>Chullin</i> 40b infers that if the mother is hovering over the nest, the mitzvah does not imply. Since the verse does not use the term "sitting," however, we learn that the obligation exists even when the mother is not sitting in the nest but lingering close by in a manner that its wings are touching.</i> If not, he is not obligated. If there was a cloth or feathers intervening between her wings and the nest, he must send her away. If he did not send her away, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This question is left unresolved by <i>Chullin, loc. cit.</i> Hence, the Rambam rules that one must be stringent and send away the mother, but because of the doubt, cannot be held liable for lashes if he did not.</i>
If there were two rows of eggs and [the mother bird's] wings were touching [only] the top row, [the mother bird] was sitting on unfertilized eggs, but there were good eggs below them, one female was sitting on another female, a male was sitting on the nest and the female was sitting on the male - [in all these situations,] one should not take [the mother bird with the offspring]. If he takes [her], he should send her away. But if he does not send her away, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">All of these situations are questions left unresolved by <i>Chullin</i> 140b. Hence, as above, one must be stringent and send away the mother, but because of the doubt, cannot be held liable for lashes if he did not.</i>
If [the mother bird] was sitting among the young or the eggs and was not touching them,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro mentions a question raised by Rabbenu Nissim: Since touching the nest from the side is not sufficient as indicated by the concluding clause in the halachah, what does it matter if the mother bird touches its young from the side when it sits among them? Based on that objection, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 292:12), he incorporates Rabbenu Nissim's understanding when quoting this law.</i> one is not liable to send her away.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For the Torah speaks about the mother "resting <i>on</i> the eggs or the chicks" and not sitting at their side.</i> Similarly, if she was at the side of the nest and her wings were touching the nest from the side, he is not obligated to send her away.
When [the mother bird was perched] on two branches of a tree and the nest was positioned between them, we make an evaluation. In all instances where the mother would fall on the nest if the branches were removed, one is obligated to send her away.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Chullin</i> 140b, states that this applies even if the mother's wings are not touching the nest. As long as she is resting directly above the nest, it is considered as if she was resting on it. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 292:17 quotes this point as halachah.</i>
When the mother is resting on one chick or on one egg, one is obligated to send her away.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As evident from <i>Chullin</i> 12:3, the Biblical command speaks about "a nest." As long as a nest contains one egg or chick, it is still considered a nest.</i> When a person finds a nest floating on the water or positioned on the back of an animal, he is obligated to send the mother away. [The verse] mentions "chicks or eggs"<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Using a plural form.</i> and "on any tree or on the ground" [not as exclusions], but because the Torah speaks about the commonplace situations.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle applying with regard to many Biblical commandments. See <i>Yevamot</i> 15:2, <i>Shabbat</i> 65a, <i>Nedarim</i> 48a.</i>
It is forbidden to acquire the eggs as long as the mother is resting upon them. Therefore even if a mother bird was resting on eggs or chicks in one's loft or dovecote, they are not considered as "at hand" and his courtyard does not acquire them for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to a principle in Jewish business law which maintains that a person can acquire property by virtue of its presence in his domain. As the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Gezelah Va'Avedah</i> 17:8-11:<br>A person's courtyard can acquire property for him without him being aware of it. Thus, if a lost object falls into a person's courtyard, he acquires it.<br>When does the above apply? When the courtyard is protected. [When, by contrast, a lost article enters a person's] field or garden [different rules apply]. If he is standing at the side of his field and says, "May my field acquire it for me," he acquires it. If, however, he is not standing there, or he is standing there but does not make such a statement [he does not acquire it.]...<br>The [potential for] a man [to acquire property by virtue of its presence in his] courtyard is derived, by contrast, from [the fact that] he is able to acquire an article via an agent.

From that time on, they are considered as "at hand" and this mitzvah does not apply. Indeed, he can tap the nest so that the mother will rise up and then acquire the young (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
It is forbidden to take a mother bird together with her offspring, even to purify a person with <i>tzara'at</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">A skin condition, resembling leprosy, that is visited upon a person as retribution for speaking gossip and slander.

Chapter 14

It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 147) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 187) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to cover the blood of a kosher wild beast or fowl<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Both a wild fowl and a domesticated one. One need not, by contrast, cover the blood of a domesticated animal that was slaughtered.</i> that was slaughtered, as [Leviticus 17:13] states: "If you will snare a wild beast or a fowl that may be eaten, you shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth." Therefore, before covering it, he is obligated to recite the blessing: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the earth who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to cover the blood.
[The mitzvah] to cover the blood applies to animals that are at hand and those that are not at hand. [The verse mentions:] "If you will snare" only because it speaks about the commonplace situation. It applies with regard to ordinary animals, but not to those consecrated: whether they were consecrated [to be offered on] the altar or consecrated to the Temple treasury. If a person transgresses<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For it is forbidden to slaughter animals consecrated to the Temple treasury until they have been redeemed.</i> and slaughters [such an animal], he is not obligated to cover its blood.
If a person slaughters a wild beast or a fowl and afterwards, consecrates them - or consecrates the blood - he is obligated to cover the blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Because when the blood was poured out, it did not have a connection to the Temple treasury, and at that time, the person became obligated to cover it.</i>
It is necessary to cover the blood of a hybrid that comes from the mating of an animal and a wild beast or an animal that we do not know whether to classify as a domesticated animal or a wild beast,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries to <i>Chullin</i> 83a employ this interpretation with regard to a <i>kevi</i>, an animal which one opinion in <i>Chullin</i> 80a understands as referring to an animal whose species could not be identified as a domesticated animal or a wild beast. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 28:4) employs this concept with regard to a buffalo.</i> but one does not recite the blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">We are unsure of the status of this animal and do not know whether there is an obligation to cover its blood or not. Hence, we cover it, but do not recite a blessing, lest the blessing be recited in vain.</i> When a person slaughters for the sake of a sick person on the Sabbath, he is obligated to cover the blood after the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For covering it on the Sabbath would be a violation of the prohibition against performing labor.</i> Similarly, when a person slaughters an animal whose status is doubtful or is a hybrid on a festival, he should cover its blood after the festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He is required to cover the animal's blood because of the doubt as stated in the first clause. Nevertheless, he may not cover it on the festival, for perhaps he is not obligated to do so, and hence, will be performing a forbidden labor on the festival for no valid reason. For this reason, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 28:3) rules that, as an initial and preferred option, one should not slaughter such an animal on a festival. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 498:18) which states that even if one has earth prepared before the festival so that covering the blood will not involve the transgression of a prohibition, one should not cover it on a festival because of the impression that will be created. People might think that it was definitely determined that it is a wild beast and may therefore partake of its fat [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 6:1) based on <i>Beitzah</i> 8b].<br>See also the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 28:10 which states that the blood must be poured out on the ground on the festival. It cannot be saved in a utensil (because of the prohibition mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 5) and spilled out after the festival.</i>
When a person slaughters many fowl and several types of wild beasts in one place, he should recite one blessing and cover the blood of all of them together at one time.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is not necessary to cover the blood immediately. Instead, one may wait until he has slaughtered all the animals he desires and then cover the blood.</i>
When blood becomes mixed with water, one is obligated to cover it if it has the appearance of blood. If not, one is not liable. If it became mixed with wine or the blood of a domesticated animal, one considers it as if they were water. If were [the wine or blood] to have been water, [the mixture] would have appeared to be blood, he is obligated to cover the entire mixture. If not, he is not obligated.
If a person covered blood and then it became revealed, he is not obligated to cover it a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For he has already fulfilled the mitzvah involved.</i> If blood was covered by [dust blown] by the wind, one is not obligated to cover it.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For the Torah's commandment obligates one to cover only blood that is apparent. If it is covered, there is no mitzvah involved.</i> If it became revealed again after the wind covered it, he is obligated to cover it.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since the person never covered the blood himself, it is as if it was never covered. See <i>Pitchei Teshuvah</i> 28:4; <i>Magen Avraham</i> 586:6 which discuss whether there is a definite obligation to cover the blood in such a situation or there is an unresolved question and one does so because of the doubt involved. The question of whether or not to recite a blessing in this situation depends on the clarification of this issue.</i>
If there is no other blood [from the slaughter] except the blood which spurted out [while the animal was being slaughtered] and the blood on the knife,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Usually, a certain quantity of blood is poured out directly after the slaughter as well.</i> one is obligated to cover it.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam's interpretation of the mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 6:6), if there is other blood aside from this, it is sufficient to cover that other blood. It is not necessary to cover all the blood. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that all the blood must be covered. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 28:15 follows the Rambam's view.</i>
[The following rules apply if] one slaughters and the blood is absorbed in the ground. If a mark remains, he is obligated to cover it. If not, it is as if it was covered by the wind<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 7.</i> and he is not obligated to cover it.
The only blood that must be covered is the blood of slaughter [that produces meat] that is fit to be eaten, as [the prooftext cited] states: "that may be eaten."<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This prooftext causes the ruling to be different from that applying to the prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring on the same day. See <i>Chullin</i> 85a.</i> Therefore, if a person slaughters and the animal is discovered to be <i>trefe</i>, one slaughters ordinary [fowl or beasts] in the Temple Courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Which are forbidden to be eaten (Chapter 2, Halachah 2).</i> one slaughters fowl or beasts that were condemned to be stoned to death,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an animal or fowl that killed a human.</i> one slaughters an animal and causes it to become a <i>nevelah</i>, one is not obligated to cover the blood.

With what should [the blood] be covered? With earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Though this term is not found in the standard printed texts. It is found in authoritative manuscripts and early printings. The version of the standard printed text can be interpreted to mean that in this halachah, the Rambam is clarifying which other substances can be considered as "earth."<br>When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 28:23) gives the following introduction: "Any substance in which seeds will grow is called סearth'.... If [seeds] will not grow in it, but it is called סearth,' we may cover [blood] with it."</i> lime, gypsum, fine fertilizer, fine sand that need not be crushed by a potter, crushed rocks and earthen-ware, fine flax chips, fine saw dust, bricks, burnt mud,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:1). In his commentary to 3:7, 10:2, he interprets the term as "crushed earthenware." We, however, used the former translation to avoid redundancy. Others cite the interpretation of the <i>Aruch</i> who explains that the term refers to a type of lime.</i> and sealing clay that are crushed, for all of these are types of "earth." If, however, one covered it with a utensil or with stones, it is not considered as "covered," for the verse states "with earth."
For this reason, we do not cover [blood] with coarse fertilizer, coarse sand, flour, bran, grain fiber, or filings from metal utensils, for these are not types of "earth." There is one exception: filings of gold alone may be used to cover [blood], for they are called "dust,"<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term <i>afar</i> has both the meaning "earth" and "dust."</i> as [Job 28:6] states: "And it possesses the dust of gold" and [Deuteronomy 9:21] speaks [of grinding the Gold Calf] "until it was thin, into dust."
We may cover [blood] with oven soot, stibium,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">A blue-powder uses for makeup and medicinal purposes in Talmudic times.</i> powder from mills, and ashes.

With the ruling in this halachah, the Rambam is explaining that although it is forbidden to benefit from the property - and even the ashes - of such a condemned city, its ashes may be used for this purpose. The rationale is that using the ashes for the mitzvah is not considered as benefiting from them, because the mitzvoth were not given for our benefit (<i>Chullin</i> 89a).</i>
One who slaughters must place earth below<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Moreover, this earth must be loose. One should not slaughter over a place where the earth is hard [<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 28:5)].</i> and then slaughter, [pouring the blood] into [the earth]. Afterwards, he covers it with earth. He should not slaughter [and pour the blood] into a container<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the utensil contains murky water and thus the prohibition mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 5, does not apply.</i> and then cover it with earth.
The person who slaughters [the animal] should cover its blood,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">One may, however, give another person the privilege of fulfilling the mitzvah. For that reason, there are many who ask the ritual slaughterer for the privilege of fulfilling the mitzvah of covering the blood after fulfilling the custom of <i>kapporot</i>. Nevertheless, one must ask the slaughterer for the privilege, one who takes it without asking is liable to pay the slaughterer a fine for "stealing" his mitzvah. See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 28:8.</i> as [the above prooftext ] states: "[You shall pour out its blood and] cover it with earth."<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 87a states: "The one who סpours out its blood' should סcover it.'"</i> If he did not cover the blood and another person sees it, he is obligated to cover it, for this is an independent mitzvah and is not dependent on the slaughterer alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin, loc. cit.,</i> notes that the passage states: "And you shall say to the children of Israel," implying that the mitzvah is the concern of the entire people.</i>
