Mishneh Torah, Forbidden Foods



Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment to know the signs that distinguish between domesticated animals, beasts, fowl, fish, and locusts that are permitted to be eaten and those which are not permitted to be eaten,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam includes these four among the Torah's 613 mitzvot in his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandments 149-152). The Ra'avad (in his <i>hasagot</i> to the listing of the mitzvot at the beginning of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>) and the Ramban (in his <i>hasagot</i> to general principle 6 in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>) differ and maintain that they should not be counted as mitzvot. According to their view, the mitzvot involve the observance of the prohibitions, but there is no positive act involved that could be considered as the observance of a commandment. [The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvot 153, 470, 158, and 155) mentions these mitzvot, but explains that he personally subscribes to the opinion of the Ramban that they should be not included among the 613 mitzvot.]<br>In his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam explains his position. Leviticus 11:2 states: "This is the living creature that you may eat...." The <i>Sifri</i> commenting on that verse describes it as a positive commandment. Now there is no positive commandment to eat kosher meat. The commandment is to know which species are kosher and to make a distinction between them and those which are not kosher meat as implied by the verse the Rambam cites here: "And you shall distinguish...." For it is only in this way, that one will be able to eat kosher meat. See also the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>. And see Chapter 2, Halachah 1, where the Rambam explains how he derives the idea that both a positve mitzvah and a negative mitzvah are involved.</i> as [Leviticus 20:25] states: "And you shall distinguish between a kosher animal and a non-kosher one, between a non-kosher fowl and a kosher one." And [Leviticus 11:47] states: "To distinguish between the kosher and the non-kosher, between a beast which may be eaten and one which may not be eaten."
The signs of a [kosher] domesticated animal and beast are explicitly mentioned in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:3.</i> There are two signs: a split hoof and chewing the cud. Both are necessary.<br>Any domesticated animal and beast that chews the cud does not have teeth on its upper jaw-bone. Every animal that chews the cud has split hoofs except a camel.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions why the Rambam does not mention a rabbit or a hare. The Torah specifically mentions that they chew their cud. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam does not mention them because they have teeth on their upper jaw.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 79:1) also mention that a camel has two teethlike growths on its upper jaw, but they do not in any way resemble teeth.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's intent is that any kosher domesticated animal or wild beast that chews its cud will not have teeth on its upper jaw and every such animal will have a split hoof.</i> Every animal that has split hoofs chews the cud except a pig.
Therefore if a person finds an animal whose hoofs are cut off in the desert and he cannot identify its species, he should check its mouth. If it does not have teeth on its upper jaw, it can be identified as kosher, provided one can recognize a camel.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if one sees that the domesticated animal is not a camel, one can assume that it is kosher, for a camel is the only non-kosher animal without teeth on its upper jaw.</i> If a person finds an animal whose mouth is cut off, he should check its hooves, if they are split, it is kosher, provided he can recognize a pig.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For a pig is the only non-kosher animal with split hooves.</i><br>When both its mouth and its hoofs are cut off, he should inspect the end of its tail after he slaughters it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For before slaughtering it, such an inspection would be painful for the animal.</i> If he discovers that [the strings of] its meat extend both lengthwise and widthwise,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the commentary of the Meiri to <i>Chullin</i> 59a. Rashi interprets that passage slightly differently and his opinion is cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>79:1).</i> it is kosher, provided he can recognize a wild donkey. For [the strings of] its meat also extend both lengthwise and widthwise.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 79:1) mention another sign for a kosher animal: horns.</i>
When a kosher animal gives birth to an offspring resembling a non-kosher animal, it is permitted to be eaten even though it does not have split hoofs or chew the cud, but instead, resembles a horse or a donkey in all matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by the Rambam's statements in the following halachah, the matter is dependent on the species and not the presence of distinguishing signs in and of themselves.</i><br>When does the above apply? When he sees it give birth. If, however, he left a pregnant cow in his herd and found an animal resembling a pig dependent on it, the matter is doubtful and [the young animal] is forbidden to be eaten. [This applies] even if it nurses from [the cow], for perhaps it was born from a non-kosher species, but became dependent on the kosher animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad qualifies the Rambam's ruling, stating that it applies only when the person possesses a non-kosher animal in his herd. If that is not the case, we do not suspect that a non-kosher newborn came from elsewhere. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 79:6 do not accept this addition.</i>
When a non-kosher animal gives birth to an offspring resembling a kosher animal, it is forbidden to be eaten. [This applies] even if it has split hoofs and chews its cud and resembles an ox or a sheep in all matters. [The rationale is that offspring] produced by a non-kosher animal are not kosher<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See also the beginning of ch. 3.</i> and those produced by a kosher animal are kosher.<br>For this reason, a non-kosher fish found in the belly of a kosher fish is forbidden, and a kosher fish found in the belly of a non-kosher fish is permitted, for they did not produce the fish, but instead, swallowed it.
When a kosher animal gives birth to an offspring that has two backs and two backbones<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a calf born with a Siamese twin.</i> or such a creature is discovered within [an animal that was slaughtered], it is forbidden to be eaten. This is what is meant by the term <i>hashisuah</i> which is forbidden by the Torah, as [Deuteronomy 14:7] states: "These may not be eaten from those which chew the cud and have split hoofs, the <i>shisuah</i>...", i.e., an animal that was born divided into two animals.
Similarly, when [a fetus] resembling a fowl is found within a [slaughtered] animal, it is forbidden to be eaten. [This applies] even if it resembles a kosher fowl. [For when a fetus] is discovered in an animal, only one which has a hoof is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The hoof, however, need not be split as indicated by Halachah 4. See also Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 13:5) and <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 13:20 who rule more leniently.</i>
There are no other domesticated animals or wild beasts in the world that are permitted to be eaten except the ten species mentioned in the Torah. They are three types of domesticated animals: an ox, a sheep, and a goat, and seven types of wild beasts: a gazelle,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The translation of the names of these seven species is a matter of debate among both Torah commentaries and zoologists. Our translation is taken from Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's Living Torah. Consult the notes there for a detailed discussion of the matter. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 80:3; Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 28:4 who discuss these issues. In practice, we partake of the meat of an animal only when there is an established tradition that it is permitted (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 80:1).</i> a deer, an antelope, an ibex, a chamois, a bison, and a giraffe. [This includes the species] itself and its subspecies, e.g., the wild ox and the buffalo are subspecies of the ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and others interpret <i>t'o</i> as referring to a wild ox.</i><br>All of these ten species and their subspecies chew the cud and have split hoofs. Therefore, a person who recognizes these species need not check neither their mouths,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">To see whether or not they have teeth on their upper jaw, as stated in Halachah 3.</i> nor their feet.
Although all these species are permitted to be eaten, we must make a distinction between a kosher domesticated animal and a kosher wild beast. For the fat of a wild beast is permitted to be eaten and its blood must be covered.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i>, ch. 14.</i> With regard to a kosher domesticated animal, by contrast, one is liable for <i>kerais</i> for partaking of its fat<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7.</i> and its blood need not be covered.
According to the Oral Tradition, these are the distinguishing signs of a [kosher] wild beast: Any species that has split hoofs, chews its cud, and has horns which branch off like those of a gazelle are certainly kosher wild beasts. [The following laws apply with regard to] all those whose horns do not branch off: If they are curved, like the horns of an ox, notched, like the horns of a goat, but the notch should be embedded within them, and spiraled, like the horns of a deer,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 3:6) for a definition of these terms. The Ra'avad, the Rashba, and Rashi offer slightly different definitions for these terms.</i> it is a kosher wild beast. Its horns, however, must have these three signs: They must be curved, notched, and spiraled.
When does the above apply? With regard to a species that he does not recognize. [Different rules apply with regard to] the seven species mentioned in the Torah. If he recognizes this species, he may partake of its fat and is obligated to cover its blood, even one does not find any horns on it at all.
A wild ox is a species of domesticated animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Although it is not domesticated and lives like a wild beast, it is still placed in this category.</i> A unicorn<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This was not a mythical beast, but a species of antelope known to exist during the Talmudic period (<i>Chullin</i> 59b).</i> is considered a wild beast even though it has only one horn.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">And all other kosher wild beasts have two.</i><br>Whenever we have a doubt whether an animal is a domesticated animal or a wild beast, its fat is forbidden, but lashes are not given for partaking of it, and we must cover its blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we accept the stringencies resulting from both positions. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 80:3 adds that since we are not certain that this is required, we do not cover its blood on a festival. Similarly, the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 80:4 states that a blessing is not recited before covering its blood.</i>
A mixed species that comes from the mating of a kosher domesticated animal and a kosher wild beast is called a <i>koi</i>. Its fat is forbidden, but lashes are not given for partaking of it, and we must cover its blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Hilchot Nazirut</i> 2:10-11 which states that in certain ways it is like a domesticated animal (its fat is forbidden). In others, it is like a wild beast (its blood must be covered). Still in others it is like neither a domesticated animal or a wild beast (for it is considered as a mixed species with either of them) and in others (that it must be slaughtered), it resembles both.</i> A non-kosher species will never be impregnated by a kosher species.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if they are mated, they will not produce offspring.</i>
The distinguishing signs of a kosher [species of] fowl are not mentioned explicitly by the Torah. Instead, the Torah mentions<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:13-19; Deuteronomy 14:12-18.</i> only the non-kosher species. The remainder of the species of fowl are kosher. There are 24 forbidden species. They are:<br>a) the eagle,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, the translation of the names of these species is a matter of debate among both Torah commentaries and zoologists. Our translation is taken from Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's Living Torah. Consult the notes there for a detailed discussion of the matter. In practice, we only partake of those species of fowl concerning which we have an established tradition that they are acceptable.</i><br>b) the ossifrage,<br>c) the osprey;<br>d) the kite, this is identical with the <i>rayah</i> mentioned in Deuteronomy,<br>e) the vulture, this is identical with the <i>dayah</i> mentioned in Deuteronomy,<br>f) members of the vulture family; for the Torah states "according to its family," implying that two species [are forbidden],<br>g) the raven,<br>h) the starling;<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others who state that there is a difference of opinion whether this species is acceptable or not.</i> since the Torah states "according to its family" with regard to the raven, the starling is included,<br>i) the ostrich,<br>j) the owl,<br>k) the gull,<br>l) the hawk,<br>m) the gosshawk, for this is among the hawk family; and the verse says "according to its family,"<br>n) the falcon,<br>o) the cormorant,<br>p) the ibis,<br>q) the swan,<br>r) the pelican,<br>s) the magpie,<br>t) the stork,<br>u) the heron,<br>v) members of the heron family; for the Torah states "according to its family,"<br>w) the hoopie, and<br>x) the bat.<br>
Whoever is knowledgeable with regard to these species<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned, there is a difference of opinion regarding the species associated with these names and there are few if any individuals who can claim the desired level of familiarity (see <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 82:1).</i> and their names<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by Chapter 3, Halachah 18, the knowledge of the names of the species is important. Otherwise, the hunter's word is not accepted.</i> may partake of any fowl from other species.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For these are the only ones forbidden by the Torah.</i> A kosher species of fowl may be eaten based on tradition, i.e., that it is accepted simply in that place that the species of fowl is kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">If there is such a tradition, there is no necessity to check the signs mentioned in the following halachah.</i> A hunter's word is accepted if he says: "The hunter who taught me told me<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 63b states that this refers to a person who taught hunting and not a teacher of Torah, for it is possible that the Torah teacher will not be able to actually identify the species. Nevertheless, if a Rabbinical authority testifies that he has received the tradition that a species is acceptable, we follow his ruling (<i>Siftei Cohen, loc. cit.</i>).</i> that this fowl is permitted," provided that [teacher] has an established reputation as being knowledgeable with regard to these species and their names.
Whoever does not recognize these species and does not know their names must check according to the following signs given by our Sages: Any fowl that attacks with its claws<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 3:6), the Rambam defines this as meaning "place its claws on the object that it desires to eat and eats it."</i> and eats is known to be among these species and is unkosher. If [a fowl] does not attack with its claws and eat, it is kosher if it possesses one of the following signs: a) it has an extra claw,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a claw that is positioned higher and behind the fowl's row of claws (Rashi, <i>Chulin</i> 62a). Although most species of fowl possess such a claw, it is called "extra," because it is not positioned in the row of claws. Alternatively, the Hebrew term <i>yeterah</i> can be translated not as "extra," but as "larger," i.e., a claw that is larger than the others (Rabbenu Nissim).</i> b) a crop;<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">An organ which parallels a human's stomach.</i> this is also referred to as a <i>mur'ah</i>, c) [the membrane of] its craw<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">An extra muscular stomach that exists in fowl.<br>We are speaking about the inner membrane (Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Chulin</i> 3:6). See <i>Chatam Sofer, Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 50.</i> can be peeled by hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 82:2) quotes the Rambam's words, it concludes: "Even though a fowl possesses these three signs, it should not be eaten, because we suspect that it might be a bird of prey unless they have a tradition given to them by their ancestors that this species is kosher." Similarly, the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 82:3) states: "One should not partake of any fowl unless there is a received tradition that it is kosher. This is the accepted custom. One should not deviate from it." Thus even if a species of fowl possesses these three signs, we do not partake of it.</i>
[The rationale is that] there are none of the forbidden species that do not attack with its claws and eat and possesses one of these three signs with the exception of the ossifrage and the osprey. And the ossifrage and the osprey are not found in settled areas, but rather in the deserts of the distant islands that are very far removed to the extent that are located at the ends of the settled portions of the world.
If its craw can be peeled with a knife, but cannot be peeled by hand and it does not possess any other sign even though it is not a bird of prey, there is an unresolved doubt regarding the matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">And we do not permit it.</i> If the membrane was firm and tightly attached, but [the craw] was left in the sun and it became looser [to the extent that] it could be peeled by hand, [the species] is permitted.
The <i>Geonim</i> said that they have an existing tradition that one should not rule to permit a fowl that possesses only one of these signs unless that sign is that its craw can be peeled by hand. If, however, it cannot be peeled by hand, it was never permitted [to be eaten] even if it possesses a crop or an extra claw.
Whenever a bird divides its claws when a line is extended for it,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it stands on a rope or a pole extended for it by gripping the rope or pole with its claws (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Chulin</i> 3:6).</i> placing two on one side and two on the other or it seizes an object in the air and eats while in the air, it is a bird of prey<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For these actions indicate that it uses its claws to attack other animals.</i> and non-kosher. Any species that lives together with non-kosher species and resembles them, is itself non-kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 65a states that only species that are themselves impure will dwell together with impure species.</i>
There are eight species of locusts which the Torah permitted:<br>a) a white locust,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, the translation of the names of these species is a matter of debate among both Torah commentaries and zoologists. Our translation is taken from Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's Living Torah. Consult the notes there for a detailed discussion of the matter. In practice, it is common in most communities not to partake of any species of locusts (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 85:1). In the Yemenite community, however, there are certain species of locusts which are eaten.</i> b) a member of the white locust family,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah mentions four names of locust species and in connection with each states "according to its family," indicating that a sub-species is also permitted.</i> the <i>razbenit</i>, c) the spotted grey locust, d) a member of the spotted grey locust family, the <i>artzubiya</i>, e) the red locust, d) a member of the red locust family, the bird of the vineyards, f) the yellow locust, g) a member of the yellow locust family, the <i>yochanah</i> of Jerusalem.
Whoever is knowledgeable with regard to these species and their names may partake of them. A hunter's word is accepted as [stated with regard] to a fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 15.</i> A person who is not familiar with them should check their identifying signs. [The kosher species] have three signs. Whenever a species has four legs, four wings that cover the majority of the length and the majority of the width of its body, and it has two longer legs to hop, it is a kosher species.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 66a speaks of four identifying signs for a kosher locust: a) four wings, 2 long legs, four legs, and the fact that its wings cover the majority of its body..</i> Even if its head is elongated and it has a tail, if it is referred to as a locust, it is a kosher species.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishneh (<i>Chullin81</i>, the conclusion of ch. 3) which states that the factor of fundamental importance is that the specis be referred to as a locust. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 85a).</i>
When [a locust] does not have wings or extended legs at present, or its wings do not cover the majority [of its body], but it will grow them later when it grows larger, it is permitted [to be eaten] at present.
There are two signs of [kosher] fish: fins and scales. Fins are used by the fish to swim and scales are those which cling<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this term implies that the scales are not an integral part of the fish but can be separated from its body either by hand or with a utensil. If they cannot be separated from the fish, the fish is not kosher [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 83:1)].</i> to its entire body. Any fish that possesses scales will have fins.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if one finds scales on a piece of fish, there is no need to check whether it possessed fins (the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 83:3).<br><i>Chulin</i> 66b asks: If so, why did the Torah mention fins and answers that this magnifies and amplifies the Torah.</i> If it does not have them at present, but when it grows, it will have them or if it has scales while in the sea, but when it emerges it sheds its scales,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">There are several species of kosher fish which shed their scales in this manner.</i> it is permitted.<br>When a fish does not have scales that cover its entire body, it is permitted. Even if it has only one fin and one scale,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> and Rama (<i>loc. cit.</i>) quote the view of certain <i>Rishonim</i> who maintain that in such an instance, the scale must be located under its gills, fins, or tail.</i> it is permitted.

Chapter 2

Since it is written [Deuteronomy 14:6]: "Any animal that has split hooves, [whose foot] is divided into two hoofs and chews the cud, [this may you eat],"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Similar verses are also stated in that passage with regard to fish, fowl, and locusts. Like verses are also stated in Leviticus, except that in Leviticus, there is no such commandment with regard to a kosher fowl. To include that as well, the Rambam refers to the passage in Deuteronomy.</i> one may derive that any animal that does not chew its cud and have split hoofs is forbidden. A negative commandment that comes as a result of a positive commandment is considered as a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it does not have the severity of a negative commandment. Hence its violation is not punishable by lashes.<br>The Rambam is explaining that the Torah is not commanding us to eat kosher species, for there is no obligation to partake of them. Instead, it is commanding us to take precautions - through checking distinguishing signs - against partaking of non-kosher ones. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 6) where the Rambam elaborates in the explanation of the concept of a prohibition derived from a positive commandment. See also Chapter 1, Halachah 1, and notes which deals with this issue.</i><br>With regard to the camel, the pig, the rabbit, and the hare, [Leviticus 11:4]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Here the Rambam cites the verses from Leviticus - although like verses also appear in Deuteronomy - for Leviticus comes first in the Torah.</i> states: "These you may not eat from those which chew the cud and have split hoofs." From this, you see that they are forbidden by a negative commandment, even though they possess one sign of kashrut. Certainly, this applies to other non-kosher domesticated animals and wild beasts that do not have any signs of kashrut.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have raised a question concerning the Rambam's statements. There is a general principle (<i>Pesachim</i> 24a, <i>et al</i>): "We do not issue a warning on the basis of logical deduction." Implied is that a person is not given lashes when a prohibition is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, but instead derived through logic. Why then, these commentaries ask, are lashes given for partaking of non-kosher species other than the four mentioned specifically by the Torah?<br>The Rambam offers a resolution to this question in his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 172). There he explains that in this instance, we are not deriving the prohibition on the basis of logic, for it is already stated in the positive commandment. We are using logic only to derive that this prohibition is also included in the negative commandment.</i> The prohibition against eating them involves a negative commandment in addition to the positive commandment that is derived from "This may you eat."
Therefore anyone who eats an olive sized portion<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Approximately, an ounce in contemporary measure.</i> of the meat of a non-kosher domesticated animal or wild beasts is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law. This applies whether he partook of the meat or the fat. For the Torah did not distinguish between the meat and fat of non-kosher animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Such a distinction is made with regard to the meat and fat of kosher animals. With regard to non-kosher animals, by contrast, the two are included in the same category and the same prohibition applies to both of them.</i>
With regard to humans: Although [Genesis 2:7] states: "And the man became a beast with a soul," he is not included in the category of hoofed animals. Therefore, he is not included in the [above] prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For the prohibition mentions the animal's hoofs.</i> Accordingly, one who partakes of meat or fat from a man - whether alive or deceased - is not liable for lashes. It is, however, forbidden [to partake of human meat] because of the positive commandment [mentioned above].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and the Rashba differ with the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that there is no prohibition at all against partaking of meat from a human. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 79:1) follows the Rambam's ruling.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains the Rambam's position, noting that - as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 2, and in Chapter 6, Halachot 1-2 - there is no Scriptural prohibition against partaking of milk and blood from a human. Now these leniencies are derived from the exegesis of verses from the Torah. Were the meat of a human not to be forbidden, why would it be necessary to teach that his milk and blood are permitted? Who would have thought otherwise?</i> For the Torah [Leviticus 11:2] lists the seven species of kosher wild beasts and says: "These are the beasts of which you may partake." Implied is that any other than they may not be eaten. And a negative commandment that comes as a result of a positive commandment is considered as a positive commandment.
When one partakes of an olive-sized portion of a non-kosher fowl, he is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law, as [Leviticus 11:13] states: "These shall you detest from the fowl. You shall not partake of them." And he violates a positive commandment, as [Deuteronomy 14:11] states: "You may partake of all kosher fowl." Implied is that the non-kosher may not be eaten.<br>Anyone who partakes of an olive-sized portion of a non-kosher fish is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law, as [Leviticus 11:11] states: "They shall be detestable for you. Do not partake of their meat." And he violates a positive commandment, as [Deuteronomy 14:9] states: "All that possess fins and scales, you may eat." Implied is that those that do not possess fins and scales may not be eaten. We thus learn that anyone who partakes of a non-kosher fish, domesticated animal, wild beast, or fowl nullified a positive commandment and violated a negative commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 172, 173, 174) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvot 154, 156, 157) include these among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i>

For example, a fly, a mosquito, a hornet, a bee, or the like.
When one partakes of an olive-sized portion of a teeming animal of the land, he is liable for lashes, as [Leviticus 11:41] states: "Any teeming animal that swarms on the ground is detestable to you.

The eight teeming animals that are mentioned in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:29-30. The translation of the names of these eight species is a matter of debate among both Torah commentaries and zoologists. Our translation is taken from Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's Living Torah. Consult the notes there for a detailed discussion of the matter.<br>The Torah singles these teeming animals out from others and states that they convey ritual purity. It does not mention anything about them with regard to the prohibition against partaking of their flesh. Nevertheless, since this quantity of their flesh is significant in another halachic context, it is also considered significant with regard to this prohibition (<i>Meilah</i> 16b). This explains why the minimum measure for which they are liable is less than that associated with other prohibitions.</i> are: the weasel, the mouse, the ferret, the hedgehog, the chameleon, the lizard, the snail, and the mole. A person who eats a lentil-sized portion of their meat is liable for lashes. The minimum measure that one is prohibited to partake of their meat is the same as the minimum measure that conveys ritual impurity. They all may be combined together to reach the measure of a lentil.
When does the above apply? When one partakes of them after they have died.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For their flesh only conveys ritual impurity after they have died.</i> If, however, one cuts off a limb from a living creature from one of these species and eats it, he does not receive lashes unless he [partakes of] an olive-sized portion of meat. They all may be combined together to reach the measure of an olive.<br>One who eats an entire limb of a teeming animal after it dies does not receive lashes unless it contains a lentil-sized amount of meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Shaar Avot HaTumah</i> 4:3 states that there is no minimum measure with regard to the limbs of a teeming animal within the context of ritual impurity. A person who touches an entire limb of a such an animal after its death becomes impure even if the limb is smaller than the size of a lentil. Nevertheless, we do not rule that one is liable if he eats such a limb.<br><i>Meilah, loc. cit.</i>, explains that although the limbs of other animals also convey ritual impurity no matter what their size, one is not liable unless he partakes of an olive-sized portion. Hence, there is no reason to extend the stringency that applies with regard to these teeming animals any further.</i>
The blood of these eight teeming animals and their flesh can be combined to reach the minimum measure of a lentil, provided the blood is still attached to their flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If not, one is not liable until he partakes of an olive-sized portion, as stated in the following halachah.</i> Similarly, the blood of a snake<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Which is not one of the teeming animals explicitly mentioned by the Torah.</i> is combined with its flesh to reach the measure of an olive and one receives lashes for it. The rationale is that its flesh is not separate from its blood, even though it does not impart ritual impurity.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the blood of the eight teeming animals that were singled out by the Torah.</i> Similar concepts apply with regard to other teeming animals that do not convey ritual impurity.
When a person collects the blood of teeming animals that has been separated [from their bodies] and partakes of it, he receives lashes if he partakes of a portion the size of an olive.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (in his gloss to Halachah 9) states that this applies even to the eight teeming animals mentioned explicitly in the Torah. Once their blood is separated from their bodies, the minimum measure is the same as that of other species.</i> [This applies] provided he was warned against partaking of it because [of the prohibition against partaking of] a teeming animal. If, however, he is warned against partaking of it because [of the prohibition against partaking of] blood, he is not liable. For we are liable only for the blood of domesticated animals, wild beasts, and fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 1.</i>
All these measures - and the distinctions between them<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">That for some one is liable for an olive-sized portion and for others, for a lentil-sized portion.</i> - are halachot received by Moses at Sinai [and transmitted via the Oral Tradition].
One who partakes of an olive-sized portion of an aquatic teeming animal is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law, as [Leviticus 11:43] states: "Do not make your souls detestable [by partaking] of any teeming animal that swarms... and do not become impure because of them." Included in this prohibition are teeming animals of the land, that fly, and of the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 179) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 164) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. As obvious from the Rambam's words here and as explained in greater length in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, this is not a specific commandment relating to aquatic teeming creatures, but a general commandment relating to all teeming animals. Accordingly, when a person partakes of a teeming animal of the land or a flying teeming animal, he is liable for two transgressions.<br>The Ramban (<i>Hasagot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, General Principle 9) and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> differ with the Rambam and maintain that this is not considered as a separate mitzvah.</i><br>What is meant by a aquatic teeming animal? Both small creatures like worms and leeches that inhabit the water<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 18-19.</i> and larger creatures that are beasts of the sea. To state a general principle: Any aquatic creature that does not have the characteristics of a fish, neither a non-kosher fish or a kosher fish, e.g., a seal, a dolphin, a frog, or the like.

It is not our place to defend these concepts against the findings of science. It must, however, be said that many Rabbinical leaders who are aware of the work of Pasteur and others did not doubt the teachings of the Torah and accepted these laws.</i> but from filth that decays and the like are called "those which creep on the earth." A person who partakes of an olive-sized portion [of these creations] is liable for lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 177) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 165) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Leviticus 11:44] states: "Do not make your souls impure with any teeming animal that creeps on the earth," even thought they do not reproduce. Teeming animals that swarm on the earth, by contrast, are those that reproduce from male-female [relations].
[The following laws apply with regard to] species that come into being from fruits and other foods.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 18-19.</i> Should they depart from [the source from where they came into being] and go to the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording is borrowed from the prooftext cited. Even if these crawling animals do not reach the earth, but merely appear on the surface of the fruit, they become forbidden., as stated in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 178). Note, however, Halachah 16.</i> a person who partakes of an olive-sized portion of them is liable for lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 178) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 163) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Leviticus 11:42] states: "With regard to any teeming animal that swarms on the earth, [do not eat them]." This forbids those that departed to the earth, even though they returned to the food. If, however, they did not depart, it is permitted to eat the fruit together with the worm in it.
When does the above apply? When the food became worm-ridden after it was uprooted from the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Or removed from its tree.</i> If, however, it became worm-ridden while it was connected [to its source of nurture], that worm is forbidden as if it became departed to the earth. For it was created on the earth. One is liable for lashes [for partaking of it]. If there is a doubt, it is forbidden.<br>Therefore all fruits that commonly become worm-ridden<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This is a halachic issue that is given much attention today. We find certain Jewish groups who have taken it upon themselves to grow vegetables without any exposure to insects. There is a heightened consciousness with regard to the need to check and many books and tools have been produced with this purpose in mind. It must be emphasized, however, that although there are no vegetables that are absolutely insect and larvae free, the common halachic approach is not to show concern for any insects and/or larvae that are not visible to the naked eye. Conversely, we assume that all insects we discover came from male-female relationships or came into being while the fruit was connected to its source and do not permit any because they might have come from the fruit itself after it was detached.</i> when connected [to their source of nurture] should not be eaten until one checks the fruit from its inside,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an external search is not sufficient and one must cut the fruit or vegetable open and search from the inside.</i> for perhaps it contains a worm. If the fruit remains twelve months after being severed [from its source], it may be eaten without being inspected. For a worm inside of it will not endure for twelve months.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since a crawling animal will not live for more than twelve months inside produce and the produce has been detached for more than twelve months, it follows that the animal came into being from the produce itself and thus the produce and the animal can be eaten together.<br>Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 84:8) states that the produce should be checked lest there be crawling animals that have left the produce. One of the ways to select grains, legumes, and the like is to soak them first. Any ones with holes will float to the top. They should be discarded, lest they be worm-ridden.</i>
If [the worm] departed to the atmosphere, but did not reach the earth, or only a portion of it reached the earth, it departed after it died, the worm was found on the seed on the inside, or it departed from one food to another, [in] all these [situations, the worm] is forbidden because of the doubt, but lashes are not administered [if one partakes of it].
A worm found in the stomach of a fish, in the brain within the head of an animal, and one found in meat are forbidden. When, however, salted fish becomes worm-ridden, the worms in it are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Provided they have not departed from the fish itself (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains the Rambam's approach as follows: All worms that are found in both meat and fish while the animals are alive are forbidden, for we assume that they entered from the outside. Even after a fish dies, we can assume that the worms in its stomach were swallowed when it was alive. Similarly, those in an animal's brain can be assumed to have entered its nose from the outside and are hence, forbidden. Those found in the body of a fish are considered to have been spontaneously generated are hence permitted. Those found in the meat of an animal are not permitted. The rationale is that anything that comes from an animal is permitted to be eaten only after it has been slaughtered according to law. Even though the animal itself was slaughtered, since that slaughter preceded the existence of the worms, they are not permitted.<br>The Ra'avad and many other <i>Rishonim</i> differ with the Rambam's understanding and permit worms that came into being in meat from animals that were ritually slaughtered, e.g., in meat that was salted to be used at a later time. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 84:16) quotes both views, but appears to favor the more lenient one. The Rama states that it is customary to follow the more lenient view. In practice, in the present age, this problem is far less prevalent, for because of refrigeration and freezing, it is less likely for worms to exist in meat.</i> This is comparable to fruit which has become worm-ridden after it has been separated from the earth. It is permitted to eat them together with the worm that is in them.<br>Similarly, if water<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Or other beverages (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 84:1). This is evident from Halachot 19-20.</i> in a utensil produces teeming animals, those teeming animals are permitted to be drunk together with the water, as [can be inferred from Leviticus 11:9]: "All that possess fins and scales in the water, seas, and rivers, they you may eat." Implied is that you may eat those that possess [fins and scales] in the water, seas, and rivers and those that do not possess them, you may not eat. But those creatures [that come into existences] in utensils are permitted whether they possess [fins and scales] or not.
[Since the water found] in cisterns, trenches and caves is not flowing water, but instead is collected there,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., water that is stored in storage compartments dug into - or naturally found within - the earth.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that irrigation ditches and breeding ponds which water flows through are not included in this category, because - in contrast to water found in containers - the water in them does not stand still. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 84:1) quotes a difference of opinion on this issue.</i> it is comparable to water found in containers. [Hence], aquatic teeming animals that are created [in these places] are permitted. A person may bend down and drink<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Commenting on the citation of this ruling by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 84:2), the Rama states that if one finds worms in a bucket of water drawn from such bodies, the worms are forbidden, because we fear that the worms came from the bucket and not from the water.</i> without holding back even though he swallows these flimsy teeming animals when drinking.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Or other beverages (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 84:1). This is evident from Halachot 19-20.</i>
When does the above apply? When the teeming animals did not depart from the place where they came into being. If they did, even though they later return to the container or the cistern, they are forbidden. If they went out to the walls of the barrel and then fell back into the water or the beer, they are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">For the walls are still considered as "the place where the teeming animals came into existence."</i> Similarly, if they went out to the walls of the cistern and the cave and returned to the water, they are permitted.
When a person strains wine, vinegar, or beer and eats the insects, bugs, and worms that he strains, he is liable for lashes for partaking of an aquatic teeming animal or [for partaking of] a flying teeming animal and an aquatic teeming animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If the insect has the characteristics of both the prohibited species, as stated in Halachah 23.</i> [This applies] even if they returned to the container after they were strained, for they departed from the place where they came into existence. If, however, they did not depart, one may drink without holding back, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 18. I.e., he need not worry that perhaps they became separated (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>
When, in this chapter, we have spoken about partaking of an olive-sized portion, [the intent is that] one ate an olive-sized portion of a large creature or one collected some from one species and some from another similar species<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For the portions of forbidden insects to be combined, they need not be of the same species. They must, however, be included in the same prohibition. See Chapter 4, Halachah 17.</i> until one partakes of an olive sized portion. If, however, one eats an entire forbidden creature by itself, one is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law even if it is smaller than a mustard seed.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle applying in many contexts in the laws of kashrut. The creature must, however, be visible to the naked eye.</i><br>[This applies] whether one partook of it after it died or while it was alive. Even if the creature decayed and lost its form,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, it has decayed to the extent that it is no longer fit for human consumption, one is not liable, as stated in Chapter 14, Halachah 11.</i> one is liable for lashes since one consumed it in its entirety.
When an ant has lost even one of its legs,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For it is no longer considered as a complete creation.</i> one is not liable for lashes for partaking of it unless one eats an olive-sized portion. For this reason,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase refers to the previous halachah.</i> one who eats an entire fly or an entire mosquito whether alive or dead is worthy of lashes for partaking of a flying teeming animal.
[The following laws apply if] a particular creature is [included in the categories of] a flying teeming animal, an aquatic teeming animal, and a teeming animal of the earth, e.g., it has wings, it walks on the earth like other [earthbound] teeming animals, and it reproduces in the water. If one partakes of it, he is liable for three [sets of] lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Makkot</i> 16b: "If one eats a <i>potisa</i>, one is liable for four [sets of] lashes, an ant, five [sets of] lashes." As he explains in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot </i>(negative commandment 179), the intent is not that one is liable for additional sets of lashes because several prohibitions are stated with regard to a particular creature. Instead, the intent is that if one creature falls into several forbidden categories, one is liable for a set of lashes for every forbidden category. See <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>.<br>It must be emphasized that the Ra'avad, Rav Moshe HaCohen, the Ramban, and other <i>Rishonim</i> do not accept the Rambam's interpretation and instead, maintain that the prohibitions mentioned in <i>Makkot, loc. cit.</i>, refer to the repetition of prohibitions concerning a single creature.</i><br>If, in addition to the above, it is one of the species which are brought into being in the earth in fruit, he is liable for a fourth [set of] lashes. If it is one of the species that reproduce,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although this particular creature was spontaneously generated, it was brought into being in a manner that it could reproduce and bear offspring.</i> he is liable for a fifth [set of] lashes. If it also can be considered as a non-kosher fowl in addition to being considered a flying teeming animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam is sensitive to the question that might arise and states: "Do not wonder how it is possible for a fowl to come into being from the decay of fruits, for we have seen this take place frequently." In that source, he also explains that it is possible for a single creature to have the characteristics of a non-kosher fowl and a flying teeming animal.</i> he is liable for six [sets of] lashes: [for partaking of] a non-kosher fowl, a flying teeming animal, a teeming animal of the earth, an aquatic teeming animal, an animal that swarms on the earth, and a worm from fruit.<br>[This applies whether] he partook of the entire creature or he partook of an olive-sized portion of it. Therefore one who eats an ant that flies that breeds in the water is liable for five [sets of] lashes.
When one crushed ants, added another complete ant to those that were crushed so that the entire quantity was equal to an olive-sized portion, and partook of it, he is liable for six [sets of] lashes: five [for partaking of] the one ant<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in the previous halachah.</i> and an additional one, because he partook of an olive-sized portion of dead non-kosher animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is not referring to the prohibition against partaking of an animal that is not ritually slaughtered. For that prohibition applies only with regard to kosher animals, as stated in Chapter 4, Halachah 2. For this reason, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (in his gloss to that halachah) raises questions with the Rambam's statement here. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others attempt to offer resolutions.</i>

Chapter 3

Any food that is produced from forbidden species for which lashes are given for partaking of<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., foods that are forbidden by a negative commandment.</i> is forbidden to be eaten according to Scriptural Law, e.g., milk from a forbidden species of domesticated animal or wild beast or the eggs of a forbidden species of birds or fish. [This is derived from Leviticus 11:16 which mentions]: "the <i>bat</i> of the ostrich." [Our Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 64b. The term literally means "the daughter of the ostrich." Our Sages, however, expanded the interpretation of the term as the Rambam explains.</i> commented:] "This refers to its egg." The same law applies to all species that are forbidden like an ostrich and all entities [that are produce] like eggs.
Human milk is permitted to be eaten,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even by an adult. Note, however, Halachah 4.</i> although the meat of a human is forbidden to be eaten. We have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachah 3.</i> that it is forbidden by virtue of a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it does not contradict the general principle mentioned in the previous halachah.</i>
Honey produced by bees and hornets<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions, there is a difference of opinion among the Sages in<i> Bechorot</i> 7b whether the honey of hornets is forbidden. This difference of opinion is perpetuated among the later authorities. See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 81:9).</i> is permitted. [The rationale is that] it is not a product of their bodies. Instead, it is collected in their mouths from herbs and then expelled in their hive so that they will be able to partake of it in the rainy season.
Although human milk is permitted, our Sages prohibited an adult to nurse from [a woman's] breasts. Instead, the woman should express it into a container<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Or into a person's hands. She may not, however, express it into the person's mouth [the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 81:7)].</i> and the adult should partake of it. An adult who nurses from [a woman's] breast is like one who nurses from a teeming animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 81:9 explains that these words of censure were issued because an observer might think that the milk of a non-kosher animal is also permitted.</i> He is given stripes for rebellious conduct.
An infant may continue to nurse for even four or five years. If, however, he was weaned for three days or more in a state of health and not because of sickness, he should not be allowed to nurse again.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, if there is a danger to the child's life, he may be allowed to nurse again regardless of the amount of time for which he had been weaned [the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 81:7)].</i> [The above applies] provided he was weaned after 24 months. If he was weaned within that time, even if he was weaned for a month or two, it is permitted to have him nurse again until the conclusion of 24 months.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When an infant has never been weaned, he may continue past the 24 month limit as the Rambam states at the beginning of the halachah. If, however, he has been weaned, he is bound by this restriction [<i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 81)].</i>
Although the milk of a non-kosher animal and the egg of a non-kosher fowl are forbidden according to Scriptural Law, [one is] not [liable for] lashes [for partaking of them. [This is derived from Leviticus 11:8] which states: "You may not eat from their flesh." [Implied is that] one is liable for lashes for [partaking of] their flesh, but is not liable for lashes for [partaking of] their eggs and milk. One who partakes [of these substances] is like one who eats half the minimum measure [of a forbidden substance]. This is forbidden according to Scriptural Law, but one is not liable for lashes. Instead, he receives stripes for rebellious conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 16, <i>Hilchot Shivitat Esor</i> 2:3, <i>et al</i>.</i>
It appears to me that eating the eggs of non-kosher species of fish that are found in their bellies is comparable to eating the insides of the forbidden fish themselves<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For they are part of the fish's body and are not separated by a shell.</i> and one is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law. Similarly, when a person partakes of the eggs of a non-kosher fowl that are hanging in a cluster without being separated from the mother's body or completed, he is liable for lashes as if he ate the insides of [the fowl itself].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For this instance as well, the eggs are not a distinct entity, but instead are considered part of the fowl's body. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> brings proof of this concept from Chapter 9, Halachot 4-5, which states that it is forbidden to eat such eggs together with milk and from <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i> 3:10 which states that they convey ritual impurity like the meat of the fowl itself.</i>
When one partakes of the egg of a non-kosher fowl inside of which an embryo has begun to take form, he is liable for eating a flying teeming animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The embryo is not considered as a non-kosher fowl. Nevertheless, it is already a distinct entity. Hence it is considered as a non-kosher teeming animal. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions that there are other <i>Rishonim</i> who do not accept the Rambam's position.<br>The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 15:1 explains that while the embryo is within the egg, it has the characteristics of a teeming animal.</i> If, however, one partakes of the egg of a kosher fowl inside of which an embryo has begun to take form, he is liable for stripes for rebellious conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Chullin</i> 64a, it appears that there is only a Rabbinic prohibition against partaking of this embryo.

The milk of a non-kosher animal will not congeal and solidify as the milk of a kosher animal does. If the milk of a non-kosher animal is mixed together with the milk of a kosher animal, when the mixture is [set aside for cheese to be made], the kosher milk will solidify and the non-kosher milk will be expelled together with the whey of the cheese.
Accordingly, logic would dictate that any milk found in the possession of a gentile is forbidden, lest the gentile have mixed the milk of a non-kosher animal with it. And the cheese of the gentiles should be permitted, for the milk of a non-kosher animal will not form cheese. Nevertheless, during the age of the Sages of the Mishnah, they issued a decree against gentile cheese and forbade it, lest they use the skin of the stomach of an animal they slaughtered - which is forbidden as a<i> nevelah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This term refers to an animal from a kosher species which died without being ritually slaughtered.</i> - to cause it to solidify.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For milk to solidify as cheese, it needs a catalyst, rennin, to cause it to curdle. One of the most common sources of rennin was the digestive organs of an animal. For the enzymes that facilitate the digestion of food also produce such an effect. Using the skin of a non-kosher organ causes the cheese to be non-kosher for the reasons the Rambam proceeds to explain. See also Chapter 4, Halachah 19, and Chapter 9, Halachah 15.<br>As the Ra'avad and <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mention, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 35a gives several additional reasons for these prohibitions. The Rambam, however, does not mention them because the factors causing the prohibition could be nullified as explained in the following note. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions that there are opinions that maintain that the motivating factor behind the prohibition against non-Jewish cheese is to prevent social interaction between Jews and non-Jews. Hence the prohibitions are never nullified even if there is a substantially larger quantity of the kosher substance.</i><br>If one would say: The stomach skin is a very small entity when compared to the milk that it is used to solidify. Why is it not nullified because of its insignificant size?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained, according to Scriptural Law, when a forbidden substance is mixed together with a kosher substance, it is nullified - i.e, considered as if it has become part of the permitted substance - if the quantity of the permitted substance is greater than it. According to Rabbinic Law, this is true when the quantity of the permitted substance is so great that the taste of the forbidden substance would not be detected. That would certainly be true in the instance at hand. Nevertheless, the forbidden substance is not nullified for the reason explained by the Rambam.</i> Because it is used as the catalyst to cause the cheese to curdle. Since the catalyst which causes it to curdle is forbidden, everything is forbidden, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 9, Halachah 16; Chapter 16, Halachah 26.</i>
[The following laws apply when] cheese is left to solidify with herbs or fruit juice, e.g., fig syrup, and it is apparent [that these substances were used for] the cheese. There are some of the <i>Geonim</i> who have ruled that it is forbidden, for [our Sages] already decreed that all the cheeses of gentiles are forbidden, whether they caused them to solidify with a forbidden entity or with a permitted entity.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This is also the Rambam's view. It is quoted by the the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 115:2. The Rama states that it is customary to follow this view. The Rama continues, stating that when a Jew observes a gentile milking the cows and making the cheese, it is permitted to partake of it even though the cheese belongs to the gentiles. He continues, stating that even if the Jew does not observe the gentile milking the cow, as long as he observes him making the cheese, the cheese is acceptable after the fact. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 115:11 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 115:22 quote opinions that differ and maintain that the prohibition should be observed even if a Jew did not observe the milking.<br>This difference of opinion is relevant today, reflecting the difference between <i>chalav Yisrael</i> cheese and ordinary kosher cheese. In both instances, the cheesemaking process is supervised. <i>Chalav Yisrael</i> cheese uses milk that was supervised when milked, while ordinary kosher cheese does not.</i> This is a decree, [instituted] because they cause them to solidify using forbidden entities.
When a person partakes of cheese from gentiles or milk that was milked by a gentile without a Jew observing him, he is given stripes for rebellious conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For his behavior is in violation of an explicit Rabbinic prohibition. Even though the rationale for the original decree is no longer applicable, the prohibition established by our Rabbis is still in force. (See <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 2:2.)<br>In the present era, there are certain Rabbis (see Rav Moshe Feinstein, <i>Igros Moshe</i>) who give a rationale for leniency with regard to this prohibition, stating that government supervision makes it impossible for gentiles to mix non-kosher milk together with cow's milk and thus there is no necessity to heed that prohibition. It must be emphasized, however, that this responsum was authored before the time when it became relative easy to procure <i>chalav Yisrael</i> and that many other Rabbinical authorities never accepted this decision. On the contrary, basing themselves on the ruling of <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 2:2, they explain that the original decree must still be observed. As a result of their forceful stance, at present, it is possible to obtain <i>chalav Yisrael</i> products in almost every major Jewish community.</i> With regard to butter produced by gentiles, some of the <i>Geonim</i> permit it, for [our Sages] did not decree against butter and some of the <i>Geonim</i> forbid it,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 115:3) states that one should not rebuke those who permit the use of such butter, but if the local custom is to forbid it, that custom should be respected.

Nevertheless, most of the authorities who forbid using non-Jewish butter maintain that, in practice, one should refrain from cooking it as well.</i> For if one will say that [drops of non-kosher milk] were mixed with the butter and it was all cooked together, they became insignificant because of the small quantity [involved].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the amount of non-kosher milk is surely insignificant in relation to the quantity of the mixture as a whole.

When a Jew sits near a herd belonging to a gentile and the gentile brings him milk from the herd, it is permitted [for him to partake of it] even though there are non-kosher animals in the herd.

As long as he is present and could see what the gentile is doing, the gentile will refrain from mixing in a non-kosher substance.<br>The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 115:1) states that this ruling applies only after the fact. At the outset, the Jew must observe the milking and also check the container into which the gentile is milking.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> clarifies that this ruling applies only when the gentile is milking the animal for the Jew and knows that the Jew will not drink the milk of the non-kosher animal.

When both of the ends of an egg are rounded, both are pointed, or the yolk is on the outside and the white is on the inside, it is certainly from a non-kosher species.

If he tells him that they are from such-and-such a fowl and that this fowl is kosher, he may rely on him.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">We are certain that he will not lie, because it is possible to bring other eggs from that species and see that they are not alike (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 86:1; <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 86:3).</i> If, however, he tells him that they are from a kosher fowl, but does not mention its name, he may not rely on him.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For the method of verification mentioned in the previous note does not apply.<br>The Ra'avad rules that if the hunter has an established reputation for observance, we may rely on his word, even though he does not name the species of the fowl.

According to this understanding, the hunter we are speaking about is not known for his observance. Nevertheless, we rely on his statements.<br>In his notes to Halachah 20, the Rashba emphasizes that we are not speaking about a person who is known to sell non-kosher food as kosher. As evident from <i>Hilchot Maaserot</i> 12:16, such a person is considered as a gentile and his word is not accepted at all. Instead, the intent is someone whose reputation for observance has not been established, but is also not suspect to cause others to transgress.</i>
For this reason, we do not purchase eggs from gentiles unless one recognizes the eggs and can identify them as being from a particular kosher species of fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quotes the Ramban who differs with the Rambam and maintains that there is no difference between a Jew whose reputation for observance is not established and a gentile. Just like we accept the Jew's word, we accept that of the gentile. For we assume that he will not risk his reputation by making false statements. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 86:1) quotes the Rambam's ruling, while the <i>Tur</i> and the Rama cite that of the Ramban.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also quotes Rashba who states that in the present age, we purchase eggs from gentiles without compunction, because non-kosher species are uncommon and the overwhelming proportion of eggs sold are from chickens or geese. This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 86:2).</i> We do not suspect that they came from a fowl that was <i>trefe</i> or <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., that died without being ritually slaughtered; see Chapter 4, Halachah 1.

The distinguishing signs of fish eggs are the same as those for fowl. When both of the ends of an egg are rounded or both are pointed, it is non-kosher. If one end is pointed and the other rounded, he should inquire of the Jew who sells them.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">For the distinguishing signs themselves are not sufficient for the eggs to be considered kosher. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that although <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 40a would appear to indicate that the distinguishing signs are sufficient, since <i>Chullin</i> 64a compares fish eggs to fowl eggs, we assume that all the laws that apply to one apply to the other.<br>In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 83:8), Rav Yosef Caro quotes the Rambam's ruling, but states that at present, it has become customary to buy any red fish eggs, even from gentiles. Black fish eggs, however, may not be purchased. In his <i>Beit Yosef</i> 81:12, he explains that the Rabbinic authorities of the earlier ages researched the matter and discovered that there are no common non-kosher fish that lay red eggs. See <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 83:27 who quotes other sources from which it is not clear whether or not this ruling was accepted in all communities.</i> If he tells him that he salted them<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to preserve them, for it is common to bring fish eggs from distant places.</i> and removed them from a kosher species,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Naming the species as in Halachah 18.</i> he may partake of them on the basis of his statements. If he tells him that they are kosher, he may not rely on him unless he is a person who has an established reputation for observance.
Similarly, we may not purchase cheese and pieces of fish that do not have distinguishing signs except from a Jew who has an established reputation for observance. In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, at the time it was populated primarily by [observant] Jews,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by Chapter 11, Halachah 25, today, the same principles that apply in the Diaspora apply in Eretz Yisrael.</i> one could purchase these items from any Jew located there. And it is permitted to purchase milk from any Jew, anywhere.
When a person pickles non-kosher fish, the brine produced is forbidden. The brine produced by non-kosher locusts, by contrast, is permitted, because they do not possess any moisture.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 10:9), he states that they possess very little moisture. The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling and forbids brine from non-kosher locusts.</i> Accordingly, we do not purchase brine from gentiles unless there is a kosher fish floating in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">For then we assume that the brine came from this species of fish.</i> Even one fish is sufficient.
When a gentile brings a trough filled with open barrels of brine and there is a kosher fish in one of them, they are all permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For we consider all the open barrels as a single entity and the one fish indicates that the entire quantity is acceptable.

The rulings of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 83:6) quotes the Rambam's ruling, but also those of others who interpret that passage differently.</i> If they are closed, one opens one and finds a kosher fish and one opens a second and finds a kosher fish, they are all permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The intent is not that all the barrels are considered as a single entity, but that since two barrels are discovered to be kosher, we assume that the others are also kosher (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> [This applies] provided the head of the fish and its backbone are present so that it is recognizable that they are from a kosher species of fish.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., by looking at the head and the backbone, the person is able to recognize that the fish comes from a kosher species.

Chapter 4

A person who partakes of an olive-sized portion of a domesticated animal, wild beast, or fowl which dies is liable for lashes, as [Deuteronomy 14:21] states: "Do not partake of any <i>nevelah</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 180) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 472) include this among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> All animals that were not slaughtered in the appropriate manner are considered as if they died. In the Laws of<i> Shechitah</i>, we will explain which types of slaughter are appropriate and which are not.
Only animals from kosher species are forbidden as a <i>nevelah</i>, for they are the species that are fit to be ritually slaughtered and if they are slaughtered in a kosher manner, it is permitted to partake of them. [When,] by contrast, one partakes of [meat from] a non-kosher species, [since] ritual slaughter is of no consequence with regard to them, whether they are slaughtered in a kosher manner, whether they died in a natural manner, or whether one cut meat from a living animal and ate it, one does not receive lashes for partaking of a <i>nevelah</i> or partaking of <i>trefe</i> meat,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 10.</i> only because one ate the meat of a non-kosher animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Chullin</i> 100b, it would appear that the rationale for this ruling is the general principle: "One prohibition does not fall upon another prohibition." Since the meat is already prohibited because it is from a non-kosher species, the prohibition of <i>nevela</i> does not apply to it. The Rambam's wording, however, is slightly different and may be alluding to a slightly different rationale.</i>
When a person eats an [entire] kosher fowl<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Which was not correctly slaughtered.</i> of any size, he is liable for lashes for partaking of a <i>nevelah</i>, even though he ate less than an olive-sized portion. [The rationale is that] he consumed it in its entirety.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This reflects a general concept with regard to the laws of kashrut. As stated in Chapter 2, Law 21, whenever "one eats an entire forbidden creature by itself, one is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law even if it is smaller than a mustard seed."<br>The commentaries (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, Rav Moshe HaCohen) question why the Rambam states that the person is liable for eating a <i>nevelah</i>. Seemingly, the prohibition he transgresses is eating a limb from a living animal (see Chapter 5). The <i>Meiri</i> explains the Rambam's position, stating that an entire creature cannot be considered as "a limb."</i> If he ate it after it died, it must be the size of an olive [for him to be liable].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For the conception of being liable for an entire creature even though it is not the size of an olive, applies only when that creature is inherently forbidden (<i>Meiri</i>). While alive, the bird is considered as an entire forbidden entity, like a non-kosher species. After its death, that distinction does not apply.</i> Even though it does not have an olive-sized portion of meat on it, since as a whole, it is the size of an olive, he is liable for [partaking of] a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For we include the bones and the sinews as well (<i>Chullin</i> 102b).</i>
When a person partakes of an olive-sized portion of a stillborn fetus<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The same laws apply if the fetus is born alive, but it is obvious that the birth is not viable. Even if the animal is slaughtered in the appropriate manner, we are forbidden to partake of it.</i> of a kosher animal, he is liable for lashes for partaking of a <i>nevelah</i>.<br>It is forbidden to partake of a newborn animal until the night of the eighth day [of its life].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if the animal is slaughtered properly, it is forbidden because it is possible that the birth is not viable. Although our Sages (<i>Chulin</i> 136a) spoke of the eighth day of an animal's life, their intent was the beginning of the eighth day (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> For whenever an animal has not lived for eight days, we consider it as stillborn, but lashes are not administered [for partaking] of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is not a definite matter, lashes are not administered (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> [Moreover,] if it is known that the animal was born after a full term period of gestation, i.e., nine months for a large domesticated animal and five months for a small domesticated animal, it is permitted on the day that it was born.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, an animal may not be offered as a sacrifice until the eighth day of its life (Exodus 22:29; <i>Turei Zahav</i> 15:3).</i>
The placenta that is expelled together with the newborn is forbidden to be eaten. A person who eats it, however, is not liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is not considered to have partaken of a <i>nevelah</i>.</i> because it is not [considered] meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in Halachah 18, these are not considered meat, but rather comparable to an animal's wastes. For that reason, the Ra'avad (in his gloss to Chapter 5, Halachah 13) states that there is no prohibition against partaking of a placenta.</i>
When a person eats an olive-sized portion of a kosher<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., like the prohibition of <i>nevelah</i>, the prohibition of <i>trefe</i> does not apply with regard to non-kosher species.</i> domesticated animal, wild beast, or fowl that was mortally wounded is liable for lashes, as [Exodus 22:30] states: "Do not eat meat [from an animal that was] mortally wounded (<i>trefe</i>) in the field. Cast it to the dogs."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if it was slaughtered properly before it died, the meat is, nevertheless, forbidden, as stated in the following halachah. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 181) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 73) include this among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i><br>The term <i>trefe</i> employed by the Torah refers to [an animal] mortally wounded by a wild beast, e.g., a lion, a tiger, or the like, or a fowl mortally wounded by a bird of prey, e.g., a hawk or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam proceeds to explain in Halachah 8, the term <i>trefe</i> also applies in other situations. Nevertheless, there is an added dimension of severity to the laws applying to animals that are mortally wounded by beasts, as stated in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 5:3 (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> We cannot say that the term <i>trefe</i> refers to an animal that was attacked and killed, for if it died, it is a <i>nevelah</i>. What difference does it make if it died naturally, was struck by a sword or died, or was battered by a lion and died? Thus [the term <i>trefe</i>] must refer to an instance when it was mortally wounded, but did not die.
If an animal that is mortally wounded is forbidden, shall we say that if a wolf or a lion comes and drags a kid by its foot, its tail, or its ear, and a man pursues [the beast] and saves [the kid], it will be forbidden, because it was attacked?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>trefe</i> literally means "preyed upon." Our translation "mortally wounded" is the halachic definition as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> The Torah states: "Do not eat meat [from an animal that was] mortally wounded (<i>trefe</i>) in the field. Cast it to the dogs." [An animal is not considered <i>trefe</i>] unless it was brought to a state that its meat is fit [only] for the dogs. Thus we have learned that the term <i>trefe</i> employed by the Torah refers to [an animal] that was attacked by a wild beast and battered by it that has not died yet. Even if the person hurries and slaughters it before it dies, it is forbidden as<i> trefe</i>. For it is impossible that it will live after suffering such wounds.
Thus we have learned that the Torah forbade [an animal] that died, a<i> nevelah</i>, and it forbade one that was on the verge of death because of its wounds even though it has not died yet, i.e., a <i>trefe</i>.<br>Now we do not make a distinction with regard to an animal that has died regardless of whether it died naturally, it fell and died, it was strangled until it died, or it was attacked by a wild beast who killed it. Similarly, we do not make a distinction between an animal that is on the verge of death, regardless of whether it was attacked by an animal and battered, fell from the roof and broke the majority of its ribs,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following examples are specifically mentioned by the Rambam in <i>Hilchot Shechitah </i> 10:1, 9:8, 11:4, 6:1.</i> fell and crushed its limbs, it was shot with an arrow and its heart or lung pierced, it developed an illness that caused its heart or lung to be perforated, one broke the majority of its ribs, or the like. Since it is on the verge of death regardless of the cause, it is a <i>trefe</i>. [This applies] whether [its wound] was caused by flesh and blood or by God's hand.<br>If so, why does the Torah use the term <i>trefe</i>? For Scripture speaks with regard to prevalent situations.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle employed by our Sages with regard to the interpretation of the Torah's language. When it mentions a specific situation, it is not confining itself to the limited setting mentioned in the verse, but applies to other circumstances as well. Why is that situation mentioned? Because it is common.</i> [We are forced] to say this. If not, only an animal that was mortally wounded in the field would be forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For only that is in the direct scope of the verse.</i> One that is mortally wounded in a courtyard would not be forbidden. Thus we learn that Scripture [is employing this example,] only because it speaks with regard to prevalent situations.
The intent of the verse is that [an animal] that is mortally wounded and will not live<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Longer than twelve months (<i>Hilchot Shechitah </i> 11:1).</i> because of these wounds is forbidden. On this basis, our Sages said:<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 42a.</i> "This is the general principle: Whenever [an animal] in this condition will not live, it is <i>trefe</i>." In <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">From Chapter Five to Chapter Eleven. A concise list is found in Chapter 10, Halachah 9.</i> we will explain which conditions cause an animal to be deemed <i>trefe</i> and which do not cause it to be deemed <i>trefe</i>.
Similarly, when one cuts meat from a living kosher<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For as mentioned above, the prohibition against partaking of a <i>trefe</i> applies only with regard to kosher animals.</i> animal, one receives lashes for partaking of a <i>trefe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter Five, Halachot 2-3, where the Rambam distinguishes between this prohibition and the prohibition against partaking of a limb from a living animal. Note, however, <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:10-11 where the Rambam includes eating the meat from an animal and eating a limb from an animal as a single prohibition for a gentile.</i> For this meat comes from an animal that has not been ritually slaughtered and has not died. [Hence it is comparable to a <i>trefe</i>.] What difference does it make to me if it was attacked by an animal or cut by a knife? And what difference does it make if [the animal] was [wounded] in its totality or only a portion of it was wounded?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., just as we forbid the meat of an animal that was mortally wounded, we should forbid a portion of meat that was cut off with a knife.</i> For the verse states: "Do not eat meat [from an animal that was] <i>trefe</i> in the field." Since [a portion of] the animal was made meat in the field,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the meat was cut off from its natural place. See also Chapter 5, Halachah 9.</i> it is <i>trefe</i>.
When an animal is sick because it is weakened and is on the verge of death, it is permitted, because it did not suffer a wound in any one of the limbs and organs that will cause it to die. For the Torah forbade only those situations resembling an animal mortally wounded by a preying wild beast. In that situation, the animal wounded it with a blow that caused it to die.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">With this explanation, the Rambam is clarifying the distinction <i>Chulin</i> 37a makes between an animal which is <i>misukenet</i> (dangerously ill) and <i>trefe</i>. The <i>trefe</i> condition is a result of wound, while in the case of a <i>misukenet</i>, all of its limbs and organs are sound. Nevertheless, as stated in <i>Hilchot Trefot</i> 5:2, there are other physical conditions which render an animal <i>trefe</i> even if it has not been attacked by an animal. These conditions were communicated as halachot to Moses at Sinai.</i>
Although it is permitted, the great sages would not partake [of the meat] of an animal which people were hurrying to slaughter before it died.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (based on <i>Chullin</i> 37b) interprets this as a gesture of pious conduct. Note, however, <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 17:8.</i> [This applies] even if it makes convulsive movements after being slaughtered.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Such a convulsive movement is a sign that it was alive at the time that it was slaughtered, as the Rambam continues to explain in the following halachah.</i> This is a matter that does not involve a prohibition. Nevertheless, whoever desires to accept this stringency upon himself is praiseworthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quotes opinions that maintain that this leniency was granted only to alleviate the financial loss a Jewish owner of an animal would suffer. Therefore, meat from an animal belonging to a gentile which is in such a condition should not be eaten. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 116:7) quotes this ruling.</i>
When a person slaughters a domesticated animal, wild beast, or fowl and blood does not flow out from them, they are permitted. We do not say: perhaps they were dead already. Similarly, when one slaughters a healthy animal and it does not make convulsive movements, it is permitted.<br>Different [rules apply with regard to an animal that] is dangerously ill, i.e., one which cannot maintain itself when others cause it to stand it up.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It must be able to stand up on its own when called or hit with a switch. If it is stood up by hand, it is still considered dangerously ill even if it is able to remain standing [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 17:1); <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 17:1].</i> [It is placed in this category] even if it eats the food of healthy animals. If [such an animal] is slaughtered and does not make any convulsive movements at all, it is a <i>nevelah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we assume that it died before the slaughter was completed (see <i>Chulin</i> 38a).</i> and one is liable for lashes [for partaking] of it. If it makes convulsive movements, it is permitted.<br>The convulsive movements must be made at the end of the slaughter. If they are made at the beginning, they are of no consequence.
What is meant by convulsive movements? For a small domesticated animal and for both a small and a large wild beast, the intent is that it extended its foreleg and returned it, extended its hind leg even though it did not return it, or merely bent its hind leg.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 17:4 quote opinions that rule that if a small domesticated animal's foreleg was extended and it bent it, that is sufficient to render it acceptable.</i> This is considered a convulsive movement and [the animal] is permitted. If, however, it merely extended its foreleg and did not return it, it is forbidden. [This movement is] merely a result of the expiration of the soul.<br>With regard to a large domesticated animal, [more lenient laws apply]. If it either extended its foreleg or its hind leg without bending it or bent its foreleg or hind leg without extending it, it is considered as a convulsive movement and it is permitted. If, however, it neither extended or bent its foreleg or its hind leg at all, it is considered as a <i>nevelah</i>.<br>With regard to a fowl, even if it only blinked its eyelid<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 17:5 which quotes different versions of <i>Chullin</i> 38b that state that a fowl must move its wing.

When one slaughters an animal that is dangerously ill at night and does not know<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because he cannot see. Needless to say, if the room is illuminated, this law does not apply.</i> whether or not it made convulsive movements, it is forbidden, because of the possibility that it is a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we follow the principle that when a doubt concerning a Scriptural prohibition is involved, we rule stringently.</i>
None of the substances prohibited by the Torah can be combined with each other [to reach the minimum measure for which one is liable for lashes] with the exception of the prohibitions that apply to a nazarite, as explained in that source.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Nazirut</i> 5:3, although there are separate prohibitions against eating raisins, grape peels, grape seeds, and partaking of wine, if one combined all these substances together, one is liable.</i> Therefore when a person takes a small amount of fat, a small amount of blood, a small amount of the meat of a non-kosher animal, a small amount of the meat of a<i> nevelah</i>, a small amount of the meat of a non-kosher fish, a small amount of the meat of a non-kosher fowl, or the like from other prohibited substances, although he collects an olive-sized portion from the entire mixture and partakes of it, he is not liable for lashes. He is bound by the laws that apply when one eats half the minimum measure [of a forbidden] substance.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the prohibition is Scriptural in origin, but lashes are not given (Chapter 3, Halachah 6).<br>The Rambam's statements in this and the following halachah touch on an issue of general significance. Rabbi Meir (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 66a) maintains that forbidden substances of different types can be combined together to make a person liable for lashes. The Sages differ and maintain that they cannot be combined, but instead are judged individually. If there is enough of the one substance to make one liable, he is liable. If not, he is exempt.<br>The principle stated in Halachot 18-19 is a correlory to these concepts. Since the forbidden substances are not combined with each other, but are instead considered as discrete entities, they help nullify each other, as explained there.</i>
All [types of] <i>nevelot</i> may be combined together. A<i> nevelah</i> may be combined with a <i>trefe</i>. All the non-kosher animals and wild beasts may be combined with each other. But the meat of a <i>nevelah</i> and the meat of a non-kosher animal may not be combined.<br>What is implied? When one takes [some meat] from a <i>nevelah</i> of an ox, some from the <i>nevelah</i> of a deer, some from the <i>nevelah</i> of a chicken and combined it so that he has an olive-sized portion of meat, he is liable for lashes if he eats it. Similarly, if he collected half of an olive-sized portion from the <i>nevelah</i> of a kosher animal and half of an olive-sized portion from a<i> trefe</i>, or half of an olive-sized portion from the meat of a <i>nevelah</i> and half from meat taken from a living kosher animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For this is included in the prohibition against a <i>trefe</i>, as stated in Halachah 10.</i> he is liable if he eats it. Similarly, if he collects an olive-sized portion [by combining] the meat of a camel, a pig, and a hare,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Although each one of these species is mentioned separately in the Torah, they are all included in the same prohibition.</i> he is liable if he eats it.<br>If, by contrast, he takes half of an olive-sized portion of a <i>nevelah</i> of an ox and half an olive-sized portion of a camel [an eats it], they are not combined.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad mentions that this point is the subject of a difference of opinion among the Sages of the Talmud, seemingly implying that the opinion which maintains that they should be combined should be followed. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's position.</i> Similar principles apply in all analogous situations. Similarly, the meat of a non-kosher animal, fowl, or fish are not combined for they involve different prohibitions. For each one is forbidden by a separate negative commandment, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2.</i> Nevertheless, all the forbidden species of fowl can be combined as may all the forbidden species of domesticated animals and wild beasts.<br>This is the general principle: Whenever substances are included in the same prohibition, they may be combined. [If they are included] in two [separate] prohibitions, they are not combined. The [only] exceptions are a <i>nevelah</i> and a <i>trefe</i>. [The rationale is that] a <i>trefe</i> is the beginning of [an animal] becoming a <i>nevelah</i>.
When a person eats the skin, the bones, the sinews,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 9:1) which interprets the Hebrew term <i>giddim</i> as also referring to veins, arteries, and nerves.</i> the horns, or the hoofs<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if the portions eaten were soft and blood spurts from them.</i> of a <i>nevelah</i>, a <i>trefe</i>, or a non-kosher domesticated animal or wild beast, from the nails of a non-kosher fowl in the places where blood would spurt through when they are cut off, or from their placenta,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 5.</i> although this is forbidden, he is not liable. [The rationale is that] they are not fit to be eaten. They cannot be combined with meat [in the measure of] an olive-sized portion.
[Milk found in] the stomach of a <i>nevelah</i> and the stomach of a non-kosher animal<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam does not distinguish between milk that has coagulated and milk that is fluid. For even if it is fluid, it is already considered as a waste product. (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> is permitted, for it is like other waste products of the body. Therefore, it is permitted to use [milk found in] the stomach of an animal slaughtered by a gentile or the stomach of a non-kosher domesticated animal or wild beast to cause cheese to solidify.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the digestive juices from the animal's stomach have already mixed with this milk, it will be an effective catalyst to cause the large quantity of milk to curdle and harden into cheese. See also Chapter 3, Halachah 13, and Chapter 9, Halachah 15.<br>The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 81:6) differs and quotes Rabbenu Tam's opinion states that liquid milk found in the stomach of a forbidden species is forbidden. Moreover, at the outset, one should not use even dried milk found in the stomach of a non-kosher animal as a catalyst because of the impression it will create. After the fact, it is permitted.</i> The skin of the stomach, by contrast, is like the other digestive organs and is forbidden.
The placenta of a donkey<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the glosses of Rashi and <i>Tosafot, Bechoros</i> 7b. The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling and maintains that this placenta is forbidden.

There is skin which is considered like meat and one who partakes of an olive-sized portion is considered like one who eats an olive-sized portion of meat, provided one partakes of it when it is soft.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">And not processed so that it becomes hard like leather.</i>
The following [types of] skins are considered like meat: the skin of a human, the skin of a domesticated pig,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">That of a wild boar, by contrast, is too tough to be eaten.</i> the skin of a camel's hump upon which a burden has never been loaded, [because] it has not reached the age [to serve as a beast] of burden, for then it is still soft, the skin of genital area, the skin that is below the tail, the skin of a fetus, the skin of the hedgehog, the chameleon, the lizard, the snail.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes to Chapter 2, Halachah 7, the names of these species are a matter of debate.</i> When all of these skins are soft, they are considered like meat with regard to all matters, whether with regard to [liability<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This addition is necessary, for there is a prohibition against partaking of any skin, as stated in Halachah 18.</i> for] the prohibition against partaking of them or with regard to the laws of ritual purity.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">For an olive-sized portion of the meat of a <i>nevelah</i> can convey ritual impurity, while a hide or a piece of leather that size does not.</i>

See <i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i>, ch. 10, which explains the pertinent laws.</i> [Exodus 21:28] states: "Its meat shall not be eaten." Now, how could one think that it would be eaten after it was stoned to death, for it is a <i>nevelah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For it died without ritual slaughter.</i> Instead, the Torah is coming to teach you that once it has been sentenced to execution by stoning, it becomes forbidden; it becomes like a non-kosher animal. [Even] if one hurried and slaughtered it in an acceptable manner [before it was executed], it is forbidden to benefit from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 188) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 52) include this among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>Instead, the corpse of the executed animal should be buried (<i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 19:11).</i> If one eats an olive-sized portion of its meat, he is liable for lashes. And when it is executed by stoning, its [meat] should not be sold or given to the dogs or to a gentile, [as implied by the phrase]: "shall not be eaten."<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 8, Halachah 15, unless there is a teaching that states otherwise, this phrase implies both a prohibition against eating and a prohibition against deriving benefit.</i> It is permitted [to benefit from] the dung of an ox condemned to be stoned.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 5:2, the rationale is that the dung is considered of negligible importance with regard to the ox itself. As implied by Halachah 20, the dung of an animal is not considered as part of the animal itself, nor is it included in the prohibitions applying to it.</i><br>If it is discovered that [a condemned ox] is not liable to be stoned after it was sentenced, e.g., the witnesses who testified against it were disqualified, it may be sent out to pasture with the herd. If this was discovered after it was executed, it is permitted to benefit from [its meat].

Chapter 5

According to the Oral Tradition, we learnt<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 102b.</i> that [the intent of] the Torah's statement "Do not partake of the soul together with the meat" [is to] forbid a limb cut off from a living animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 182) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 452) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> With regard to a limb cut off from a living animal, it was said to Noah [Genesis 9:4]: "But flesh, together with its soul, its blood, you may not eat."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This prohibition is also one of the seven universal laws commanded to Noah and his descendants (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 8:10).</i><br>The prohibition against [partaking of] a limb from a living animal applies to kosher domesticated animals, wild beasts, and fowl, but not to non-kosher species.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since the species is forbidden, no additional prohibitions apply.</i>
The term <i>ever</i> [translated as "limb"] applies both to a limb that has flesh, sinews, and bones, e.g., a hand or a foot, and to an organ that does not have a bone, e.g., the tongue, the testicles, the spleen, the kidneys, the heart, and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Merkevat HaMishneh</i> notes that this represents a difference between this prohibition and the prohibition against ritual impurity stemming from a limb where the limb must possess a bone. He explains that there a bone is necessary, for the source of the impurity is that of a corpse, and a corpse possesses bones.</i> [There is, however, one difference.] When an organ does not possess a bone, the prohibition [against partaking of] a limb from a living animal applies whether one cut off the entire organ or only part of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and does not accept this distinction. He maintains that partaking of part of an organ is also included in the prohibition against partaking of a <i>trefe</i>.</i> When, by contrast, a limb possesses a bone, a person is not liable [for violating the prohibition against] a limb from a living animal unless he separates it in its complete state, with its flesh, sinews, and bones. If, however, he only removes flesh from the living animal, he is liable for [the prohibition against partaking of] a <i>trefe</i> [animal] as explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 4, Halachah 10.</i> and not because of a limb from a living animal.
One is liable for lashes only for partaking of an olive-sized portion of a limb from a living animal. Even if one eats an entire limb or organ, if it is the size of an olive, one is liable;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">We do not consider an organ or limb as a distinct creature and hold him liable, as he is liable for partaking of an ant, even if it is smaller than an olive. <i>Chulin</i> 102a explains that we require an olive-sized portion for the verse that states the prohibition speaks of "partak[ing] of the soul." The term partaking is appropriate only when one eats an olive-sized portion.</i> if not he is exempt.<br>If one cut off a olive-sized portion of flesh, sinews, and bones from the limb according to its natural form and ate it, one is liable, even if it possessed only the smallest amount of meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since one did not alter its natural form, one is liable for the bones and sinews as well.</i> If, however, one separated a limb which he tore off from a living animal and detached the flesh from the sinews and the meat, he is not liable for lashes unless he eats an olive-sized portion of the meat alone. The bones and the sinews are not included in the olive-sized portion since he changed [the limb's] natural form.
When one divides this organ and eats it bit by bit, he is liable if there is an olive-sized portion of meat in what he ate.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he did not detach the meat from the sinews and the bones, since he cut the limb and distorted its natural form, we consider only the meat and not the other elements of the limb.</i> If not, he is exempt. If he took an olive-sized portion of a limb with flesh, sinews, and bones according to its natural form and ate it, he is liable, even though it became divided inside his mouth before he swallows it.
When a person rips a limb from a living animal and causes it to become <i>trefe</i> when doing so, he is doubly liable for partaking of it: once for [partaking of] a limb from a living animal and once for [partaking of] a<i> trefe</i>. Both of these prohibitions take effect at the same time.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This explains why the person is liable for the prohibition against partaking of a <i>trefe</i>, for seemingly, we should follow the principle "a prohibition does not fall on a substance which is already forbidden." This principle does not apply in this instance, for here, both prohibitions take effect at the same time. Hence, one does not take precedence over the other and the transgressor is liable for both. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 17:8-10; Chapter 14, Halachah 18, for explanation regarding these principles.)</i> Similarly, if one rips fat from a living animal and partakes of it, he is doubly liable: for [partaking of] a limb from a living animal and for [partaking of] fat.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">He is liable for both prohibitions, because the prohibition against partaking of a limb from a living animal is of a wider scope (<i>issur mosif</i>; i.e., it is forbidden to gentiles as well as Jews) than the prohibition against partaking of forbidden fat (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).<br><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> asks why a limb taken from a forbidden species is not forbidden. Here also, the prohibition against taking a limb from a living animal is of a wider scope than that against partaking of a forbidden species.</i> If he rips fat from a<i> trefe</i> [animal], he is liable for [the violation of] three [negative commandments].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The two mentioned in the previous clause and the prohibition against partaking of a <i>trefe</i>.<br>He is liable for all three prohibitions, because the prohibition against partaking of forbidden fat is of a wider scope than the prohibition against partaking of a <i>trefe</i> and the prohibition against partaking of limb of a living animal is of a wider scope than the other two (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
[The following rules apply when] meat is disjoined from an animal and an organ is hanging from it. If it is impossible that this meat will again become a living part of the body, it is forbidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">From a comparison to the following halachah, it appears that this prohibition is of Scriptural origin.</i> but one is not liable for lashes for it. [This applies] even though it was not separated [from the animal] until after it was slaughtered. If the animal dies, we consider [the limb] as if it fell off while [the animal] was alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 74a makes this distinction between an animal that dies naturally and one which is ritually slaughtered.</i> Therefore one receives lashes for [partaking] of it, because of the prohibition against [partaking of] a limb from a living animal. If, however, the limb could again become a living part of the body and the animal is ritually slaughtered, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For it is considered as part of the animal.</i>
If one pulled an organ [from its natural position],<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Without detaching it.</i> crushed it, ground it, e.g., one crushed testicles or pulled them from their place [and then slaughtered the animal, the organ] is not forbidden according to Scriptural Law. [The rationale is] that it possesses a trace of life - as evidenced by the fact that it does not decay. Nevertheless, it is forbidden to partake of it as a result of a custom followed by the entire Jewish people from previous generations. For it resembles a limb separated from a living animal.
[The following laws apply when an animal's] bone was broken:<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 8:11-12, the Rambam mentions instances where a broken bone causes an animal to be designated as <i>trefe</i>. Here the Rambam is speaking of instances where the broken bone does not cause the animal to be <i>trefe</i> and the question involves merely the broken limb. May the meat from that limb be eaten or not?</i> If the flesh or the skin covers the majority of the thickness of the broken bone and the majority of the circumference of the fracture, it is permitted. If the bone emerged outside [the skin], the limb is forbidden. When the animal or the fowl is slaughtered, one should cut off [the limb] at the place where it is broken and discard it. The remainder of the limb is permitted.<br>We rule that [the limb] is forbidden until the flesh is healed [in all the following situations]: the bone broke, the flesh covers the bone, but that flesh was crushed or decayed like flesh which a doctor would remove, it is scattered in many different places,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when one would calculate the entire amount of the flesh, it would be large enough to cover the majority of the bone. Nevertheless, it is not located in large sections, but is instead, made up of many small pieces.</i> there were many perforations within the flesh,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">None of these perforations, however, caused a decrease in the mass of the flesh.</i> the flesh was cracked or pierced like a ring, the flesh was rubbed off from above until only a [thin] peel remained, or the flesh decayed from below around the broken bone to the extent that the flesh surrounding the bone does not touch it.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 76b mentions all these circumstances without reaching a final ruling regarding them. Hence we rule stringently.</i> If a person partook [of the limb] in any of these [circumstances], he is liable for stripes for rebellious conduct.
When a person inserts his hand into the inside of an animal, cuts off the spleen, one of the kidneys, or the like,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., organs that do not cause an animal to be considered as a <i>trefe</i>.</i> but leaves [the severed organ] inside the animal, and then slaughters it, the pieces cut off are forbidden as organs from a living animal although they remained within the animal's womb.

The rationale is that the animal's organs are an integral part of it. On the basis of Deuteronomy 14:5, "You shall eat it," our Sages explain when it's whole, you may eat everything within it, but not when it is lacking. The fetus, however, is not considered an integral part of the animal. Hence, as long as its limbs have not emerged outside the womb, they are permitted with the slaughter of the mother.</i><br>When a fetus sticks its foreleg or hind leg out of the womb, that limb is forbidden forever, whether one cuts off [the limb] before he slaughters the mother or afterwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">From this halachah and Halachah 11, we see that there are two prohibitions involved: partaking of a limb considered <i>trefe</i> and partaking of a limb from a living animal. At times, one applies, and in other situations, the other applies.</i> Even if it returns the limb to the womb of the mother and afterwards, [the mother] was slaughtered or the fetus was born and lived for several years,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interpret this as referring to a situation where the fetus was not born before the mother was ritually slaughtered (see also Halachah 12). Instead, the mother was slaughtered while the fetus was still in its womb. Afterwards, the fetus was taken out and it survived. If, however, the fetus is born before the mother is slaughtered, the leg which emerged is not forbidden. When the calf is slaughtered, all of its legs are permitted. There are authorities who differ whether this is the Rambam's intent. Most, however, agree that this ruling should be followed in practice [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 14:2)].</i> that limb is forbidden as a <i>trefe</i>. [The rationale is that] all meat that emerged from its natural position is forbidden as flesh that was separated from a living animal.<br>[This is derived from the phrase (Exodus 22:30 :] "Meat [from an animal that was] mortally wounded (<i>trefe</i>) in the field." [Our Rabbis extrapolated:] When meat comes out to a place that is like a field for it,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is not its natural place.</i> it becomes <i>trefe</i>, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 10.</i>
[When the fetus] sticks out a portion of a limb and a portion remains within, even if it is only the minority of it, the portion which emerged is forbidden and that which remained within is permitted.<br>If he cuts off the portion of the limb that emerged after it was returned within the animal and the animal was slaughtered, only that portion is forbidden, the remainder of the limb is permitted. If he did not return it to the womb and it remained outside and he cut it off there, the place where he cut it off - i.e., the place on the limb open to the air after the limb was cut off - is forbidden. He must afterwards cut off this portion as well. [This applies] whether he [originally] cut off the portion of the limb before [the mother] was slaughtered or afterwards.
Whenever a limb emerges and is cut off before the animal is slaughtered while it is outside, it is considered as a limb from a living animal<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As evident from a comparison to Halachah 9, the prohibition against partaking of a <i>trefe</i> applies only when the limb was cut off following the ritual slaughter of the mother.</i> and one is worthy of lashes for partaking of it. [This applies] even if the fetus dies before [the mother] is slaughtered.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For the ruling is dependent on the mother's condition, not that of the fetus. Even if the fetus dies, it is permitted to partake of it after the slaughter of the mother (see <i>Tosafos, Chullin</i> 72a).</i> If it is cut off after ritual slaughter, one who partakes of it is not liable for lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is not liable for lashes for transgressing the prohibition against partaking of a limb of a living animal. As reflected by Halachah 9, he violates the prohibition against partaking of a <i>trefe</i>. The Ra'avad maintains that he is liable for lashes for this violation. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> maintains that this situation is comparable to a maimed limb as described in Halachah 6 in which instance a Scriptural prohibition is involved, but one is not liable for lashes.</i> even if it dies. If [the mother] dies and then one cuts off this limb, one who partakes of it is liable for lashes for the prohibition against partaking of a limb from a living animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">And not for either the prohibition against partaking of a <i>trefe</i> or a <i>nevelah</i>. The death of the mother causes the limb to be considered as if it fell off during the animal's lifetime. See <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i> 2:9 which explains the parallels that apply with regard to the laws of ritual impurity.</i>
[The following rule applies when] a fetus sticks out a limb and that limb becomes forbidden and then the fetus is born.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that this also refers to a situation where the fetus was born after the mother was slaughtered.</i> If it is female, we are forbidden to drink its milk because of an unresolved halachic question.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 69a asks whether this milk can be compared to milk from a kosher animal or not. The distinction is that a kosher animal will become permitted if it is slaughtered in the ritual manner and this limb will never become permitted.</i> For the milk comes from all of the animal's limbs and it has a limb which is forbidden. Hence, it is comparable to milk from a <i>trefe</i> animal that becomes mixed with milk from a kosher animal.
When a person slaughters a kosher animal that is pregnant and discovers a fetus - whether live or dead - within it, the fetus is permitted to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to a live fetus, see the following halachah. With regard to a dead fetus, the Rambam is emphasizing that it is not considered as a separate entity (in which case it would be forbidden as a <i>nevelah</i>), but instead as one of the limbs of the mother.</i> Even the placenta is permitted to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 4, Halachah 5, states that a placenta that is expelled together with the newborn is forbidden to be eaten. In this instance, however, since the placenta has not been expelled, it is still considered part of the mother's body and permitted.</i><br>[The following rules apply if] a portion of the placenta emerged and then one slaughtered the mother. If the placenta was attached to the fetus, the portion which emerged is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Like the limb of a fetus that emerged before ritual slaughter (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ra'avad states that the placenta is comparable to an animal's waste products and therefore is not forbidden at all. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling.</i> and the remainder is permitted. If it is not attached to the fetus, it is forbidden in its entirety, for perhaps the fetus that was in this placenta disappeared<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Which was not permitted because of the slaughter of the mother.</i> and maybe the placenta of the fetus that is found in the womb disappeared. Needless to say, if a fetus is not found in the womb at all, the placenta is forbidden in its entirety.
If one finds a living fetus [in the womb of a slaughtered animal] - even though it has been carried for nine months,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the period of gestation was full term.</i> and it is possible that it will live, it does not require ritual slaughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">And can be killed in any manner.</i> Instead, it is acceptable because of the slaughter of its mother. If it steps on the ground, it requires ritual slaughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the impression that might be created (<i>Chullin</i> 75b).</i>
If a person ripped open an animal<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Without slaughtering it according to Torah law.</i> or slaughtered an animal that was <i>trefe</i> and found a live fetus that had been carried for nine months, [that fetus] must be ritually slaughtered to be permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 13:3) states that at present, we do not permit any fetus found in the womb of a <i>trefe</i> even if it was ritually slaughtered.</i> The slaughter of its mother is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Since the slaughter of the mother does not cause the mother to be permitted, it is not effective with regard to the fetus.</i><br>If the period [of gestation] was not completed, it is forbidden even though it is alive in the womb of the <i>trefe</i> animal. [The rationale is that] it is considered as one of the mother's limbs.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since the period of gestation has not been completed, it is not considered as an independent entity. Even if it is taken from the womb and lives for a brief time, ritual slaughter does not cause it to be permitted.</i> Whenever an animal thrust its head [out of the womb] and then returned it and [only] afterwards its mother was slaughtered, the slaughter of its mother has no bearing on it, it is considered as if it was born and it must be ritual slaughtered [to be permitted].

One is liable for <i>karet</i> only for blood that flows out [from the animal] when it is slaughtered, killed, or decapitated as long as it is tinted red, blood that is collected within the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Keritot</i> 5:1) where he states that this is the blood of fundamental importance.

As stated in the notes to that halachah, there are other Rabbis who differ with that point and require salting only when one cooks meat. See also the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 72:1) which quotes certain authorities that forbid eating a cooked heart, even if it was cut open and salted.</i> If one cooks a heart without cutting it open, one may cut it open after it was cooked.

Other substances that are cooked with it, however, are forbidden (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i> in the name of the Rashba). The Ra'avad and others differ with the Rambam and consider a heart cooked with its blood as forbidden. This is the view cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 72:2).</i> If one did not cut it open and partook of it, one is not liable for <i>karet</i>.<br>When does the above apply?

This view is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 73:2).</i> It has already become universal Jewish custom to singe it over a fire<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 10:11) where the Rambam mentions ordinary roasting and not singeing for the liver to be permitted.</i> and then cook it.

Instead, he writes that it is customary to cut open the membrane surrounding it and then to salt it thoroughly. See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 71:3).</i>
When a liver was cooked without being singed over a fire or cast into vinegar or hot water, the pot in which it was cooked is forbidden entirely: the liver and everything cooked with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 73:2) follows the opinion that the liver itself is permitted if it is cooked after being salted, though everything cooked with it is forbidden.

Hence, even at the outset, this is permitted. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 73:4) states that this ruling applies with regard to the ovens that existed in the Talmudic era. In the present era, however, it is common to turn the spit upside down.

It is permitted to cook a spleen<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">That has been salted [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 74:1)].</i> together with meat, because it is not blood, but meat that resembles blood.<br>When one breaks the neck of an animal before its soul expires, the blood is absorbed into the limbs.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the animal suffers internal bleeding when its neck is broken. Since it is in the midst of expiring, it does not have the potential to expel this blood from its system.

It is forbidden to partake of blood that has moved from place to place within an animal's body and cooking meat will certainly cause such movement. To avoid this difficulty, we salt meat, for this removes the blood. Casting meat in vinegar or boiling water does not remove blood, but instead causes it to be sealed in its place without moving even when the meat is cooked. Hence, according to the Rambam, this process is effective for ordinary meat. It is not, however, effective in this instance, for the internal bleeding that resulted from the breakage of the neck leaves blood that is not in its natural place (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, see also his gloss to Halachah 12).</i> What should be done? One should cut open<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the gloss of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> who states that one should cut open the meat to allow its blood to flow out.

In that chapter, the emphasis was that the animal was not dead when slaughtered. Here the Rambam is restating the law to emphasize that we do not fear that the blood became absorbed within the meat and will not be released through salting.</i> that when a person slaughters a domesticated animal, wild beast, or fowl and no blood emerges, they are permitted.
Meat does not release [all] the blood it contains unless it is salted thoroughly and washed thoroughly. What should one do? One should wash the meat first<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Among the reasons given for this initial washing are:<br>a) it removes the blood on the external surface of the meat;<br>b) it softens the meat and enables the blood inside to flow out more easily;<br>c) it enables the salt to adhere well to the surface of the meat.</i> and afterwards, salt it thoroughly. One should leave it in the salt for the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mil</i> is a Talmudic measure equivalent to approximately a kilometer. According to many Rabbinic opinions, it takes 18 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. [This view is cited in the present context by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 69:6).] The Rambam, however, follows a more stringent view [see his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 3:2)] and requires 24 minutes.<br>The Rama states that these measures are acceptable only after the fact or when there is an urgent need to prepare meat quickly. Otherwise, meat should be allowed to soak in water for at least half an hour.</i> and then wash it thoroughly, [continuing] until clean water emerges.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This washing removes the salt and blood from the meat. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 69:7) states that the meat should be washed twice and the Rama requires a third washing.</i> Immediately afterwards, one should cast it into boiling water - warm water is not [sufficient] - so that it will become white immediately and [no further] blood will be released.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the Rambam's view that we are knowledgeable in the process of casting meat into hot water to seal it in its place. (As mentioned above, there are many who maintain that we lack that knowledge.) Moreover, in this instance, once the meat has been salted, there is no need for this measure, because all its blood has been released. For this reason, the Ra'avad and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> object to the Rambam's ruling. It is, however, mentioned by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 69:19).</i>
When we salt meat, we salt it only in a utensil that has holes.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">So that the blood will drain out and not be reabsorbed by the meat. If one salted meat in utensil that did not have holes, all the meat lying in the brine is forbidden. Moreover, the outer surface of the meat above the brine becomes forbidden [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 69:18)]. The Rama maintains that the entire piece of meat becomes forbidden.</i><br>We salt it only with thick salt that resembles coarse sand. [The rationale is that] salt that is thin like flour will be absorbed by the meat and will not extract the blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 69:3) states that one should be careful not to use salt with overly large crystals for they will not adhere to the meat. The Rama adds that if one has only thin salt, it is permitted to salt meat using it.</i><br>One must shake the salt from the meat before washing it.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For the water will stop the meat from releasing blood. Afterwards, the salt may cause the blood on the surface to be reabsorbed into the meat (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 69:27).</i>
All of the above procedures apply with regard to meat that one must cook. For roasting, by contrast, one may salt the meat and roast it immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">When meat is cooked, the blood will enter the pot in which it is being cooked and cause the meat and any other substances to become forbidden. When it is being roasted, the blood will flow down from the spit without being absorbed.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam's words imply that he maintains that one must salt meat before roasting it. There are other Rabbinic opinions that do not accept that approach. (They are favored by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 76:1).<br>The Rashba emphasizes that if one salts meat and does not roast it immediately, he should wash off the salt and the blood. Otherwise, the blood may become reabsorbed. The Rama rules that one should wash meat and salt it slightly before roasting it and should roast it directly after salting it.</i><br>When a person desires to eat raw meat, he should salt it thoroughly<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements have attracted the attention of the commentaries, for they appear to contradict his approach in Halachah 9 and in the latter clause of this halachah. To explain: From Halachah 9, it would appear that it is forbidden to eat raw meat that is not salted only when there is internal bleeding while the animal is being slaughtered. For although the meat contains blood, that blood is forbidden only when it moves from one part of the meat to another while cooking. If one eats the meat raw, such a transfer will not take place.<br>Similarly, the latter clause of this halachah permits meat when it is cast into vinegar because the blood becomes sealed in its place. Implied is that the blood itself is permitted.<br>This clause, by contrast, states that one must salt the meat to remove the blood even when one eats the meat without cooking it. Implied is that the blood is forbidden even though it has not moved from place to place within the meat. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves the contradiction, explaining that since the blood is fit to move from place to place, it is forbidden. Hence, the latter clause which speaks about blood that is sealed in its place does not represent a contradiction. Similarly, this interpretation allows Halachah 9 to be understood in a manner that does not produce a contradiction.<br>It must be emphasized that the Ra'avad and many other authorities object to the Rambam's ruling and maintain that as long as the blood has not actually moved from place to place, it is not forbidden. Therefore it is permitted to partake of raw meat without salting it. It must, however, be washed thoroughly to remove all blood on its surface. This view is cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 67:2).</i> and wash it thoroughly.

Hence one should not rely on this leniency. This approach is followed by the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 76:6) which state that one should not place a utensil under the meat until the meat is roasted to the extent that it can be eaten.</i>
When roasted meat is sliced over a piece of bread, it is permitted to eat the bread, for [the liquid] which exudes is only fat.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., once the meat is roasted to the extent that it is fit to be eaten, we assume that all the forbidden blood has drained off.</i><br>When fish and fowl are salted together, even in a utensil with holes, the fish are forbidden.

The rationale is that since it is expelling its own blood and/or other juices, it will not absorb blood. Fish, however, will expel its blood and juices far faster than meat or fowl and will complete that process before the meat completes expelling its blood. Hence, we fear that it will absorb the blood from the meat or fowl (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>All that is forbidden is the external surface of the fish (<i>kedai kelipah</i>). Once that is cut off, the remainder of the fish is permitted [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 70:1)]. The Rama rules that all the fish are forbidden. This stringency applies when the fishes' scales have been removed. If they have not been removed, the fish are permitted.</i> Needless to say, [this law applies] if one salted fish together with the meat of an animal or beast.
When one leaves fowl whole, stuffs their cavity with meat and eggs, and cooks them, they are forbidden, for the blood flows into them.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., into the stuffings. Afterwards, the blood will become reabsorbed into the fowl itself and cause it to become forbidden.</i> This applies even if one salted them thoroughly,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets the Rambam's ruling as being dependent on his ruling in Halachah 10 that after being salted, meat must be placed in hot water. In this instance, the fowl's stuffing prevents the boiling water from having the desired effect on the fowl.<br>Alternatively, the Rambam's ruling can be understood according to the statements of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 77:1) who rules that initially one must salt both sides of the fowl. If the fowl was already stuffed, salting just the exterior is not sufficient, because it will not effect the blood on the inside. See also the Rama who rules that at the outset, fowl must be salted properly and any meat placed within it must be salted properly. Only in such a situation should one cook a fowl with stuffing.</i> and even if the meat inside them was cooked or roasted.

When one filled intestines [that were not salted] with roasted or cooked meat in this manner or with eggs and cooked them or roasted them, they are permitted.

[The following rules apply when] one coated fowl<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this halachah as referring to fowl that were salted, but were not placed in water after the salting. According to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 78:1), it applies to fowl that were not salted. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> continues, stating that according to the present custom, one should not coat meat that is being roasted unless it has been salted and washed first.</i> with flour and roasted them, whether whole or cut in portions. If they were coated with coarse flour, one may partake of the coating, even if it became reddish. [The rationale is that] coarse flour will crumble<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it will not stick thoroughly to the sides of the fowl.

It is forbidden to use a knife that was used for ritual slaughter to cut hot meat<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling is based on the following points. There is a difference of opinion among our Sages (<i>Chullin</i> 8b) whether the portion of the animal's neck where it is slaughtered is considered as "hot" at the time of slaughter, in which instance, when the animal is slaughtered some of its blood would be absorbed into the knife. Or it is not hot, in which instance, there is no such absorption.<br>From the Rambam's ruling (here and in Chapter 17, Halachah 7), it appears that he maintains that the animal's neck is not "hot." Nevertheless, he requires certain safeguards in consideration of the other views.<br>This issue is a matter of concern only when the meat being cut itself is hot. For otherwise, the blood absorbed in the knife will not be transferred to it.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions that there is another opinion which maintains that even though the animal's neck is cold, the pressure of cutting causes the knife to absorb some blood. See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 10:2) and commentaries.</i> unless the knife was exposed to fire until it turned white, sharpened in a sharpener or inserted into hard earth ten times. [After the fact,] if one cut hot meat with it, it is permitted.<br>Similarly, one should not cut radishes or other sharp foods<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Since these foods are sharp, they produce an effect similar to actual heat and have the potential to affect forbidden foods absorbed in a knife.

When meat has been salted in a bowl,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Seemingly this refers to a bowl that does not have holes.

Once it absorbs forbidden matter, it will never be dislodged from it (see Chapter 17, Halachah 2). Hence once the bowl has absorbed the blood, there is no way that the earthenware utensil will be permitted again.</i> for the blood has already been absorbed in its clay.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">And will be released when the hot food is placed in it, causing that food to become forbidden.</i> [This applies] even if [the utensil] is coated with lead.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Were the utensil to be made of lead alone, it could be kashered by boiling water in it (<i>hagalah</i>), as is the law with regard to metal utensils.

When a person partakes of the fat of a <i>nevelah</i> or a<i> trefe</i>, he is liable for partaking of fat and for partaking of a <i>nevelah</i> or a<i> trefe</i>. [The rationale]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., why we do not follow the principle that one prohibition does not fall upon another.</i> is that since a prohibition is added to its meat - for it was permitted beforehand - it is also added to its fat.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The fat was forbidden previously and a further prohibition is added when the meat becomes forbidden.</i> Hence one is liable for two sets of lashes.

This conclusion is cited by the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 64:4 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 64:6.</i> for it in the same way as if he cut off the fat of the animal itself. [The rationale is that the fulfillment of the gestation period] is what causes the prohibition against fat.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> clarifies that this stringency does not apply when the fetus dies in its mother's womb even if it has completed the nine months of gestation.</i>
There are three types of forbidden fat for which one is liable for<i> kerat</i>: the fat on the digestive organs, on both kidneys, and on the flanks. The fat-tail, by contrast, is permitted to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 64:5) states that one must remove the fatty portion on the inner side.</i> It is called fat only with regard to the sacrifices, just as the kidneys and the large lobe of the liver are referred to as "fat" with regard to the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 117a interprets Leviticus 3:16: "All of the <i>cheilev</i> to God" as referring to the portions of the animal offered on the altar. These include the kidneys and the lobe of the liver although they are not "fat" (see <i>Hilchot Maaseh HaKorbanot</i> 1:18). Instead, the intent of term <i>cheilev</i> in the verse is "choice portions."</i> Similarly, we find the expressions<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 45:18; Deuteronomy 32:14.</i> "the fat of the land," and "wheat as fat as kidneys" [where the intent is not "fat,"] but "choice."<br>Since these entities are being raised up from the sacrifice to be consumed with fire for God, they are called "the fat," i.e., the choice portion, for there is nothing more choice than the portion consumed with fire for God.

There is also fat on the maw which is bent like an arch; it is forbidden. There is a ligament that extends like a lobe; it is permitted. The strands [stemming from] the fat are forbidden, but one is not liable for <i>kerat</i> for them.
Fat which is covered by meat is permitted. Scripture forbids "fat on the flanks," but not within the flanks. Similarly, "fat on the kidneys" is forbidden, but not fat within the kidneys.

There are two cords of fat in the primary loin area, near the top of the thigh. While an animal is alive, this fat can be seen on the intestines.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For while an animal is alive, its meat hangs loosely (<i>Chulin</i> 93b).</i> When, however, it dies, one portion of meat will cling to another and cover this fat.

It is forbidden for a butcher to spread the fat of the flanks over the meat<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions views that maintain that this restriction only applies directly after slaughter when the fat is still warm. Once it has cooled, it hardens. This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 64:18).</i> to make it appear attractive. [The rationale is that] the membrane over the fat is thin.

Meat should not be salted before the forbidden membranes and strands of tissue are removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This is a safeguard against the fat and blood being absorbed by the meat.</i> If the meat was salted with them, they must be removed after the salting.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 64:20) quotes both views. The Rama also cites a more stringent perspective, but concludes that one may rely on the Rashba's view.</i>

Chapter 8

[The prohibition against partaking of] the <i>gid hanesheh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis, ch. 32, relates that before his confrontation with Esau, Jacob remained alone in his camp. An unidentified being - interpreted by the Torah commentaries to be Esau's archangel - wrestled with him the entire night. When he saw that he could not defeat Jacob, he gave him a blow to his upper thigh, dislocating his <i>gid hanesheh</i>. In commemoration of this event, "The children of Israel do not eat the <i>gid hanesheh</i>.<br>The Rabbis identified the <i>gid hanesheh</i> as the sciatic nerve, the large main nerve running down the back of an animal's hind leg. The term <i>gid</i>, though sometimes translated as "sinew," is a general term. As the Rambam writes in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 3:4), it is used to refer to arteries, veins, tendons, nerves, and sinews.</i> applies with regard to kosher<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 5.</i> domesticated animals and wild beasts,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 183) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 3) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> even <i>nevelot</i> and <i>trefot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 6.</i> It applies to a fetus<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 65:7 does not cite the Rambam's view, but instead quotes two differing opinions: one that the prohibition does not apply to a fetus at all and another, that it applies only when the fetus has completed the period of gestation and is discovered alive.</i> and to animals that have been consecrated, both those consecrated [for sacrifices] of which we partake and for sacrifices of which we do not partake. It applies to [the <i>gid</i>] on the right thigh and that on the left thigh.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Although the angel only dislodged the nerve on one of Jacob's legs, we are forbidden to partake of the nerves from both sides.</i><br>According to Scriptural Law, only [the <i>gid</i>] on the hip socket is forbidden, as [Genesis 32:33] states: "which is on the hip-socket." The remainder of the <i>gid</i> which is above the socket or below the socket - and similarly, the fat which is on the <i>gid</i> - are forbidden only according to Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 7 concerning the removal of this nerve.</i> There are two <i>giddim</i>. The inner one next to the bone is forbidden according to Scriptural Law. The entire outer one is forbidden by Rabbinic decree.
When a person partakes of the inner <i>gid hanesheh</i> on the socket, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Because he violates a Scriptural prohibition.</i> If he partakes of the fat [of the <i>gid</i>], the remainder of the inner <i>gid</i>, or the entire outer one, he is liable for stripes for rebellious conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For violating a Rabbinic prohibition.</i><br>What is the measure of which one must partake to be liable?

The rationale is that it is considered as a self-contained entity.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Accordingly, even if it is less than an olive-sized portion in size, one is liable. Compare to Chapter 2, Halachah 21, Chapter 15, Halachah 17, and Chapter 16, Halachah 6.</i>
When a person eats an olive-sized portion of the <i>gid</i> on the right side and an olive-sized portion of the <i>gid</i> on the left side, or he ate two entire <i>giddim</i> even if they are not the size of an olive, he receives 80 lashes. He is given lashes for every <i>gid</i> independently.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Moshe HaCohen writes that this ruling applies when the person was given a separate warning for each <i>gid</i>. Otherwise, he receives only one set of lashes. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam would also accept that interpretation.</i>
The prohibition against <i>gid hanesheh</i> does not apply with regard to a fowl, because it does not have a [round]<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This explanatory addition is based on <i>Chullin</i> 92b.</i> hip-socket. Instead, its thigh is long [and flat]. If there is a fowl whose thigh is shaped like that of the thigh of an animal, i.e., it has a hip-socket, its <i>gid hanesheh</i> is forbidden, but one is not liable for lashes, because of it. Similarly, when there is an animal whose thigh is long like that of a fowl, its <i>gid hanesheh</i> is forbidden, but one is not liable for lashes for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 92b discusses these issues and leaves both matters unresolved; hence, the Rambam's rulings.</i>
When a person eats the <i>gid hanesheh</i> from a non-kosher domesticated animal or wild beast, he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Not for partaking of the <i>gid</i> and not for partaking of the meat of a forbidden animal.</i> [The rationale is that this prohibition] does not apply with regard to a non-kosher animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chullin</i> 101a notes that the confrontation between Jacob and the angel took place before the Giving of the Torah, at a time when the Jews could eat non-kosher animals. Hence, there is reason to say that the prohibition could involve a non-kosher animal, for partaking of such animal was not forbidden until the Giving of the Torah.<br>In response, the Talmud explains that our observance of this prohibition does not stem from the practice observed by Jacob's descendants, but because this prohibition was reiterated at the time of the Giving of the Torah. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 7:6, the Rambam elaborates on this point, explaining that our observance of Jewish practice, even the mitzvot which we know that the Patriarchs fulfilled like circumcision, stems from God's command at Sinai and not from our ancestors' observance.</i> only with regard to an animal that is entirely permitted.

See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 65:9) which states that a <i>gid</i> is "like a piece of wood; it has no flavor."</i> If, however, one partakes of the fat on the <i>gid</i> [of a non-kosher] animal, it is considered as if one ate from its meat.
When a person partakes of a <i>gid hanesheh</i> from a<i> nevelah</i>, a <i>trefe</i>, or an animal consecrated as a burnt offering, he is liable for two [sets of lashes]. Since [the prohibition]<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prohibition against partaking of a <i>nevelah</i>, <i>trefe</i>, or burnt offering.</i> includes the remainder of its body which was permitted, it also includes the <i>gid</i> and causes another prohibition to be added to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Following the concept of <i>issur kollel</i>, "an encompassing prohibition," as explained in the conclusion of Halachah 14 (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's ruling, noting that <i>Chullin</i> 82b states that according to the opinion that a <i>gid hanesheh</i> does not have any flavor, one is not liable. Only the opinion that maintains that the <i>gid hanesheh</i> does have a flavor holds one liable. From the previous halachah, it appears that the Rambam follows the former view. Why then does he hold the person liable for two sets of lashes.</i>
One who removes the <i>gid hanesheh</i> must ferret out all traces of it until nothing remains.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>gid hanesheh</i> and the <i>gid</i> forbidden by Rabbinic decree subdivide into several branches, this is a rather difficult task. For this reason, in most sectors of the Jewish community today, it is customary not to eat the hind-quarters of an animal. Accordingly, several cuts of meat, e.g., sirloin steak, are not available from kosher butchers.</i> A butcher's word is accepted with regard to the<i> gid hanesheh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we rely on his word and do not inspect the meat ourselves.</i> just as it is accepted with regard to forbidden fat. [Accordingly,] we do not purchase meat from every butcher, [only from] an upright man who has established a reputation for observance.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">If the person himself does not have a reputation for observance and knowledge of the laws, he can sell meat if he hires such a person to act as a supervisor. This is the rationale for the practice of<i> hasgachah</i>, kashrut inspection, practiced today.</i> If he slaughters meat himself and sells it, his word is accepted.
Where does the above apply? In the Diaspora. In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, by contrast, when it is populated entirely by [Torah-observant] Jews, meat may be purchased from anyone.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In the present era, there is no difference between <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and other lands, for the majority of the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> are not Torah observant.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a butcher is considered as trustworthy to sell meat, but it is discovered that he sold meat that was <i>nevelah</i> or<i> trefe</i>. He must return the money to its owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">He must return the money entirely. This applies even if the customers already partook of the non-kosher meat (<i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 16:14). The rationale is that a person's soul is revolted by the commission of a transgression and he is not considered to have benefited from the meat at all (<i>Sefer Meirat Einayim</i> 232:4).</i> He is placed under a ban of ostracism and is removed from his position.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 21.</i><br>There is no way that he can correct [his act] so that people [will be allowed] to purchase meat from him until he goes to a place where his identity is unknown<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">If he performs such an act in a place where his identity is known, it can be said that he did so in order to be reinstated.</i>and returns a lost object of significant worth or slaughters an animal for his own self and has it declared <i>trefe</i> although it involves a significant financial loss.

When a person purchases meat and sends it via a common person, [the latter's] word is accepted with regard to it. Although he has not established a reputation for Torah observance,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> who maintains that the Rambam would rule in this manner even when a Jew is reputed to transgress various prohibitions.

If the majority were Jewish, it is permitted.
Similarly, when meat is found in the hand of a gentile and it is not known from where he purchased it, if [the majority of] the sellers of meat were Jewish, it is permitted.<br>This reflects the ruling according to Scriptural Law. [Nevertheless,] our Sages have already forbidden any meat found in the marketplace or in the possession of a gentile<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, there are <i>Rishonim</i> who permit meat found in the possession of a gentile when the majority of the sellers are Jewish, maintaining that this is evident from <i>Chullin</i> 95a.

[The following rule applies when] one hung a container filled with pieces of meat, the container broke, and the pieces fell to the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he found it as he left it, it is certainly permitted (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> If there is no distinguishing mark [on the meat] and he was not able to recognize it, it is forbidden.

It is permitted to derive benefit from a <i>gid hanesheh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that according to <i>Pesachim</i> 22a, it would appear that the authorities who maintain that the <i>gid hanesheh</i> has no flavor also maintain that it is forbidden to benefit from it. Now the Rambam follow the perspective that the <i>gid hanesheh</i> has no flavor (see Halachah 5). Hence his position here is somewhat difficult. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains, however, that the two positions are not necessary interrelated and both rulings of the Rambam can be upheld.</i> Therefore it is permissible for a person to send a thigh which contains a <i>gid hanesheh</i> to a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because there is no prohibition against receiving benefit from the <i>gid hanesheh</i>, he does not have to remove it before selling the meat.</i> He may give him the entire thigh intact in the presence of a Jew. We do not suspect that [the other] Jew will partake of this meat before the <i>gid</i> is removed, because its place is recognizable.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Jew sees a co-religionist giving the gentile the meat, he will assume that it was ritually slaughtered and that the meat was kosher. [This applies in a place where public announcements are made when an animal is discovered to be <i>trefe</i> (<i>Chullin</i> 93b). Otherwise, the Jew must tell the gentile that the animal is kosher (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 65:11)].<br>Nevertheless, since the place of the <i>gid hanesheh</i> is recognizable - i.e., it is obvious whether the <i>gid</i> is still in the thigh or has already been removed - he will not partake of the meat until the <i>gid</i> is removed.</i> Accordingly, if the thigh was cut into pieces, he should not give it to a gentile in the presence of a Jew, lest the other Jew partake of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Since the place of the <i>gid hanesheh</i> is not obvious, the other Jew may think that ordinary kosher meat is being given and may partake of it.</i>

The passive form implies that it is forbidden to derive any benefit that could lead to one's eating, e.g., selling it for money that could be used to purchase food.</i> unless:<br>a) a verse explicitly states otherwise, as it does with regard to a <i>nevelah</i> [Deuteronomy 14:21]: "Give it to the stranger in your gate and he shall partake of it," or with regard to forbidden fat [Leviticus 7:24]: "You may use it for any task"; or<br>b) the Oral Law states explicitly that it is permitted to benefit from it, as is the case with regarding to teeming animals, swarming animals, blood, a limb from a living animal, and the <i>gid hanesheh</i>. For according to the Oral Tradition, it is permitted to benefit from all these prohibited entities, even though it is forbidden to partake of them.
Whenever it is forbidden to benefit from a substance, if a person derives benefit without partaking of it, e.g., he sold or gave to a gentile or gave it to dogs, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Moshe HaCohen questions this ruling, stating that if the intent of the Scriptural prohibition is that it is forbidden to benefit from these substances, why is one not liable for lashes for deriving such benefit? The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that he is not liable, for one is liable for lashes only when he derives benefit from the food in the ordinary manner one derives benefit from food. This includes only eating. Receiving money, by contrast, is not considered as benefiting from food in the ordinary manner. Rav Moshe HaCohen, however, anticipated that attempted resolution and explains that, on the contrary, selling edible food is an ordinary way of deriving benefit.</i> He should, however, be given stripes for rebellious conduct. The money [he received] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">There is one exception to this: money received in return for a false deity or articles associated with it. That money is itself forbidden (see Chapter 13, Halachah 15; <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 7:19).</i><br>Whenever it is forbidden to partake of a substance, but it is permitted to benefit from it, even though it is permitted to benefit from it, it is forbidden do business with such articles or establish oneself in a profession that involves forbidden entities.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one's livelihood may not revolve around the sale of these forbidden entities or performing work with them (e.g., serving as a chef in a non-kosher restaurant). The rationale for the prohibition is that we fear that a person who has extensive involvement with forbidden substances may come to partake of them (Rashba).<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> clarifies that the above applies only with regard to food from forbidden species. One may choose a profession that involves employing a horse or a donkey as a beast of burden.</i> [There is] an exception, forbidden fat, for concerning it, it is written: "You may use it for any task." For this reason, we do not do business with <i>nevelot, trefot</i>, teeming animals, and swarming animals.
When a trapper happens upon a non-kosher wild animal, fowl, or fish, and he snares them or he traps both kosher and non-kosher animals, he may sell them.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">He must sell them immediately. He may not raise them until they become large [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 117:4)]. See also <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 117:6 who questions whether the leniency is granted only to a professional trapper or to any person.</i> He may not, however, intend to have his profession concern non-kosher species.<br>It is, however, permitted to do business with milk that was milked by a gentile without being observed by a Jew, cheeses made by gentiles, and the like.
This is the general principle: Whenever a prohibition is forbidden by Scriptural Law, it is forbidden to do business with it. Whenever the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin, it is permitted do business with it, whether we are certain of the existence of the prohibition or it is a matter of question.

Chapter 9

It is forbidden to cook meat and milk together and to partake of them according to Scriptural Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandments 186-187) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvot 113 and 92) include these prohibitions among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> It is forbidden to benefit from [such a mixture]. It must be buried. Its ashes are forbidden like the ashes of all substances that must be buried.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 19:11,13.</i><br>Whenever a person cooks an olive-sized portion of the two substances together,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., together the mixture is the size of an olive.

Similarly, a person who partakes of an olive-sized portion of the meat and milk that were cooked together<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the meat and milk have not been cooked together, there is no Scriptural prohibition against partaking of them together (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).

The implication is that the prohibitions against cooking the mixture and partaking of it are separate issues that do not necessarily share a connection (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>
The Torah remained silent concerning the prohibition against partaking [of meat and milk]<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., no where in the Torah does it state that it is forbidden to partake of such a mixture.</i> only because it forbade cooking them. This is as if to say: Even cooking it is forbidden, how much more so partaking of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, in his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, the Rambam explains that the prohibitions against partaking of and benefiting from milk and meat are derived from the fact that the Torah repeats this prohibition three times. Perhaps the reason the Rambam does not mention this means of derivation here is to avoid the following question being raised: Why are lashes not given for benefiting from milk and meat?<br>To explain: In Chapter 8, Halachah 16, the Rambam writes that one is not liable for lashes for deriving benefit from a forbidden substance. As explained in the notes to that halachah, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that one is liable for lashes only when he derives benefit from the food in an ordinary manner from food. This includes only eating and not other forms of deriving benefit. Nevertheless, seemingly this should not apply with regard to benefiting from a mixture of milk and meat. For, as stated in Chapter 14, Halachah 10, in that instance, one is liable even if one does not derive benefit in the ordinary manner. Hence, it would appear that one should be liable for lashes for partaking of such a mixture.<br>Among the explanations given why one is not liable is that the prohibition against deriving benefit from a mixture of milk and meat is derived from an inference from a more lenient instance to a more stringent one (a <i>kal vichomer</i>; see <i>Chullin</i> 115b). And we follow the principle that punishment is not meted out when a prohibition is derived in such a fashion, only when it is stated explicitly (<i>Sifri, Naso</i>). If, however, there was an explicit prohibition in the Torah teaching us that deriving benefit from a mixture of milk and meat was forbidden. Seemingly, one would be liable for lashes (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).</i> [To cite a parallel:] The Torah did not mention the prohibition against relations with one's daughter, because it forbade those with the daughter of one's daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 2:6.</i>
According to Scriptural Law, the prohibition involves only [a mixture of] meat from a kosher domesticated animal<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the meat or milk of a kosher wild beast or fowl, see the following halachah and notes.</i> and milk from a kosher domesticated animal, as implied by the verse: "Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prohibition involves only a kid that could be eaten and milk of which one could partake.</i> The term "a kid" includes the offspring of an ox, the offspring of a sheep, and the offspring of a goat unless the verse states explicitly, a goat-kid.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the term <i>gidi</i> translated as "kid," commonly means "a kid-goat." Nevertheless, according to the Bible, it is not necessarily restricted to this meaning unless the verse specifies so explicitly, as in Genesis 27:16; 38:20.</i> The term "a kid in its mother's milk" [does not exclude all other situations].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the intent is not that one is liable only for cooking an offspring in the milk of its mother and not in any other situations.

One is not liable for [transgressing the prohibition against partaking of] meat and milk if one partakes of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, one is liable for partaking of the non-kosher meat or the non-kosher milk.</i>
Similarly, the meat of a wild beast and the meat of a fowl together with the milk of a wild beast or the milk of a domesticated animal is not forbidden according to Scriptural Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis in <i>Chullin </i>116a whether the prohibition against eat the meat of a wild beast [cooked] in milk is Scriptural or Rabbinic in origin. According to some interpretations, that difference of opinion is perpetuated among the <i>Rishonim</i> (see <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 87:4). Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of <i>Rishonim</i> and <i>Achronim</i> follow the opinion the Rambam states here. This is also the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 87:3).<br>Significantly, in (<i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 2:9), the Rambam states that the meat of a wild beast that is cooked in milk is forbidden according to Scriptural Law. In their glosses to <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i>, the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that there, the Rambam is speaking theoretically: Were the halachah to follow the opinion that the meat of a wild beast is forbidden according to Scriptural law, the ruling would be such and such. The <i>Merkevat HaMishneh</i>, however, maintains that a printing error crept into the text in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> and the text should be changed to fit the Rambam's ruling in <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i>.</i> Therefore it is permitted to cook it and it is permitted to benefit from it. It is forbidden to partake of it according to Rabbinic Law so that people at large will not be negligent and come to violate the Scriptural prohibition against milk and meat and partake of the meat of a kosher domesticated animal [cooked] in the milk of a kosher domesticated animal. For the literal meaning of the verse implies only the meat of a kid in the milk of its actual mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Hence were the Sages to allow one to partake of the meat of a wild beast and fowl cooked in milk, one might think that the prohibition applies only in its most literal context. As a safeguard to prevent this error from occurring, they instituted this prohibition.</i> Therefore, they forbade all meat in milk.
It is permitted to partake of fish and locusts [cooked] in milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 87:3 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 87:5 mention that there are authorities who forbid eating fish and milk together because it can cause health dangers.

Why then does the prohibition against partaking of milk and meat not apply?<br>The Rambam attempts to resolve this question in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Keritot</i> 3:4) by explaining that since the prohibition against benefiting from the mixture is an extension of the prohibition against partaking of it, when - as in the present instance - the prohibition against partaking of it does not apply, the prohibition against benefiting from it also does not apply.</i>
When a person cooks a fetus in milk, he is liable. Similarly, one who partakes of it is liable.

When meat falls into milk or milk falls into meat and they are cooked together, the minimum measure [for which one is liable is] enough for one substance to impart its flavor to the other.<br>What is implied? When a piece of meat falls into a bubbling pot<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The pot must be boiling hot. If meat falls into cold milk, it will not absorb it.

His word is only accepted with regard to ritual matters when he makes statements in the course of conversation, without knowing that a Jew is depending on his word.<br>This interpretation is not evident from the Rambam's words. On the contrary, it appears that according to the Rambam, the statements of any gentile are acceptable (see Chapter 15, Law 30, and notes). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 92:1 quotes the Rambam's words. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 92:1 mentions the view of <i>Tosafot</i>. The Rama states that in the Ashkenazic community, the custom is not to rely on the word of a gentile in this context. Instead, we require sixty times the volume of the meat in all instances.

When milk falls [onto a piece of] meat [being cooked] in a pot,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As evident from the continuation of the Rambam's words in this and the following halachah, we are speaking of an instance where milk falls on a piece of meat that is not in the sauce. According to Rashi, the lower portion of the meat is resting within the sauce in the pot and its upper portion - on which the milk falls - projects beyond it. According to Rabbenu Yitzchak, the entire portion is outside the sauce. See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 92:2; <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 92:4. (From the Rambam's wording at the beginning of the following halachah, it would appear that he follows Rabbenu Yitzchak's position.)</i> we taste<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we have the meat tasted by a gentile as above.</i> the piece on which the milk fell. If it does not have the flavor of milk, everything is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the piece itself is permitted and therefore all the contents of the pot.</i> [More stringent rules apply] if the piece of meat has the flavor of milk. Even though if the piece of meat was pressed to remove [the absorbed liquid], the flavor [of milk] would not remain, since it has the flavor of milk now, it is forbidden and we must measure its entire volume.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since the meat becomes forbidden, because it is meat that has been mixed with milk, tasting the mixture for milk is not sufficient. Instead, we consider the meat as a forbidden article and measure 60 times its volume. It is not possible to distinguish between the flavor of the forbidden meat and that of the permitted meat.</i> If everything in the pot - the other meat, the vegetables, the sauce, and the spices - is great enough so that the piece is one sixtieth of the entire [volume], that piece of meat is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Once it becomes forbidden, it is considered as a prohibited entity and cannot become permitted again. Our Sages [<i>Chullin</i> 108b; Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 92:3-4)] use the expression: "The piece becomes like carrion," i.e., as if it is inherently forbidden.</i> and the remainder is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As if it was mixed with 60 times its volume of non-kosher meat. If the entire mixture is not 60 times the volume of the forbidden piece, the entire mixture becomes forbidden.</i>
When does the above apply? When he did not stir the pot at the outset when the milk fell into it. [He did so] only at the end<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Since he mixed at the end, after the meat became forbidden, the entire mixture may become forbidden.</i> and did not cover the pot.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the piece of meat on which the milk fell remained a discrete entity, separate from the entire mixture. Hence it becomes forbidden.</i><br>If, however, he stirred the pot from the beginning until the end<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 82) states that it is sufficient for him to stir the mixture at the beginning. This will cause the milk to be blended throughout the entire mixture. There is no need for him to continue stirring the pot. Rav Yaakov ibn Chaviv maintains that the Rambam would also accept this position. The Rambam mentions stirring the put until the end only for stylistic reasons. This interpretation is also apparent in the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 8:3).<br>In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and <i>Beit Yosef</i>, Rav Yosef Caro differs and maintains that the Rambam's words here should be understood literally. Unless he mixed the pot from the beginning until the end, we fear that it was not mixed well. Hence in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 92:2, he quotes the Rambam exactly. The Rama, however, cites the Tur's position.</i> or covered [the pot]<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For covering the pot also causes the flavor of the milk to be blended throughout the entire mixture.</i> from the time [the milk] fell until the end, [the question of whether a prohibition exists depends] on whether [the milk] imparted its flavor.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">And we have a gentile taste the mixture as above.</i><br>Similarly, if the milk fell into the sauce or onto all the pieces and it was not known on which piece [the milk] fell,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 92:2) emphasize that if the person does not stir the pot immediately after the milk fell in, the piece on which the milk fell becomes forbidden. Since its identity is unknown, all the pieces are forbidden unless the entire mixture is 60 times larger than its largest piece.<br>Rav Yaakov ibn Chaviv and Rav Yosef Caro (in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and <i>Beit Yosef</i>) interpret the Rambam's intent as analogous to that of the <i>Tur</i>. They maintain that the Rambam also would agree that if person waited after the milk fell on the piece, that piece - and perhaps all the pieces - become(s) forbidden.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> offers a different interpretation, explaining that in this instance, we do not say that the piece of meat on which the milk fell becomes forbidden because we do not know which piece it is. Hence rather than have the taste of the milk affect that piece, we stir the entire mixture so that the milk will become blended into it and become nullified as explained in the following note.<br>The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 92:6 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 92:8 follow the interpretation of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, explaining that in this instance, the principle (<i>Beitzah</i> 4b): "We do not nullify the existence of a forbidden substance at the outset," does not apply. For since the identity of the forbidden substance was never established, there is no specific prohibited substance involved. Hence at the outset, the entire pot is considered as subject to being forbidden. To prevent that from happening, we stir it so that the prohibition will not take effect.</i> he should stir the entire pot so that all its contents will be mixed [thoroughly].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., intentionally mixing the milk throughout the entire pot and thus nullifying its presence. As the <i>Tur</i> (<i>loc. cit</i>) writes, if the milk fell into the sauce, even if the person did not stir the mixture, this would be the ruling. Nevertheless, the Rambam advises the person to stir the mixture so that it will be mixed thoroughly and no trace will remain.</i> If the flavor of milk [can be detected] in the entire pot, it is forbidden. If not, it is permitted. If a gentile to taste [the pot] whom we can rely on cannot be found, we require a measure of sixty whether for meat in milk or milk in meat. If there is one measure in sixty,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">More precisely, the permitted substance must be sixty times the volume of the forbidden substance. Thus we are speaking about the forbidden substance being one sixty-first.</i> it is permitted. If there is less than sixty, it is forbidden.
When meat has been cooked in a pot, milk should not be cooked in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even on a later day. According to Scriptural Law, after 24 hours, there is no prohibition. Nevertheless, according to Rabbinic Law, at the outset, one should be stringent and not cook milk in a pot in which meat was cooked previously even if it had been cooked several days beforehand.</i> If one cooked [milk] in it, [it is forbidden] if it imparted its flavor.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it should be tasted by a gentile. According to the Ashkenazic custom not to rely on a gentile, we require that the contents be 60 times the volume of the pot. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 93:1 states that it would be very rare for such a situation to exist. Generally, the ratio between a pot and its contents is less than 60. Hence, in most instances, the food would be prohibited.</i>
The udders [of an animal] are forbidden according to Rabbinic Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we are afraid that a certain amount of milk remained in the udder or that the udder absorbed a certain amount of milk. Since we do not know how much milk it absorbed, we assume that it is entirely forbidden.</i> [The prohibition is not of Scriptural origin, because] meat that was cooked in milk from an animal that was slaughtered is not forbidden according to Scriptural Law, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 6.</i><br>Therefore if one cut it open and discharged the milk it contained, it is permitted to roast it and eat it. If one cut it both horizontally and vertically and then pressed it into a wall until none of the moisture of the milk remained, it may be cooked with other meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The ruling regarding roasting is more lenient than the ruling regarding cooking, because when meat is roasted, any fluids it contains are discharged and flow outward without being absorbed (see Halachah 14). When it is cooked, by contrast, it stews in its juices and it and any other meat will absorb the milk it discharges.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 90:2) writes that the accepted custom is not to cook it with other meat at all and to cook it alone only after it has been cut vertically and horizontally and pressed into a wall. The Rama adds that it is Ashkenazic custom not to cook it at all.</i><br>When an udder has not been cut open, when from a young animal that never nursed<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., our Sages enforced their decree universally, without differentiating between one animal and another.</i> or from an older one, it is forbidden to cook it. If one transgressed and cooked it alone, it is permitted to partake of it. If one cooked it with other meat, we require 60 times its volume. The udder itself is calculated in the 60.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In Chapter 15, Halachah 18, the Rambam explains that since only a Rabbinic prohibition is involved, our Sages were more lenient. Thus the Rambam interprets this ruling as being of general significance. The Rashba offers a different rationale for this ruling, explaining that since the meat of the udder is acceptable, we include it in the reckoning of 60. Thus in contrast to other instances where 60 times the amount of the forbidden substance is required, here, we require only 59.</i>
What is implied? If the entire mixture together with the udder was sixty times the volume of the udder, the udder is forbidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Chullin</i> 97b, explains that we assume that the milk imparted its flavor to the udder. Hence it becomes forbidden as the Rambam proceeds to state.</i> and the remainder is permitted. If there was less than 60 times its volume, the entire mixture is forbidden. Regardless of [the ruling applying to the entire mixture], if the udder fell into another pot, it can cause it to be forbidden. We require 60 times its volume as in the original instance.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Thus according to the Rambam, only 59 times its volume is required. This view is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 90:1). The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama differ and maintain that the second mixture is judged more stringently than the first. They follow the rationale of the Rashba cited above. Thus they maintain at first, the udder is included in the reckoning, because its meat is permitted. With regard to the second mixture, by contrast, it is the meat, not the milk of the udder which is forbidden. Hence 60 times its volume is required.</i> [The rationale is that] the udder which is cooked becomes considered as a forbidden piece of meat.<br>We measure [the volume of] the udder at the time that it was cooked, not according to its state when it fell [into the mixture].
We do not roast an udder that has been cut above meat on a spit.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This is a safeguard so that it will not discharge milk which will flow over other pieces of meat.</i> If, however, one roasted it [in that manner], everything is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">For even if its milk does flow over other pieces of meat, they are not forbidden. The rationale is that since it has been cut open, we do not suspect that perhaps some milk remained. Since the entire prohibition is Rabbinic in origin, we are not overly stringent. The Rama states if the udder was not cut open beforehand, the meat that is lower on the spit is forbidden.</i>
A stomach that is cooked with milk inside it<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a calf that had drank its mother's milk and was cooked with that milk in its stomach.</i> is permitted. [The rationale is that] it is no longer considered as milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that according to the Rambam, this applies even to milk that is still liquid.

It is forbidden to place the skin of a kosher animal's stomach [in milk] to serve as a catalyst for it to harden into cheese. If one used it as a catalyst, [a gentile] should taste the cheese. If it has a taste of meat, it is forbidden. If not, it is permitted. [The rationale is that] the catalyst is itself a permitted entity,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the logic mentioned in the following note does not apply.</i> for it comes from the stomach of a kosher animal. [The only question] is [whether] the prohibition against meat and milk [was violated] and that is dependent on whether the flavor was imparted.<br>[Different laws apply, however, when] one uses the skin of the stomach of a <i>nevelah</i>, a <i>trefe</i>, or a non-kosher animal. [The rationale is that] since the catalyst is forbidden in its own right, the cheese becomes forbidden, not because of the prohibition of meat and milk, but because of the prohibition against a <i>nevelah</i>. For this reason, [our Sages] forbade cheeses made by gentiles, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 3, Halachah 13. As the Rambam states in that halachah, since the amount of skin used is minimal, we might think that no prohibition is involved, for the forbidden substance would be nullified. Nevertheless, the Rabbis ruled stringently, explaining that since the catalyst which causes the milk to curdle is forbidden, everything is forbidden.</i>
Meat alone is permitted and milk alone is permitted. It is [only] when the two become mixed together through cooking that they both become forbidden.<br>When does the above apply? When they were cooked together, when a hot object fell into a hot object,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance, the two substances will be absorbed by each other just as if they had been cooked together.</i> or when a cold object fell into a hot object.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">For we follow the principle (<i>Pesachim</i> 76a): "The lower one dominates," and the food is considered as hot.</i> If, however, [milk or meat] that is hot fell into the other when it is cold, [all that is necessary is to] remove the surface of the meat which touched the milk; the remainder may be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">We assume that the meat's surface absorbed a small amount of milk while it was cooling down (<i>ibid.</i>). Hence the surface is forbidden and must be removed. The milk does not, however, permeate beyond the surface. Therefore the remainder is permitted. With regard to the milk, it appears that there is no prohibition. The Radbaz explains that since it is not possible to remove the surface of the milk, there is no prohibition whatsoever. Other <i>Rishonim</i> require that the milk be sixty times the volume of the surface of the meat. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 91:4) quotes the Rambam's ruling and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 91:8 states that this decision is accepted by the Rama despite the fact that this might appear incompatible with some of the other rulings of the Rama. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 91:7, however, argues in favor of the view of the other <i>Rishonim</i>.</i><br>If cold [meat] fell into cold [milk or the opposite], one must wash the piece of meat thoroughly.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Since they are both cold, there is no suspicion that one will be absorbed by the other. Washing the meat is necessary only to remove any traces of milk that might be left.</i> [Afterwards,] it may be eaten.

Afterwards, when one desired to partake of it, he would soak it in water to remove the salt (Rashi, <i>Chullin</i> 112a). The Radbaz states that we are speaking about salting meat in a manner similar to the way it is salted to remove its blood. If less salt than that is used, these laws do not apply.

This is merely a Rabbinic stringency.<br>It must be emphasized that the comparison to cooking is not total. Generally, salting only causes the surface of the substance to become forbidden. If, however, the substance is fatty, the entire substance becomes forbidden (<i>ibid.</i>:6).</i> If it can be eaten in its present state like <i>kutach</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">A mixture of milk, breadcrumbs, salt, and spices, commonly served as a dip in Babylon.</i> it is not considered as if it is boiling.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">All that is necessary is to wash the meat and/or cheese thoroughly.</i>

If it was roasted, one should remove its surface.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if this is speaking about a roasted fowl that is hot, or even one that is not hot. According to the latter opinion, it will still absorb some milk because it has become soft and permeable. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 91:7) quotes the first view while the <i>Tur</i>and the Rama mention the second.</i> If it has portions where it is open<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., instead of being a solid surface, the surface of the meat cracks open in several places.</i> or it is spiced and it falls into milk or <i>kutach</i>, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Because the cracks in its surface or the spices will cause it to absorb the milk to a greater extent than it would otherwise. This clause appears also to be referring to meat that has been roasted. There are, however, opinions that interpret it as referring to raw meat. See <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 91:21.</i>
It is forbidden to serve fowl<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, this applies to meat (see <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).</i> together with milk on the table upon which one is eating.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">They may, however, be placed together on a serving table (<i>Chullin</i> 104b).</i> This is a decree [enacted] because habit [might lead] to sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Since both substances are permitted and they are served together, one might accidentally partake of them together.<br>Implied is that if substances are forbidden and one would not ordinarily partake of them, there is no difficulty in having them served on the table at which one is eating. See <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 88:2.</i> We fear that one will eat one with the other. [This applies] even though fowl with milk is forbidden only because of Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 88:2) which explains that if a distinction is made, e.g., the milk is placed on one type of placemat and the meat on another, there is no prohibition.</i>
When two guests who are not familiar with each other are eating at the same table, one may eat the meat of an animal and one may eat cheese. [The rationale is] that they are not well-acquainted with each other to the extent that they will eat together.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Thus there is little likelihood that they will share their food together.</i>
We do not knead a loaf with milk. If one kneaded it [with milk], the loaf is forbidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Even to be eaten alone [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 97:1)]. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, however, grants license if only a small amount of bread was prepared in this manner and thus it can be eaten at one time.</i> because habit [might lead] to sin, lest he eat it together with meat. We do not dab an oven with animal fat.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the fat is kosher.</i> If in fact one dabbed an oven [with fat], any loaf is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">We fear that the fat from the oven became absorbed in the bread, causing it to become <i>fleishig</i>.</i> until one fires the oven,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Firing the oven to the point that it becomes red-hot will burn away all traces of the fat.</i> lest one eat milk with [that loaf]. If one altered the appearance of the bread so that it will be evident that one should not eat meat or milk with it, it is permitted.
When a loaf has been baked together with roasted meat, or fish were roasted together with meat,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Even if they did not touch each other. Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 116) and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 95:3) which mention that there is a prohibition against eating fish roasted with meat because it could cause a health problem.</i> it is forbidden to eat them together with milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">For the vapors from the meat become absorbed in the bread or in the fish. In Chapter 15, Halachah 32, the Rambam rules that vapors do not cause an object to become forbidden. There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two rulings, for here we are speaking about a small oven [Radbaz,<i> Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 97:3). Even though, after the fact, kosher meat roasted together with non-kosher meat in a small oven is permitted, here one is not deeming the bread or fish forbidden, one is merely prohibiting that it be eaten with milk (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 97:4).</i> When meat was eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Or cooked [Radbaz, <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 95:1)]. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> adds that this ruling applies only when the dish was thoroughly washed and no trace of meat remains.</i> in a dish and then fish were cooked in it, it is permitted to eat those fish together with <i>kutach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the <i>kutach</i> contains milk. The rationale is that although the flavor of the meat was imparted to the dish and from the dish, it was imparted to the fish. Nevertheless, since it went through these two intermediate stages, it is not considered significant and does not cause the fish to be considered <i>fleishig</i>. The Rabbis referred to this concept as <i>nat bar nat - notain taam bar notain tam</i> ("imparting merely flavor a second time").<br>It must be emphasized that <i>nat bar nat</i> is permitted only with regard to a mixture of milk and meat. The rationale is that both milk and meat are permitted, a prohibition only exists when they are mixed together and if one of them has been weakened to the extent that it is <i>nat bar nat</i>, it is not considered significant. When, however, an entity is inherently forbidden, e.g., non-kosher meat, when its flavor becomes absorbed into a dish, that dish becomes forbidden and it may not be used again for hot food (Radbaz).</i>
When a knife was used to cut roasted meat<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording implies that the meat was hot (Radbaz). This ruling applies also to hot cooked meat (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). There are opinions that maintain that this ruling also applies when the meat was cold (Radbaz).</i> and then was used to cut radish or other sharp foods, it is forbidden to eat them together with<i> kutach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Chullin</i> 111b, states that the rationale is that it is likely that there will be a small amount of fat left on the knife. Thus when the knife is used to cut the sharp food, its sharpness will cause that the flavor of the fat will be imparted to it. According to this view, if the knife was cleaned or used to cut another substance first, it does not cause the radish to be forbidden [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 96:5); note also the dissenting view of the Rama]. (This opinion speaks of fat being left on the knife, for if there was no fat there, seemingly, this instance would resemble the concept of <i>nat bar nat</i> mentioned in the previous halachah.)<br>There are, however, other opinions (<i>Tosafot, Sefer HaTerumot</i>) which maintain that this ruling would apply even if the knife was clean. The rationale is the pungency of the food and the pressure of the knife cause it to absorb more than an ordinary instance of <i>nat bar nat</i>.<br>From the Rambam's wording, it appears that the entire radish is forbidden. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 96:1), however, rules that it is sufficient to remove a piece a fingerbreadth in thickness. The Rama, however, mentions the Rambam's view.</i> If, however, one cut meat [with a knife] and afterwards cut zucchini or watermelon,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., substances that are not pungent and soft and contain moisture. If one cuts a vegetable that is not soft and moist, it is sufficient to wash it [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 96:5)].</i> one should scrape away the place where the cut was made and the remainder may be eaten with milk.
We do not place a jar of salt near a jar of <i>kutach</i>, because it will draw out its flavor.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and the Radbaz note that the Rambam apparently had a slightly different version of <i>Chullin</i> 112a, the source for this halachah, than that found in the standard printed texts of the Talmud. According to the standard version, the rationale is that we fear that some drops of <i>kutach </i>will fall into the salt. The Radbaz adds that according to the Rambam, the prohibition applies only with regard to earthenware jugs. If they are made from metal, the material will be too dense to allow for the flavor to be drawn out.</i> Thus one will cook meat with this salt that has the flavor of milk. One may, however, place a jar of vinegar near a jar of <i>kutach</i>, because the vinegar will not draw out its flavor.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">According to the other rationale, the <i>kutach</i> will remain a distinct entity if it falls into the salt, but it will become mixed with the vinegar and nullified if it falls into it (Radbaz; <i>Turei Zahav</i> 95:16).</i>
When a person eats cheese or milk first, it is permitted for him to eat meat directly afterwards. He must, however, wash his hands<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 89:2) states that if one sees that his hands are clean, it is not necessary to wash them.</i> and clean his mouth between the cheese and the meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama quotes a view that requires one to wait six hours after eating hard cheese. It is, however, questionable if this would be required for most hard cheese commercially produced today.</i><br>With what should he clean his mouth? With bread or with fruit that [require him] to chew and then swallow or spit them out.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that one should also wash his mouth.</i> One may clean his mouth with all substances with the exception of dates, flour, and vegetables, because they do not clean effectively.
When does the above apply? With regard to the meat of a domesticated animal or a wild beast.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The requirement of this stringency for the meat of a domesticated animal is understandable, for the prohibition is of Scriptural origin. Nevertheless, according to the standard text of Halachah 4, the prohibition against a mixture of milk and the meat of a wild beast is also Rabbinic in origin. What then is the difference between the meat of a wild beast and that of a fowl? The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, explains that the meat of a domesticated animal resembles the meat of a wild beast. Hence it was necessary for the Rabbis to forbid it. Alternatively, Rabbenu Tam explains that the meat of a wild beast will stick to a person's mouth and hands more than the meat of a fowl.</i> If, however, one [desires to] eat the meat of a fowl after eating cheese or milk, it is not necessary for him to clean his mouth or wash his hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Since only a Rabbinic prohibition is involved, our Sages did not enforce any further stringency.</i>
When a person ate meat first - whether the meat of an animal or the meat of a fowl - he should not partake of milk afterwards unless he waits the time for another meal, approximately six hours.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">This is the view stated in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 89:1) and in the Rama's conclusion, although the Rama does mention that there are some more lenient views.</i> This stringency is required because meat that becomes stuck between teeth and is not removed by cleaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 89) gives a different rationale: that because meat is fatty, its taste persists for a long time.</i>

Chapter 10

All the prohibitions we mentioned involve living beings. There are also other Scriptural prohibitions that involve the produce of the earth. They include:<i> chadash, kilai hakerem, tevel,</i> and <i>orlah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam proceeds to define each of these terms in the subsequent halachot. The prohibitions the Rambam mentions in this chapter apply universally. There are other prohibitions involving the consumption of agricultural products that apply with regard to non-priests, e.g., <i>terumah</i>, as explained in <i>Sefer Zeraim</i> and others involving the sacrifices as explained in <i>Sefer HaAvodah</i> (Radbaz).</i>
What is meant by <i>chadash</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>chadash</i> literally means "new." It refers to new grain, i.e., grain that is harvested before the sixteenth of Nisan, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> It is forbidden to partake of any of the five species of grain<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These five species are commonly identified as wheat, barley, rye, oats, and spelt. As mentioned in the notes to <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:1, there is some discussion whether these are in fact the species of which the Talmud and the Rambam speak.</i> alone<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., other species commonly identified as grain, e.g., corn, rice, and millet, are not included in this ban.</i> before the<i> omer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A measure of barley that is offered on the sixteenth of Nisan, as explained in Leviticus 23:9-15; <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i>, ch. 7.</i> is offered on the sixteenth of Nisan, as [Leviticus 23:14] states: "You may not partake of bread, roasted kernels, or fresh kernels."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandments 189-191) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvot 303-305) include these prohibitions among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. The Radbaz states that the Rambam mentions <i>chadash</i> before the other prohibitions, because it occurs most frequently, recurring every year.</i><br>Anyone who partakes of an olive-sized portion of fresh grain before the offering of the <i>omer</i> is liable for lashes. [This applies] in every place and at all times, whether in <i>Eretz [Yisrael</i>] or in the Diaspora,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In the Diaspora, where crops of grain are sometimes planted after Pesach, this prohibition could present a problem. For all grain planted after Pesach, will not be permitted until the following year. In resolution, the Rama writes that unless we know otherwise, all grain is permitted after Pesach, based on the concept of <i>sefek-sefekah</i> - multiple doubt. It is possible it is from the previous year's crop. Even if it is from this year's crop, perhaps it took root before Pesach and is thus permitted.<br>The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> in his gloss to the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 293) elaborates on the concept that the prohibition against <i>chadash</i> applies only to grain belonging to a Jew. Grain belonging to a non-Jew is not bound by this prohibition. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 293:2 differs and maintains that it applies also to grain grown by a gentile. Most of the authorities respect the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> for his attempt to absolve most of the Jewish people from the prohibition (since by and large, the grain available in the Diaspora is grown by non-Jews) but accept the logic of the <i>Turei Zahav</i>. In practice, however, it is customary to rely on the leniency of the Rama.</i> whether at the time of the Temple or when the Temple is no longer standing.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prohibition is not dependent on the offering of the <i>omer</i>, but instead applies even when no sacrifices are offered.</i><br>[The only difference in observance is that] while the Temple is standing, once the <i>omer</i> has been offered, it is permitted [to partake of] new grain in Jerusalem. Distant places<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., places that will not be able to hear a report when the <i>omer</i> was actually offered before noon because they are far removed from Jerusalem.</i> are permitted [to partake of new grain] after midday. For the court will not be indolent with regard to [the offering of <i>omer</i>] beyond midday.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., by midday, one can be certain that the <i>omer</i> had been sacrificed.</i> [Now] when the Temple is no longer standing, the entire day is forbidden according to Scriptural Law. In the present age, in the places where the festivals are observed for two days,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i>, ch. 5, which explains that in places where messengers from Jerusalem would not inform the Jewish community when the new month had been sanctified, the festivals are observed for two days, for perhaps the day considered as the fifteenth of Nisan was really the fourteenth.</i> <i>chadash</i> is forbidden on the entire day of the seventeenth of Nisan until the evening according to Rabbinic Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since the observance of the second day was instituted because there was a doubt concerning the day on which the festival should be observed, our Sages ordained that the prohibition concerning <i>chadash</i> should be observed by Rabbinical decree until the conclusion of the seventeenth so as not to minimize the importance of the festival. Even though there is no longer any doubt concerning the day on which the festival should be observed, we heed this prohibition to maintain our Sages' original decree (Radbaz).</i>
When a person partakes of an olive-sized portion of bread from each of roasted kernels, or fresh kernels [from <i>chadash</i>], he is liable for three sets of lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Provided he is given a separate warning for each one (Radbaz).</i> as [implied by the verse]: "You may not partake of bread, roasted kernels, or fresh kernels." According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that all three involve separate prohibitions.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">All three are mentioned in one verse. Thus one might think that we are speaking of a prohibition of a general nature and we follow the principle (see <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3) that lashes are not given for a prohibition of a general nature. Nevertheless, <i>Keritot</i> 5a explains why this instance is an exception.</i>
Whenever grain took root before the offering of the <i>omer</i>, it is permitted to be eaten after the offering of the <i>omer</i> despite the fact that it did not reach maturity until after that offering. Grain that took root after the offering of the <i>omer</i> is forbidden until the offering of that sacrifice the following year even though it was planted before that offering was brought. This law applies in every place<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even in places that follow a different agricultural cycle than <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> and in every era according to Scriptural Law.
[There is an unresolved halachic difficulty in the following situations:] Grain took root after the <i>omer</i>. One harvested it and sowed this wheat in the ground. Afterwards, the <i>omer</i> of the following year was offered, while these kernels of wheat were still in the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And had not sprouted (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 293:4).</i> There is a doubt whether [the offering of] the <i>omer</i> caused [these kernels] to be permitted as if they had been stored in a jar or it did not cause them to be permitted, because they have been nullified in the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">And thus they would not be permitted until the following year.</i> Therefore if a person collected them and partook of them, he is not liable for lashes, but [instead] is given stripes for rebellious conduct.<br>Similarly, when a stalk reached a third of its growth before the offering of the<i> omer</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Thus had one left it in the ground, it would have been permitted.</i> one uprooted it and then replanted it after the offering of the <i>omer, </i>and it increased in size. There is a doubt whether it is forbidden because of the increase in size until the offering of the <i>omer</i> the following year or it is not forbidden because it took root before the offering of the <i>omer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 293:5) rules that such grain is forbidden because of the doubt.</i>
What is meant by <i>kilai hakerem</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term literally means "mixed species in a vineyard."</i> Sowing a species of grain or a type of vegetable together with a vine.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements have attracted the attention of the commentaries, for they represent a contradiction to his statements in <i>Hilchot Kelayim</i> 8:1: "One is not liable for sowing <i>kilai hakerem</i> unless he sows wheat, barley, and grape seeds together." The Radbaz explains that the laws governing sowing mixed species are different than those regarding partaking of them.</i> [This applies] whether they were sown by a Jew or a non-Jew,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For as above, the prohibition against sowing mixed species and partaking of them are distinct.</i> whether they grew on their own, or whether one planted a vine among vegetables, we are prohibited against partaking and benefiting from both of them, as [Deuteronomy 22:9] states: "Lest the fullness of the seed which you sowed and the produce of the vineyard become hallowed."<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 193) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 549) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> ["Becom[ing] hallowed"] means being set apart and forbidden.
One who eats<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah does not specifically mention that it is forbidden to partake of the mixed species. Nevertheless, it states that it is forbidden to derive benefit from them. There is no greater derivation of benefit than eating (Radbaz). From the Rambam's wording, one would surmise that one is not liable for lashes from merely benefiting from <i>kilai hakerem</i>.</i> an olive-sized portion from <i>kilai hakerem</i>, whether from the vegetables or from the grapes is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law. The two can be combined to reach this measure.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when one eats some of the grapes and some of the vegetables, if the combined volume is the size of an olive, he is liable.</i>
When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Liability for lashes.</i> apply? When they were sown in <i>Eretz Yisrael.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i> 3:10), the Rambam writes that this concept is derived from Deuteronomy 22:9: "Do not sow <i>kilayom</i> in your vineyard." For the only vineyard that can truly be considered as "yours," i.e., belonging to a Jew, is one in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>The <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> writes that in the present era, when the observance of the agricultural laws in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is only a matter of Rabbinic Law (see <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:26), the prohibition against <i>kilai hakerem</i> is also of Rabbinic origin.</i> </i>In the Diaspora, by contrast, <i>kilai hakerem</i> are forbidden by Rabbinic decree.<br>In <i>Hilchot Kelayim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">One of the <i>Halachot</i> in <i>Sefer Zeraim</i>.</i> it will be explained which species are forbidden as <i>kilai hakerem</i> and which are not forbidden, how they become forbidden, when they become forbidden, in which situations, produce causes vines to become "hallowed," and when they do not cause them to become "hallowed."
What is meant by <i>orlah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The term literally means "covered." Thus the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 4:4) speaks of "something which covers (<i>oral</i>) its fruit." For that reason, a foreskin is described as an<i> orlah</i>, because it covers the male organ. Here also this fruit is "covered" by a forbidden quality.</i> Whenever anyone plants<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., replants an existing seedling or plants a seed and grows the tree from the outset (Radbaz).</i> a fruit tree, it is forbidden to partake of or benefit from all of the fruit the tree produces for three years after being planted, as [Leviticus 19:23] states: "For three years, they shall be closed off for you, they may not be eaten."<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 192) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 246) include this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> Whoever eats an olive-sized portion of such fruit is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law.
When does this apply? When one plants in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, as [the above] verse states: "When you enter the land...." With regard to the prohibition against <i>orlah </i>in the Diaspora, it is a <i>halachah</i> transmitted to Moses at Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an element of the Oral Tradition that has no explicit source in the Written Law.</i> that fruit that is definitely <i>orlah</i> is forbidden. If there is a doubt regarding the matter, it is permitted. In <i>Hilchot Ma'aaser Sheni</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">One of the <i>Halachot</i> in <i>Sefer Zeraim</i>.</i> it will be explained which [growths] are forbidden as <i>orlah</i> and which are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., which type of planting or replanting incurs the prohibition against <i>orlah</i> and which does not.</i>
When there is a doubt whether produce is <i>orlah</i> or <i>kilai hakerem</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">A Scriptural prohibition is involved. Hence we follow the principle: Whenever a Scriptural prohibition is involved, we rule stringently.</i> In Syria, i.e., the lands that David conquered,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:3, King David conquered parts of Syria before he completed the conquest of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Hence, these lands were not considered as part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> proper. Nevertheless, certain laws concerning the produce of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> were applied there by Rabbinic decree.</i> it is permitted.<br>What is implied? If there was a vineyard [containing] <i>orlah</i> and grapes were being sold outside it, or there were vegetables sown inside it<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Thus violating the prohibition against <i>kilai hakerem</i>.</i> and vegetables were being sold outside it, [in which instance,] there is a doubt whether [the grapes or the vegetables] came from it or from another place, in Syria, they are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., permission is granted even in an instance were it is highly likely that the produce is prohibited.</i> In the Diaspora, even if one sees grapes being taken out from a vineyard that is <i>orlah</i> or vegetables being taken out from a vineyard, one may purchase them provided one does not actually see <i>orlah</i> being reaped or the vegetables being harvested [from the vineyard].
When there is a doubt whether a vineyard [contains] <i>orlah</i> or <i>kilai hakerem</i>, in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is forbidden. In Syria, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one may purchase the produce even if one is certain it comes from the vineyard in question. Indeed, one may even pick the produce from that vineyard by oneself (Radbaz; <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 10:11).</i> Needless to say, that ruling prevails in the Diaspora.
It is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Bava Batra</i> 24a. Others interpret that passage as stating that we are even permitted to partake of the wine. This is the view quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 294:11).<br><i>Tosafot</i> questions: Why isn't the wine forbidden as <i>yayin nesech</i>, wine touched by a gentile? They reply that we assume that the thieves were Jewish. Thus if there is reason to think that the thieves are gentile, the wine is forbidden (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 294:22).</i> to drink a jug of wine that is found hidden in an orchard [whose produce is]<i> orlah</i>. It is permitted to benefit from it. [The rationale is] that a thief will not steal from a place and hide [what he stole] there. Grapes that are hidden there are forbidden, lest they have been harvested from there and stored away there.
[The following laws apply when] a gentile and a Jew are partners in planting [an orchard]. If at the beginning of the partnership, they agreed that the gentile would benefit from the produce during the years of <i>orlah</i> and the Jew would benefit from it for three years when the produce is permitted afterwards, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the gentile takes care of the orchard in the <i>orlah</i> years, and the Jew in the subsequent years. He is not considered as benefiting from the produce that is <i>orlah</i>, because it never belonged to him.</i> If they did not make such an agreement at the outset, it is forbidden [to make one afterwards].<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For the crops that are <i>orlah</i> are considered to have become the Jew's property and he is bartering them. Rashi and Rabbenu Asher (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 22a) differ and permit such an arrangement to be made. They explain that although if such an arrangement is not made at the outset, it is forbidden to make it with regard to the Sabbath, different rules apply here. On the Sabbath, it is forbidden for the gentile to perform work on behalf of the Jew. In this instance, no such prohibition exists (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 294:28).

The laws of <i>neta reva'i</i> are not dependent on the existence of the Temple. Even if the Temple is not standing, this mitzvah applies. Nevertheless, according to Scriptural Law, they apply only when the sanctity of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is intact. And according to Scriptural Law, that sanctity was nullified after the conquest of the land by the Assyrians and Babylonians. According to Rabbinic Law, however, these laws do apply in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in the present age.</i> Some of the <i>Geonim</i> ruled that <i>kerem reva'i</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The harvest of a vineyard must be redeemed, but not that of any other type of tree.</i> alone must be redeemed in the Diaspora before it is permitted to be eaten.

The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama quote the opinion of the <i>Geonim</i> who maintain that these laws apply with regard to a vineyard, but not with regard to any other types of produce.</i>
In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is forbidden to eat any of the produce of the fourth year<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz emphasizes that even if the fourth year passes, fruit which grew during that year is forbidden in the fifth year until it is redeemed. This is also included as one of the 613 mitzvot. The Rambam, however, lists that mitzvah in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i>.</i> until it is redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the present era. See the following note.</i> In <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i>, we will explain the laws governing the redemption [of the produce], how it should be eaten, and when we begin calculating the growth of a tree with regard to <i>orlah</i> and [<i>netah] reva'i</i>.
How is produce which is <i>neta reva'i</i> redeemed in the present age?<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i>, the Rambam explains that in the era of the Temple, the produce would be taken to be eaten in Jerusalem in a state of ritual purity (or redeemed for its value and that money taken to Jerusalem to be used to purchase food to be eaten there in a state of ritual purity). Since that is not possible in the present era, different laws apply.</i> After [the produce] is collected, one recites the blessing: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the earth, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to redeem <i>neta reva'i</i>. Afterwards, one redeems the entire crop even with one <i>p'rutah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">A copper coin of minimal value. In the era of the Temple, it was necessary to redeem the produce for its value and add a fifth (<i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:1,9). In the present era, since there is no opportunity to use the money as required, a <i>p'rutah</i> is sufficient for one's entire harvest (<i>Arachin</i> 29a).</i> This <i>p'rutah</i> is then cast into the Dead Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a place where no one will benefit from it. In <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:2, the Rambam states that the <i>p'rutah</i> should be cast into the Mediterranean Sea. At times, the term <i>Yam HaMelech</i> which is commonly translated as the Dead Sea is used to refer to the Mediterranean. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 294:6) mentions the Mediterranean. It also states that one may grind the coin into dust.</i><br>Alternatively, one may transfer the holiness to other produce that is worth a <i>p'rutah</i> by saying:<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Seemingly, the wording of the blessing should also be altered as indicated by <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:3.</i> "The holiness of all of this produce is transferred to this wheat," "...to this barley," or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This is also a leniency granted in the present age. In the era of the Temple, at the outset, one should not transfer the holiness from one species of produce to another (<i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:2).</i> Afterwards, one burns the [latter quantity of produce] so that they will not cause difficulty to others.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">These kernels of grain must also be eaten in Jerusalem in a state of ritual purity. Since this is impossible, they should be destroyed, lest another person transgress by eating them elsewhere.</i> He may then partake of all the produce [he harvested].
Some of the <i>Geonim</i> ruled that even though one redeemed the produce of the fourth year or transferred its holiness, it is forbidden to partake of it until the entrance of the fifth year. This ruling has no foundation. It appears to me that it is in error. [Although Leviticus 19:25] states: "And in the fifth year, you shall partake of its produce," the intent of the verse is that in the fifth year you will partake of its produce without redeeming it like any ordinary produce in the world. One should not heed the above ruling.
What is meant by <i>tevel</i>? Any produce from which one is obligated to separate <i>terumah</i> and tithes is called <i>tevel</i> before one separates these portions.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Before produce may be eaten, a person must separate <i>bikkurim</i> (the first fruits), <i>terumah gedolah</i> (a small portion - 1/40 to 1/60 of the produce) which is given to the priests, <i>ma'aser</i> (tithes, which is given to the Levites), and <i>ma'aser sheni</i> (the second tithe, which is eaten in a state of purity in Jerusalem) or <i>ma'aser oni</i> (the tithe given to the poor).

When, however, one partakes of food from which <i>terumah gedolah </i>and <i>terumat ma'aser</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumat Ma'aser</i> should be separated after the tithes are separated.

That term refers to <i>terumah</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, notes that the second tithe is also referred to as "a sacrament." The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, however, offers a resolution.</i>
The warning against partaking of <i>tevel</i> from which tithes were not separated is included in [Deuteronomy 12:17 which] states: "You may not eat the tithes of grain... in your gates."<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Although that prohibition forbids eating the second tithe outside of Jerusalem, it also has this intent.</i><br>In <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> and <i>Hilchot Ma'aserot</i>, it will be explained which produce is obligated to have <i>terumah</i> and the tithes [separated from it] and which is not, when does the obligation stem from Scriptural Law and when is it Rabbinic. When a person partakes of an olive-sized portion of produce that is <i>tevel</i> according to Rabbinic Law<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., produce that grows in a flower pot without a hole on the bottom.</i> or <i>kilai hakerem</i> or <i>orlah</i> from the Diaspora,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 8 and 10.</i> he is liable for stripes for rebellious conduct.
The juices that come from produce that is <i>tevel, chadash,</i> consecrated to the Temple, growths of the Sabbatical year, <i>kilayim</i>, and <i>orlah</i> are forbidden as they are. One is not, however, liable for lashes for partaking of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (in his gloss to Chapter 8, Halachah 16) states that this is not the ordinary way which one benefits from such produce. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that other juices, in contrast to wine and oil, are not considered to have the substance of the fruit.</i> Exceptions are wine and oil that are <i>orlah</i> and wine that is <i>kilai hakerem</i>. One is liable for lashes for them just as one is liable for lashes for the olives and grapes,
There are other prohibitions involving foods applicable to consecrated entities. They are all of Scriptural origin, e.g., there are prohibitions against partaking of <i>terumot</i>, the first fruits, <i>challah,</i> and the second tithe. And there are prohibitions involving sacrifices consecrated [to be offered] on the altar, e.g., <i>piggul</i>, sacrificial meat that remains past its time, and sacrifices that have become impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 18 of <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMekedashim</i> for a definition of these prohibitions.</i> All of these [prohibitions] will be explained in the appropriate place.
The measure for which one is liable - whether for lashes or for <i>kerait</i> is an olive-sized portion.

Chapter 11

When wine has been poured as a libation to a false divinity,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 3:3, pouring a libation and sacrificing are among the four acts of service for which one is liable to any false deity, even if this is not its mode of service.</i> it is forbidden to benefit from it. A person who drinks even the smallest quantity<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachah.</i> of [such wine] is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law. Similarly, anyone who partakes of the smallest quantity of something offered to a false deity, e.g., meat or fruit, even water or salt, is worthy of lashes, as [implied by Deuteronomy 32:38]: "The fat of whose offerings they would eat; they would drink the wine of their libations. Let them stand."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 194) includes this prohibition among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. According to the Rambam, it is actually the last of the mitzvot which the Torah mentions.<br>Although the verse does not specifically mention a prohibition, the Rambam derives the prohibition as follows: As stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 7:2, we are forbidden to derive benefit from anything offered to a false deity. Since the prooftext quoted establishes an equation between a libation and an offering, we conclude that just as an offering is forbidden by a negative commandment; so, too, there is a negative commandment involving a libation (see <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 29b).<br>The Ramban (in his <i>Hasagot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>) and the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 111) maintain that both are included in a single prohibition. They should not be counted as separate negative commandments. They all agree, however, that the prohibition against such wine is Scriptural in origin. As the Rambam explains in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, there are statements of our Sages that appear to imply that the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin. Those statements, however, apply to wine handled by gentiles (see Halachah 3) and not to wine that was actually used for a libation.</i>
Wine poured as a libation to a false deity is like a sacrifice offered to it. Since this prohibition stems from [the prohibition against] the worship of false deities, there is no minimum measure involved, as stated with regard to the worship of false deities [<i>ibid.</i> 13:18]: "Let no trace of the condemned [entity] cling to your hand."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is most particularly related to the prohibition against benefiting from the property of a city who were drawn after idol worship (<i>ir hanidachat</i>). Nevertheless, since all false deities can be considered as "condemned," the verse applies to them as well (<i>Megillat Esther, Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, negative commandment 25). The expression "any trace" implies even the slightest amount of benefit is prohibited.</i>
When we do not know whether wine belonging to a gentile was used for a libation or not, it is called "ordinary [gentile] wine." It is forbidden to benefit from it, as it is forbidden to benefit from wine used as a libation. [This matter] is a Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">We find an allusion to this decree in Scripture itself for Daniel 1:8 speaks of how Daniel refrained from drinking the king's wine. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 36b states that the decree against drinking wine handled by gentiles was instituted lest this lead to familiarity and ultimately, to intermarriage. From the Rambam's wording in the following halachah, however, it would appear that the prohibition was instituted as a safeguard against benefiting from idolatry (<i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>; see also Halachah 7 and notes).</i> When a person drinks a <i>revi'it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">One fourth of a <i>log</i>, 86 cc.

It is forbidden [to benefit from] any wine that a gentile touches;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12, Halachot 1-2, which define what is meant by a gentile touching wine. As implied by the contrast to the following halachah, for it to be forbidden to benefit from the wine, the gentile must touch it intentionally. Similarly, he must know that it is wine (Radbaz).</i> for perhaps he poured it as a libation. For the thought of a gentile is focused on the worship of false deities.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore even if there is no false deity present, it is possible that the gentile intended to use it as a libation. See Halachah 7 and notes which discuss which gentiles we are referring to.</i> From this, we learn that it is forbidden to benefit [even from] wine belonging to a Jew which was touched by a gentile; it is governed by the laws that apply to ordinary gentile wine.
When a gentile touches wine unintentionally<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12, Halachah 5.</i> and similarly, when a gentile child<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Here the term child is not defined chronologically, but in terms of his relation to idolatry.

In the first instance, he did not intend to touch the wine and in the second, the child does not know about idolatrous worship. Nevertheless, the wine is still forbidden as a safeguard. See Chapter 12, Halachah 5. See also the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:24) who states that in the present era, most gentiles are not idolaters. Even so, if they touch wine unintentionally, although there are authorities who say there is room for leniency, the prevailing custom is to be stringent unless a significant loss is involved. See <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 124:71.</i> but it is permitted to benefit from it.<br>When one purchases servants from a gentile and they were circumcised and immersed [in the <i>mikveh</i>] immediately,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Thus reaching the intermediate stage of Jewish servants, as <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 12:11 states, they "have departed from the category of gentiles, but have yet to enter the category of Jews."</i> they no longer pour libations to false deities.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Their "conversion" to Judaism will prevent them from offering such a libation. See the <i>Tur</i> who also mentions the opinion of Rabbenu Chananel who maintains that a gentile servant causes wine to be forbidden for twelve months.<br>The <i>Tur</i> clarifies that the debate concerns only a servant, because his acceptance of Judaism is forced. All agree that no such strictures apply to a convert who willingly accepts Judaism.</i> It is permitted to drink wine which they touch even though they have yet to conduct themselves according to the Jewish faith and they still speak of idolatry.
[With regard to] the children of gentile maidservants that were born in a Jewish domain<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">If they were not born in a Jewish domain, the circumcision alone is of no consequence and even minors cause wine to become forbidden to drink (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and circumcised, but were not immersed yet:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">If they were not immersed yet, even young children cause wine they touch to become forbidden to drink (the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> interpretation of the Rambam's opinion).

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that when the entire nation does not worship false deities, then we do not fear that wine will be used as a libation. When, however, that is not the case, a gentile must accept all seven mitzvot for his wine to be permitted.</i> It is forbidden to drink his wine, but it is permitted to benefit from it. The <i>Geonim</i> rule in this manner. With regard to those who worship false deities,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the standard version of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.

It must be emphasized that today, though many gentiles are nominally Christian, their observance is minimal and they have an awareness of monotheism.<br>See also the statements of the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 123:1, 124:24) who quotes opinions that maintain that in the present age, it is not customary for gentiles to pour wine as libations to false deities.

Whenever it is stated that wine is forbidden in this context, if the gentile who causes the wine to be forbidden worships false deities, it is forbidden to benefit from it. If he does not worship false deities, it is merely forbidden to drink it. Whenever we refer to a gentile without any further description, we mean one who worships false deities.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For in the Rambam's age, most gentiles were idolaters.

Only wine that is fit to be offered on the altar is used for libations for false deities.

Will boiling the wine prevent familiarity from arising with gentiles?<br>In resolution, he explains that perhaps since boiled wine is uncommon, our Sages did not apply their decree in such a situation. Even though today, it has become common to drink boiled - i.e., pasteurized wine - our Sages decree has not been expanded.

When there is a hole on the side of a barrel, the stopper slips away from the hole, and a gentile places his finger over the hole so that the wine will not flow out, all of the wine from the top of the barrel until the hole is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">One may not even benefit from it. Since the wine would have flowed out had the gentile not place his finger there, our Sages considered it as if he touched all of that wine.</i> It is, however, permitted to drink the wine beneath the hole.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Because this wine was not affected by the gentile's touch at all. Although this wine is touching the wine that is forbidden, it is not forbidden. The Ra'avad objects to such a ruling, maintaining that the entire barrel should be considered as mixed together. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justify the Rambam's ruling, explaining that had the gentile inserted his finger in the hole and touched the wine, the entire barrel would have been forbidden. Here, however, we are speaking about an instance where the gentile stopped the wine from flowing by placing his finger on the outside. Therefore the wine above the hole is forbidden because it was affected by his power, as stated in the following halachah. This is merely a Rabbinic decree. Hence, the wine below the hole is not forbidden at all. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:23) follow the Ra'avad's view. See also <i>Hilchot Tum'at Ochalin</i> 8:6.</i>
[The following rules apply when] one end of a bent outflow pipe made from metal, glass, or the like is placed in wine and the other end extends out of the barrel. If one sucked on the wine and the wine began flowing out as is always done, and a gentile came and placed his finger at the end of the outflow pipe and prevented the wine from flowing outward, all of the wine in the barrel is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling applies when the opening to the outflow pipe is placed at the bottom of the barrel, so that all the wine would actually have flowed out had the gentile allowed it to. If it was not placed at the bottom of the barrel, the laws mentioned in the previous halachah apply (Radbaz; <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 124:69).</i> [The rationale is that] were it not for his hand, everything [in the barrel] would have flowed out. Thus all the wine is affected by his power.
When a person pours wine into a receptacle containing gentile wine, all of the wine in the upper container is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's wording, it appears that this ruling applies with regard to all gentile wine, even when it was not known to have been used as a libation for a false deity. The Rambam, moreover, appears to forbid benefit from the wine, not only partaking of it. The Ra'avad rules that it is permitted to benefit from the wine, but not to partake of it. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 126) mentions the opinion of Rabbenu Tam which is more lenient, ruling that this stringency does not apply to ordinary gentile wine. He rules that it is even permitted to partake of the wine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 126:1-2) follows the ruling of the Maharam of Rutenburg, who states the Rambam's stringency should be followed only when a small loss is involved. If there is a significant loss involved, we may rely on the perspective of Rabbenu Tam.<br>See also the <i>Tur</i> who mentions a perspective that maintains that the above stringency applies only to wine used as a libation for a false deity, but not to ordinary gentile wine.</i> [The rationale is that] the column of wine being poured connects<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Compare to <i>Hilchot Tumat Ochalin</i> 7:1,5 where this principle is not applied.

Therefore when a person is measuring wine for a gentile into a container in the latter's hands, he should interrupt [the column of wine before it reaches the utensil] or throw the wine so that [the column of wine] being poured will not establish a connection and cause the wine remaining in the upper container to become forbidden.

[The following rules apply with regard to] a container possessed by a Jew that has two "nostrils,"<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., outflow pipes.</i> that emerge from it, like containers that are used to wash hands, and is filled with wine.

When the gentile stops drinking, all the wine that was in the nostril will return to the container and cause all the wine in it to be forbidden. [The rationale is that] the wine [in the nostril] was moved by [the gentile's] power.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For it was his sucking that drew it into the outflow pipe.

When [a Jew] was drinking together with a gentile and he heard the sound of prayer in the synagogue and departed, even the open wine is permitted.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> asks: "If we fear that the gentile touched the wine, it should be forbidden to benefit from it as well. And if not, it should be permitted to drink it." Indeed, he proposes that perhaps the Rambam's intent is that it is permitted to benefit only from the barrels. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 129:19), he follows the Rambam's ruling. Based on his <i>Beis Yosef</i>, it is possible to explain that we are speaking about closed barrels.

Chapter 13

[The following rules apply when a Jew] purchases or rents a building in a courtyard belonging to a gentile and fills it with wine.

When, however, the house belongs to the gentile, the wine is forbidden, even if he did not entrust him with the key.

The Radbaz defends the Rambam's ruling explaining that since the house is rented the owner does not have the right to enter it at will.

[The following laws apply when] a gentile hires a Jew to prepare wine for him in a state of ritual purity<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">We have translated the Rambam's words literally.

(This approach is also mentioned in the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit</i>).</i> the wine is forbidden even though the key and the seal are in the possession of a Jew.

Once the Jew pays the gentile something, the wine is considered his and more lenient rules apply. It is questionable, however, if the Rambam would accept this leniency, for as stated in Chapter 12, Halachah 25, he rules that as long as wine is security for a debt, a gentile creditor will feel free to do with it as he desires.</i> since the Jew cannot remove the wine from the gentile's domain until he pays him the money, the wine belongs to the gentile and it is forbidden unless the guard lives in the courtyard.<br>The guard does not have to sit and guard [the wine] at all times. Instead, he may come in and go out, as explained. [This applies whether the wine is stored] in the domain belonging to the owner of the wine or in a domain belonging to another gentile.
When the pure wine belonging to a gentile was placed in the public domain or in a building that is open to the public domain and there are Jews going back and forth, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since Jews can see whether or not the gentile touches it, he is afraid to do so, lest his investment be ruined. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:11).</i> For it has not entered the gentile's domain.
[When wine is located] in a garbage dump, a window, or under a palm tree even if it does not have fruit, it is as [if it is located in] the public domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Because these places are also in public view and/or acces.</i> When a gentile is located near wine located in such a place, it is not forbidden. A house which is open to such a place is considered as if it as open to the public domain.
[The following rule applies when] there is a courtyard divided by low barriers,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows Rashi's commentary to <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 70a. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 129:16) defines the term as meaning pillars.</i> on one side there is a gentile and on the other, a Jew, there are two roofs, with the Jew's roof located above the gentile's roof, or [the two roofs are located] side by side, but there are dividers separating them. Even though the gentile can reach the Jew's portion, he need not worry about [the gentile pouring] his wine as a libation<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since the gentile would be considered as a thief for overstepping these boundaries, we do not fear that he would do so.</i> or [disqualifying] articles that are ritually pure.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Were a gentile to touch them, they would be disqualified.</i>
It is permitted for a Jew to entrust his wine to a gentile for safekeeping in a closed container, provided it has two distinguishing marks. This is referred to as "a seal within a seal."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that we assume that a gentile will not trouble himself to reseal the container with two seals as the Jew had sealed it. Hence the fact that he found it with the two seals he left, it is a sign that it has not been tampered with.</i><br>What is implied? [A Jew] closed a barrel with a utensil that is not tightly fitting as most people do and then sealed it with clay, it is considered as one seal. If the container is tightly fitting and he applied clay to it from above, it is considered as "a seal within a seal."<br>Similarly, if one tied the opening to a wineskin close, it is considered as one seal. If he turned the opening to the wineskin inside and then tied it close, it is considered as "a seal within a seal." Similarly, any deviation from the ordinary pattern people follow is considered as one seal and applying clay or tying it is a second seal.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">To apply these concepts in contemporary terms: When a bottle of wine is closed with a cork or a bottle-cap, that is one seal. If there is a paper or plastic wrapper around the cork or the cap, that is the second seal.</i>
If [a Jew] entrusted [wine that was closed] with one seal to a gentile for safekeeping, it is forbidden to drink it, but it is permitted to benefit from it provided he designates a [specific] corner for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 31a, some interpret this as speaking about an instance where the corner the gentile grants the Jew is closed off with a seal. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 130:2) writes that there are opinions which rule that after the fact, one seal is sufficient in this situation.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that even if the place is not closed off, since it is designated for the Jew, one seal is sufficient. See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 130:4).</i>
Two seals are not necessary when one deposits boiled wine, beer, wine which is mixed with other substances, e.g., honey or oil,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For in none of these instances do we fear that the gentile will use the beverage for a libation, as stated in Chapter 11, Halachot 9-10.</i> – and similarly, vinegar, cheese, and any substance that is forbidden only according to Rabbinic Law – with a gentile. Instead, one seal is sufficient.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In these instances, we fear that the gentile will exchange another substance, for the substance deposited. One seal is sufficient to dispel these suspicions (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).</i> Nevertheless, two seals are necessary for wine, meat, and pieces of fish that do not have signs and which were entrusted to a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Since the prohibition involved in these instances is Scriptural in origin, we are more stringent.</i>
It appears to me that anywhere in this context that we have stated that our wine is forbidden to be drunk, but it is permitted to benefit from it because of the possibility that a gentile touched it, we are speaking about an instance where the gentile is an idolater. If, however, the prohibition has arisen because of a gentile who is not an idolater, e.g., an Arab,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 11, Halachah 7. That halachah states that when a gentile who is not an idolater touches wine, it is only forbidden to drink it. In this instance, since the gentile did not intend to touch the wine, we are more lenient and do not forbid it at all (Radbaz).<br>As mentioned previously, the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:24) rules that in the present era, none of the gentiles are considered as idolaters and the leniency suggested by the Rambam applies universally. On that basis, he and the subsequent Ashkenazic authorities have suggested several leniencies.</i> who touched our wine unintentionally or tapped the top of a barrel,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12, Halachot 5 and 9.</i> [the wine] is permitted to be drunken. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When, however, one deposits wine in the domain of a resident alien<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A gentile who has made a formal commitment to accept the Seven Universal Laws Commanded to Noah and His Descendants. These include the prohibition against worshipping false divinities.</i> sends wine with him and departs for an extended period, or leaves one's home open in a courtyard that [one shares with] a resident alien, it is forbidden to drink the wine. For it appears to me that the suspicions that a gentile will exchange [wine] and forge [a seal] apply equally to all gentiles. Since the wine enters their domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a place where it can be exchanged without a Jew noticing.</i> it is forbidden at least to drink it.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For we fear that he exchanged it with his own wine and it is forbidden to drink such wine. Although a resident alien also accepted the prohibition against theft, we fear that he - and certainly, other gentiles - will not abide by his commitment (Radbaz).</i>
There are situations where the prohibition against wine poured as a libation does not apply at all, yet our Sages forbade them as a safeguard against libation. They are: a gentile should not mix water into wine in a Jew's possession lest he come to pour wine into water. A gentile should not bring grapes to the winepress lest he come to press them or touch the wine. He should not help a Jew when he pours wine from one container to another lest he leave the wine in the possession of the gentile and the wine [will flow] because of [the gentile's] power. If the gentile assists [the Jew], mixes water [into wine] or brings grapes, [the wine] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For these are merely safeguards. Although Rashi (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 58b) and other <i>Rishonim</i> rule more stringently, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 125:3,6,7) accepts the Rambam's position.</i>
Similarly, it is permitted for a gentile to smell the fragrance of our wine<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Doing so does not arouse a suspicion that perhaps he used it as a libation for his false deity. Smelling is not considered as tasting or drinking.</i> and it is permitted for a Jew to smell the fragrance of a barrel of wine that had been used as a libation.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">It is not included in the prohibition mentioned at the beginning of Ch. 11.</i> There is no prohibition against this, because fragrance is of no consequence since it has no substance.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See the conclusion of Ch. 5 of <i>Hilchot Meilah</i>, where the Rambam delivers a slightly contradictory ruling.</i>
We already explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 8, Halachah 16. See also <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavimn</i> 7:9 and <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 5:2.</i> that whenever it is forbidden to benefit from a substance, if one transgresses and sells it, it is permitted [to make use of] the money with the exception of false deities, their accessories, offerings made to them, and wine poured as a libation to it. Our Sages were stringent with regard to ordinary gentile wine [and ruled that] money given for it is forbidden like money given for wined poured as a libation to a false deity.<br>Accordingly, when a gentile hires a Jew to work with him with wine, his wages are forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For he is deriving benefit from gentile wine.</i>
Similarly, when a person rents a donkey or a boat to transport wine, the payment for them is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the Jew himself does nothing to help transport the gentile wine.</i> If he gave him money, he should bring them to the Dead Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., throw in a place where neither he nor anyone else will benefit from them.</i> If he gave him clothes, utensils, or produce as payment, he should burn it and bury the dust so that he<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Nor others.</i> does not benefit from it.
If a gentile rented a donkey to ride and placed containers of wine on it, the rental fee for the donkey is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For the rental fee was not primarily paid for the sake of the wine (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 133:3). The Radbaz emphasizes that this leniency applies when the donkey was rented primarily for human transport and, by the way, the gentile placed wine upon it. If, however, he rented it primarily to transport packages - and later the owner discovered that wine was included among them - the rental fee is forbidden even if the person also rides on the donkey.</i> If [a gentile] hires a Jew to break barrels of wine used as a libation, his fee is permitted. May he be blessed because he eliminated obscenity.
When a person hires a worker and tells him: "Transport 100 barrels of beer for me for 100 <i>p'rutot</i>," and it is discovered that one of them is [gentile] wine, his entire wage is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">He is being paid for the entire work as a collective entity. Were he not to have transported all the barrels, he would not be paid at all (Rashi, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 65a). Accordingly, the payment for transporting the beer was never distinct from that of the wine. Hence his entire wage is forbidden.<br>The Ra'avad differs and maintains that it is sufficient to destroy the wage paid for the forbidden barrels. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 133:3) follows the Rambam's stringency.</i>
If he told him: "Transport barrels for me at a <i>p'rutah</i> each," and he transported them and barrels of wine were discovered among them, the wage for the barrels of wine is forbidden. The remainder of the wage is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Since the wage was paid for each barrel individually, the wage paid for the barrels of beer is a separate and distinct entity. Hence it is not forbidden. Nevertheless, at the outset, it is forbidden to accept such a job [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>)].</i>
When a gentile sends Jewish craftsmen a barrel of wine as part of their wages, it is permitted for them to tell him: "Give us its worth."<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For the craftsman have not accepted the wine and the employer owes them money.</i> Once it enters their domain, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">For then it is as if they are exchanging the wine for wine.<br>The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 132:3) writes that in the present age, (when gentiles are not actually idolaters,) a worker may return the barrel of wine even though it has entered his domain.</i>
When a gentile owed a Jew a <i>maneh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">One hundred silver <i>zuzim</i>.</i> it is permitted for the gentile to sell a false deity and wine that had been poured as a libation and bring him the money. If, before he sells them, he tells [the Jew]: "Wait until I sell the false deity or libation wine that I own and [then] I will bring you [the money]," if he sells it and brings [the money] to him, [the money] is forbidden. [This applies] even with regard to ordinary gentile wine. [The rationale is that] the Jew desires that [the false deity or the wine] to continue to exist so that he will be able to pay him his debt.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he has benefited from existence of the gentile wine. Hence, it is forbidden.<br>The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 132:7) states that, even if the Jew desires that the false deity continue to exist, leniency can be granted in an instance where the gentile has other resources to pay the debt or alternatively, when the debt is secured by a guarantor. Moreover, if all that is concerned is ordinary gentile wine, in the present age, there is no prohibition for the reason stated above.</i>
Similarly, when a convert and a gentile were partners and they came to divide the resources [of the partnership], the convert may not tell the gentile: "You take the false deity and I will take the money. You take the wine and I will take the produce." [The rationale is that] he desires that [the forbidden entities] continue to exist so that he will be able to receive something in exchange for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Here leniency is not granted, because the convert has a share in the entities belonging to the partnership. Thus he is exchanging money for a false deity.</i><br>When, by contrast, a convert and a gentile inherit the estate of their father who was a gentile, [the convert] may tell [the gentile]: "You take the false deity and I will take the money. You take the wine and I will take the oil." This is a leniency granted with regard to an estate inherited by a convert so that he will not return to his deviant ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., our Sages feared that the convert will be so disturbed about being unable to receive his inheritance, that he will forsake Jewish practice and return to his previous mode of conduct. This is undesirable, because once a person converts, he is a full-fledged Jew. If he conducts himself undesirably, his conduct affects the entire Jewish people.</i> If [the forbidden entities] entered the domain of the convert, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For they have already entered the domain of the convert and are, therefore, forbidden. Hence it is forbidden to exchange them for others, for then one will be deriving benefit.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a Jew sells his wine to a gentile. If he established a price before he measured out [the wine], the money is permitted. [The rationale is that] from the time a price was established, [the gentile] definitely agreed [to the purchase] and when he pulled [the wine] into his domain, he acquired it.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he acquires the wine through the <i>kinyan</i> of <i>meshichah</i> [see <i>Maggid Mishneh, Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 1:14; <i>Turei Zahav</i> 132:4) and the money is considered as a loan which he owes the Jew.<br>The Radbaz questions why the Rambam mentions <i>meshichah</i>, drawing the wine into his own domain. Seemingly, once a price was established and the wine was poured, the gentile acquires it whether or not he performs <i>meshichah</i> immediately. Conversely, if <i>meshichah</i> finalizes the transaction, seemingly as long as a price was set before <i>meshichah</i>, the wine should be permitted<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam is speaking according to the common practice. It was customary to establish a price either before measuring the wine or after <i>meshichah</i>.</i> And it does not become [comparable to] wine offered as a libation until he touches it. Therefore at the time of sale, it was permitted.<br>If he measured it out for him before he established a price, the money is forbidden. [The rationale is that the gentile] did not definitely agree [to the purchase], even though he pulled [the wine] into his domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For he fears that the Jew will ask an exorbitant price (Radbaz). Hence he always keeps the option of negating the sale.</i> Thus at the time he touched [the wine], he had not definitely agreed to the purchase. Hence the wine becomes forbidden because of his touch and it is as if [the Jew] is selling gentile wine.
When does the above apply? When the Jew measured [the wine] into his own containers. If, however, he measured it into the gentile's containers or to a container belonging to a Jew in the gentile's possession, he must take the money,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For the payment of the money formalizes the transfer of the wine (effecting a <i>kinyan</i>), Thus the gentile has paid for the wine before it entered his domain and became forbidden.</i> before measuring out [the wine]. If he measured out [the wine,] but did not take the money, the money is forbidden even though he established a price. As soon as [the wine] enters [the gentile's] container, it is forbidden as ordinary gentile wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">There are several explanations for this ruling. The gentile left some of his wine in the container and thus as the Jew was pouring the new wine in, it became forbidden. Alternatively, the gentile was holding the container and moved it (see Chapter 12, Halachah 3). This is sufficient to cause the wine to become forbidden (Radbaz).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, stating that (as the Rambam himself rules in Chapter 16, Halachah 29) if kosher wine becomes mixed with non-kosher wine, it is forbidden to drink it, but one may benefit from it. Nevertheless, he does not provide a rebuttal to the second explanation given above.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since the wine in the container the gentile is holding becomes forbidden, the wine the Jew is pouring also becomes forbidden, as stated above in Chapter 12, Halachah 12.</i>
When [a Jewish employer] gives a <i>dinar</i> to a gentile storekeeper and tells his gentile employee: "Go, drink, and eat [on my account] from the storekeeper and I will settle the accounts with him," he must show concern lest [the employee] will drink wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since he gave the storekeeper the money in advance, it is as if he paid the storekeeper for what his worker would eat. Thus it is as if the worker is drinking the employer's wine.</i> Thus it will be as if he purchased wine used as a libation and gave it to him.<br>A similar arrangement with regard to the Sabbatical year<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's source (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 58b) mentions both produce from the Sabbatical year and untithed produce, because it is possible that a common person is lax in his observance of both these mitzvot. Apparently, the Rambam also had this intent because he begins by mentioning produce of the Sabbatical year and concludes by mentioning untithed produce.</i> is also forbidden; i.e., one gives a <i>dinar</i> to a Jewish storekeeper who is a common person and tells his Jewish employee: "Go, drink, and eat [on my account] from the storekeeper and I will settle the accounts with him." If the worker eats food that was not tithed, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is forbidden for the employer to do this, because it would be considered as if he personally gave his employee produce from the Sabbatical year or untithed produce.</i>
If, however, he told them: "Eat and drink the worth of this<i> dinar</i>," or "Eat and drink from the storekeeper on my account and I will pay him," this is permitted. Although the Jew becomes liable, his liability is not specifically related [to the foods from which the employees partake].<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he undertakes a financial obligation to the storekeeper, but since he does not pay him the money beforehand, that obligation is not explicitly associated with the food or drink of which the worker partakes.</i> [Therefore,] he need not be concerned, not about wine used as a libation, not about produce of the Sabbatical year, nor about untithed produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 450:6) mentions opinions that are more stringent with regard to an employer taking financial responsibility for the food a gentile will eat on Pesach. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 460:4 explains that with regard to Pesach, there is a greater reason for stringency, for it is almost certain that the gentile will eat <i>chametz</i>. In the situations mentioned in our halachah, by contrast, it is possible that none of the prohibitions will be violated, for the gentile will not want wine, nor the Jewish workers, the untithed or Sabbatical produce.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a [gentile] king distributes his wine among the people and takes money for it, as he desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">A gentile king produced wine from the royal vineyard as a means of financing his nation's expenses. He would obligate each of the person's in his kingdom to buy a standard amount of wine. For a Jew, that represents a problem for the wine is gentile wine. Not only is it forbidden to drink it, it is forbidden to benefit from it. Thus not only may a Jew not partake of such wine, nor may he take it and sell it. He is forbidden even to purchase it from the king.<br>This represents the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 71a. It is quoted by the Rashba and other <i>Rishonim</i>. Rashi, the Ra'avad, and others, however, have different interpretations of the passage. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 132:6) quotes the Rambam's interpretation.</i> A [Jew] may not tell a gentile: "Take 200 <i>zuz</i> and go into the king's storehouse in place of me," so that the gentile will take the wine designated for the Jew and give the money to the king.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that in this way, the gentile is purchasing the wine from the Jew.

When a gentile touches<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This law applies when the gentile intentionally touches the wine.

The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 132:2, however, interprets this wording as implying that even if the gentile caused it to become forbidden inadvertently, the Jew may sell it to him.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 7:4 and commentaries, where a similar concept is discussed.</i> a Jew's wine against [the Jew's] will,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For if the Jew could have stopped the gentile from touching the wine and didn't, he is responsible for the loss (Radbaz).</i> it is permitted to sell that wine to that gentile alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:2) rules that in the present age, when it is not customary for gentiles to use wine as libations, the wine may be sold to any gentile.</i> [The rationale is] since that gentile wished to cause a Jew a loss [by] having his wine forbidden, it is as if he destroyed it or burnt it, in which instance, he would be obligated to pay. Thus the money [the Jew] takes from him is money for the loss and not money for a sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 59b states that in such a situation, he may charge the gentile the full price of the wine.</i>

Chapter 14

The minimum measure for which one is liable for partaking of any of the forbidden foods in the Torah is [the size of] an average olive.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The measure of "the size of an olive" cannot be determined by measuring an average olive today. Instead, this refers to a measure established by our Sages and is the subject of debate by later Rabbinic authorities. The <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) states that the Rambam considers an olive as one-third the size of an egg with its shell (17.3 grams according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> 3:13, 24 grams according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>). <i>Tosafot, Chullin</i> 103a, differs and defines an olive as one-half the size of a shelled egg (25.6 grams according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> 3:12, 36 grams according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>). In practice, with regard to questions of Scriptural Law, the more stringent opinion should be followed. With regard to questions of Rabbinic Law, one may rely on the more lenient view.</i> [This applies] whether for lashes,<i> kerait</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the soul's being cut off. This involves premature death in this world (before the age of 50, <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 28a) and the soul not meriting a portion in the world to come (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1).</i> or death at the hand of heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Premature death before the age of 60 (<i>Mo'ed Kattan, loc. cit.</i>).</i> We already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 1:7.</i> that anyone who is liable for <i>kerait</i> or death at the hand of heaven for [partaking of] forbidden food, should receive lashes.
This measure, as all the other measurements, is a halachah conveyed by Moses from Sinai. It is forbidden by Scriptural Law to eat even the slightest amount of a forbidden substance. Nevertheless, one receives lashes only for an olive-sized portion. If one partakes of any amount less than this measure, he is given stripes for rebellious conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment given for the violation of Rabbinic commandments or Scriptural Laws for which there is no specific punishment outlined.</i>

To explain: For a person to be liable, he must eat not only a specific amount (an olive-sized portion), but he must eat it in a specific time: <i>k'dai achilas p'ras</i>, as explained in Halachah 8.</i> For the liability is for the benefit one's palate receives from a forbidden substance.

[The following rules apply when] a person partakes of a barley-corn or mustard-seed-sized portion of any forbidden food, waits, and then partakes of another mustard-seed-sized portion whether inadvertently or intentionally. If he waited from the beginning to the end the time it takes to eat a portion of bread with relish the size of three eggs<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on <i>Hilchot Tumat Tzara'at</i> 16:6.</i> [or less], everything [he ate] is combined.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This is one of the fundamental concepts with regard to the mitzvot and prohibitions concerning eating. Just as there is a minimum amount, a <i>k'zayit</i> (an olive-sized portion), which one must eat for the mitzvah or prohibition to be fulfilled; so, too, there is a minimum measure of time,<i> k'dei achilat p'ras</i>, in which that amount of food must be eaten. If one takes a longer time to eat the prohibited food, his eating is not significant, like one who eats less than the minimum amount.<br>Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 44a ) offers a different view and maintains that this measure is defined as the time it takes to eat four eggs. <i>Shiurei Torah</i> mentions several different opinions from between four minutes until nine minutes for this figure.</i> He is liable for <i>kerait</i>, lashes, or a sacrifice as if he ate an olive-sized portion at one time. If he waits a longer time from the beginning to the end, [the small portions] are not combined. Since he completed the olive-sized portion only in a longer time than <i>k'dei achilat p'ras</i>, he is not liable even if he did not wait at all, but continued eating mustard-seed-sized portion after mustard-seed-sized portion.

Indeed, the Rambam himself mentions that measure with regard to drinking within the context of the laws of ritual purity (<i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i>.<br>The Radbaz explains the Rambam's ruling here, stating that with regard to the prohibitions against eating, what is important is that one feel significant satisfaction. If he prolongs his drinking longer than that, he will not feel satisfaction from it. See also the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> to <i>Hilchot Shivitat Esor</i> 2:4 which discusses this issue.</i>
One is not liable for partaking of any of the prohibited foods unless one partakes of them in a manner in which one derives satisfaction with the exception of a mixture of meat and milk and mixed species grown in a vineyard. [The rationale is that with regard to these prohibitions, the Torah] does not use the term "eating,"<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">When, however, the Torah uses the term "eating," that implies that one derives satisfaction in the ordinary manner one derives benefit from food (see the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> to Chapter 8, Halachah 16). Only then is one liable. Needless to say, it is forbidden by Rabbinic Law to partake of a forbidden substance even if one does not derive benefit.</i> but instead conveys the prohibition against partaking of them in other terms. [With regard to meat and milk, it uses] the term "cooking" and [with regard to mixed species grown in a vineyard, it uses the term] "become hallowed."<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Chapter 10, Halachah 6, "becom[ing] hallowed" means being "set apart and forbidden."</i> [This implies] that they are forbidden even when one does not derive satisfaction.

When one liquefied fat and swallowed it when it was so hot that his throat was burned from it, he eat raw fat,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Which does not have a pleasant taste.</i> mixed bitter substances like gall or wormwood into wine<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This concept also applies with regard to wine used as a libation, for, Deuteronomy 32:38, the prooftext from which this prohibition is derived, also mentions "eating" [<i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (mitzvah 111)].</i> or into a pot [where meat from] a <i>nevelah</i> [is cooking] and he partook of it while they were bitter,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if the unappetizing element of the food is not dependent on them, but on a foreign substance.</i> or he ate a forbidden food after it became decayed, spoiled, and unfit for human consumption, he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the concept referred to as <i>notein taam lifgam</i>, giving an unfavorable taste. Our Rabbis extend this concept further, explaining that any pot which has not been used for non-kosher food for a day no longer causes the pot to be forbidden according to Scriptural Law, because the forbidden food has already lost its flavor [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 103:5)]. See also Chapter 15, Halachot 28-31.</i> If, by contrast, he mixed a bitter substance into a a pot [where meat and milk are cooking] or into wine from a vineyard where mixed species are growing and partook of it, he is liable.
When a person partakes of one of the forbidden food in a frivolous manner or as one who is acting purposelessly, he is liable.

See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:9, <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 617:2).</i> [of the meat itself]. If her mind does not become settled, we feed her until her mind becomes settled.
Similarly, when a sick person smells food that contains vinegar or the like, [i.e.,] substances that arouse a soul's [desire], he is governed by the same laws that apply to a pregnant woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is sick, his condition is precarious and we are concerned that his craving may place his life in danger.

When a person rips a limb from a living animal which causes the animal to become <i>trefe</i>, he is considered to have transgressed two prohibitions: the prohibition against eating flesh from a living animal and the prohibition against partaking of an animal that is <i>trefe</i>, for both prohibitions take effect at the same time.</i> the latter prohibition forbids additional entities,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This concept is exemplified in this and the following halachah.

Since when the animal became <i>trefe</i>, its entire body became encompassed in the prohibition, that prohibition also encompasses the <i>gid</i> even though it was prohibited beforehand.</i><br>Accordingly, [it is possible] for there to be a person who eats one olive-sized portion of forbidden food and yet, he will be liable for five [sets of] lashes for it, provided he was warned for all five prohibitions that accumulated.<br>What is implied? For example, on Yom Kippur, a person who was ritually impure ate an olive-sized portion of forbidden fat from a consecrated animal that remained after its prescribed time.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Every sacrifice of which we are allowed to partake has a certain time span - a day and a night or two days and a night - in which we are allowed to partake of it.

That additional portion, however, need not involve all these different prohibitions.</i> because he partook of consecrated food while ritually impure, and because he derived benefit from consecrated food, thus [violating the prohibition of] <i>me'ilah</i>.
Why do these prohibitions fall on each other? Because although it was forbidden to partake of the fat of this animal, it was permitted to benefit from it. Once he consecrated it, it became forbidden to benefit from the fat. Since the prohibition to benefit from it was added to it, the prohibition against [benefiting from] consecrated articles became added to it.<br>Although this fat was forbidden to an ordinary person, it was still permitted to be offered to the One on High. When it became <i>notar</i>, since it became forbidden to the One on High, [that] prohibition was added to an ordinary person.<br>This person was permitted to partake of the meat of the animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Before it became <i>notar</i>.</i> although he was forbidden to partake of its fat. When he became impure, since its meat became forbidden an additional prohibition was added to its fat.

Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.

What is meant by its substance? For example, there was enough forbidden fat for there to be an olive-sized portion [of fat] in each portion the size of three eggs from the mixture. If a person eats a portion of beans the size of three eggs, he is liable for lashes for they contain an olive-sized portion of forbidden fat, for [not only] the flavor, [but also] the substance of [the forbidden fat] is present.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam shares the perspective of <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 67b) who maintains that if there is more than an olive-sized portion of fat in a portion of food <i>k'dei achilat p'ras</i> (the size of three eggs), its substance is considered as present even though it is dissolved and not discernable.

Into what quantity [of a permitted substance] must a forbidden substance be mixed for it to be considered nullified because of its tiny proportion?

Thus we learn from this that [the following laws apply] with regard to all of the prohibited substances in the Torah, whether those punishable by lashes or punishable by<i> kerait</i> or substances from which it is forbidden to benefit that become mixed with permitted substances. If the substances are of different types, [the mixture is forbidden] if the flavor is detectable.<br>If the substances are of the same type and thus it is impossible to detect the flavor [of the forbidden substance], we measure [whether there was] 60, 100, or 200 [times the amount of permitted substances].

The rationale given by the Rambam here has its source in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shivi'it</i> 6:3).</i> For that reason, even the slightest mixture of them with a substance of their type is forbidden. If they become mixed with substances of a different type, the matter is dependent on whether their flavor is detectable.

Therefore it may not be used on the holiday. This prohibition is referred to as <i>nolad</i>. Both of these prohibitions are of Rabbinic origin. Halachah 1:21 states that if such an egg becomes mixed with other eggs, they are all forbidden.</i>
With regard to <i>orlah</i>, mixed species grown in a vineyard, fat, blood, and the like, our Sages fixed a measure [that would enable mixtures to be nullified]. Similarly, our Sages fixed a measure with regard to <i>terumot</i>, for there is no way it can be permitted for all people.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a mixture of <i>terumah</i> could be eaten in a permitted manner by a priest. Nevertheless, since there is no way it could be permitted to an ordinary person, our Sages were not stringent (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>Both the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the Radbaz ask: It is possible to have to have <i>terumah </i>permitted by making a statement of regret concerning its separation before a wise man. If so, seemingly, it should be considered as an object that could be eaten in a permitted manner. The Radbaz explains that a wise man who can nullify the separation of <i>terumah</i> may not always be found. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that since this is not the common practice, a substance may not be considered as an object that could be eaten in a permitted manner for this reason.</i>
It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This term indicates a conclusion deduced by the Rambam without an explicit prior Rabbinic source. There are others, including Rav Yitzchak Alfasi and Rav Moshe HaCohen, who differ and maintain that since the mixture could be eaten in a permitted manner, the above stringencies apply. The Ra'avad, however, states that this concept is explicitly stated in the Mishnah. He does not, however, mention which mishnah. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offer different hypotheses as to the Ra'avad's intent and why the Rambam did not accept it.</i> that even there is a factor that will cause a substance to become permitted, if that substance becomes mixed with a substance of a different type and its flavor is not detectable, it is permitted. The fact that there is a factor that will cause the substance to become permitted does not [cause the prohibition to be] more severe than <i>tevel</i>.

(Note the Radbaz who questions how the priests could eat the mixture.) Here, by contrast, we are speaking about pieces of the showbread that are impure.

Why is it necessary to separate [a measure of] <i>terumah</i> and not a measure of <i>orlah</i> or mixed species from a vineyard? Because <i>terumah </i>is the property of the priests. Accordingly, any <i>terumah</i> which the priests are not concerned with, e.g., <i>terumah</i> from [low-grade] figs,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 11:4).</i> carobs, and Edomite barley, need not be separated.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">For the priests will not be concerned about its loss.</i>
Why was the measure doubled for <i>orlah</i> and mixed species grown in a vineyard?

The Radbaz emphasizes that they are compared to <i>terumah</i> and not to other forbidden substances for the root <i>kodesh</i> is used with regard to them.</i><br>Why did [the Sages] choose the figure of 100 for <i>terumot</i>? For<i> terumat ma'aser</i> is one hundredth of the entire crop,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For it is one tenth of a tenth.</i> and yet it causes the entire crop to be "sanctified,"<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., "forbidden."</i> as [Numbers 18:29] states: "its sacred part."<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam continues to explain, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Orlah</i> 2:1) offers a non-literal interpretation of this phrase, understanding it as meaning "the one who sanctifies it."</i> Our Sages said: "An entity which must be separated from it sanctifies it if it returns to it.
The measure for all of the other prohibitions of the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">With this wording, the Rambam also eliminates those prohibitions of Rabbinic origin, which have a smaller measure as stated in the following halachah.</i> e.g., the meat of crawling animals, teeming animals, fat, blood, and the like is sixty times [the original amount].<br>What is implied? When an olive-sized portion of the fat of the kidneys falls into sixty times the size of an olive of the fat from the fat tail, the entire mixture is permitted. If it falls into less than sixty [that amount], the entire mixture is forbidden.

As explained in the notes there, the Ra'avad and the Rashba offer a different rationale for this ruling, explaining that since the meat of the udder is acceptable, we include it in the reckoning of 60. Thus in contrast to other instances where 60 times the amount of the forbidden substance is required, here, we require only 59. According to his view, we cannot extrapolate from this ruling to other Rabbinic prohibitions.</i>
[The following laws apply when] an egg in which a chick is found<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Such an egg is forbidden to be eaten (see Chapter 3, Halachah 8).</i> is cooked together with eggs that are permitted.

See the notes to the following halachah where a rationale cited by other authorities is mentioned.</i> [our Sages] made a distinction and added to its [required] measure.
If, however, the egg of an non-kosher fowl was cooked together with the eggs of kosher fowl, it does not cause them to become forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Here we are talking about eggs that are cooked in their shells. When an egg contains a chick, the chick will impart its flavor to the entire pot. When, by contrast, eggs are cooked in their shells, they do not impart flavor (<i>Chulin</i> 97b). The non-kosher egg must be removed from the mixture. This, however, can sometimes be done, because the appearance of non-kosher eggs may differ from that of kosher eggs (Chapter 3, Halachah 18).<br>The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 86:6) differs and states that if a substantial loss will not be caused, we should be stringent and follow the same ruling with regard to all eggs. If, however, there will be a substantial loss, even he counsels to rely on the more lenient views.</i><br>If [the eggs were opened and] mixed together or the egg of a non-kosher fowl or the egg of a fowl that is <i>trefe</i> become mixed with other eggs,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">For, at times, non-kosher eggs are not distinguishable from kosher eggs (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> the required measure is 60.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the mixture is judged as an ordinary instance in which kosher food becomes mixed with non-kosher food.

The Ramban explains that the reason is that not all eggs are the same size and by adding an extra egg, we make certain that we have the necessary amount. (He uses this rationale to explain the law stated in the previous halachah as well.) The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 86:15 offers a different rationale, stating that an egg itself is considered a creation in its own right.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that there are some who would rule that 60 eggs are not necessary, for there are opinions [see <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 109:1)] that when kosher and non-kosher entities are intermingled in a dry mixture, we rely on Scriptural Law and require only a simple majority of the kosher substances. As obvious from this ruling, the Rambam does not accept this leniency.</i>
What is the source because of which the Sages relied on the measure of 60? For the portion given [to the priest] from the ram brought by a Nazirite,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">When a Nazirite completes the days of his Nazirite vow, he brings several sacrifices. Among them is a ram brought as a peace offering. The foreleg from this offering is given to the priest and may not be eaten by an ordinary Israelite (<i>Chulin</i> 98a; <i>Hilchot Nazirut</i> 8:1-4).</i>i.e., the foreleg, is one sixtieth of the remainder of the ram. It is cooked together with it and does not cause it to be forbidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although this portion which is forbidden to an Israelite is cooked together with the entire ram, the Israelite is permitted to partake of the remainder of the ram. Accordingly, our Sages inferred that a similar ratio may be used when other prohibited substances are cooked with permitted substances.</i> as [Numbers 6:19] states: "And the priest shall take the cooked foreleg from the ram."
[The following rules apply when] two substances of the same type, [one permitted and one forbidden,] and a [third] entity become mixed together, e.g., there was a pot with fat from the fat tail and beans and fat from the kidneys fell into it. The entire [mixture] dissolved and became a single entity. We view the fat from the fat tail and the beans as a single entity and we measure the fat from the kidneys against it. If the ratio was one to sixty, it is permitted. For it is impossible to detect the taste.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Because there is no significant difference between the taste of fat from the fat tail and fat from the kidneys, as indicated by Halachah 4.</i>
The same principle applies when <i>terumot</i> are mixed together [with other substances, some of the same type and some of a different type], their measure is 100. And the measure of mixed species from a vineyard and <i>orlah</i> is 200.
When we calculate the measure of permitted substances with regard to all prohibitions, whether the measure is 60, 100, or 200, we include the soup, the spices, everything that is in the pot, and what the pot has absorbed after the prohibited substance fell according to our estimation.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., at that time, it absorbed both the permitted substances and the prohibited substance (Radbaz).<br>In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 99:4), Rav Yosef Caro follows the view of Rashi and the <i>Tur</i> who maintain that we should measure the prohibited substance and the permitted substances as they are at present, for there is no way of knowing how much the pot absorbed. This stringency applies, however, only with regard to forbidden substances mixed with permitted substances of a different type. (For then the prohibition stems from Scriptural Law.) If they are of the same type (when a simple majority is required according to Scriptural Law), the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> rules more leniently and accepts the Rambam's ruling.</i> For it is impossible to know the exact amount which the pot absorbed.
It is forbidden to nullify a substance<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after a forbidden substance fell into a mixture, one may not add enough permitted substances that there will 60, 100, or 200 times the amount of the forbidden substance.</i> forbidden by Scriptural<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, a substance forbidden by Rabbinic Law accidentally fell into a mixture, one may add enough permitted substances to nullify the prohibition, as stated in Halachah 26.</i> Law as an initial and preferred measure. If, however, one nullified it, the mixture is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Because in fact the presence of the forbidden substance has been nullified.</i> Nevertheless, our Sages penalized such a person and forbade the entire mixture.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 99:11 explains the reason for this penalty. If we would permit him to benefit from it, we fear that if, in the future, such a situation would recur, he would instruct his servants to nullify the prohibited substances for him.</i> It appears to me that since this is a penalty, we forbid this mixture only to the person<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Or the person whom he intended to serve after nullifying the forbidden substance. Were this not the case, he would benefit from his undesirable act (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> who transgressed and nullified the prohibited substance.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording implies that the penalty was imposed only when he willfully nullified the existence of the forbidden substance. If he did so accidentally or inadvertently, no prohibition applies, for our Sages did not impose penalties in such situations [<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 99:5)].</i> For others, however, the entire mixture is permitted.
What is implied? If a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>orlah</i> falls into 100 <i>se'ah</i> [of permitted produce], the entire [mixture] is forbidden. One should not bring another 100 <i>se'ah</i> and join [the entire quantity] together so that [the forbidden substance] will be nullified because of the presence of 201 times the original amount. If, however, he transgressed and did so, the entire [mixture] is permitted.<br>With regard to a prohibition forbidden by Rabbinic decree,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">This point was not accepted by all authorities. The Ashkenazic authorities (as reflected by the ruling of Rabbenu Asher) maintain that even a Rabbinic prohibition should not be nullified as an initial and preferred measure. The Radbaz proposes an intermediate position: that the stringency should be applied only to Rabbinic prohibitions that have a source in Scriptural Law, e.g., milk and fowl, but not those enacted by the Rabbis entirely on their own initiative. This compromise, however, was not accepted. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 99:6) adopts the Rambam's position, while the <i>Tur</i> and the Rama follow that of Rabbenu Asher.</i> we do nullify a prohibition as an initial and preferred measure.
What is implied? If milk fell into a pot that contains fowl and imparted its flavor to the food, one may add other fowl to the pot until the flavor [of the milk] is no longer discernable. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
We already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 1.</i> that if a forbidden substance imparts its flavor to a permitted substance, the entire mixture is not permitted. When does the above apply? [When the flavor imparted] improves [the flavor of the permitted food]. If, however, the forbidden substance detracts from the flavor of the permitted substance and impairs it, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 66a derives this concept from the statements of Deuteronomy 14:21 concerning the meat of an animal that died without slaughter: "Give it to the stranger in your gate and he will partake of it." Implied is that the prohibition applies only to meat that is fit for a non-Jew to partake of. If it is not fit for the non-Jew to eat, it cannot cause a Jew's food to be forbidden.<br>See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 103:2) which states: "The impairment of the food's flavor does not have to be complete to the extent that one would be disgusted to eat it. Instead, even if it slightly detracts [from its flavor], it does not cause the mixture to become forbidden."</i><br>[This applies] provided it detracts from its flavor from the beginning until the end. If, however, it detracted from its flavor at the outset, but ultimately improved it or improved it initially, even though it will ultimately detract from it, [the mixture] is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah, loc. cit.</i> states that if initially, the flavor of a substance is improved by the addition of the forbidden substance, it becomes forbidden. The fact that ultimately the addition detracts from the flavor of the permitted substance is not sufficient to cause it to become permitted again. The Rambam draws the conclusion that ultimately if the flavor of the substance will be improved, it is also prohibited (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>Note, however, the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 103:7 who states that it is permitted to partake of a mixture after the flavor of the permitted substance was impaired, before it improved, even though one knows that ultimately, it will improve. Based on the wording of the following halachah, however, it is questionable if the Rambam would accept this conclusion.</i>
Who will taste the mixture?<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since there is a question whether the mixture is forbidden or not.</i> If <i>terumot</i> were mixed with ordinary crops, a priest should taste the mixture.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">For he is permitted to partake of <i>terumot</i>.</i> If the flavor of the <i>terumah</i> is discernible, the entire mixture is considered as <i>miduma</i>.

If [the mixture involved] meat and milk, wine poured as a libation, wine that was <i>orlah</i>, or [made from grapes that grew together with] mixed species in a vineyard that fell into honey, or the meat of crawling animals or teeming animals that were cooked with vegetables and the like, a gentile should taste [the mixture].<br>We rely on his word.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difficulty with the Rambam's statements, for generally, we do not rely on the word of a gentile with regard to ritual matters. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 98:1) relies on the opinion of the Rashba quoted by the <i>Tur</i>, that this refers to a situation where the gentile does not know that we are relying on him, but instead makes his statements as a matter of course (<i>masiach lifi tomo</i>).<br>See also the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 98:2 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 98:2 who quote views which state that an ordinary gentile is not sufficient, but instead, the intent is a gentile chef who is an expert on recognizing flavors. According to some, however, this interpretation leads to a leniency. For since he is a professional, he will not risk his professional reputation by lying to mislead a Jew. Hence, according to these views, his statements can be accepted even if they are made in response to direct questions and not as a matter of course. There are, nevertheless, authorities who differ and require even a chef to make his statements as a matter of course. Moreover, there are authorities (among them, the Radbaz and the Rama) who never accept the statements of a gentile with regard to these matters.<br>The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 98:1) states that in the present age, we do not rely on the statements of a non-Jew who tasted food to determine whether it is kosher or not.</i> If he says: "It does not have the flavor [of the forbidden substance]," or he says: "It [imparted] its flavor, but that flavor is bad and it detracts [from the flavor of the permitted substance," the entire [mixture] is permitted, provided it will not ultimately improve it, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 28.</i> If there is no gentile to taste it, we rely on the measures of 60,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">For it is an accepted principle that the taste of a forbidden substance will be nullified in more than 60 times its volume.</i> 100, or 200.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to mixtures of <i>terumot, orlah</i>, and mixed species in a vineyard.

When a goat is roasted in its fat, it is forbidden to eat from even the tip of its ear. [The rationale is that] the fat permeates through all its limbs, improves [their taste], and imparts flavor.

Chapter 16

All the above measures given by our Sages with regard to a forbidden substance being mixed with a permitted substance of the same type apply when the forbidden substance is not a leavening agent, a spice, or an important entity that is discrete and is not mixed together with or blended with the permitted substance.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it does not become mixed with the forbidden substances into a single blend, nevertheless, it cannot be distinguished from the kosher substances.</i> If, however, [the forbidden substance] is a leavening agent, a spice, or an important entity, even the slightest amount of it causes [the entire mixture] to be forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The presence of the forbidden substance is never nullified no matter how great the ratio between it and the permitted substances. Needless to say, this stringency was instituted by Rabbinic degree. As mentioned above, according to Scriptural Law, a simple majority is sufficient to nullify the presence of an entity.</i>
What is implied? When yeast from wheat that is <i>terumah</i> falls into a dough of ordinary wheat [flour] and it is of sufficient quantity<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, there is not enough to cause the dough to leaven, it is not considered a leavening agent and its presence can be nullified [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i> 2:6-7)].</i> to cause the dough to leaven, the entire dough is considered as having been mixed with <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And must be sold to a priest at the price of <i>terumah</i>.</i> Similarly, if spices that are <i>terumah</i> fall into a pot of ordinary food [containing] the same substance,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, they do not contain the same substance, according to the Rambam (<i>loc. cit.</i>), we see if their flavor can be detected or not. If it cannot be detected, the mixture is permitted.</i> when [the forbidden spices] are of sufficient quantity to season [the dish], the entire [dish] is considered as having been mixed with <i>terumah</i>. This applies even if the ration between the yeast and the spices [to the permitted substances] is 1:1000.<br>Similarly, if yeast from mixed species grown in a vineyard fall into a dough or spices of <i>orlah</i> fall into a pot, it is forbidden to benefit from the entire [mixture].
Even the smallest amount of an important entity [that is forbidden] can cause a mixture of its own type to become forbidden. The seven entities that follow are considered as important: nuts from Perach,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Perach and Baden are names of places. These and the following terms are defined in the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i> 3:8).</i> pomegranates from Baden, sealed barrels,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 134:2) states that this applies only when the barrels are large and therefore important. A small barrel is not important and its presence can be nullified by a simple majority.</i> beet shoots, cabbage heads, Greek squash, and loaves baked by a private person.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to those baked by a baker.</i>
What is implied? If one pomegranate from Baden that was <i>orlah</i> became mixed with several thousand other pomegranates, it is forbidden to benefit from the entire mixture.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., all the pomegranates are considered as if they are the pomegranate that is <i>orlah</i>.<br>The Radbaz mentions opinions that state that one may throw away the value of the forbidden pomegranate, but then benefit from the entire mixture. He, however, brings support for the Rambam's position.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 101:1) appears to support the Rambam's ruling. Note, however, the comments of the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 110:2 who writes that even though a Jew may not benefit from any one of the forbidden pomegranates himself, he may sell the entire mixture to a gentile, minus the price of the forbidden pomegranate. See also the notes to Halachah 7.</i> Similarly, if a sealed barrel of wine that is<i> orlah</i> or that is a product of mixed species from a vineyard that became mixed with several thousand sealed barrels, it is forbidden to benefit from the entire quantity.
Similarly, when a piece of meat from a <i>nevelah</i> or from a non-kosher species of animal, beast, fowl, or fish become mixed with several thousand other pieces of meat, the entire mixture is forbidden until one separates that piece of meat and makes certain that there is sixty times its measure.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to an instance when the forbidden piece of meat was cooked with the other pieces.</i> For if one does not separate [the forbidden piece of meat], it will continue to be present and it will not have changed.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">If its form changes, different rules apply, as apparent from Halachah 11.</i> And this piece of meat is important to him, for he receives honor [by serving it] to guests.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 109:1) state that if a piece of meat is not of the type that will bring a person respect by serving it to guests, the stringency mentioned in this halachah does not apply.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Chulin</i> 100a) explains that even though in practice, the piece of meat will not bring honor to the person - because since it is forbidden, he cannot serve it - it is placed in this category, for were it not to be forbidden, it would bring him honor.</i>
The same laws apply with regard to a piece of meat [cooked] with milk<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">There is an important insight associated with this ruling. The stringency relating to a piece of meat from which one receives honor applies only when the meat is inherently forbidden. When, however, a piece of kosher meat falls into a stew of non-kosher meat, it is not considered a piece of meat from which one receives honor, for it is not inherently forbidden. What is forbidden is the flavor of the non-kosher meat and that flavor is not a substance from which one receives honor.<br>This does not apply with regard to milk and meat. Although it is absorbing the milk that causes the meat to be considered forbidden, once it absorbs that milk, it becomes inherently forbidden. For both of the substances are themselves permitted, it is their mixture that is forbidden by the Torah (Radbaz).</i> or an ordinary animal that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard, for it is forbidden to benefit from [the latter] according to Rabbinic decree,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this stringency is applied even though we are speaking only about a Rabbinic prohibition (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> as will be explained in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachah 3.</i> Even the slightest amount of them causes [a mixture] to become forbidden until they are removed.<br>Similarly, when a <i>gid hanesheh</i> was cooked with other similar tissue or with meat, when it can be recognized, it should be removed and the remainder is permitted.

Otherwise, 60 times its volume is required, for the fat does impart flavor.</i> If one cannot recognize it, the entire mixture is forbidden. For [the <i>gid hanesheh</i> is considered as a created being in its own right.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 100:1) gives the following criteria for a creation in its own right: It must be alive, in contrast to a kernel of wheat. It must be inherently forbidden, in contrast to a kosher fowl that was slaughtered improperly. It must be a complete entity to the extent that were it to be divided it would no longer be referred to with that name in contrast to non-kosher fat. And it must actually be whole, in contrast to a <i>gid hanesheh</i> that was cut in half.</i> Hence, it is significant; no matter how small it is, it causes [a mixture] to become forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This principle applies with regard to all entities that are creations in their own right. Until they are removed, the mixture is forbidden regardless of the ratio of kosher to nonkosher substances. Once they are removed, the ratio must be 60:1 (<i>ibid.</i>:2).</i>
Similarly, all living animals are significant and they never become nullified.

The benefit from the remainder is permitted. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> points to Halachah 29 as indication that the Rambam would also accept the ruling stated by the Ra'avad. The <i>Migdal Oz</i> differs and maintains that the Rambam would not accept that ruling. As mentioned above, the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 101:2 defends the position of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, stating that the Rambam would allow one to sell the entire mixture to a gentile, minus the price of the forbidden article.</i> With regard to other entities, even though it is customary to [sell] them by number,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:1) cite the view of other <i>Rishonim </i>who state that whenever an article is always sold by number, not by a package, its presence is never nullified.</i> they can be nullified according to the ordinary measures.
What is implied?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., what is an example of an article that is sold by number being nullified.</i> When a bundle of vegetables that come from mixed species grown in a vineyard are mixed with 200 bundles or an <i>esrog</i> which is <i>orlah</i> is mixed with 200 <i>esrogim</i>, the entire quantity is permitted. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
It appears to me that every article that is significant to the inhabitants of a given place as nuts from Perach and pomegranates from Baden were significant in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in [the Talmudic] era causes a mixture to be forbidden if even the slightest amount becomes mixed in because of its importance in that time and in that era. The particular entities [referred to above] were mentioned because the slightest amount of them causes a mixture to be forbidden in every place. The same laws apply to articles similar to them in other places. It is clear that all of these prohibitions stem from Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For according to Scriptural Law, a substance mixed with substances of the same type are forbidden when there is a majority of the permitted substance. When mixed with substances of a different type, they are nullified when the taste can no longer be detected.</i>
If one pomegranate from a mixture [of pomegranates including a forbidden pomegranate from Baden] falls into two other [permitted] pomegranates from Baden and then one of these three pomegranates fell into other pomegranates, the latter mixture is permitted. [The rationale is that the presence of] the pomegranate from the first mixture [which fell into the second mixture] is nullified because of the majority of permitted substances.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to Scriptural Law; according to Rabbinic Law, both the first and the second mixtures are forbidden.</i> If, however, [a pomegranate] from the first mixture falls into 1000 pomegranates, they are all forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For with regard to each of the pomegranates in the second mixture, there is a question if it is forbidden by Scriptural Law or not (Radbaz).<br>The Radbaz notes that the Rambam's ruling here appears to contradict his ruling in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 7:10 where the Rambam rules that if a goblet used for idol worship becomes mixed with other goblets and then one from the first mixture falls into a second mixture, one may use the goblets of the second mixture. The Radbaz maintains that with this ruling, the Rambam changed his mind and adopted a more stringent position.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam rules more stringently in this instance than with regard to idol worship because the prohibition against idol worship is universally known. The prohibition against benefiting from a significant entity, by contrast, is less recognized. Therefore there is need for greater stringency. Alternatively, here the Rambam is speaking about partaking of the forbidden mixture, while in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>, he is speaking about benefiting from the mixture. Obviously, there is greater reason to prohibited a substance from which one partakes.<br>The position followed by the Rambam in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> is followed by other <i>Rishonim</i> even with regard to a significant entity. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:8) quotes the Rambam's view and the Rama adds further stringencies. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 110:10 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 110:3 mention the more lenient views.</i> [The concept that the presence of the forbidden pomegranate] was nullified because of the majority of permitted substances only when there is a multiple doubt involved:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps the pomegranate that fell from the first mixture into the second mixture was not forbidden by Scriptural Law. Even if it was forbidden, perhaps the pomegranate that fell from the second mixture was not forbidden by Scriptural Law. Thus there is a multiple doubt if an entity forbidden by Scriptural Law is present.</i> i.e., that if one of the second mixture will fall into another place, it does not cause [that third mixture] to become forbidden. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
If the nuts that were forbidden because of the nut that was <i>orlah </i>intermingled with them were cracked open, the pomegranates were taken apart, the barrels were opened, the squash was cut, or the bread was sliced after they became forbidden, [the presence of the forbidden entity] can be nullified if there is 201 times its volume.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As required with regard to the prohibitions of <i>orlah</i> and mixed species in a vineyard. I.e., the stringency of a significant article no longer applies, because the entities are no longer whole and in their present form, they are not significant.</i> This law also applies with regard to a piece of forbidden meat<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Which would be forbidden because one derives honor from serving it as stated in Halachah 5. Once it has been minced, the meat is no longer a piece from which one would derive honor [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>101:6)].</i> that is minced together with other pieces and they are all [minced] in the same way, [the presence of the forbidden entity] can be nullified if there is 60 times its volume.
It is, however, forbidden to crack the nuts, take apart the pomegranates, open the barrels after they have become forbidden so that [the presence of the forbidden entity] can be nullified if there is 201 times its volume. For, as an initial and preferred measure, we do not nullify the presence of an entity.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question the Rambam's statement, noting that in Chapter 15, Halachah 26, the Rambam states that we may nullify the presence of a substance forbidden by Rabbinic Law.

[The following rule applies when] yeast that comes from mixed species in a vineyard and from<i> terumah</i> falls into dough and there is not enough of either of [the forbidden substances] alone to cause the dough to rise, but when the two are combined, there is enough to cause the dough to rise. This dough is forbidden to an Israelite, but permitted to the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 1, if an entity is sufficient to cause a dough to leaven or to spice a pot, its presence can never be nullified. Although neither forbidden entity on its own is large enough to bring about this change, when the two are combined, this result is achieved. Therefore an Israelite is forbidden to partake of the dough or the pot. With regard to a priest, by contrast, since <i>terumah </i>is not forbidden to him, we do not say that an article forbidden to him brought about this change. For the mixed species alone is not of sufficient size. Hence, he is permitted to partake of the bread or the cooked food.</i><br>Similarly, when spices that come from <i>terumah</i> and from mixed species in a vineyard fall into a pot and there is not enough of either of [the forbidden substances] to spice the pot, but together there is enough of both of them to spice the pot, that pot is forbidden to an Israelite - for an entity forbidden to him spice it - and permitted to the priests.
When there are two or three types of the same species of spice or three species of the same type, they can be combined to cause a pot to be forbidden when they spice it or when [a similar type mixture] causes dough to leaven.<br>What is implied? Yeast from wheat and yeast from barley are not considered as being two separate substances. Instead, since the category yeast is the same, they are considered as one substance and they can be combined to measure to see if they are sufficient to cause a dough of wheat to leaven if their combined flavor is that of wheat<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">If the combined flavor is not that of wheat, the dough does not become forbidden, because the yeast is considered as giving a different flavor to the dough. Hence the dough is forbidden only of that flavor is detectable.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling, offering a different interpretation of <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 65a, the Rambam's source. Significantly, their disagreement is mirrored by similar difference in interpretation by Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i>. Rashi and the Rambam follow one approach and <i>Tosafot</i> and the Ra'avad, the other.</i> or to cause a dough of barley to leaven if their combined flavor is that of barley.
What is meant by three species of the same type? For example, river parsley, parsley that grows in meadows, and parsley that grows in gardens. Although each of them has a distinct name, since they are of one type, they can be combined to [cause a dish to be forbidden if they] spice [it].
[The following rules apply when] yeast that is <i>terumah</i> or from mixed species from a vineyard falls into dough that is already leavened or spices that are <i>terumah</i> or from mixed species from a vineyard fall into a pot that has already been spiced. If there is enough [of the forbidden] yeast to cause the dough to leaven if it had been unleavened or there is enough of the spices to spice the pot had it been unspiced, the entire mixture is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Although in actual fact the forbidden yeast or spices did not have an effect, because the dough leavened and the pot was spiced without them. Nevertheless, since they could have had an effect, they cause the dish to become forbidden.<br><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 68a notes that when a dough is already leavened, adding yeast will spoil its flavor. Hence, seemingly, it should not be forbidden. Nevertheless, an exception is made with regard to dough, for when extra yeast is added to dough, that dough is then used to cause other doughs to leaven. Hence, it is not considered to be spoiled.<br>The Ra'avad understands the emphasis of the passage from <i>Avodah Zarah</i> differently and objects to the Rambam's ruling. He note that <i>Avodah Zarah</i> does not mention spices; the Rambam added those on the basis of his logic. And the Ra'avad, argues, that logic can be disputed. For the addition of yeast to the dough has an effect as explained. The addition of the spices, by contrast, have no effect - for the pot was already spiced. Why then do they cause the pot to be forbidden?<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> answers, that even according to the Ra'avad's understanding, the Rambam's logic can be defended, for the food from the heavily spiced pot could be used to spice other pots.</i> If they are of sufficient size to spice [the pot] or cause [the dough] to leaven, their presence can be nullified according to the required measure: <i>terumah</i> when [the mixture] is 101 times [the size of the forbidden substance] and mixed species in a vineyard when [the mixture] is 201 times [the size of the forbidden substance].
<i>Terumah</i> can [help] cause <i>orlah</i> and mixed species from a vineyard to be nullified.<br>What is implied? When a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> falls into 99 [<i>se'ah</i> of] ordinary produce and afterwards, a half <i>se'ah</i> of<i> orlah</i> or mixed species from a vineyard falls into the entire mixture, the prohibition against <i>orlah</i> or mixed species in a vineyard does not apply.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The mixture is, however, forbidden to Israelites and permitted only to priests, for the presence of the <i>terumah</i> is not nullified.</i> For it is nullified because of the presence of 201 times [the size of the forbidden substance] even though a portion of the 201 is <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following halachah represent the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Orlah</i> 2:2 which is based on the Jerusalem Talmud.</i>
Similarly, <i>orlah</i> and mixed species from a vineyard can [help] cause <i>terumah</i> to be nullified.<br>What is implied? When 100 <i>se'ah</i> of <i>orlah</i> or mixed species from a vineyard fall into 20,000 <i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce, the entire mixture is thus 20,100 <i>se'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the presence of the <i>orlah</i> or the mixed species from the vineyard are nullified.</i> Afterwards, a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah </i>fell into every 100 <i>se'ah</i>, the entire [mixture] is permitted and the presence of the <i>terumah</i> is nullified because of the presence of 101 times [the original amount of <i>terumah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This example is the product of the Rambam's own deduction.

Similarly, <i>orlah</i> may [help] nullify mixed species from a vineyard and mixed species from a vineyard may [help] nullify <i>orlah</i>. Mixed species from a vineyard may [help] nullify [the presence of other] mixed species from a vineyard and <i>orlah</i> may [help] nullify [the presence of other] <i>orlah</i>.<br>What is implied? 200 <i>se'ah</i> of <i>orlah</i> or mixed species from a vineyard fall into 40,000 <i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition is thus nullified because the ratio of permitted to forbidden substances is 200:1.<br>The Ra'avad criticizes the Rambam, questioning why he uses extremely large numbers.

A garment that was dyed with shells of <i>orlah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i> 1:8), the Rambam quotes the <i>Sifra (Parshat Kedoshim)</i> which teaches that since it is forbidden to benefit from <i>Orlah</i>, it is also forbidden to use it as a dye. The Rambam emphasizes that, accordingly, this applies, not only to fruit which is <i>orlah</i>, but also to the shells from which dye is made. In his notes to the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, Rav Kapach cites a responsa from the Rambam from which it appears that this applies only to shells because they serve a fruit. It is not forbidden to make dye from the wood or the bark of a tree that is <i>orlah</i>. See Halachah 24 and notes.</i> should be burnt.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Since the substance from which the dye comes is forbidden, the entire article becomes forbidden.</i> If it became intermingled with others, [its presence] may be nullified when there are 201 times the original amount.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording - and hence, our translation - implies that one may cause the presence of the forbidden garment to be nullified by adding 200 other garments to it. The Radbaz explains that the mixture is forbidden only according to Rabbinic Law. As stated in Chapter 15, Halachah 26, as an initial and preferred option, one may add a sufficient quantity of permitted substances to nullify the presence of a substance forbidden by Rabbinic Law. Note, however, the glosses of the <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> and Rav Kapach to <i>Orlah</i> 3:1, that do not accept this interpretation and state that one may not nullify the prohibition as an initial and preferred option.</i> Similarly, when a dish was cooked or a loaf of bread baked with the shells of <i>orlah</i> or mixed species from a vineyard, the dish or the bread must be burnt, for the benefit [from the forbidden substance] is evident.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 22.</i> If it became intermingled with others, [its presence] may be nullified when there are 201 times the original amount.
Similarly, when <i>milo hasit</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In his notes to the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i> 3:2), Rav Kapach elaborates on the definition of this term, concluding that it is equal to two thumbbreadths. This is also reflected in the Rambam's ruling, <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 9:18.</i> of a garment was dyed with [a dye that is] <i>orlah</i>, and [that garment] cannot be identified, [its presence] may be nullified when there are 201 times the original amount.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the entire garment is not 201 times the size of the portion dyed with the forbidden dye. In his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that this law teaches us that if even a small portion of a garment is dyed with forbidden dye, the entire garment may become forbidden.</i> If powdered dye that is <i>orlah</i> becomes mixed with powdered dye that is permitted, [its presence] may be nullified when there are 201 times the original amount. When liquid dye that is <i>orlah</i> becomes mixed with liquid dye that is permitted, its presence is nullified when there is a majority [of the permitted substance].<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that a more lenient ruling is issued in this instance, because:<br>a) Here there is no substance that is forbidden, it is only the color that comes from the forbidden dye that is problematic. A differentiation can be made between this instance and the previous laws, for in those instances, the forbidden dye has already become permanently associated with a substance.<br>b) In this instance, the majority of the dyeing will result from the permitted dye. The effect of the prohibited dye is secondary.</i>
When an oven has been heated with shells of <i>orlah</i> or mixed species from a vineyard, it must be cooled off [before cooking in it]. [This applies] to both a new and an old [oven]. Afterwards, one should heat [the oven] with permitted wood.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">If so, it is then permitted to use even a new oven. Heating a new oven with the shells of <i>orlah </i>completes the task of fashioning the oven. Thus there is reason to say that since it was completed in a forbidden manner, the oven itself would be forbidden. Nevertheless, when permitted fuel is used even for such an oven, the products are permitted. The rationale is that they are produced by two substances: the oven which is forbidden and the fuel which is permitted. Whenever there are two factors involved, one permitted and one forbidden, the result is permitted to be used (<i>Pesachim</i> 26b). We do not require the oven to be destroyed, for the oven is not inherently forbidden (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>One might ask: If so, why is an oven that is heated with shells that are <i>orlah</i> forbidden to be used. Here also there are two factors involved, the oven which is permitted and the fuel which is forbidden. It is possible to explain that the leniency of allowing to use the yield produced by a forbidden and a permitted substance only after the fact. In this instance, cooling the oven provides an easy alternative (Radbaz).</i> If one cooked in it before it was cooled, whether bread or food, it is forbidden to benefit from it. [The rationale is that] the forbidden wood increased the value of the bread or the food.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">One might ask, since the oven is permitted, even though the fuel is forbidden, there is both a permitted and a forbidden factor producing this result. Why, then, is the food forbidden? It is possible to explain that since the fire which is forbidden is evident and apparent, we rule stringently (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>If one removed the entire fire<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by the Halachah 24, this applies even if there are still glowing coals in the oven.</i> and then cooked or baked with the heat of the oven [that remained], it is permitted, for the forbidden wood is no longer present.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">One might ask: In the case of a new oven, since both factors - the oven and the fuel - are forbidden. Nevertheless, it appears that according to the Rambam, removing the fire is sufficient for the food to be permitted. For the oven itself is not inherently forbidden, it was only completed in a forbidden manner (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
It is forbidden to benefit from plates, cups, pots, and bottles that were fired by a potter with shells of <i>orlah</i>. [The rationale is] they are made new by an object from which it is forbidden to benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since the fuel used to fire the kitchenware is the primary element in completing them, they are forbidden. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 142:7 explains that here we are speaking about kitchenware on which food is served cold. Since the kitchenware was made in a forbidden manner, it is forbidden to benefit from it. If, however, a pot was fired with forbidden fuel and then used to cook kosher food, that food would be permitted as is the law concerning a new oven. The Meiri (in his gloss to <i>Pesachim</i> 26b), however, explains that if one cooks food with a pot forbidden because of these factors, the food is forbidden.</i>
When bread was baked on coals from wood<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz emphasizes that here, too, we are speaking about shells from fruit that is <i>orlah</i>.

[The rationale is] that at the time it was cooked with the forbidden wood, the permitted wood had not been introduced. Thus part of the cooking process was performed with permitted wood and part with forbidden wood.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> gives two interpretations for this halachah. Our translation follows the first interpretation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, questions that interpretation, stating that seemingly, the fact that the pot in which the food was cooked was permitted would add another permitted factor and thus the food was never cooked in a totally forbidden setting. He therefore offers another interpretation, stating that here the Rambam is speaking about firing the pot in which the food was cooked. First it was fired with forbidden fuel, then it was fired with permitted fuel, and then food was cooked in it with permitted fuel. Since it was originally fired with forbidden fuel, it becomes forbidden and any food cooked in it is likewise prohibited. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 142:9 favors the first interpretation, explaining that the situation resembles food cooked in an oven with forbidden fuel.</i>
When a plant that is <i>orlah</i> becomes mixed together with other plants or a row of mixed species from a vineyard became mixed with other rows,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it was known that one plant or row was forbidden, but one was not able to identify the forbidden plant.

The leniency stated in this halachah applies only after the fact. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam changed his mind, because the more lenient opinion is mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Gittin</i> 54b).</i> If [the ratio of] permitted plants to forbidden plants was 200:1 or the ratio of forbidden rows to permitted ones is 200:1, everything that was gathered is permitted. If the ratio was less than this, all that was gathered is forbidden.<br>[One might ask:] Why is one permitted to gather [the produce] at the outset? Seemingly, the law should require that everything be forbidden for him until he undertakes the difficulty of removing the forbidden plant or row.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., perhaps we should ordain a decree, forbidding benefit from the entire field, lest one intentionally mix a forbidden <i>orlah</i> plant into his vineyard.</i> [It can be explained that that] a person will not cause his vineyard to be forbidden because of one plant.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Hence we do not fear that he will introduce a forbidden plant into the vineyard.</i> Were he to be able to identify it, he would remove it.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not fear that he left the <i>orlah</i> plant intentionally.<br>In <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 13:12, the Rambam rules more stringently with regard to<i> terumah</i>.

It is forbidden to benefit from cheese that is made to harden using the syrup of <i>orlah</i> fruit that has not ripened,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i> 1:7), the Rambam states that it is common to use the white syrup that drips from underdeveloped figs as a catalyst to cause cheese to harden.</i> the stomach<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., using the renin as a catalyst.</i> of an animal offered as a sacrifice to false divinities, or vinegar made from the wine of a false divinity.

In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 2:5), the Rambam writes that the laws applying to a catalyst used to make cheese are more severe than those applying to spices and yeast (Halachah 1, for the latter can be nullified when they fall into a substance of another type) for the reason explained above. As the Radbaz explains, even without yeast a dough would be able to be baked and a dish could be served without spices, but without a catalyst, milk would never harden into cheese.</i>
The law is that fruit that is <i>orlah</i> or from mixed species from a vineyard should be burnt.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 56b derives this from the exegesis of Deuteronomy 22:9, <i>pen tikadeish</i>, "lest it become hallowed," interpreting it as <i>pen tukad eish</i>, "lest it be consigned to fire."</i> Liquids from [that fruit] should be buried, because it is impossible to burn liquids.
When wine that was poured as a libation to idols is mixed with [other] wine, it is forbidden to benefit from the entire mixture regardless of how small [the amount of forbidden wine], as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 15, Halachot 6-7.</i><br>When does the above apply? When the permitted wine is poured onto a drop of wine that had been poured as a libation.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> quotes <i>Rishonim</i> who rule that if a quantity of permitted wine that is 60 times the volume of the forbidden wine falls into the forbidden wine at the same time, the presence of the forbidden wine is nullified. The stringency mentioned by the Rambam applies only when the kosher wine is poured into the forbidden wine little by little. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> rules that if a severe loss is involved, one may rely on this leniency.</i> If, however, one poured wine that had been poured as a libation from a small bottle<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a bottle from which the wine is poured one drop at a time.</i> into a cistern of wine, its presence is nullified. Even if one poured the entire day, each individual drop becomes nullified, drop after drop.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this applies even if the majority of the mixture comes from the forbidden wine. Since each drop was nullified, the entire quantity is permitted. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 134:4 differs and requires that the permitted wine be 60 times the volume of the forbidden wine.<br>According to the Rambam, it is even permitted to drink the wine of the mixture. Rashi (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 73a) rules that it is permitted to benefit from the wine, drinking it, however, is forbidden. And the Ra'avad rules that it is forbidden even to benefit from it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 134:1) quotes the Rambam's ruling.</i><br>If one pours from a jug,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a container with a large opening.</i> the entire quantity is forbidden.

When water is mixed into wine or wine is mixed into water, [the forbidden entity causes the mixture to be prohibited] if its flavor can be detected, because they are two different types of substances.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 15, Halachah 6.</i><br>When does the above apply?

When wine poured as a libation falls on wheat, [the wheat] is forbidden to be eaten, but it is permitted to benefit from it. One should not sell it to a gentile, lest he sell it again to a Jew.

Because [the wheat] draws out the wine<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 65b states, the kernels of wheat are cracked and this causes them to absorb the wine (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>).</i> and it becomes absorbed within it.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz emphasizes that the taste of the wine becomes blended in with the taste of the wheat to the extent that it cannot be detected.</i>

When the meat of a <i>nevelah</i> or a crawling animal or teeming animal was cooked in an earthenware pot,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">If the pot was made out of metal, it is possible to purge the flavor of the non-kosher food the pot absorbed through <i>hagaalah</i>.

If he cooked a type of meat [in the pot that day], the dish is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since the dish contains meat and the flavor of the forbidden meat was absorbed in the pot, the laws applying to a forbidden substance mixed with its own type apply. Since we do not know how much of the forbidden substance is absorbed in the pot, we assume that the entire pot is forbidden. For this reason, the Rambam does not mention that if there is 60 times the amount of the forbidden food in the kosher food, the kosher food is permitted. For it is very rare that a pot be able to contain sixty times its own volume (Radbaz).</i> If he cooked another substance in it, [it is forbidden if] its flavor can be detected.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, it should be tasted by a gentile to determine whether the forbidden flavor is detectable or not, as stated in Chapter 15, Halachah 30.

The immersion of the dinnerware that is purchased from gentiles to allow it to be used for eating and drinking is not associated with ritual purity and impurity. Instead, it is a Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 5:15) states, this immersion was instituted to mark the article's transition from the impurity of the gentiles.</i><br>There is an allusion<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Most commentaries understand the Rambam as explaining that the requirement for immersion is an <i>asmachta</i>, i.e., an obligation that is essentially Rabbinic in origin. Although our Sages cited a verse that can be seen to allude to it, the intent is not that the obligation is derived from the verse. Instead, the verse is merely a hint which the Rabbis found to allude to their teaching (Rabbenu Nissim).<br>There are, however, others who note that the Rambam occasionally employs the term he employs here - <i>midvrei sofrim</i> - to refer to obligations and laws that are of Scriptural origin. They are not explicitly stated in the verse, but instead derived through the principles of Biblical exegesis. According to this view, the obligation is of Scriptural origin (the Rashba, Vol. III, Responsum 255, 259).</i> to this [in Numbers 31:23 that describes Moses' instructions with regard to the spoils taken from Midian:] "Everything that can be passed through fire, you shall pass through fire and it will become pure." According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that the verse is speaking only about purifying [the utensils] from gentile cooking, not from ritual impurity. For there is no ritually impurity that is dispelled by fire. All those who are impure ascend from their impurity through immersion and the impurity stemming from [contact with] a human corpse is [dispelled] through the sprinkling [of water and the ashes of the red heifer]. There is no concept of fire [employed in this context], rather [it is employed] with regard to purification from gentile cooking. Since the verse states "and it will become pure," our Sages said: "Add to it another dimension of purity after passing it through fire to cause it to be permitted because [of its contact] with gentile cooking."<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after you have purged it from the taste absorbed because of gentile cooking, add another dimension of purity through immersion.</i>
[Our Sages] obligate this immersion only for metal<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This requirement also applies to glass dinnerware, as stated in Halachah 3.<br><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 75b explains the association with metal utensils as follows. Our Sages associated this obligation with the purification of the spoil taken in the war against Midian and the verse which mentions those spoils (Numbers 31:22  refers to metal utensils. Glass utensils are also included, because, halachically, they share similarities to metal utensils.</i> dinnerware utensils<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., utensils used to prepare, serve, or partake of food. Even utensils that are used in the preliminary phases of preparation of food, e.g., a knife used to slaughter or skin an animal, are required to be immersed according to certain authorities [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 120:5)].</i> that were purchased from a gentile. When, however, a person borrows [such utensils] from a gentile or a gentile left him such utensils as security, it is only necessary to wash them thoroughly, boil them, or expose them to fire. He does not have to immerse [them].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For even though he has permission to use them, he has not become their owner. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes certain opinions that maintain that utensils taken as security must be immersed, because if the debt is not repaid, they are considered as payment [see <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 120:5).<br>In this context, there are many authorities who question why the utensils that are "purchased" by a gentile before Pesach are not required to be immersed.</i> Similarly, if one purchased wooden or stone utensils, it is only necessary to wash them thoroughly, boil them, or expose them to fire. Similarly, earthenware utensils need not be immersed.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, plastic utensils need not be immersed.</i> If, however, they are coated with lead, they are considered as metal utensils and require immersion.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama ((<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 120:1) states that they should be immersed without a blessing.</i>
When a person purchases a knife from a gentile, he must expose it to fire until it become white hot or have it honed in its sharpener.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">By exposing the knife to fire, the person will burn away any non-kosher substances.

Hence before the knife is used, the traces of the forbidden flavor must be removed as above.<br>The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 121:7) quotes opinions that maintain that honing the knife is not sufficient to allow it to be used for hot foods. He states that this is accustomed practice. Even so, after the fact, if a person slaughtered an animal with a knife that was honed in a grinder, thre is no prohibition involved (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 121:20).</i> If he slaughtered [an animal] with such a knife before purifying it, he should wash thoroughly the place of slaughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">To remove any traces of forbidden fat that might be present.<br>This is permitted only after the fact.

Hence it is necessary that it be removed. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 10:1) rules that it is necessary to take this measure and remove the surface of the meat.</i>

Hence washing it thoroughly is sufficient.</i>
There are other substances which are forbidden by the Sages. Even though there is not a basis for their prohibition in Scriptural Law, they decreed against their use<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">These decrees were about the eighteen decrees passed when the students of the School of Shammai outnumbered the students of the School of Hillel, as related in <i>Shabbat</i> 1:3 (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 2:6).</i> to separate from the gentiles so that Jews will not intermingle with them and intermarry.

A person should not drink at a party of gentiles even though boiled wine which is not forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 11, Halachah 9.</i> [is being served] or he is drinking from his own utensils. If the majority of the attendants of the party are Jewish, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> do not mention this restriction or the accompanying leniency. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 112) explains the Rambam's logic as follows: <i>Avodah Zarah </i>30a relates that one of the Sages, Shmuel was sitting with Abalat, a gentile. They were served boiled wine. Abalat withdrew, lest he touch the wine and cause it to become forbidden. Shmuel called him back, telling him there was no prohibition against boiled wine.<br>Rabbenu Asher asks: Since the prohibition against gentile wine was instituted as a protection against intermarriage, what difference does it make whether the wine is boiled or not? He answers that boiled wine is not common. Hence our Sages did not include it in their decree.<br>Rambam maintains that boiled wine is common and hence included in our Sages' decree. For this reason, it is forbidden to drink it together with gentiles. How then could Shmuel drink with Abalat? Because there were a majority of Jews at the gathering and such a situation is not included in our Sages' decree.</i> We may not drink the beer that they make from dates, figs, or the like. [This is forbidden] only in the place where they are sold.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Thus according to the Rambam [and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 114:1) who quotes his ruling, it is forbidden to drink at a bar frequented primarily by gentiles. The Rama mentions that it is customary in the Ashkenazic community to rule leniently with regard to alcoholic beverages made from honey and grain.</i> If, however, one brought the beer home and drank it there, it is permitted. For the fundamental point of the decree is that one should not feast with [a gentile].
It is permitted to drink wine from apples, pomegranates, and the like in every place. [Our Sages] did not institute a decree in an uncommon situation. Raisen wine is like ordinary wine and is used for libations.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hence a gentile's touch renders it forbidden.</i>
Although [our Sages] forbade bread [baked] by gentiles, there are places where leniency is shown regarding this matter and bread baked by a gentile baker is purchased in a place where there is no Jewish baker and it is in a field, because this is a pressing situation.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Because bread is a staple of life and there is no Jewish bread available, our Sages allowed for leniency when purchasing bread from a commercial baker. For buying from him will not lead to close personal relationships. Nevertheless, according to the Rambam, this leniency is granted only: where there is no Jewish bakers and in the fields, not in the cities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 112:2) rules more leniently and does not forbid this in a city. The Rama rules even more leniently and allows the purchase of bread from a gentile baker even in places where bread from a Jewish baker is available.</i> There is, by contrast, no one who will rule that leniency may be shown with regard to bread baked by a homeowner.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">There are opinions which maintain when there is no bread from a commercial baker available, one may even use bread baked by a gentile homeowner [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 112)]. The Rama states that one may accept this leniency.</i> For the primary reason for [our Sages'] decree was [to prevent] intermarriage. If one will eat the bread of a [gentile] homeowner, [it is likely that] he will feast with him.
[The bread] is permitted [in the following situations]: A gentile lit the oven and a Jew baked within it, a Jew lit the oven and the gentile baked within it, the gentile both lit the oven and baked, but the Jew stirred the fire or reduced it, since he was involved in the baking tasks, [we rule leniently]. Even though he did not do more than throw one piece of wood into the oven, he caused all the bread in it to be permitted. [The rationale is that this requirement] is only to make a distinction that [a gentile's] bread is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this leniency applies only with regard to baking bread. With regard to cooking, a Jew must take a more active role in the cooking process. This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 113:7). The Rama, however, differs and maintains that kindling the oven is sufficient for cooking as well.</i>
When a gentile cooks wine, milk, honey, quince,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements, because quince are only edible when cooked.</i> or the like, i.e., any entity that is usually eaten raw, it is permitted. [Our Sages] issued their decree only with regard to entities that are not eaten at all raw, e.g., meat, unsalted fish, an egg, and vegetables. If a gentile were to cook them from the beginning to the end without the Jew participating in the cooking at all, they are forbidden because they were cooked by gentiles.
When does the above apply? To [food] that would be served on the table of kings<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Today, when monarchy is a point of history, the phrase "fit to be served on the table of kings" refers to food served at a dinner for the President or dignitaries of similar status.</i> to be eaten together with bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 38a gives this and the leniency mentioned in the previous halachah as alternate explanations when food cooked by gentiles is permitted.

When, by contrast, [food] would not be served on the table of kings to be eaten together with bread, e.g., vetch<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">A legume used as cattle fodder, but also served to humans on occasion.</i> cooked by gentiles, it is permitted despite the fact that it is not eaten uncooked. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. For the fundamental purpose of the decree was to prevent intermarriage, by [hindering] a gentile from inviting [the Jew] to a feast. And when [food] would not be served on the table of kings to be eaten together with bread, a person would not invite a friend [to share a meal] of it.
When small fish were salted by a Jew or a gentile,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The Kessef Mishneh states that this is speaking about fish that are frequently served salted even without being cooked (e.g., sardines or herring served in brine). It is permitted to eat such fish for, as the Rambam states in the following halachah, in this context, salting is not considered as cooking. This leniency does not apply to large fish, for they are unfit to be eaten unless they are cooked or roasted. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 103:12) mentions this ruling, but also a dissenting view that allows leniency even with regard to large fish.</i> it is as if they have undergone part of their cooking process. [Therefore] if a gentile roasted them afterwards, they are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Since they were fit to be eaten before they were roasted, the fact that they were roasted by a gentile afterwards does not cause them to be forbidden. This applies even when a gentile performed the salting. For that salting did not cause the fish to become forbidden and yet, it made it fit to be eaten (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> [Similarly,] whenever a Jew performs a small part of the cooking process, whether at the beginning or at the end, [the food] is permitted. Accordingly, if a gentile placed meat or a pot on the fire and the Jew turned over the meat or stirred the pot or, conversely, the Jew placed [the food on the fire] and the gentile completed [the cooking process], [the food] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, R. Yosef Caro rules that this applies only when the cooking process would have been completed without the gentile's activity; the gentile merely hastened it. He does not, however, quote this ruling in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 113:6) rules that even if the food would not have cooked without the gentile's activity, it is permitted. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 113:6 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 113:8, however, raise questions concerning that leniency.</i>
When a gentile salts fish or smokes fruit and in this way prepares them to be eaten, they are permitted. With regard to this decree,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to certain other halachic contexts.</i> salted food is not considered as if it were boiling hot, nor is smoking considered as cooking.

Beans, peas, lentils, and the like that have been cooked by gentiles and are sold are forbidden because of [the decree against] gentile cooking in places where they are served on the tables of kings<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is that the designation of a food as important enough to be served on the tables of kings is a relative matter, determined by each locale in accordance with its own practice (<i>Makor Mayim Chayim</i>).</i> as a relish.

When a gentile cooked without intending to cook, [the product] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 113:5) emphasizes that if the gentile intends to cook, even if he did not intend to cook a particular substance, that substance is forbidden. For example, when a gentile lit an oven with the intent of cooking food without realizing that there was meat in the oven, the meat is forbidden.</i> What is implied? A gentile lit a fire in a swamp to clean away the overgrowth and grasshoppers were roasted, it is permitted to eat them. [This applies] even in places where they are served on the tables of kings as a relish. Similarly, if he scorches a [kosher animal's] head to remove its hair, it is permitted to partake of the strings of meat and the tips of the ears that were roasted at the time of the scorching.
[The following rules apply to] dates that were cooked by gentiles.

Roasted lentils that were kneaded with water or with vinegar are forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 38b relates that it was customary to eat a dish made from roasted lentils mixed with vinegar.

Hence, there was no reason to forbid grain mixed with water.</i> When, however, roasted kernels of wheat or barley are kneaded with water, they are permitted.

Similarly, pickled foods to which it is not customary to add vinegar or wine or pickled olives or pickled grasshoppers that are brought from the storehouse are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In some halachic contexts, pickling is considered as cooking. Nevertheless, with regard to this prohibition, our Sages ruled leniently.

[Gentile] fish brine, in places where it is customary to mix wine into it, is forbidden. If the wine is more expensive than the fish brine, it is permitted. We rule this way in all instances where we suspect that the gentiles mixed a forbidden substance [into a permitted substance].
