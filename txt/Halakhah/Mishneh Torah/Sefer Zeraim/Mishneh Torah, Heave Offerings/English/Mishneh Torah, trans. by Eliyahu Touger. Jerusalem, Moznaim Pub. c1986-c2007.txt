Mishneh Torah, Heave Offerings



Chapter 1

According to Scriptural Law, [the obligation to separate] the <i>terumot<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The plural term is used in this halachah and in many instances in this text, because there are two types of terumot: a) "the great terumah," i.e., the terumah separated initially, and b) terumat ma'aser, the terumah the Levites separate from the tithes that are given them. See Hilchot Matanot Aniyim, ch. 6, for details regarding the separation of these allocations.</i></i></i> and the tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Here also the plural term is used because there are several tithes: the first tithe given to Levites, the second tithe which must be brought to Jerusalem, and the tithe for the poor. See <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim, loc. cit.</i></i> applies only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 36b states that all the mitzvot involving the produce of the earth apply only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> [It applies] whether the Temple is standing or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Although the agricultural laws apply even when the Temple is not standing, there is a restriction to the time when they apply according to Scriptural Law. The entire Jewish people must be located in our holy land, as stated in Halachah 26. (See also <i>Hilchot Shemitah VeYovel</i> 10:8-9.)</i> The prophets ordained that these obligations should be observed in Babylon as well, because it is adjacent to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the majority of the Jewish people journey to and from there.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Babylonia is further away than the other lands mentioned in this halachah, it had a larger Jewish community and there was far more contact between its populace and the Jewish community of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Hence, the prophets gave it precedence over the other lands (Radbaz).</i> The Sages of the early generations<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages of the generation that followed Ezra [Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura (<i>Yadayim</i> 3:3).</i> ordained that they also be observed in the lands of Egypt and the lands of Ammon and Moab, because they are on the peripheries of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
Whenever <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is mentioned, the intent is the lands conquered by the King of Israel or a prophet with the consent of the entire Jewish people. This is called "a conquest of the community."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 5:6.</i> If, however, an individual Jew, a family, or a tribe go and conquer a place for themselves - even in the land given to Abraham<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam speaks of the land being given to Abraham, not merely being promised to him, since from the time God said that the land was his, spiritually, it became his possession. Moreover, as the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 5:1) states, from Abraham's time onward, even though the land was still possessed by the Canaanites, the Jews were already its legal owners. See also <i>Bava Batra</i> 119b.</i> - it is not considered as <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in the sense that one is obligated to observe all the mitzvot there.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the agricultural mitzvot that must be observed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> For this reason, Joshua<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A king and a prophet.</i> and his court divided the entire Land of Israel into tribal portions<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since Joshua and his court had made this division, when the tribe went to conquer its portion, it was acting on behalf of the entire Jewish people.</i> even though it was not conquered [entirely] at that time. In this way, when every tribe would ascend and conquer its portion, it would not be considered as merely an individual conquest.
The lands which [King] David conquered outside of the Land of Canaan, e.g., Aram Naharaim, Aram Tzovah, Achlab,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">These regions are located in contemporary Syria.</i> and the like, even though he was a King of Israel and he was acting with the consent of the High Court,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The wars to conquer these lands are classified as voluntary wars, and a voluntary law requires the consent of the High Court (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 5:1).</i> is not considered as the Land of Israel with regard to all matters, nor is it like the Diaspora, i.e., Babylonia and Egypt with regard to all matters. Instead, it was removed from the category of the Diaspora, but did not enter the category of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>Why was its level considered lower than that of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>? Because David conquered them before he conquered all of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 6:11) where he criticizes King David for this approach, quoting the <i>Sifri</i> (<i>Parshat Ekev</i>) that states that he did not act in accordance with the Torah. Since the designation of the land as <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is through Divine fiat as expressed through the Torah. Accordingly, a conquest that is not in accord with the Torah cannot bring about such a designation (<i>Likkutei Sichot,</i> Vol. V, p. 9).</i> Instead, there were still members of the seven nations there. If, however, he had conquered <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> entirely, in all of its boundaries, and afterwards conquered<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">With the consent of the High Court.</i> other lands,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even lands outside of the homeland promised to Abraham (Radbaz).</i> his entire conquest would have been equivalent to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> with regard to all matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">And the agricultural laws would have to be observed there.</i> The lands which [King] David conquered are called Syria.
There are dimensions of [the laws that apply to] Syria that resemble [the laws that apply in] <i>Eretz Yisrael</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to those points the Rambam mentions below, among the other examples of this principle are: its air is not considered as a source of impurity (<i>Hilchot Tuma'at Meit</i> 11:6); it is permitted to have a gentile compose a deed of purchase for land there on the Sabbath so that one will acquire the land (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 6:11).</i> and there are dimensions of [its laws] that resemble [those which apply] in the Diaspora.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Among the examples of the relevant laws: its earth is considered as a source of ritual impurity (<i>Hilchot Tuma'at Meit, loc. cit.</i>); a servant from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> sold there is granted his freedom (<i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 8:6).</i> A person who purchases landed property [in Syria] is comparable to one who purchases [land] in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> with regard to <i>terumot</i>, tithes, and the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 15.</i> All [the laws that apply] in Syria are of Rabbinic origin.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For according to Scriptural Law, it is not part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i>
All of the lands that [the Jews] who ascended from Egypt took possession of were sanctified in the first consecration [of the land]. When they were exiled, that sanctity was nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:16, the Rambam states: "It was no longer <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>," i.e., none of the halachic obligations apply there.</i> [The rationale is that] the initial consecration came about because of the conquest. [Hence,] its consecration was effective for the time [it was under their rule], but not for all time.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was established by conquest, it could be nullified by conquest. See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.</i> The Radbaz explains that when the Jews ascended from Egypt, they did not make a statement, consecrating the land. Therefore its holiness could be nullified.</i> When, by contrast, the descendants of the exiles ascended [from Babylon] and took possession of a portion of the land,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>Yevamot</i> 16a states: "Much of the land that was conquered by [the Jews who] ascended from Egypt was not conquered by [the Jews who] ascended from Babylon.</i> they consecrated it a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, since the entire Jewish people did not return together with Ezra, this consecration is only of Rabbinic origin.</i> [This consecration] is perpetuated forever, for that time and for all time.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">And thus at present, Ezra's consecration of the land is still effective.<br>In his gloss to <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.</i>, the <i>Kessef Mishnah</i> finds these statements difficult to accept because of the following questions:<br>a) On what basis is <i>chazakah</i> considered a more effective means of acquisition than conquest?<br>b) After the initial conquest of Eretz Yisrael, the Jewish people manifested their ownership over it and thus, effected a <i>chazakah</i>. If so, why is Ezra's <i>chazakah</i>, which was not preceded by conquest, more effective than the <i>chazakah</i> which followed the original conquest? Why should the conquest detract from the consecration of the land?<br>To explain: As mentioned above, the Jewish people's ownership of the land began with God's promise of the land to Abraham. The sanctity of the land, by contrast, did not begin until the Jewish people actually took possession of it, upon their reentry into the land after the exodus from Egypt and the journey through the desert. At that time, they were commanded to conquer the land and take it forcefully from the Gentiles (see Numbers 32:29,Deuteronomy 3:21, <i>et al</i>). Since God made the consecration of the land dependent upon its conquest by the Jewish people, it follows that conquest by a Gentile nation can nullify its holiness.<br>In contrast, Ezra was not commanded to reconquer <i>Eretz Yisrael,</i> but to settle it. In this instance, God made the sanctity of the land dependent on the Jewish people manifesting their ownership over it. In other words, the sanctity came from manifesting the true reality: that <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is a Jewish land. Accordingly, since <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> remains our land, regardless of how many times it has been conquered by Gentiles, the sanctity effected by that manifestation of ownership also continues eternally (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XV, pp. 102-109).</i><br>[The Sages] left those places that had been settled by [the Jews who] ascended from Egypt, but were not settled by those who ascended from Babylon in their previous [halachic status] and did not exempt them from [the obligations of] <i>terumah</i> and tithes so that the poor could rely upon them in the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">And receive the tithe of the poor.</i> Our holy teacher<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehudah <i>HaNasi</i>.</i> released Beit Shan<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that Beit Shan was released only from those obligations that are of Rabbinic origin.</i> from those places which [the Jews] who ascended from Babylon did not take hold of. He decided that Ashkelon should be exempted from the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> relates that Rabbi Yehudah <i>HaNasi</i> released these cities from the obligation of the tithes, because they were not populated by Jews and were not close to the area settled by Jews.</i>
Thus the entire earth is divided into three categories in relation to those mitzvot involving the land: <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, Syria, and the Diaspora. <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> itself is divided into two categories: a) those portions settled by the Jews who ascended from Babylonia, and b) those portions that were settled only by the Jews who ascended from Egypt.<br>The Diaspora is divided into two categories: a) Egypt, Babylon, Ammon, and Moab in which the mitzvot are observed according to the decrees of the sages and the prophets and the other lands in which [the obligations of] the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes are not observed.
What are [the boundaries of] the land settled by the Jews who ascended from Egypt? From Rekem which is in the east of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> until the Mediterranean Sea. From Ashkelon<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ashkelon - and similarly, the other cities the Rambam refers to - is located near, but not exactly on the same site - as the city presently called by that name. With regard to Ashkelon in particular, there is discussion of the issue by the commentaries, for some sources (see Radbaz and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>) explain that it was part of the land conquered by the Jews who ascended from Egypt. It was not, however, conquered by the Jews who ascended from Babylonia.</i> which is in the south of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> until Acre which is in the north. As one proceeds from Acre to Kziv,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., proceeding northward.</i> the area to one's right, on the east, can generally be assumed to be of the Diaspora - it is impure as is the lands of the nations<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages decreed that merely touching the earth of the Diaspora is sufficient to impart ritual impurity. See <i>Hilchot Tuma'at Meit</i>, ch. 11.</i> and is exempt from [the mitzvot of] the tithes and the Sabbatical year - unless it is known that it was part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The area to one's left, to the west, can generally be assumed to be part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> - it is pure [from the impurity associated with] the lands of the nations and is obligated with regard to [mitzvot of] the tithes and the Sabbatical year - unless it is known to be part of the Diaspora.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as depicted in the map drawn by the Rambam to accompany the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the borders of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> ascend northward from Acre to Kziv, but there is a strip of land in the center that did not become part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> With regard to the entire area that slopes downward from the Samnum Mountains:<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Our text is based on authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as cited in the Rav Shabsie Frankel edition. The standard printed text refers to the Umenum Mountains. See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 6:1).<br>In the map the Rambam drew to depict this matter, the Samnum Mountains are located in the southeastern corner of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, near Ashkelon. Most of the other commentaries understand this term as referring to the Umenum Mountain range in Northern Lebanon.</i> The inner [portion]<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to the south.</i> is <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the portion outside the Samnum Mountains is the Diaspora.<br>With regard to the islands in the sea, we consider their [status dependent] on an [imaginary] line extended from the Samnum Mountains until the River of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Radbaz, this refers to Wadi el Arish and not the Nile. Most other commentaries, however, identify "the River of Egypt" as the Nile.</i> Those within this line are part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Those outside this line are part of the Diaspora. This is a depiction of the matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Rambam included the accompanying map so that the matter would be clearly understood.. This reflects his thrust throughout the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: to provide his readers with an applicable text without any ambiguity.</i>
Which area did the Jews who ascended from Babylonia settle in? [The area] from Kziv inward toward the east. They did not, however, take possession of the area from Kziv outward until Amana which is Samnum until the river, i.e., the River of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it appears that the entire coastal range of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was not settled by the Jews who ascended from Babylon.</i> And they did not take possession of Kziv itself.
What constitutes Syria? From <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and below<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The term "below" in this context is problematic. It does not mean "south," because significant portions of Syria are more northerly than <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Some commentaries understand it as meaning in height, because as <i>Kiddushin</i> 69b states, <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is higher than other lands.</i> parallel to Aram Naharaim and Aram Tzovah, the entire region of the Euphrates until Babylonia, e.g., Damascus, Achalev, Charan, Minbag, and the like until Shinar<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Shinar itself, however, is part of the Diaspora, as evident from Halachah 1.</i> and Tzahar. These are considered like Syria. Acre, by contrast, is considered part of the Diaspora, like Ashkelon.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, there are commentaries who consider Ashkelon to be part of the land conquered by the Jews who ascended from Egypt, but not that conquered by the Jews ascending from Babylonia. Some also place Acre in this category.</i> These are the boundaries of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
When a gentile purchases land in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, he does not cause it to be absolved from [the observance of] the mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachah for the practical application of this principle.</i> Instead, its holiness is still intact.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 47a derives this concept from Leviticus 25:23: "The entire land is Mine." Implied is that the land belongs to God and His ownership cannot be absolved through conquest by any earthly power.<br>This ruling was a point of question for the Rambam. As indicated by the notes of Rav Kappach to his translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 4:9; <i>Gittin</i> 4:9, <i>et al</i>), the Rambam changed his mind concerning the issue several times and amended his text of the Commentary to the Mishnah accordingly. At first, he stated the opinion quoted here, then adopted the opposite view, that a gentile's acquisition does cause the agricultural obligations to be absolved, and finally returned to his original position. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:3-4) follow the Rambam's ruling here. See also <i>Hilchot Shemitah VeYovel</i> 4:29 where this issue is also discussed.</i> Therefore, if a Jew purchases this land from [the gentile], it is not considered as a private conquest.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the agriculture laws would not be applicable, as stated in Halachah 2.</i> Instead, he should separate the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes and bring the first fruits. All these [obligations] are Scriptural in origin, as if it was never sold to a gentile. When a gentile acquires land in Syria, his acquisition has the power to absolve [the land] from the obligations of tithes and the Sabbatical year,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The entire obligation to observe the agricultural laws in Syria is Rabbinic in origin (Halachah 4) and our Sages did not enforce their decrees in this instance.</i> as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Halachot 15-19.</i>
[The following laws apply with regard to] produce belonging to a gentile that grew on land that he purchased in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. If all the work involving the produce was completed in the possession of a gentile and the gentile straightened the edges of the grain heap,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., completed the work involved in preparing them. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 3:13.</i> they are exempt, because [the verse mentioning the obligation to separate <i>terumah</i>, Deuteronomy 18:4] mentions "your grain," [thus excluding] the grain of a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">From the interpretation of the term by the Sages (<i>Bechorot</i> 11b), the intent seems to be that not only that the grain must belong to a Jew, but that he must perform the work to complete its preparation for use.</i><br>If a Jew purchases [the produce] after it was harvested, but before the tasks involved with it were completed and they were completed by a Jew, all [of the agricultural obligations apply with regard to the produce] according to Scriptural Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for the produce to be obligated in the agricultural laws according to Scriptural Law, it must belong to the Jew and the Jew must complete the work involved with preparing it. If only one of these conditions was met, the obligations must be fulfilled only because of Rabbinic decree. See Halachah 13.</i> He must separate the great <i>terumah</i> and give it to a priest and [separate] the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and sell it to a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>terumat ma'aser</i> is sold to the priest and not given to him for the reason explained shortly afterwards by the Rambam. It cannot be kept by the owner, because he is forbidden to partake of it. Instead, it is consecrated and must be eaten by a priest in a state of ritual purity (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:10).</i> The first tithe belongs to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he must separate the first tithe to fulfill the agricultural obligations incumbent upon the produce, but is not obligated to give it to the Levites. There is no difficulty in him keeping the tithes, because, as the Rambam explains, he is not obligated to give them to the Levite and there is no prohibition against him partaking of them, because they are not consecrated at all and any person may partake of them, even when he is not in a state of ritual purity.</i> because he can tell a Levite with regard to the tithes and a priest with regard to the <i>terumat ma'aser</i>: "I am coming in the stead of a person<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The gentile.</i> from which you could not have collected anything."<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Had the gentile completed the tasks associated with preparing the grain, he would not have been under any obligation to make any of these separations. Hence, although the Jew is obligated to separate the various allocations, the obligation is primarily a ritual one and not a financial one. With the exception of the great <i>terumah</i>, he is not obligated to accept any loss and may keep the first tithes for himself.</i><br>Why do we say that he should not give the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> to a priest as [he gives him] the great <i>terumah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., like the first tithe, the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> must be separated, but it need not be given to the priest.</i> Because with regard to <i>terumat ma'aser,</i> it is written: "When you take the tithes from the children of Israel...."<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">There is, by contrast, no such verse stated with regard to the great <i>terumah</i>. Hence, it is not considered the property of the owner, but instead, must be given - and not sold - to a priest.</i> [Implied is that from] untithed produce that you purchase from a Jew, you should separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and give it to a priest, but from untithed produce that you purchase from a gentile, you need not give the priest the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> you separate from it. Instead, you sell it to the priest and take the money.
[The following laws apply if] a gentile sold his produce to a Jew while it was connected to the earth. If [he sold it] before it developed to a stage when he is obligated to separate tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See below and <i>Hilchot Ma'aserot</i> 2:5 for a definition of this concept.</i> and the work [associated with it] was completed while it was owned by the Jew, [the Jew] is responsible for all of the agricultural obligations and should give the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes to their [appropriate] owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the tithes to a Levite and the <i>terumot</i> to a priest. It is as if the produce grew on land belonging to the Jew from the outset.</i> If [the gentile] sold [the produce] after it developed to a stage when he is obligated to separate tithes, he should separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and the tithes and give them to their [appropriate] owners according to the [acceptable] reckoning.<br>What is implied? If he purchased grain that had been sown from a gentile after it reached a third of its growth and the work associated with its completion was performed while it was in the possession of a Jew, he should separate the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as explained in the previous halachah and notes, the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes must be separated even if they - or a portion of them - are kept by the owner.</i> He should give two thirds of the tithes to a Levite.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">He may keep one-third of the tithes as his own. The rationale is that since the produce reached one third of its growth in the possession of the gentile, the Jew is not liable to give away the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and the tithes for that portion of the crop. With regard to that portion, the concepts stated in the previous halachah apply. With regard to the remaining two thirds, it is considered as produce owned by a Jew and is obligated in all agricultural laws.</i> [With regard to the] <i>terumat ma'aser</i>, he should give two thirds to the priest and sell him one third.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in the previous halachah, he must give the great <i>terumah</i> to the priest without receiving any return whatsoever.</i>
[The following laws apply if] a Jew sold his produce to a gentile before it developed to a stage when he is obligated to separate tithes and the work [associated with it] was completed by the gentiles, it is exempt from the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">It is as if the produce grew in the possession of the gentile from the outset in which instance, they are exempt from all agricultural obligations, as stated in Halachah 11.<br>The Ra'avad objects to this ruling based on the principle stated in Halachah 10: "When a gentile purchases land in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, he does not cause it to be absolved from [the observance of] the mitzvot. Instead, its holiness is still intact." The Radbaz explains that this principle applies only when the gentile purchases the land, but not when he purchases merely produce. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:6) quotes the Rambam's view.</i> If [he purchased it] after it developed to a stage when the tithes are obligated to be separated, even if the gentile completed the work associated with it, all of the agricultural obligations are incumbent upon it according to Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the produce is later sold to a Jew, the Jew must separate the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes. The rationale is that since the produce grew in a Jew's possession, it is considered as Jewish produce.</i><br>Similarly, if a gentile completed [the work associated with] produce belonging to a Jew,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the interpretation of Rav Yosef Corcus as quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. He explains that, based on the exegesis of Deuteronomy 18:4 by <i>Bechorot</i> 11b (see Halachah 11 and notes), as long as the work is completed by a gentile, the fact that the produce belongs to a Jew is not significant.</i> since the work associated with them was completed by a gentile, the obligation for <i>terumot</i> and tithes is incumbent upon them, but it is only Rabbinic in origin.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In one of his responsa, the Rambam writes (based on <i>Menachot</i> 67a) that this decree was enacted lest Jewish landowners have gentiles complete the work associated with the crops to avoid having to separate the tithes.</i>
If a gentile sold produce that was still connected to the earth after it reached the stage when the tithes are obligated to be separated and [another] gentile straightened the edges of the grain heap in the possession of a Jew, [the produce] is not obligated in the <i>terumot</i> or the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even according to Rabbinic Law.</i> Since the produce reached the stage when the tithes are obligated to be separated in the possession of a gentile and a gentile straightened the edges of the grain heap,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., performs the task which completes the work associated with the produce at which time the obligation to separate the <i>terumot</i> and tithes takes effect.</i> [the fact] the produce belongs to a Jew [is not significant].<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is as if the produce belonged entirely to the gentile and the laws stated in Halachah 11 apply.</i>
When a person purchases a field in Syria, he is obligated by Rabbinic decree to separate <i>terumot</i> and tithes like one who purchases [a field] in Jerusalem<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to the wording of <i>Challah</i> 4:11: "One who purchases [land] in Syria is comparable to one who purchases [land] in the suburbs of Jerusalem."</i> according to Scriptural Law, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 4.</i> If, however, a person [merely] purchases produce from a gentile - whether it was harvested or [still] connected to the earth - he is exempt, because [the produce] does not come from his land.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Since the entire obligation to separate the <i>terumot</i> and tithes in Syria is Rabbinic in origin, our Sages applied it only when the Jew owned the land itself. Since the obligation to separate tithes when one purchases produce alone is merely Rabbinic in origin even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, our Sages did not apply it in Syria.</i> [This applies] even if [he purchases the produce] before it develops to a stage when the tithes are obligated to be separated [and] even though a Jew straightened the edges of the grain heap.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., performs the task which completes the work associated with the produce at which time the obligation to separate the <i>terumot</i> and tithes takes effect.</i>
[The following laws apply when a person] purchases land in Syria to which produce is attached. If it reached a stage when the tithes are obligated to be separated while in the possession of a gentile, it is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is considered as if it was the gentile's produce entirely.</i> [Conversely,] if it did not reach a stage when the tithes are obligated to be separated [in his possession],<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The previous growth of the produce is not significant.</i> [the Jewish purchaser] is obligated to tithe it, since he purchased it together with the land.
When a Jew is working as a sharecropper for a gentile in Syria, his produce is exempt from the tithes, because he does not own the land itself at all. A gentile's purchase of land in Syria causes it to be absolved from [the obligation of] the tithes, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 10.</i> The same laws apply when one rents a field, but stipulates that the payment will be made in produce,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's definition of the term <i>chocher</i> in <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 8:1.</i> enters into a sharecropping agreement as a <i>mekabel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Both the terms <i>aris</i> and <i>mekabel</i> refer to sharecropping agreements. The difference between them is that an <i>aris</i> is working for the owner of the field for a percentage of the crops (see <i>Hilchot Shluchin</i> 8:5), while a <i>mekabel</i> is renting the field from the owner for a percentage of the crops (<i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 8:2).</i> or rents a field for money from a gentile in Syria, he is absolved [from the obligations of] <i>terumot</i> and tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The motivating principle behind these laws is that renting the field is not equivalent to purchasing it, for the land itself does not become his (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 15a).<br>In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, by contrast, a person entering any one of these types of agreements would be obligated to separate the tithes (Radbaz).</i>
[The following law applies when] a Jew purchases a field from a gentile in Syria before [the crops] reached a third of their development and sells it to a gentile after the crops reach a third of their development. If a Jew purchases it a second time,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> who debates whether, to be obligated, the Jew must purchase the field or it is sufficient for him to purchase the produce alone without purchasing the land.

When a Jew owns land in Syria and he hired a sharecropper and the sharecropper sent him produce,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">As payment of the produce due the owner from his field.</i> he is not obligated to separate [the <i>terumot</i> and tithes], for it is possible to say that [the sharecropper] purchased [the produce he gave him] from the marketplace.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we allow for the possibility that the sharecropper sold the produce from the field and then purchased other produce to pay the owner his due. The rationale for this leniency is that since the obligation to tithe in Syria is Rabbinic in origin, as long as we are not definitely certain that it applies, we rule leniently. In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, he would have to separate the tithes (Radbaz).</i> [This applies] provided this species is available in the marketplace.
There is an obligation [to separate] the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes [from crops grown on land owned in] partnership with a gentile.<br>What is implied? When a Jew and a non-Jew purchased a field in partnership - even if they divided the field while the grain was standing,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">In such a situation, there is room to say that the principle of <i>bereirah</i> applies. <i>Bereirah</i> means that retroactively, it is considered as if the division that was ultimately made was made at the outset (see <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 7:1). To explain within the context of the present situation: Were a portion of the field to belong to the gentile, there would be no obligation to separate the tithes from the grain that grew in that portion. To apply the principle of <i>bereirah</i> would mean that, after the division of the crops, it is clarified that at the outset, the portion of the field where the crops given to the gentile grew belonged to him. There is a debate among the Sages whether the principle of <i>bereirah</i> can be applied and with regard to halachah, the accepted general principle is that in question of Scriptural Law, it does not apply. Thus in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, where the obligation to tithe is one of Scriptural Law, we do not accept this principle and maintain that the Jew has a share in the grain given to the gentile and hence, it is under obligation to be tithed.</i> and needless to say, if they divided it after it was collected in a grain heap<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, all authorities agree that the principle of <i>bereirah</i> is not applied.</i> - <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Produce which is forbidden because the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes were not separated from it.</i> and ordinary produce are mixed together in each and every stalk of grain in the gentile's share.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Hence if a Jew purchases that produce, he must separate the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes.</i> [This applies] even if the gentile straightened the edges of the grain heap and thus the obligation is Rabbinic in origin,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">In such an instance, there is room to say that the principle of <i>bereirah</i> should be applied, because the obligation to separate the tithes is Rabbinic in origin.

When does the above apply? In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, where [the obligation to] tithe is Scriptural in origin, and according to Scriptural Law, the principle of <i>bereirah</i> does not apply. If, however, he purchased a field in Syria, since [the obligation to] tithe there is Rabbinic in origin, even if they divided a grain heap, the portion of the gentile is exempt entirely.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting these laws, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:11) states that in the present age, when the obligation to separate <i>terumot</i> and tithes in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is Rabbinic in origin (see Halachah 26), the laws applying to produce grown in Syria also apply to produce grown in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i>
When produce from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is taken to the Diaspora, it is exempt from the obligations of <i>challah</i>, the <i>terumot</i>, and the tithes, [for one of the prooftexts requiring the separation of these gifts, Numbers 15:18]<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">And from that verse which speaks of the obligation to separate <i>challah</i>, we learn that one is also obligated to separate the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes.</i> states: "[the land] to which I am bringing you." [Implied is that] these obligations exist there alone. In the Diaspora, one is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the exemption from the obligation to tithe applies only according to Scriptural Law. According to Rabbinic Law, all authorities agree that one is obligated, for this produce is comparable to that of Ammon and Moav. The Radbaz does not accept this perspective, stating that there is no source which maintains that a Rabbinic obligation exists. The Radbaz does, however, qualify the Rambam's ruling, explaining that it applies only when the work that makes the produce obligated to be tithed is completed in the Diaspora. If this work is completed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the obligation to separate the tithes has already been incurred and they must be separated even if the produce was later taken to the Diaspora. For this reason, in most instances, <i>terumah</i> and tithes must be separated from produce that is grown in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in the present age and later exported to the Diaspora. This, however, applies to fruits only, not vegetables as stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 6.</i> If [the produce] was taken to Syria, one is obligated by Rabbinic decree.<br>Conversely, we are obligated [to separate] <i>challah</i> from produce from the Diaspora that was brought into <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, as [suggested by the phrase] "to which." [Implied is that] one is liable [to make these gifts] there, whether the produce is from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> or the Diaspora. If the obligation [to separate <i>challah</i> or the tithes] was established [because of the actions] of a Jew after the produce entered <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, there is an obligation of Rabbinic origin to separate the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions why the obligation to separate the tithes is only of Rabbinic origin. Since the concept is based on the exegesis of the same Biblical term as mentioned above, if the work that made the produce obligated to be tithed was performed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, why is the obligation not Scriptural in origin? The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> answers that since the prooftext mentions "the bread of the land," one can conclude that the obligation applies only to produce grown in the Holy Land itself. Alternatively, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> suggests that indeed if the work that makes the produce obligated to be tithed is completed only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the obligation is indeed Scriptural in origin. This ruling is quoted by the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:22.</i>

For if as stated there, everything depends on where the work that makes the produce obligated in the tithes is completed, of what difference does it make where the produce grows. That text explains that if the person separates tithes from produce that grew in the Diaspora before the work that makes the produce obligated in the tithes is completed, even if that work is completed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the tithes separated are not significant. For at the time, they were separated, there was no obligation to tithe the produce.</i> If some of its roots were in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and others were in the Diaspora - even if they were separated by glistening stone, [it is considered as if] <i>tevel</i> and ordinary produce are mixed together [throughout the entire produce].

Nevertheless, it can be explained that at that time, they were expecting the majority of the people to return and then, the status of the mitzvah would revert to that of Scriptural origin.

Chapter 3

There is no minimum requirement for the great <i>terumah</i> according to Scriptural Law, as [implied by Deuteronomy 18:4]: "The first of your grain," i.e., even the slightest amount. Even one kernel of grain fulfills the requirement for the entire grain heap. Idealy, one should separate only according to the measures specified by our Sages. In the present age, when [the <i>terumah</i>] will be burnt because of impurity, a person may separate even the smallest amount as an initial and prefatory measure.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since the produce will ultimately be burnt, there is no purpose in setting aside more than the very minimum. The Radbaz notes that the priests are also given the opportunity to benefit from impure <i>terumah</i>, because they use it as fuel. Why then shouldn't they be given a full measure of impure <i>terumah</i>? He explains that since this is not the primary use of <i>terumah</i>, our Sages did not feel that for the minimal benefit the priest receives from burning the <i>terumah</i>, it was necessary to require the people to separate a larger amount.</i>
What is the measure that our Sages established? A generous measure is one fourtieth [of the crop]. The average [measure] is one fiftieth and a parsimonious measure is one sixtieth.
Idealy, we may separate one sixtieth [of the crop] as <i>terumah</i> from species to which the priests do not pay attention, e.g., carobs<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 1:3, there are certain species of carobs which are generally not eaten by humans. There is no obligation to separate <i>terumah</i> from them according to Scriptural Law.

Nevertheless, since they are not considered important by the priests, there is no need to separate more than the minimal amount.</i> and <i>kilisin</i> beans.<br>[Similarly,] we [may separate] one sixtieth [of the crop as <i>terumah</i>] in the following situations: <i>terumah</i> separated from produce grown from <i>terumah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Chapter 11, Halachot 21 and 27, when produce that is <i>terumah</i> is sown, according to Scriptural Law, the produce which grows is ordinary produce and <i>terumah</i> and tithes must be separated from it. Nevertheless, our Sages were stringent and declared that the entire crop should be considered as <i>terumah</i> and sold to the priests (at a price substantially less than that of ordinary produce). Since the owners are required to consider the entire crop as <i>terumah</i>, our Sages did not require them to separate more than a sixtieth to be given as <i>terumah</i> (<i>Tosefta, Terumot</i>, ch. 5).</i> <i>terumah</i> that is mixed [with <i>tevel</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which <i>terumah</i> and tithes were not separated.

Since the person is already separating the amount of <i>terumah</i> from the mixture, our Sages did not require him to separate a large quantity of <i>terumah</i> from the <i>tevel</i>.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> does not accept that position and quotes sources in support of the Rambam's view.</i>
When a Levite possessed [produce from] the first tithe from which <i>terumat ma'aser</i> was not separated and he left it so that he could continuously separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> [for other crops] from it while it is still <i>tevel</i>, his actions are viable. [This is derived from Numbers 18:24]: "For the tithes of the children of Israel [from] which they will separate <i>terumah</i>...." Implied is that [the tithes] can be transformed into <i>terumat [ma'aser]</i> in their entirety.
If one separated <i>terumat ma'aser</i> first and then left [the produce] so that one could continually separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for other produce from it until it becomes <i>terumat ma'aser</i> in its entirety, at which he would give it to a priest, his actions are of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">And it is as if <i>terumat ma'aser</i> has never been separated for the produce for which he intended that it serve that purpose.</i> [This is derived from <i>ibid.</i>:29]: "The sacred portion from it."

Chapter 4

A person may appoint an agent to separate <i>terumah</i> and the tithes for him, as [Numbers 18:28] states: "So shall you separate, also you." [The wording implies] the inclusion of an agent.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">By saying "also you," the verse implies that there is someone other than you - an agent - that may also separate <i>terumah</i> [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumah</i> 1:1)].</i> A gentile may not be appointed as an agent, because [the phrase] "also you" [implies an equation between you and your agent]. Just as you are a member of the covenant, your agent must be a member of the covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle applying not only with regard to <i>terumah</i>. A gentile cannot serve as an agent for a Jew in any matter (<i>Kiddushin</i> 41b).</i>
There are five [types of individuals] who should not separate <i>terumah</i> and [even] if they do, [the produce] they separated is not considered as <i>terumah</i>: A deaf-mute,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumah</i> 1:2) although the term <i>cheresh</i> refers to someone who cannot hear, in a halachic context, the intent is someone who also cannot speak. He is referred to as a <i>cheresh</i> because it is his inability to hear that prevents him from learning how to speak.</i> a mentally or emotionally unstable person, a minor,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These three individuals are considered as incapable of controlling their affairs. Hence they are not obligated in the observance of the Torah and its mitzvot. Just as they are not responsible for themselves, they cannot discharge the responsibilities of others.</i> a gentile who separated <i>terumah</i> from produce belonging to a Jew, even with his permission,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated above, a gentile cannot act as an agent for a Jew.</i> and a person who separates <i>terumah</i> from produce that does not belong to him without the owner's permission.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If he is granted the owner's permission, he is considered as his agent and the separation is effective as stated above.</i> If, however, a person separates <i>terumah</i> from his own produce for the produce of others, the produce is <i>terumah</i> and [the colleague's] produce has been prepared for use. The satisfaction [of allocating the <i>terumah</i>] belongs [to the person who separated it and he may] give to whichever priest he desires.
[The following rules apply when a person] separates <i>terumah</i> [from a colleague's produce] without permission or descends into his colleague's field and gathered produce without permission so that he could take them [for himself], but separate some as <i>terumah</i>. When the owner comes and says: "You should have taken better ones,"<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on Rashi's commentary (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 22a).</i> if there are better ones than those separated as <i>terumah,</i> the separation is effective,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">According to this approach, the statement "You should have taken better ones" is understood simply. The owner in truth desired that the person give the priest the best produce possible as <i>terumah</i>.</i> because [the owner] did not object.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Thus we consider it as if the person acted with the owner's consent and thus functioned as his agent. Since a mitzvah is involved and ultimately, he consented, we assume that this was his intent from the outset (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Also, implied is that the owner was willing to allow the person to take a certain amount of the produce as his own. Note the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 331:15 who maintains that the Rambam's ruling runs contrary to the simple meaning of the passage in <i>Bava Metzia, loc. cit.</i>, and rejects the resolutions offered by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. Note, also, the contrast to <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 5:8.</i> If there are not better ones, his separation is not effective, for his statements were made as an objection.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we assume that he was speaking facetiously.</i> If the owner came and gathered produce and added it to the quantity separated,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">We interpret that as an expression of consent to the other person's actions.</i> whether he possesses better produce or not, his separation is effective.
There are five<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumah</i> 1:4 also mentions a person who had a seminal emission. He is prohibited, because he is not allowed to recite a blessing until he immerses himself in a <i>mikveh</i>.

In the present age, such a person should recite blessings even though he has not yet immersed.</i> who should not separate <i>terumah</i>, but if they do, their separation is effective:<br>a person who is deaf, but not mute, because he cannot hear the blessing,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This category is not mentioned in the mishnah, <i>loc. cit.</i> The Rambam mentions it, based on the principle (see <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:7) that a person who recites a blessing should recite it in a manner that enables him to hear it.</i> a mute who can hear, but not speak and a person who is naked, because they cannot recite the blessing,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A person who cannot speak is physically incapable of reciting the blessing. A person who is naked is forbidden to recite the blessing, because his personal state is not considered as appropriate for the recitation of a blessing (see <i>Shabbat</i> 23b).</i> and a person who is drunk<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is speaking about a person who is slightly intoxicated, but still able to function. If a person is intoxicated to the extent that is not at all in command of his mental faculties, he is considered as one who is intellectually incapable and his separation is of no consequence whatsoever. See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 29:18.</i> and a blind person, because they cannot make distinctions and separate the most attractive portion [as <i>terumah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And as an initial and preferable measure, the finest portion of the produce should be separated as <i>terumah</i> (see Chapter 5, Halachah 1). When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:32) states that in the present age, when the <i>terumah</i> is ultimately destroyed, we are not precise in separating the finest portion of the crops as <i>terumah</i>. Hence, it is also acceptable if individuals in the latter two categories also separate <i>terumah</i>.</i>
When a minor reaches the age when his vows may be of consequence<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a male minor who is twelve years old and a female minor who is eleven years old, provided they know the significance of vows, or a male of thirteen and a female of twelve who have not manifested signs of physical maturity, .</i> - even though he has not manifested signs of physical maturity and he has not attained majority - separates <i>terumah</i>, his separation is of consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In one of his responsa, however, the Rambam writes that as an initial preference, it is not desirable for a minor to separate <i>terumah</i> until he manifests signs of physical maturity.</i> [This applies] even with regard to <i>terumah</i> mandated by Scriptural Law.

When a person tells his agent: "Go and separate <i>terumah</i> for me" and he goes to separate <i>terumah</i>, but [the principal] does not know whether he [actually] separated <i>terumah</i> or not, [even] when he discovers that <i>terumah</i> was separated from the granary, we do not assume that [he] separated <i>terumah</i>. For with regard to prohibitions, we apply the principle:<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 31b; <i>Gittin</i> 64a,b <i>et al</i>.</i> "An agent can be assumed to have carried out his mission," only when that leads to a stringency, not when it leads to a leniency.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we are uncertain whether we can rely on the fact that an agent will carry out his mission. Hence, if his doing so would lead to a prohibition, we rule stringently and assume that he carried out his mission (see <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 9:6). If, however, his doing so would lead to a leniency, we do not make such an assumption.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:34) quotes the Rambam's ruling. The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama, however, rule that in such a situation, we can assume that the agent carried out his mission, for failing to do so would create a spiritual stumbling block for the principal.</i> [Instead,] we suspect that another person separated the <i>terumah</i> without his permission.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the separation of <i>terumah</i> would not be effective, as stated in Halachah 2.</i>
When a person tells his agent: "Go and separate <i>terumah</i>," he should separate according to the temperament of the owner. If he knows that he is parsimonious, he should separate one sixtieth. If he was generous, he should separate one fortieth. If he does not know his temperament, he should make the average separation, one fiftieth. If he intended to make the average separation, but it turned out that he separated one fortieth or one sixtieth, his separation is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 4:4), the Rambam writes that if the agent gave more or less than the average measure unintentionally, his separation is effective. In contrast to the situation described in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, here the agent is acting with the principal's permission. Hence, even if he deviated from the amount he could be expected to give, his act is of consequence.</i> If he intended to add to the average separation, and he separated even one forty-ninth,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.

There is an obligation to separate <i>terumah</i> and tithes from produce belonging to partners, for [Numbers 18:28] speaks of "your tithes," [using a plural term,] implying even from two people.<br>Partners do not have to receive permission from each other. Instead, whenever anyone separates <i>terumah</i>, the separation is effective.

The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that in fact, the Rambam himself accepts this concept in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 9:20 with regard to appointing an agent to consecrate a woman as one's wife. Both of these commentaries quote possible rationales to distinguish between the separation of <i>terumah</i> and the consecration of a woman.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:36) quotes the Rambam's ruling, while the Rama cites that of the Ra'avad and the <i>Tur</i>.</i> If he did deviate, e.g., the principal told him: "Separate from the northern side," and he separated from the southern side, since he nullified the agency previously, the separation is not effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Here too, the <i>Tur</i> questions the Rambam's wording. Seemingly, since the agent deviated from the principal's instructions, the agency is nullified even if the principal did not state that he was nullifying it.

Workers do not have license to separate <i>terumah</i> without the consent of the owner with the exception of those who tread grapes in the vat. [They are given this license because] if they desired to make the wine impure, they could do so immediately.

When a gentile separates <i>terumah</i> from his own produce, according to Scriptural Law, the separation is not effective, because he is not obligated to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 11.

When a person [makes a separation and] intends to say <i>terumah</i>, but instead says tithes, or intends to say tithes, but instead says <i>terumah</i>, his statement is of no consequence unless his mouth and his heart are in accord.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For the separation of <i>terumah</i> is equivalent to a vow and when making a vow, one's intent and one's statements must be in accord (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:75).</i><br>If one separates <i>terumah</i> in his mind without uttering anything verbally, the separation is effective, as [implied by Numbers 18:27]: "And your <i>terumah</i> will be considered<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Venechshav</i> translated as "considered" shares the root <i>chashav</i> meaning "thought," thus leading to the interpretation (<i>Beitzah</i> 13b) that <i>terumah</i> can be separated through thought alone.

[The following rules apply when a person] separates <i>terumah</i> with a stipulation. If the stipulation is fulfilled, the separation is effective.

[The following rules apply when a person] separates <i>terumah</i> from a cistern of wine, saying: <sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he lets down a utensil into the cistern, allows it to fill, and makes the stipulation cited. Making the stipulation is desirable so that if the <i>terumah</i> falls back into the cistern - because the container breaks or because the wine spills from it - it does not cause the remaining wine to become <i>meduma</i> (mixed with <i>terumah</i>). As indicated by the following halachah, it is preferable to do this - instead of separating the <i>terumah</i> after the container has been lifted from the cistern, so that the <i>terumah</i> and the produce from which it is being separated will be in the same location (see Chapter 3, Halachah 17).</i> "Behold [the contents of] this [container] are <i>terumah</i> on the condition that it ascends intact [from the cistern]," [for the condition to have been met, the container] must ascend intact from being broken or spilt. [The stipulation does not cover the wine] becoming impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is not a frequent occurrence, we do not assume the person had it in mind when he made the stipulation.</i> If [the container] is broken [and the wine] spills back into the cistern, it does not cause the mixture to become <i>meduma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>meduma</i> refers to a mixture of <i>terumah</i> and ordinary produce, as explained in Chapter 13, Halachah 2. In this instance, although the wine in the container flows back into the cistern after it was designated as <i>terumah</i>, since that designation was made conditionally and the condition was not fulfilled, the wine separated is not considered as <i>terumah</i>. Hence the mixture is not <i>meduma</i>.</i> If [he lifted the container from the cistern and] put it in a place where if it breaks or rolls, it will not reach the cistern, [should the wine later spill into the cistern], it causes the mixture to become <i>meduma</i>, because the stipulation was fulfilled.
When does the above apply? With regard to the great <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For, as mentioned above, the <i>terumah</i> and the produce from which it is being separated should be in the same location.</i> With regard to <i>terumat ma'aser</i>, by contrast, [different rules apply] because it is permitted to make this separation from produce that is not in the same place.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 20.</i> [Hence as soon as the container] ascends [from the cistern], his stipulation is considered to have been fulfilled and [the wine separated] is <i>terumat ma'aser</i>, even though [afterwards, the container] breaks or [the wine] spills.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for the Rambam's ruling can be explained as follows: <i>Terumat ma'aser</i> can be separated when the produce is not in the same place as the produce for which it is being separated. Hence, were the person making the separation to be concerned that the produce separated as <i>terumat ma'aser</i> might fall into the cistern, he should have made the separation outside the cistern. The fact that he did not do so, nor make a specific statement acknowledging this possibility in his stipulation shows that this was not the intent motivating his stipulation. Hence, as soon as the container ascends from the cistern, his condition is met, even if the wine spills back in afterwards.</i> Needless to say, this applies if [the <i>terumat ma'aser</i>] becomes impure.
When a person says: "The produce in the upper portion [of this container] is <i>terumah</i> and that in its lower portion is ordinary produce" or "The produce in the upper portion [of this container] is ordinary produce and that in its lower portion is <i>terumah</i>," his statements are effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even though physically, the produce was not separated, since a separation was made in the mind of the owner, it is sufficient and it is permitted to eat from the portion of the produce that is designated as "ordinary."</i> For the matter is dependent on the thought of the person making the separation.
When a person separates <i>terumah</i> from [grain in] a granary, he must have the intent in his heart that [the produce separated] will be <i>terumah</i> for this grain heap, the stalks of wheat that were cut [and not threshed], [the grain] on the side of the grain heap, and [the kernels] in the straw.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 5:4), the Rambam writes that the intent is that he should separate <i>terumah</i> for the entire crop, that which he sees and that which he does not see.</i> When a person separates <i>terumah</i> from a vat [of wine], he must have the intent in his heart that he is separating <i>terumah</i> for [the wine absorbed] in the kernels and the peels.<br>When a person separates <i>terumah</i> from a cistern of wine,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:50) speaks of a vat of oil. There are some who maintain that the wording in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> should also read in that manner. Nevertheless, the authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> read as above.</i> he must have the intent in his heart that he is separating <i>terumah</i> for [the wine absorbed] in the peat.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the dregs. In truth, the term <i>gefet</i> is used more frequently in connection with oil than with wine.</i> [in all the above instances,] if he separates <i>terumah</i> without having a specific intent, all of the produce is included. For it is a condition of the court that [when one separates <i>terumah</i>, it] includes everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, since we assume that every Jew desires to perform the mitzvot in keeping with our Sages' desires, it is as if the person separating the <i>terumah</i> had this intent in mind. Preferably, however, a person should consciously have such thoughts when separating <i>terumah</i>.</i> When a person separates <i>terumah</i> from a basket of figs and other figs are found at the side of the basket, <i>terumah</i> need not be separated from them, because in his heart, a person has the intent to separate <i>terumah</i> for all the produce.

It is impossible that a vat will be partially pure and partially impure, so, too, <i>terumah</i> and the produce for which it is being separated must be either pure or impure."</i> If, however, one separated <i>terumah</i> [in this manner], the separation is effective [after the fact].<br>It is a halachah conveyed to Moses at Sinai that when a portion of a cake of dried figs has become impure, we may separate <i>terumah</i> from the pure portion of it for the impure portion of it as an initial preference.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 2:1), the Rambam explains the rationale for this law. Since the cake of figs is made from several discrete elements, it is not considered as a single entity with regard to the laws of ritual impurity. Hence, the fact that one portion has been touched by a source of ritual impurity does not cause another portion to become impure. Nevertheless, since it is one body of produce, <i>terumah</i> can be separated from one portion for the other.</i> This applies not only to a cake of dried figs which appears as one mass, but also to a bundle of vegetables and even a mound of wheat.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In these instances as well, since the whole is made up of discrete entities, the fact that they are connected or somewhat associated is not of consequence (<i>ibid.</i>; see also <i>Hilchot Tuma'at Ochalin</i> 6:14).</i> If a portion of it became impure, one may separate <i>terumah</i> from the pure portion for the impure portion.<br>If, however, there were two cakes of dried figs, two bundles of vegetables, or two mounds of wheat, one impure and one pure at its side, as an initial preference, one should not separate <i>terumah</i> from the produce that is pure for the produce that is impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For the two are not considered as being "in the same place" (<i>min hamukaf</i>).

If, however, it became impure before the work associated with its preparation was completed, even if it was inadvertently separated as <i>terumah</i>, the separation is not effective.</i> If one made the separation intentionally, he did not fulfill the obligation for the remainder [of the produce], but [the produce] separated is <i>terumah</i>.

For one is considered "old" and the other, "new."<br>Similarly, if one harvested an esrog<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In that era, <i>esrogim</i> were eaten as fruit, not only used for the mitzvah on Sukkot.</i> on the day before the fifteenth of Shvat on the evening before sunset and harvested another one after sunset [that day], one may not separate <i>terumah</i> from one for the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>esrog</i> is singled out, because unlike other fruit, the time when it is picked - and not the time it reaches the stage of development when we are required to separate the tithes - determines the year of the agricultural cycle we follow.

We may not separate produce from <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i> as <i>terumah</i> for produce of the Diaspora, nor may produce of the Diaspora be separated for produce from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 1:5), the Rambam explains that this concept is derived from Leviticus 27:30: "All the tithes of the land from the plantings of the land." Implied is that both the tithes and the produce must be from "the land," from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Although the verse speaks of the tithes, the principle derived is also applied to <i>terumah</i>.</i> nor may produce of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> be separated for produce from Syria, and nor may produce of Syria be separated for produce from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For according to Scriptural Law, Syria is also part of the Diaspora.</i><br>Similarly, [we may not separate <i>terumah</i>] from produce for which <i>terumah</i> need not be separated, e.g., <i>leket, shichachah</i>, and <i>pe'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 9.</i> or from produce from which <i>terumah</i> was already separated for produce for which <i>terumah</i> must be separated.

When a person separates <i>terumah</i> [for other produce] from produce that was designated as the first tithe, but from which its <i>terumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <i>terumah ma'aser</i>, the <i>terumah</i> that must be separated from the tithes.</i> had not been separated<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 1:5, Rav Kapach's edition), the Rambam explains that this is referring to a situation in which a Levite took produce that he had been given as tithes by an Israelite, but from which he had not separated <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and desired to use it to separate <i>terumah</i> for produce from his own field from which he is obligated to separate <i>terumah</i>. This is unacceptable, because there is no longer any obligation to separate <i>terumah</i> from the produce given as tithes, even though there is an obligation to separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> from it.<br>This explanation is somewhat unique. Most commentaries interpret the mishnah as referring to a situation where the person tithed his crop, but did not separate <i>terumah</i> from it. Nor did he separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i>. Afterwards, he desired to separate <i>terumah</i> for other produce from the tithes.

The Ra'avad raises objections to the Rambam's ruling. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> respond to them. If, however, they would have followed the Rambam's explanation in his Commentary to the Mishnah as explained above, the difficulties would not arise.</i>
We may not separate <i>terumah</i> from produce for which we are required to separate <i>terumah</i> according to Scriptural Law for produce for which we are required to separate <i>terumah</i> [only] according to Rabbinic Law,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">According to Scriptural Law, there is no obligation to separate <i>terumah</i> from this produce.

A flowerpot with a hole is considered as [connected] to the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Because the nurture from the power of growth in the earth is drawn to the earth in the flowerpot through the hole.

Hence, we are obligated to separate <i>terumah</i> from produce which grows within such a flowerpot according to Scriptural Law [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 5:10)].</i> This is smaller than an olive.<br>[The following rules apply when a person] planted grain in a flowerpot that did not have a hole and it reached a third of its maturity.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">If produce grows in a flowerpot without a hole, there is no obligation to separate <i>terumah</i> from it according to Scriptural Law (<i>ibid.</i>).

See Halachah 9; see also Chapter 1, Halachot 11-13.</i> Afterwards, he perforated [the flowerpot]<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">And thus enabled the produce to derive nurture from the earth.</i> and the grain completed [its growth] while [the flowerpot] was perforated.

Although our Sages ruled stringently and determined that it must be considered as <i>terumah</i>, they did not change its status as <i>tevel</i>. Hence, for the priest to partake of it, it is necessary that he separate <i>terumah</i> and tithes for it from other produce [see the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 5:10)].<br>The <i>terumah</i> and the tithes for this produce must be separated from other produce, lest one think that what remains is ordinary produce and can be eaten be a person other than a priest (<i>Tosafot, Yevamot</i> 89b).</i>

Since such a separation is invalid according to Scriptural Law, in such an instance, the priest is being given produce from which tithes and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> have not been separated.

Chapter 6

The great <i>terumah</i> and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> may be eaten by priests, both adults and minors, both males and females and their Canaanite servants,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Because Canaanite servants do not have a separate personal identity, but instead are considered as part of their master's possessions. A Hebrew servant, by contrast, is forbidden to partake of <i>terumah</i> as explained in Halachah 5.</i> and their livestock,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifra</i> states that this applies only to animal fodder.

In such an instance, her husband has the right to divorce her and is not obligated to pay for her sustenance, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, ch. 14. Nevertheless, until he divorces her, she is entitled to partake of <i>terumah</i>.</i> they may still partake of <i>terumah</i>.
<i>Terumah</i> required by Scriptural Law may only be eaten by a priest whose lineage [has been affirmed].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 20:2 defines this term as follows:

Anyone concerning whom two witnesses testify that he is a priest, the son of so-and-so the priest, and the descendant of so-and-so the priest, extending back until we reach a person whose lineage need not be checked, i.e., a priest who served at the altar.

The restriction of the consumption of <i>terumah</i> to such priests is alluded to in the Book of Ezra  2:62-63): "These sought their genealogical records, but they could not be found, so they were disqualified from the priesthood. [Nechemiah] told them that they should not eat of the most holy offerings [which includes <i>terumah</i>] until there would arise a priest [who would inquire of] the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tumim</i> [concerning their lineage]."</i> Priests whose status is accepted on the basis of a prevailing assumption<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are regarded as priests by people at large even though there is no definite proof of their lineage.</i> may partake only of <i>terumah</i> required by Rabbinic decree.<br><i>Terumah</i> that is ritually pure, whether the great <i>terumah</i> or <i>terumat ma'aser</i>, whether required by Scriptural or Rabbinic Law is given only to a priest who is a Torah scholar<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For only a Torah scholar can be expected to be versed in the knowledge and practice of the laws of ritual purity. The <i>Sifri</i> (to Numbers 18:28  cites a Biblical verse as support for this concept.<br>This is also alluded to by a Biblical narrative. II Chronicles, ch. 30, relates how King Chezekiah affected a renewal of Torah observance among the Jewish people. Among his efforts was to renew the observance of <i>terumah</i> and tithes, as it is written (30:4): "He told the people... to give the portions of the priests and the Levites so that they could strengthen themselves in the Torah of God." <i>Chulin</i> 130b interprets this to mean that these gifts should be given only to a priest or Levite who "is strong in his observance of the Torah of God." In the revision of his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 4:9), the Rambam writes that it is desirable and advisable to follow this restriction, but there is no prohibition against giving <i>terumah</i> to an unlearned priest.</i> because it is forbidden to partake of <i>terumah</i> that is ritually impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">We are concerned that the impure priest will cause the <i>terumah</i> to become ritually impure and then partake of it while it is in that state.</i> All of the unlearned people are presumed to be ritually impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that we do not think that a common person will willingly transgress and eat <i>terumah</i> that is impure. Instead, the suspicion is that he will be impure and therefore make the <i>terumah</i> impure. Nevertheless, he will not realize what has transpired and will eat the <i>terumah</i> that he himself made impure.</i> For these reasons, one may give impure <i>terumah</i> to any priest one chooses.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For it has to be burnt and any priest can perform that act. The Ra'avad differs with this ruling, maintaining that even such <i>terumah</i> should not be given to a priest who is unlearned. The Rambam's position can be supported based on the explanation given above that we do not suspect that the unlearned priest will deliberately transgress.</i>
When an Israelite woman marries a priest, even a minor three years and one day old,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">If a girl is younger than that, her consecration is not binding, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:11.</i> she may partake of <i>terumah</i> and the breast and thigh [given the priests from the peace sacrifices].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Which may be eaten by all the members of a priest's household (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbonot</i> 10:5).</i><br>According to Scriptural Law, she may partake of these foods from the time that she was consecrated. Our Sages, however, forbade her from partaking of them until she enters the <i>chupah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to Jewish law, marriage is a two-staged process involving <i>kiddushin</i> or <i>erusin</i> (consecration) and <i>nissuin</i> (living as man and wife). Today, it is customary to perform both stages at the same time. In the Talmudic era, by contrast, a significant amount of time - usually a year - was granted between the two. In this interim period, the woman was consecrated to her husband and relations between her and another man would be considered adulterous. Nevertheless, she lived in her parents' home and did not engage in intimacy with her husband. Nor was he obligated to support her. Our Sages feared that were a woman given <i>terumah</i> in this intermediate period, she might give it to her father or brother to eat.</i> [This is a] decree, [instituted] lest she give her father and brother <i>terumah</i> to eat while she is a consecrated woman in her father's home.
A deaf-mute and a mentally or emotionally unstable woman who is married to a priest may not partake of <i>terumah</i>. [This restriction applies] even if her father concluded her marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Both of these types of women are considered as incapable of marrying according to Scriptural Law. Since a deaf-mute's ability to communicate is so restricted, our Sages placed her in this category. Contemporary Rabbinic experts debate the status of a deaf-mute who was trained to communicate through other means.<br>Were such women to conclude marriages on their own, the marriage would not be binding (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:9). Nevertheless, the father of such a woman has the potential to conclude her marriage before she reaches the age of majority. If he does so, the marriage is binding according to Scriptural Law (<i>ibid.</i> 3:11). Even so, our Sages forbade such women from partaking of <i>terumah</i> for the reason stated by the Rambam.</i> [This is] decree, [instituted] lest a priest who is himself a deaf-mute marry a woman who is a deaf-mute and give her [<i>terumah</i>] to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to a mentally sound priest, the marriage of a priest who is a deaf-mute is binding only according to Rabbinic decree. According to Scriptural Law, the marriage is of no consequence.

A non-priest is forbidden to partake of <i>terumah</i>, as [Leviticus 22:10] states: "All non-priests<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">We have employed a literal translation, though somewhat clumsy in English, because of the exegesis of the verse later in the halachah.</i> shall not partake of the consecrated food."<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 133) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 280) include this as one of 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> [This prohibition applies] even to a resident [worker] of the priest or his hired [worker], as [<i>ibid.</i>] states: "A resident [worker] of the priest or his hired [worker] shall not partake of the consecrated food."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 134) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 281) include this as one of 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> [The term] "resident [worker]" refers to one hired forever. [The term] "hired [worker]" refers to one hired for years.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Even when a priest is obligated to provide for his worker's sustenance, since the worker possesses an independent financial capacity, he is not considered as the priest's "financial acquisition" (see Halachah 1) and may not partake of <i>terumah</i>.</i> A Hebrew servant is comparable to a resident [worker] or a hired [worker].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Although a Hebrew servant is purchased by his master, he retains an independent financial capacity.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that in <i>Yevamot</i> 70a and other sources, our Sages interpret the verse as referring specifically to a Hebrew servant. Why then, he asks, does the Rambam single out a Hebrew servant? He explains that the Rambam is implying that there is no difference in this regard between a servant sold by the court and one who sells himself into slavery.</i><br>A woman of priestly lineage who is married to a non-priest is considered as a non-priest, as [implied by the wording] "all non-priests" - i.e., neither he nor his wife.
A non-priest who willfully partook of <i>terumah</i> - regardless of whether he was ritually pure or impure and regardless of whether [the <i>terumah</i>] was ritually pure or impure<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz notes that when a priest who is ritually impure partakes of <i>terumah</i> that is ritually impure, he is not liable for death. He asks: Why then is a non-priest liable for partaking of such <i>terumah</i>? He explains that for a priest who is holy by nature, impure <i>terumah</i> is considered defiled and he is not liable for partaking of it. For a non-priest, however, impure <i>terumah</i> is also considered holy and he is liable for partaking of it.</i> - is liable for death at the hand of heaven, as [<i>ibid.</i>:9] states: "They shall die because of it, for they have defiled it." He is liable for lashes,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the court must administer lashes if witnesses observed the transgression and administered a warning.

See <i>Hilchot Na'arah Betulah</i> 1:11; <i>Hilchot Geneivah</i> 4:9; <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 16:12. The Radbaz notes that generally, whenever there is a financial penalty and the obligation for lashes, the person is given the financial penalty and freed of lashes. In this instance, the opposite is true. He is given lashes and freed of the financial penalty. The Radbaz explains that in this instance, the person was originally liable for death at the hand of heaven. Hence, it is inappropriate that the transgression be absolved through a mere financial payment.</i> If he partook [of <i>terumah</i>] inadvertently, [he must make restitution and] add a fifth, as [<i>ibid.</i>:14] states: "When a person eats sanctified food inadvertently, he should add a fifth."<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">One fifth of the new total; one fourth of the original amount.</i>
[Leviticus 22:12] states: "When the daughter of a priest will marry a non-priest, she should not partake of the sanctified <i>terumah</i>." There are two concepts included in this prohibition:<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This charge is considered as one of 613 mitzvot of the Torah by <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 137) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 283) .</i><br>a) that if a woman engages in sexual relations with a man prohibited to her and thus become a <i>zonah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 18:1, the halachic definition of the term <i>zonah</i> is: "A Jewish woman who engaged in relations with a man she was forbidden to marry, violating a prohibition that is universally applicable, or a woman who engaged in relations with a <i>challal</i>."</i> or a <i>chalalah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The definition of the term <i>chalalah</i> is: "[A woman] born from [relations] forbidden to the priesthood.

She may, however, partake of <i>terumah</i> after [her husband] the Israelite divorces her or dies provided he did not leave any children that she bore, as [<i>ibid.</i>:13] states: "When the daughter of a priest will become a widow or a divorcee and she has no descendants,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">From that marriage.</i> she shall return to her father's home as in her youth. She may partake of the bread of her father."
According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Yevamot</i> 87a.</i> [that verse was interpreted] "from the bread," but not all the bread. She returns to partake of <i>terumah</i>, but not the breast and the thigh.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, if she willfully partakes of these foods even after being widowed or divorced, she is a transgressor and should be punished by lashes. See <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 19:4.</i>
[This concept applies] not only to the daughter of a priest, but to the daughter of a Levite or an Israelite. If she engage in relations with a man forbidden to her, since she became a <i>zonah</i>, she is forbidden to partake of <i>terumah</i> forever, even if she has a descendant born to her from a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains in Halachah 12, as long as an Israelite woman who was married to a priest has a descendant from the priestly seed, she is permitted to continue partaking of <i>terumah</i> even though she is divorced or widowed.

If such a woman becomes a <i>zonah</i>, she can no longer partake of <i>terumah</i>.<br>The Radbaz maintains that such a woman also is not liable for death at the hand of God if she partakes of <i>terumah</i> willfully, nor an additional fifth if she does so inadvertantly.</i>
For this reason, a woman who was taken captive<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Whom we suspect engaged in relations, either willingly or unwillingly, with her captors and thus became a <i>zonah</i>.

When a woman engaged in sexual relations with an animal, she is not disqualified from the priesthood<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>:1.</i> and may partake of <i>terumah</i>.
A daughter of an Israelite who has an offspring [she bore] from a priest may partake of <i>terumah</i> by virtue of her child. <sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Provided she does not marry an Israelite as stated in Halachah 17.</i> [This applies] whether the child is male or female or even a <i>tumtum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">A child whose genital area is covered by a mass of flesh and thus his gender cannot be determined.</i> or an <i>androgynus</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">A person with both male and female sexual organs.</i> Even the offspring of offspring until the end of time<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., her grandchildren or great-grandchildren who are descendants from a priest are alive even though her children themselves have died.</i> [enable her to partake of <i>terumah</i>], as [indicated by the prooftext]: "She has no descendants."<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prooftext does not say, "She has no children" (Radbaz).</i>
Just as the descendants from an Israelite [born] to the daughter of a priest disqualify her [from partaking of <i>terumah</i>], so too, the descendants from a priest [born] to the daughter of an Israelite entitle her [to partake of <i>terumah</i>]. [This applies] even if the descendants are of blemished lineage.<br>What is implied? A daughter of an Israelite married a priest or the daughter of a priest married an Israelite and [that woman] gave birth to a daughter.

If [the <i>mamzer's</i>] grandmother was the daughter of an Israelite who [married] a priest, she may partake of <i>terumah</i>. If she was the daughter of a priest who [married] an Israelite, she may not partake of <i>terumah</i>.

The descendants of a servant do not disqualify [a woman from partaking of <i>terumah</i>], nor do they enable [a woman to do so].<br>What is implied? The daughter of a priest married an Israelite or the daughter of an Israelite married a priest. A son was born to that woman.

[The above concepts are also relevant in the following instance.] The daughter of an Israelite married a priest and he died. She had borne a son to him. Afterwards, she married an Israelite.

When a woman engages in intimacy, she may immerse herself and partake of <i>terumah</i> in the evening,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., intimate relations cause both the man and the woman to become impure.

If, however, it flows outside her vagina and touches her externally, she does become impure. According to the Rambam, if the woman does not turn over in intimate relations, the semen will remain in her vagina and not flow outside. Hence, after immersing herself and waiting until nightfall, she may partake of <i>terumah</i>. If, however, she turned over in the midst of intimacy, the semen will flow out. Moreover, it is possible that it will not flow out immediately, but will do so over the course of the coming days. Now, semen is considered to remain viable until the third day after intimacy. Hence for three days, the woman must consider the possibility that the semen flowed out from her body and made her impure. Hence, she cannot immerse herself in the <i>mikvah</i> to regain ritual purity until three days have passed.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that even if the woman did not turn over during intimacy, as soon as she arises from bed, it is possible that semen will flow out from her vagina and touch her body. He quotes <i>Niddah</i> 41b in support of his explanation. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> suggest that the Rambam had a different text of that Talmudic passage and they validate his ruling.</i> If she turned over during intimacy she is forbidden to partake of <i>terumah</i> for a duration of three days.

Chapter 8

A fetus, a <i>yavam</i>, consecration, a deaf-mute, and a child of nine years old disqualify [a woman] from partaking of <i>terumah</i>, but do not entitle her to partake [of it].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is explained in the halachot that follow.</i>
What is meant [by the above statement] with regard to a fetus? A daughter of an Israelite who was impregnated by a priest<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Without being married to the priest or after being widowed from him.</i> is not entitled to partake of <i>terumah</i> by virtue of the fetus.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as soon as the baby is born, the mother is entitled to eat by virtue of her child.

[This is derived from Leviticus 22:13:] "And she shall return to her father's home as in her maidenhood." This excludes a pregnant woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Yevamot</i> 67b) explains that a pregnant woman is excluded, because she does not resemble a maiden.</i>

Instead, she may immerse herself [in the <i>mikveh</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">To purify herself from the impurity she contracted because of the relations in which she engaged (see Leviticus 15:18 . Note, however, Chapter 7, Halachah 7, and notes, from which it is apparent that there are times when a woman will have to wait longer.</i> and partake [of <i>terumah</i>] in the evening. If she was married to an Israelite and her husband died, she may immerse herself and partake of <i>terumah</i> in the evening [and continue doing so] for 40 days.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For even if she became pregnant, the pregnancy is not significant as the Rambam continues to explain.

For only a child that was born entitles others to partake [of <i>terumah</i>]. One which is not born does not entitle others to partake [of <i>terumah</i>]. Therefore if the fetus was a <i>challal</i> [and the woman had other acceptable children, the fetus] does not disqualify the servants from partaking of <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam concerning this point and maintains that the right of the fetus to the servants is significant even before the fetus is born.

What is meant [by the initial statement] with regard to a consecration? When a daughter of a priest is consecrated by an Israelite, she is forbidden to partake [of <i>terumah</i>], for he has already acquired her. When the daughter of an Israelite has been consecrated by a priest, she may not partake [of <i>terumah</i>] until she enters the <i>chupah</i>, lest she give <i>terumah</i> to the members of her father's household, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 6, Halachah 3, explains that the Sages forbade such a woman from partaking of <i>terumah</i> for this reason.

When an Israelite tells the daughter of a priest: "Behold, you are consecrated to me after 30 days," she may partake [of <i>terumah</i>] for these 30 days,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">By virtue of her ancestral right.</i> for the consecration has not taken effect yet.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">When a woman's husband words his statement in that manner, the consecration does not take effect until the 30 days pass (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 7:10).</i> If, however, he told her: "You are consecrated to me from the present and after 30 days,"<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the wording he uses is confusing and there is a doubt whether the consecration takes effect immediately or only after 30 days (<i>ibid.</i>:12).</i> she is forbidden to partake [of <i>terumah</i>] immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the doubt regarding her status.</i> Similar laws apply with regard to other conditional agreements of this type.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the man consecrated the woman conditionally, but stated that when the condition is fulfilled, the consecration would take effect from the present time (see <i>ibid.</i>: 6:16).</i>
What is meant [by the initial statement] with regard to a deaf-mute? When a daughter of a priest is married to an Israelite who is a deaf-mute, she may not partake [of <i>terumah</i>], since he acquires her by virtue of the ordinance of our Sages who instituted marriage for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">According to Scriptural Law, a deaf-mute does not have the capacity to consecrate a woman as his wife. Our Sages, however, desired that these individuals be given a chance to enjoy the basics of family life (see <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:9, 11:4).</i> When a daughter of an Israelite marries a priest who is a deaf-mute, she may not partake [of <i>terumah</i>], because he does not acquire [her] according to Scriptural Law,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">And the acquisition ordained by our Sages does not have the power to supercede Scriptural Law.</i> because he is not of [adequate] intellectual capacity.
[When a woman] was consecrated by a priest of ordinary mental capacity, but he did not marry her until he became a deaf-mute, she may not partake [of <i>terumah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For her consecration did not entitle her to partake of <i>terumah</i> and her marriage to a deaf-mute (through <i>yibbum</i>) does not give her this right either.</i> [In the above situation, if after consecrating a woman, a priest] died and she fell before a <i>yavam</i> who is a deaf-mute, she may not partake [of <i>terumah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, the <i>yibbum</i> performed by the deaf-mute creates a marriage-bond that is effective according to Scriptural Law.

What is meant [by the initial statement] with regard to a child of nine years old?<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam speaks about a boy "nine years and one day old."

The Radbaz explains that this is the fundamental new concept taught by this halachah. Otherwise, it would be obvious that since relations with this child are significant and they are forbidden to this woman, they disqualify her from partaking of <i>terumah</i>.</i><br>When a daughter of an Israelite marries a priest who is nine years old, even though the relations in which he engages are significant, she is not entitled to partake of <i>terumah</i> because of [this] child, because he cannot acquire her [as his wife] until he reaches majority.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For a male cannot acquire a wife until he reaches majority.

Attaining the age of maturity is itself not sufficient (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:10-11).<br>Seemingly, this clause is also speaking about an instance where the daughter of a priest is marrying a youth who disqualifies her and the question is whether he is of sufficient physical maturity for the marriage to be significant. In that instance, however, it would be proper to speak of consecration, not marriage. For this reason, Rav Yosef Korcus defines this clause as referring to a daughter of an Israelite who is marrying a priest and the question is whether the marriage entitles her to partake of <i>terumah</i> or not.</i>
All of the relationships [mentioned above] that do not entitle a woman to partake of <i>terumah</i> prescribed by Scriptural Law also do not entitle her to partake of <i>terumah</i> prescribed by Rabbinic Law.

Hence, we do no allow her to partake of <i>terumah</i>, for if the marriage is nullified, she would have no right to partake of <i>terumah</i>.</i> [The rationale is that] her father might object and then she would retroactively be unfit [to partake of <i>terumah</i>].

There is a doubt [whether the transfer of the ownership of a servant is effective in the following situation].

Chapter 10

When a non-priests partakes of <i>terumah</i> unknowingly, he must make restitution for the principal and add a fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 26, the intent is one fifth of the new total. Thus if a person eats the value of four measures of grain, he must pay five. Moreover, he may not use grain that is <i>terumah</i> to make restitution, he must use ordinary grain (which is more expensive). This fifth becomes considered as <i>terumah</i> itself and must be eaten in a state of ritual purity. See also Halachah 15.</i> Even if he knows that it is <i>terumah</i> and that he is warned against partaking of it, but he does not know whether or not he is liable for death,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">At the hand of heaven.</i> he is considered to have acted unknowingly and he must make restitution for the principal and add a fifth.

This includes one who smears himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The implication of the verse is that just as eating involves tangible physical satisfaction, so too, smearing oneself produces tangible physical satisfaction.</i><br>Whether one partakes of <i>terumah</i> which is ritually pure or ritually impure unknowingly, one must make restitution for the principal and add a fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It appears that in contrast to the intentional violation of the prohibition mentioned in Halachah 5, in this instance, the transgressor should pay the full value of the <i>terumah</i> even if it is ritually impure. The rationale is that here a person is receiving atonement for his transgression. Hence, he is required to make full payment.</i> He is not liable for a fifth until he eats an olive-sized portion, as [indicated by <i>ibid.</i>:14]: "When one will eat a sacrament unknowingly"; eating implies consuming no less than an olive-sized portion. Just as one is liable for eating an olive-sized portion, so too, [one is liable for] drinking an olive-sized portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains at length why although with regard to most prohibitions, the minimum measure for which one is liable for drinking is a <i>revi'it</i> of a <i>log</i>, a larger measure than an olive-sized portion, in this instance an exception is made. The basis of his explanation is that this prohibition focuses on "eating" <i>terumah</i>, and as stated above, intaking an olive-sized portion constitutes eating.</i>
[The following laws apply if a person] ate <i>terumah</i> and then ate again, drank and then drank again.

The Rabbis mention different opinions with regard to this time span, referred to as <i>k'dai achilat pras</i>, some as brief as 2 minutes and some as long as 9 minutes. Based on Shiurei Torah, the suggested practice is to consider <i>k'dai achilat pras</i> as 4 minutes with regard to eating matzah on Pesach, but 9 minutes with regard to eating on Yom Kippur. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 14:9 and notes.</i> from the time he began to eat until he concluded or sufficient time to drink a <i>revi'it</i> from the time he began to drink until he concluded,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The time to drink a <i>revi'it</i> is much less than <i>k'dai achilat pras</i>. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that the latter measure of time should be applied in this instance as well. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite sources to support the Rambam's view and note that he mentions this measure of time for drinking both with regard to the prohibition against drinking on Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Shevitat Esor</i> 2:4) and the prohibition against drinking gentile wine (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 14:9). They do note, however, that in <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i> 8:11, however, the Rambam mentions the time span of <i>k'dai achilat pras</i> even with regard to drinking.<br>They differentiate between the rulings as follows: In all the instances involving prohibitions against eating, the Rambam mentions the time to drink a <i>revi'it</i> because a person will not feel satisfaction if his drinking the minimum measure is stretched out over a longer span of time. In <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i>, by contrast, the concept involves considering a person ritually impure because of his having ingested a quantity of liquid. As long as he does not wait longer than <i>k'dai achilat pras</i>, the liquid is still collected in his digestive system and has not begun to circulate throughout his body.</i> [all he consumes] is combined to comprise an olive-sized portion.

With regard to <i>terumat ma'aser</i> from <i>d'mai</i>, they felt the converse is true.

[Similarly, when a priest] was partaking [of <i>terumah</i>] and he was told: "You became impure," "The <i>terumah</i> became impure,"<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In these instances, when he began eating, he was permitted to do so, it is only afterwards, that he or the <i>terumah</i> became impure.</i> "You were impure," or "the <i>terumah</i> was impure,"<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Thus from the outset, he should not have partaken of the <i>terumah</i>.</i> he should spit it out.

When there are two containers, one of <i>terumah</i> and one of ordinary produce, and <i>terumah</i> fell into one of them, but it is not known which one, we operate under the supposition that it fell into the one which [contained] <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, although there is reason to suspect that the <i>terumah</i> fell into the other container, we consider it as ordinary produce. The rationale is that we were operating under the <i>chazzakah</i>, prevailing assumption, that the container was filled with ordinary produce. Hence, unless there is a strong likelihood otherwise, we continue to operate under that perspective.<br>This reflects a principle that has ramifications beyond the laws of <i>terumah</i>. Although generally, we maintain that when there is a doubt regarding a Scriptural prohibition, we rule stringently, in this instance, since there is a plausible explanation for the lenient ruling, it is accepted. See also Chapter 13, Halachah 13-14, and the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i>, sec. 111.<br>There is, however, a point that has to be clarified. In Chapter 13, it is explained that this principle applies with regard to matters of Rabbinic Law, but not matters of Scriptural Law, and yet, here we are dealing even with questions involving <i>terumah</i> of Scriptural status. Nevertheless, there is no difficulty, because here we are not speaking about whether it is permissible to partake of the mixture or not. That question was discussed in Chapter 13, and the ruling was rendered that it is forbidden. Here the question concerns financial restitution: Is the non-priest required to pay for the produce that he ate? With regard to this point, the Rambam explains that we can use the above reasoning.</i><br>If it is not known which one is <i>terumah</i> and a non-priest partakes of one of them, he is not liable for payment.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For the additional fifth. The principal, i.e., the remaining container, must certainly be given to the priest. For if the one which was eaten was <i>terumah</i>, the second one should be given to him as payment for the first. And if the one that was eaten was not <i>terumah</i>, than the remaining one is and it must be given to the priest.</i> [The rationale is that when a person seeks] to expropriate money from a colleague, the burden of proof is on him.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if the priest seeks to expropriate the additional fifth, he must prove that the container consumed was <i>terumah</i>.<br>This is a fundamental principle in Jewish Law. Whenever there is a doubt with regard to the ownership of money or movable property, the person in physical possession of the property in question is allowed to maintain possession until the claimant proves his claim. See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 20:5, <i>et al</i>.</i> He must treat the other one as if it were <i>terumah</i>. If another person partakes of the other one, however, he is also exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">From the additional fifth. For in this instance as well, we are not certain that he partook of <i>terumah</i>.</i> If, however, one person eats them both, he must make restitution for the smaller one.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">For he definitely partook of <i>terumah</i>. Nevertheless, since we do not know which one was <i>terumah</i>, he can only be held liable for the smaller one, because of the principle stated above.</i> If he did so intentionally, he is required to make restitution for the principal. If he did so unknowingly, he is required to make restitution for the principal, plus a fifth.
When a person eats the additional fifth unknowingly, he must [make restitution for it and] add another fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">For the fifth originally added becomes considered as <i>terumah</i> and compensation must be made for it.</i> For the fifth is considered as the principal with regard to all matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it must be eaten in a state of ritual purity.</i> Similarly, he continues to add a fifth for every fifth forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">When Leviticus 5:24 speaks of adding a fifth, it uses a form that could be interpreted as plural, "its fifths." The implication is that he may have to add many fifths [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 6:1)].</i><br>Whenever a person makes restitution for the principal and the additional fifth, [the grain] he gives is <i>terumah</i> with regard to all matters<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if it becomes mixed with ordinary grain, the laws of <i>dimua</i> (the mixture of <i>terumah</i>) apply (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> [with one exception]. If they were sown, the grain that grows is ordinary produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, grain growing from <i>terumah</i> is considered as <i>terumah</i> (Chapter 11, Halachah 21).</i> If the priest wishes to forgo [the payment], he cannot.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">For we are not speaking about a mere financial payment owed the priest, but a means of attaining atonement.</i> Whenever, [by contrast,] a person makes restitution only for the principal,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 5 and Halachot 11-12.</i> [the grain] he gives is ordinary grain<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., none of the restrictions of <i>terumah</i> apply to it.</i> and if the priest desires to forgo payment, he may.
[The following laws apply if] a daughter of an Israelite partakes of <i>terumah</i> and then marries a priest. If [she partook] of <i>terumah</i> that had not been acquired by a priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it had been separated, but had not been given to a priest.</i> she may make restitution of the principal and the additional fifth to herself.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">She must separate this grain to receive atonement. Nevertheless, since as a priest's wife, she is entitled to partake of <i>terumah</i>, she may take the <i>terumah</i> she separates as her own.</i> If she partook of <i>terumah</i> that a priest had acquired, she is required to make restitution of the principal to its owner,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">That priest.</i> but she may keep the additional fifth as her own.

As explained in Chapter 3, Halachah 13, in such an instance, it is not necessary to separate the great <i>terumah</i>. If, however, it is ordinary grain from which the separations were not made in the proper order, it cannot be used to make restitution for <i>terumah</i>.</i><br>One may make restitution from the second tithes and consecrated property that were redeemed, even though they were not redeemed in an appropriate manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 6:5), the Rambam explains that this refers to the second tithe that was redeemed using an unminted coin or consecrated property that was redeemed with land. The commentaries have questioned this interpretation, noting that usually redemption with such articles is not effective at all (see <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:9; <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 7:1). They cite the Rambam's Commentary to <i>Berachot</i> 7:1 which interprets this term as referring to a situation where the principal was paid, but the additional fifth that is required was not.</i> And one may make restitution using new grain<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">New grain refers to grain harvested after the <i>omer</i> offering.

When a person ate <i>terumah</i> that was ritually impure, he makes restitution from ordinary produce, whether pure or impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The produce he gives as restitution will be considered as impure <i>terumah</i>.

Although in Halachah 24, the Rambam requires two different fifths to be given, that is because one is required to atone for partaking of consecrated property. That is a different type of transgression and that requirement is not paralleled with regard to the transgression against taking a false oath.</i> as [implied by Leviticus 22:14:] "And you shall give the priest the sacred [food]."

Chapter 11

<i>Terumah</i> may be used for eating, drinking, and smearing upon oneself, for smearing upon oneself is equivalent to drinking, as [indicated by Psalms 109:18]: "It has entered his innards like water and like oil into his bones."

When one has cleared the kernels of wheat that are <i>terumah</i> from a grainheap, we do not require the owner to sit and collect the [leftover] kernels one by one and [only after collecting them] bring ordinary grain there.

Because of the danger involved, the Israelite is entitled to do this even without the permission of the priest (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
When livestock belonging to a priest was standing next to livestock belonging to an Israelite or when garments belonging to a priest were being woven next to garments belonging to an Israelite, oil that is fit for burning may be kindled because of them without the permission of the priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Since the priest is deriving benefit from the oil, it may be kindled without asking him.

Since mitzvot were not given for our personal satisfaction (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 28a), he is not considered to be deriving personal benefit from kindling the Chanukah lamp. Nevertheless, if he has other oil, it is preferable for him to use that rather than impure <i>terumah</i> oil.</i> We may kindle oil that is fit to be burnt above [the bed of] a sick person with the permission of a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">A priest must explicitly give permission for the oil to be kindled there [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 11:10)]. In contrast to the previous instances, the priest's permission is necessary in this situation, because only one individual - not people at large - are benefiting from the light (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
When a daughter of an Israelite who is married to a priest frequently visits her father, he may light [such oil] with her permission.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Since she is married to a priest, she is permitted to benefit from the kindling of this oil.

We do not suspect that the people will partake of it. At a wedding celebration, [this will not take place] because they will not touch it because of their garments are clean,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The garments worn by people at a wedding celebration are very clean and they will not want to soil them with oil that was used for a lamp [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 11:10)].</i> and in a house of mourning, the people will not feel free to do so because of their mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">They will be too preoccupied with their mourning to consider anything else (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
When a person sows <i>terumah</i> unknowingly, he should turn it over.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">And thus destroy what he sowed (<i>ibid.</i> 9:1).

Thus he will not be able to sell it at the price of ordinary produce. And yet he will have to till his land just as it was ordinary produce.</i> Once it reaches a third of its growth, whether he sowed it intentionally or unknowingly, he must maintain [the crop].<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">For at this point, the crop is already considered significant (see <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 2:3-5).

Produce that grows from <i>terumah</i> is considered as ordinary produce with regard to all matters<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Hence all the agricultural obligations that are incumbent on ordinary produce are incumbent upon it, as stated in Halachah 27. Although <i>Terumot</i> 9:4 states that produce which grows from <i>terumah</i> is <i>terumah</i>, the intent is that it is forbidden to non-priests. This was one of the decrees enacted by our Sages on the day the students of the School of Shammai outnumbered those of the School of Hillel [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 9:4), based on <i>Shabbat</i> 1:3].</i> except that it is forbidden to non-priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it does possess the sacred quality that characterizes <i>terumah</i>.</i> Our Sages decreed that it be forbidden to non-priests like <i>terumah</i> [as a safeguard], lest a priest maintain possession of impure <i>terumah</i> with the intent of sowing it and producing [a crop of] ordinary produce and this lead to undesirable consequences.

[In such a situation,] the new growth elevates the root even if the seed does not decompose and the entire [plant] is permitted to be eaten by non-priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling, stating that if the seed does not decompose, even the second generation produce that grows is forbidden. He supports his ruling based on <i>Terumot</i> 9:4 which makes such statements with regard to <i>tevel</i>, produce from which the <i>terumot</i> and tithes have not been separated.

Although the turnips and radishes themselves are <i>terumah</i>, [the produce] growing from their [seeds] is like ordinary produce with regard to all matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Since the seeds themselves are not edible, they are not considered as <i>terumah</i> (although the vegetables themselves are). And since they are not considered as <i>terumah</i>, the produce that grows from them is also not considered as <i>terumah</i>.</i>Similarly, when a person sows flaxseed that is <i>terumah</i>, the plants growing from it are permitted to non-priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Since flaxseed is usually not eaten, the requirement to separate <i>terumah</i> is only Rabbinic in origin. Hence, when the <i>terumah</i> from flaxseed is sown, it is permitted (Radbaz). The Ra'avad, however, differs concerning this and the previous instance and maintains that produce that grows from this type of <i>terumah</i> is not permitted.</i>
When a person sows <i>terumah</i> that is impure, even though the produce that grows is ritually pure, it is forbidden to partake of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Even by priests. Instead, it must be burnt, as was required of the seeds from which it grew [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 9:7)].</i> [The rationale is that] since the <i>terumah</i> that was sown was forbidden to be eaten, it was already cast off. [Hence, it remains forbidden].
If he cut off the leaves that grew and then another set of leaves grew and he cut them off, the produce that emerge afterwards is permitted to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">By a priest. It is permitted because planting it purified it from impurity. It is not permitted to an Israelite, however, because it is still the first generation of offspring from <i>terumah</i> and not the second (Ra'avad, as explained by Radbaz and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
When plants of ordinary produce became impure and afterwards, they were sown and designated as <i>terumah</i>, they are permitted [to be eaten. The rationale is that] sowing them caused them to be considered pure and they did not become impure while they were <i>terumah</i> so that they would be forbidden.
When a stalk [of grain] was in the midst of a grain heap and one straightened the edges of the grain heap,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">This obligates that <i>terumah</i> and tithes be separated from the produce as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 3:13.</i> this stalk is considered <i>tevel</i>, because it was in the grain heap when it was straightened. If [that stalk] was planted,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Before <i>terumah</i> was separated from that grain heap.</i> and then it was singled out and designated as <i>terumah</i>, there is an unresolved question if it is <i>terumah</i>. Since it was planted, it is possible to say that it was released from the categorization as <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's words require some qualification. Certainly, the fact that the stalk is replanted does not cause the categorization as <i>tevel</i> to be released, as evident from <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 6:6. The question here is whether the designation as <i>terumah</i> remains or not.</i> and is considered as produce for which all the required work was not completed.<br>If, however, it was designated as <i>terumah</i> before it was planted, it is <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that it was replanted does not change its own status.</i> Therefore if one ripped off [a portion] of it and ate it willfully, he is liable for death [at the hand of heaven].

If he bent over and ate from the ground with his mouth, his intent<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">To eat in this manner.</i> is of no consequence because of the approach of people at large [and] it is not the ordinary practice for people to eat in this manner. Therefore he is not liable for death, nor for the [additional] fifth if he acted unknowingly.
The obligations of <i>leket, shichichah, pe'ah, terumah</i> the tithes and the tithe given to the poor apply with regard to a field of produce that grew from <i>terumah</i>.

The poor Israelites sell theirs to the priests for the price of <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Which is less than the price of ordinary produce.

A person who crushes such produce is praiseworthy.

Thus he will neither be muzzling the animal, nor feeding it <i>terumah</i>.

Nevertheless, since the obligation to separate this <i>terumah</i> is only Rabbinic in origin, our Sages did not forbid making it incur Scriptural impurity.</i> [this leniency is granted] because the obligation to separate [such <i>terumah</i>] is also of Rabbinic origin.

In this instance, by contrast, the person may save the oil even if his person is ritually impure.<br>The difference between the two instances can be explained as follows. With regard to wine, what the person is doing is saving the ordinary wine, not the <i>terumah</i>, because there is no use for impure wine. Hence, he is permitted to do so only if he does not impart ritual impurity of Scriptural origin to the <i>terumah</i>. With regard to the oil, he is saving the oil that is <i>terumah</i> - for impure oil can be used as fuel.

[The following laws apply when] one was traveling from place to place, carrying loaves that are <i>terumah</i>, and a gentile tells him: "Give me one of them.

Since they are not fit for human consumption,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Under ordinary circumstances. Nevertheless, they are eaten by humans from time to time. Otherwise, there would be no obligation to separate <i>terumah</i> from them.

One must be careful only when placing them in the water to soak. For if one placed them in the water to soak while ritually impure, one will have made them ritually impure directly.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And that is forbidden. Even though the person will be causing the produce to contract ritual impurity later, in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:3), the Rambam explains that this stage of preparation is singled out because it is when the produce comes in contact with the water that it becomes fit to contract ritual impurity.</i> Once one has soaked them, however, one need not be concerned with ritual impurity at the time one crushes the vetch<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">To remove their coatings.</i> or when one feeds them to an animal. For this reason, one may give <i>chilbah</i> and vetch that are <i>terumah</i> to a priest who is a common person.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 2, it is forbidden to give <i>terumah</i> that is ritually pure to a priest who is a common person, for we fear that he will be ritually impure and yet will not be aware of his state. In this instance, however, there is no difficulty for we are not concerned with this <i>terumah</i> becoming ritually impure.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this ruling is a minority opinion in the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 4:9) and the majority of the Sages rule that it is forbidden to give such <i>terumah</i> to an unlearned priest. Why then, he asks, does the Rambam accept the minority view. (Significantly, in his own Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam states that the majority opinion is accepted.)</i>
We do not entrust <i>terumah</i> to a priest who is an unlearned person, because he is easygoing about it and may partake of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he knows that he is a priest and that <i>terumah</i> should be eaten by priests.

See <i>Hilchot Mitamei Mishkav UMoshav</i> 8:2-3. Nevertheless, both the Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> question the Rambam's ruling, for seemingly, since the produce has not become fit to contract ritual impurity, why would the woman's moving it cause the produce to contract impurity?</i>
We do not separate <i>terumah</i> from olives in a state of ritual purity for an unlearned person.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Quite often the owner of the produce would be an unlearned person whom we assume is not precise in his observance of the laws of ritual purity. Nevertheless, he would often employ workers or hire a vat owner who was precise in his observance so that his produce would comply with the laws of ritual purity. The first clause is speaking about a situation where the owner of the produce had already put olives in the press and squeezed the oil from them before asking the person precise in his observance to separate <i>terumah</i>. Since the olives became subject to contract ritual impurity because of the oil, we assume that they became ritually impure through contact with an impure person. Hence, if the person who was precise in his observance would separate <i>terumah</i>, there is a probability that it is impure, but people will think that it is pure, because of the reputation of the person who is precise in his observance. Hence, he is forbidden to separate <i>terumah</i> from it.</i> We may, however, prepare ordinary olives for him in a state of ritual purity.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a person who is precise in his observance may perform the entire process, crushing the olives for their oil and separating <i>terumah</i> .</i> [This leniency was granted] so that the operator of the vat could earn his livelihood.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the owner of the produce is not precise in his observance of ritual purity, it would be preferable not to separate <i>terumah</i> for him under any circumstances.

When the unlearned person comes to take the ordinary produce and the <i>terumah</i>, we tell him: "Be careful not to touch the <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is permitted to touch the utensil, but not the <i>terumah</i> itself.</i> Otherwise, the produce will become <i>tevel</i> again."<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Although this is not true, he is given this warning so that he will be careful not to touch the <i>terumah</i>.

When an Israelite performs the tasks associated with the preparation of his produce while ritually impure, we should not harvest grapes with him. Needless to say, we should not tread the grapes with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In the first instance, the grapes being picked are considered fit to contract ritual impurity only by Rabbinic decree (<i>Hilchot Tumat Ochalin</i> 11:1). In the second instance, the wine is already starting to flow and the impurity is of Scriptural origin. Hence, the Rambam uses the expression: "Needless to say."</i> because the <i>terumah</i> will be made ritually impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the wine will be ritually impure, and thus the <i>terumah</i> separated from it will be ritually impure and of no value. Hence, performing these tasks is forbidden, because one is aiding a Jew in the performance of a transgression. For it is forbidden to cause produce from which <i>terumah</i> has not been separated to become impure [<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 55a; the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:9)].</i> One may, however, carry barrels to<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">For these barrels are empty.</i> and from the vat for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For the wine has already been rendered impure.</i>
When olives and grapes have become ritually impure, we may squeeze them and separate <i>terumah</i> [from the oil or wine].<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and the wine or oil is considered as ritually pure. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that we are speaking about a situation in which the olives or grapes had become impure with a person who himself had come in contact with a source of ritual impurity. Thus the grapes and olives are considered as ritually impure to the second degree. Making the grapes and the olives impure does not make the wine and the oil impure, because something that is impure to the second degree does not convey impurity to ordinary produce (see <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i> 11:2). Hence once this wine and oil has been squeezed out, <i>terumah</i> that is ritually pure can be separated from it. The Radbaz emphasizes that in this instance as well, we are speaking about using less than an egg-sized portion of produce at a time as will be explained.</i> If [grapes or the olives] became impure after they themselves were designated as <i>terumah</i>, they should be squeezed [using] less than an egg-sized portion at a time.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Tumat Ochalin</i> 9:2 explains that as long as the impure produce is less than an egg-sized portion, the fact that it comes in contact with the liquids is not significant.</i> In such an instance, the liquid that flows from them is permitted to be drunk by the priests. Indeed, it would be fit to be used for libations on the altar. [The rationale is that] the liquid is considered as set aside within the fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Thus touching the fruit is not considered as touching the liquids (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> The reason that [our Sages] spoke of less than an egg-sized portion<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">And not an egg-sized portion itself.</i> is that this is a decree lest one use more than an egg-sized portion and the liquid become impure because of [contact with] the egg-sized portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For with regard to <i>terumah</i>, impurity of the second degree can impart impurity of the third degree (<i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i> 11:3).</i><br>If the produce was impure to the third degree, one may tread upon it in the vat and the liquid produced from it can be used for pure <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it came into contact with the olives or grapes that were impure.</i> [The rationale is that] ritual impurity of the third degree does not bring about ritual impurity of the fourth degree with regard to <i>terumah</i>, as will be explained with regard to the concept of ritual purity.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah, loc. cit.</i>:2</i>

It is forbidden for a priest to take <i>terumah</i> or any other of the presents given to him until they were separated by the owners [of the produce], as [implied by the verses, Numbers 18:12]: "The first [of the produce] which they will give to God I have given to you" and [<i>ibid.</i>:19]: "...that the children of Israel will offer up to God are given to you."

For all that belongs to the owner is the right to apportion them and that right is not financially significant.
When <i>terumah</i> was given to a priest and he found other entities in it, it is forbidden for him [to take them]. This is comparable to theft, for perhaps other people placed them [in the <i>terumah</i>] to take them [afterwards].<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we suspect that a person understood that the <i>terumah</i> was set aside, not to be used, and deposited other articles there for safekeeping.</i>
An Israelite is not required to trouble himself with <i>terumah</i> and bring it from the granary until a city or from a desert until a settled area. Instead, the priests should go out to the granaries and the Israelites should give them their portions there. If they did not go out [to collect the <i>terumah</i>, the owner] should separate it and leave it in the granary. Our Sages ordained that if there are beasts or animals who would eat it there and it is not protected from them, [the owner] should take the trouble of dealing with it and bringing it to the city. He may collect a wage for bringing it [to the city] from the priest. [This is done,] because if he separated it and left it for the animals and beasts, God's name would be desecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>terumah</i> is referred to as "sanctified," allowing it to be destroyed in this manner desecrates God's name (Radbaz).</i>
It is forbidden for the priests and the Levites<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">To whom the tithes are given.</i> to assist [farmers] in the granaries in order to receive the agricultural presents given them.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This applies to the presents required by Scriptural Law.

Instead, he should grant them their portion with honor.
When a person gives <i>terumah</i> to a priest on the condition that he returns it,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">And then the <i>terumah</i> would belong to the Israelite who - although he could not partake of it - could sell it to a priest.</i> he has fulfilled his obligation to give.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">For such a present is a valid transfer of property.

Chapter 13

<i>Terumah</i> becomes nullified in a mixture 101 times the size of the original quantity.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:16, the Rambam explains:

Why did [the Sages] choose the figure of 100 for <i>terumot</i>? For <i>terumat ma'aser</i> is one hundredth of the entire crop, and yet it causes the entire crop to be "sanctified," as [Numbers 18:29] states: "its sacred part." Our Sages said: "An entity which must be separated from it sanctifies it, if it returns to it.

Nevertheless, from Halachah 13-14, it appears that according to Scriptural Law, <i>terumah</i> is nullified when mixed with a majority of ordinary produce and the verse is cited merely as a support.</i><br>What is implied? When a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> falls into 100 <i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce and all the produce becomes mixed together,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, if the produce which is <i>terumah</i> is distinct, it is sufficient for him to remove it.</i> he should separate one <i>se'ah</i> and give it to the priest. The remainder is permitted [to be eaten by] non-priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:15, the Rambam explains: "Why is it necessary to separate [a measure of] <i>terumah</i> and not a measure of <i>orlah</i> or mixed species from a vineyard? Because <i>terumah</i> is the property of the priests." I.e., from a ritual perspective, it is not necessary to remove the <i>se'ah</i>, for the existence of the <i>terumah</i> has been nullified. Nevertheless, from a financial perspective, it is necessary to give the priest his due. This is the explanation of the concluding clause.</i><br>[Accordingly,] whenever the <i>terumah</i> is a substance which the priests do not care about, e.g., <i>terumah</i> from wild figs, carobs, Edomite barley and the like, it is not necessary to separate [a hundredth for the priest]. Instead, since it fell into a 100 times its amount, it is nullified because of its minimal size and the entire mixture is permitted to non-priests.
If a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> fell into less than 100 [<i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce], the entire mixture becomes <i>miduma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And it is forbidden for a non-priest to partake of it.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 1:3), the Rambam explains that Exodus 22:23 uses the term <i>dima</i> as a synonym for <i>terumah</i>.

When produce becomes mixed with its own kind. If, however, produce becomes mixed with produce of another type, [the ruling is dependent on whether] the flavor [of the <i>terumah</i>] is recognizable or not. If the entire mixture has the flavor of <i>terumah</i>, it is all considered as <i>miduma</i> and should be sold to the priests with the exception of the value of the <i>terumah</i>.

For example, if one <i>se'ah</i> fell in one hundred <i>se'ah</i>, we consider the <i>se'ah</i> that was removed as slightly less than 1/100th <i>terumah</i>. Thus if it fell into a <i>se'ah</i> or more of ordinary produce, the second mixture is permitted [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 5:5)].</i>Similarly, if a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> fell into less than one hundred <i>se'ah</i> [of ordinary produce] and the entire mixture became <i>miduma</i> and then some of this mixture fell into other [produce], the question whether the mixture is considered as <i>miduma</i> is determined according to the proportion [of <i>terumah</i> in the first mixture].<br>What is implied? Ten <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> fell into 90 <i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce and the entire mixture became <i>miduma</i>. If ten <i>se'ah</i> from this mixture fell into less than 100 <i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce, the mixture is considered <i>miduma</i>, because in the ten <i>se'ah</i> of the [original] mixture, there was at least one <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And thus a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> is being mixed with less than 100 <i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce.</i> If less than ten <i>se'ah</i> [of <i>terumah</i>] fell into [the original mixture], the [second] mixture is not considered as <i>miduma</i> [when one <i>se'ah</i> of the first mixture fell into 100 <i>se'ah</i>].
When does the above apply?

It's only that an observer cannot distinguish between the <i>terumah</i> and the ordinary produce (see Radbaz).</i> When, however, substances blend together, e.g., oil that is <i>terumah</i> mixes with ordinary oil or wine that is <i>terumah</i> mixes with ordinary wine, we follow the majority. If the majority is <i>terumah</i>, should the mixture fall into other produce, the ruling is the same as if [the first mixture] was [entirely] <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., instead of calculating the percentage of <i>terumah</i> alone in the new mixture, we consider the first mixture as if it were <i>terumah</i>.

When a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> falls into 100 <i>se'ah</i>, [a <i>se'ah</i> of the mixture] was removed, another [<i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i>] fell in, [another <i>se'ah</i>] was removed, and another fell in, the ordinary produce is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the mixture was permitted, it is considered as if the <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> that fell into it does not exist.

Thus if more than 100 <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> fell into 100 <i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce, <i>se'ah</i> after <i>se'ah</i> [in above manner], the entire mixture is considered as <i>miduma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam concerning this figure, maintaining that the mixture is considered as <i>miduma</i> if 51 <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> fall into the ordinary produce in the above manner. His rationale is that since a <i>se'ah</i> is removed from the mixture, it is possible that he is removing a <i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce. Hence, after 51 <i>se'ah</i> fell and 50 <i>se'ah</i> were removed, it is possible that there is a majority of <i>terumah</i> in the mixture. The Radbaz justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that it is logical to assume that each <i>se'ah</i> that is removed has an proportionate amount of <i>terumah</i> and ordinary produce.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> fell into 100 [<i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce] and before one <i>se'ah</i> was removed, another <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> fell [into the mixture].

Instead, he should remove two <i>se'ah</i> and the remainder is permitted. [The rationale is that] since it should have been taken out,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And thus the entire mixture would be considered as permitted.</i> we consider it as if it was taken out. If, however, he did not become aware of the first <i>se'ah</i> until after the second fell in, the mixture is considered <i>miduma</i>. It is as if both <i>se'ah</i> fell in at the same time.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad comments on the Rambam's ruling, noting that he is following what appears to be the minority opinion in <i>Terumot</i> 5:8.

This interpretation is borne out by the Rambam's Commentary to that mishnah.</i>
The waste products of <i>terumah</i> are not combined with it [a mixture of it and ordinary produce] to cause the ordinary produce to be forbidden. The waste products of ordinary produce, by contrast, are combined with it to cause <i>terumah</i> to be nullified in a mixture.<br>What is implied? A <i>se'ah</i> of high quality wheat that is <i>terumah</i> fell into 100 <i>se'ah</i> of wheat of low quality that is ordinary produce. The owner ground the entire quantity. Even though there is much bran in the ordinary produce and a small amount in the <i>terumah</i> and thus the flour from the <i>terumah</i> is more than one hundredth of the flour from the ordinary produce,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For high quality grain produces more flour and less bran than lower quality grain. Thus more of the lower quality grain is bran and more of the higher quality grain is flour.</i> it is nullified. For we measure the flour with the bran and [together,] it is 101 times [the original amount of <i>terumah</i>]. If, however, a <i>se'ah</i> of low quality wheat that is <i>terumah</i> falls into [slightly] less 100 <i>se'ah</i> of high quality wheat that is ordinary produce and [the owner] ground the entire quantity, [the weight of] the flour that is <i>terumah</i> will be one hundredth of [the weight of] the flour that is ordinary produce. Hence it is nullified because the mixture is 101 times the original amount [of <i>terumah</i>], for the weight of the ordinary produce increased and that of the <i>terumah</i> decreased.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad notes that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Terumot</i> 5:9) goes even further and says that the bran in the <i>terumah</i>, since it is considered waste and not food, can be considered as part of the ordinary produce and if there is 100 times the weight of the flour from the <i>terumah</i> when this bran is added to the ordinary produce, the <i>terumah</i> is nullified. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> suggest that the Rambam does not mention this point, because he feels that the Babylonian Talmud - according to which halachah is decided - does not accept it. Nevertheless, it appears that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 99:1) follows the Ra'avad's view, although the Rama states that as a stringency, the Rambam's perspective should be followed.</i>
When a <i>log</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A measure of liquid weight of the Talmudic period.</i> of clear wine that is <i>terumah</i> fell into 100 <i>lugin</i> of cloudy wine<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the dregs had been removed from the wine that is <i>terumah</i>, but had not been removed from the wine which was ordinary produce.</i> that is ordinary produce, we do not remove the dregs from the wine [and only then calculate whether the ordinary wine is 100 times the <i>terumah</i>]. Instead, we nullify the <i>log</i> of <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Counting the dregs of the ordinary produce as part of the mixture.</i> Similarly, if a <i>log</i> of cloudy wine [that is <i>terumah</i>] fell into a 100 <i>log</i> of clear wine, we do not remove the dregs in [the wine that is <i>terumah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is apparently saying that in this instance, the dregs of the <i>terumah</i> wine are counted and unless the ordinary wine is 100 times the amount of that wine including its dregs, it is considered as <i>miduma</i>. See Chapter 11, Halachah 13, which states that the dregs are considered as <i>terumah</i>.<br>The Ra'avad differs and maintains that in this instance, like the one described in the previous halachah, the dregs of the <i>terumah</i> are not counted, because they are wastes. The Radbaz justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that wine dregs are different than the wastes mentioned in the previous halachah, because they have the flavor of wine and can produce wine.</i>
When a <i>log</i> of water fell into 99 <i>lugim</i> of wine and then a <i>log</i> of wine that is <i>terumah</i> fell into the mixture, the entire mixture is considered as <i>miduma</i>, because water does not nullify [the existence of] wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad explains the rationale for this ruling as follows: The water is not considered as the same type as wine. Hence, it cannot nullify it unless the flavor of the wine is no longer noticeable. The wine, by contrast, is considered its type and it requires 100 times the weight of the <i>terumah</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this can be understood as the Rambam's intent.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> fell into less than 100 <i>se'ah</i> of ordinary produce and then other ordinary produce fell into the mixture so that there was more than 100 times [the weight of the <i>terumah</i>]. If [the second batch of produce was added] unknowingly, [the <i>terumah</i>] is nullified because there is 101 [times the original weight]. If he mixed it intentionally, the entire mixture is considered as <i>miduma</i>, because we do not nullify the existence of substances prohibited by Scriptural Law as an initial preference.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz notes that in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:25, the Rambam writes:

It is forbidden to nullify a substance forbidden by Scriptural Law as an initial and preferred measure. If, however, one nullified it, the mixture is permitted. Nevertheless, our Sages penalized such a person and forbade the entire mixture. It appears to me that since this is a penalty, we forbid this mixture only to the person who transgressed and nullified the prohibited substance. For others, however, the entire mixture is permitted.

In the present instance, however, it appears that the produce is considered as <i>miduma</i>, not only for the person who mixed together, but for everyone. The Radbaz differentiates between the two situations, explaining that in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>, the Rambam is speaking about a forbidden substance. Hence, if it was considered forbidden, it would have no value entirely. In our halachah, even if the mixture is considered <i>miduma</i>, it can be sold to priests and thus, it will not be wasted entirely.</i>
It is, however, permitted to nullify <i>terumah</i> from the Diaspora [by mixing it] with a majority of permitted substances<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the prohibition is of Rabbinic origin, one may nullify it as an initial preference, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:26.</i> and eat it during the time when one is ritually impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that the mixture may be eaten by a priest even when he is ritually impure or by a non-priest.</i> Not only that, if a person possesses wine that is <i>terumah</i> from the Diaspora, he should take one log of this wine and mix it with two <i>lugim</i> of ordinary [wine]. Thus there are three <i>lugim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">And the wine that is <i>terumah</i> is nullified, because it is mixed with a majority of ordinary produce.</i> Afterwards, he can add another <i>log</i> of the <i>terumah</i> wine into the three <i>lugim</i> and then take one <i>log</i> from the four and drink it.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs, maintaining that once there is no longer a majority of ordinary produce, the mixture is forbidden. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that once the <i>terumah</i> is nullified, it does not become a factor again if other <i>terumah</i> is added.</i> He may then add another <i>log</i> [of <i>terumah</i> wine] and take out a <i>log</i> and drink it. Similarly, he may continue adding a <i>log</i> of <i>terumah</i> and removing a <i>log</i> until all the wine that is <i>terumah</i> is completed. Thus he can nullify several <i>lugim</i> [of <i>terumah</i>] in two <i>lugim</i> of ordinary produce.
When one sows <i>terumah</i> next to ordinary produce and cannot identify which produce is <i>terumah</i> and which is ordinary produce, the entire batch is permitted even if there were 100 rows of <i>terumah</i> and [only] one row of ordinary produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that the produce that grows from <i>terumah</i> is not <i>terumah</i> and is forbidden to non-priests only as a stringency (Chapter 11, Halachot 21-22). Hence, if there is any confusion about which produce is <i>terumah</i>, it is all permitted.</i><br>When does the above apply? With regard to produce whose seed decomposes in the earth, e.g., wheat, barley, and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For then there is no trace of the original plant.</i> If, however, the seeds do not decompose, e.g., garlic and onions,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, the new plant grows from a bulb of the original one and that original plant never decomposes entirely.</i> even if 100 rows are ordinary produce and one row is <i>terumah</i>, the entire mixture is <i>miduma</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>terumah</i> is distinct and has not become mixed with the ordinary produce [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 9:5)].</i> If the entire crop is harvested,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Without paying attention to the prohibition.</i> <i>terumah</i> can be nullified in a mixture of 100 times its weight, but, as an initial and preferred option, one should not harvest the crop.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated above, as an initial preference, a prohibited substance should not be nullified.

When there are two containers of produce, one containing <i>terumah</i> and one containing ordinary produce and it is not known [which contains the ordinary produce and which contains the <i>terumah</i>], if [the contents of] one of these containers falls into ordinary produce, [the mixture] is not considered as <i>miduma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since we are unsure of the identity of the produce that fell into the mixture, we do not rule it forbidden because of the doubt.

When there are two containers [of produce], one containing ordinary produce and the other, containing <i>terumah</i> and two <i>se'ah</i>, one of ordinary produce and one of <i>terumah</i>, and both <i>se'ah</i> fall into these containers, [one into each], the produce is permitted.

[The following laws apply when] there were fifty dark figs and fifty<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The same laws also apply if there are 30 light figs and 70 dark ones, or any other combination of numbers (Radbaz).</i> light figs and one fig that is <i>terumah</i> fell among them.

Similar laws apply when there are cakes of pressed figs or blocks of pressed figs and a cake or block of [figs that are] <i>terumah</i> falls among them. If it is not known whether the one which fell in was a block or a cake, the cakes and the blocks are combined and the <i>terumah</i> can be nullified if their [combined weight] is 101 times that of the <i>terumah</i>. [Similarly,] when there are large cakes of figs and small ones and a cake of figs [that is <i>terumah</i>] falls among them, but it is not known whether the cake which fell in was large or small, [the existing cakes] can nullify the one which fell in whether by weight or by number.<br>What is implied? A cake [of figs] fell into a mixture of 100 other cakes, both large and small. We assume that a small cake<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, we know that a large cake fell in, but we are uncertain about its size, we cannot merely count 101 cakes both large and small to nullify it (Rabbi Akiva Eiger).</i> fell in and one may remove one of the small cakes.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since there were 101 cakes, 101 times the number of cakes that fell in, the cake that was <i>terumah</i> could be nullified.

Flour and finely sifted flour cannot be combined together to nullify <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there is one container of flour and one container of finely sifted flour. <i>Terumah</i> fell into one of the containers, but we do not know which one.

Hence it is not appropriate to combine them (Radbaz).</i>
When a <i>se'ah</i> of wheat which is <i>terumah</i> falls on the mouth of the storage vat of wheat, we do not measure it against the 101 times [its weight or ordinary grain found] in the storage vat.

We consider the <i>terumah</i> as if it is wheat placed above barley and separate the <i>terumah</i> itself which fell unto the storage vat with some of the ordinary produce upon which they fell as one would be collecting wheat from barley.
[The following laws apply when] there are two containers or two storage vats and <i>terumah</i> fell into one of them. It became mixed with [the contents of the container or storage vat] and it is not known which one it fell into. If the two storage vats were in the same building, they are considered as if they were combined and the <i>terumah</i> is nullified if the entire quantity is 101 times its weight. It is as if they were both contained in a single storage vat. Moreover, the containers are considered as combined together even if they are in two separate buildings, for it is possible to gather the two in one building.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 12:4), the Rambam writes that containers are frequently moved and in the process of their being moved, the two containers could be combined.

This ruling is also quoted in other contexts; see <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 111:7).</i> If, however, the two containers were in two cities, they are not combined.

In that situation, although the light figs and the dark figs could be distinguished from each other, they were all mixed together.

When <i>terumah</i> is definitely [present in a mixture], it is forbidden if the mixture is 100 [or less times its weight].

A sealed barrel [of wine that is <i>terumah</i>] makes a mixture <i>miduma</i> whatever the ratio [between it and the other barrels].<br>What is implied? When a sealed barrel [of wine] that is <i>terumah</i> becomes mixed with several thousand sealed barrels [of ordinary wine], the entire mixture becomes <i>miduma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the principle <i>devar shebiminyan lo betal</i>: "The presence of an object that is sold by number is never considered insignificant." Since these objects are sold by number, each one is considered important and it is not appropriate to say that one is insignificant (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 16:1-3).</i> If the barrels are opened, [the presence of the <i>terumah</i>] is nullified when 101 times its contents are present.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For once the barrels are opened, they are no longer considered as important.

When a sealed barrel [that contains <i>terumah</i>] becomes mixed with 100 barrels and then one falls into the Mediterranean Sea, they are all permitted. We assume that it is the one that is <i>terumah</i> that fell in. This is not the case when a fig falls into 100 figs. In the latter instance, it is necessary to set aside one [fig].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">And give it to a priest. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Terumot</i> 4:7) records a difference of opinion concerning this matter between Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yochanan. Reish Lakish's opinion is the one cited by the Rambam. Rabbi Yochanan, however, differs and maintains that the same law applies even with regard to figs. The Rambam rules according to Reish Lakish's opinion, for the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Zevachim</i> 74b) mentions his view only and not that of Rabbi Yochanan. See also <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 7:10 where the Rambam issues a similar ruling.<br>The Ra'avad does not accept this ruling.

Since the onion is diced, it will both impart and absorb flavor easier.</i> If he cooked the onion with the lentils, whether it is whole or diced, we estimate whether it imparted its flavor.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since the onion is cooked, even if it is whole, it can both impart and absorb flavor easily.</i> With regard to the remainder of the cooked food,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in addition to the lentils.</i> regardless of whether the onion was placed upon it after it was cooked or cooked with it, or whether it was whole or diced, we estimate whether it imparted its flavor.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam proceeds to explain, lentils are considered as being unique. Once they are cooked, they do not absorb flavor from other foods easily. Other foods are more absorbent. Even after they have been cooked, they may absorb the flavor of the onion.</i><br>Why do we not estimate [whether flavor was imparted] when a whole onion was placed among cooked lentils? Because it does not absorb from them, for it is whole, nor does it impart [flavor] to them, because they have already been cooked. If the onions were soft,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> suggests that the text should read <i>rabbim</i>, "many," instead of <i>rachim</i>, "soft;" i.e., one onion that is whole will not impart that much flavor, but several onions will.</i> it is considered as if they were diced. Similarly, if its tip or its outer shell<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Once the tip or the outer shell is removed, its flavor will be imparted easily even though it is still whole.</i> was removed or it was moist, it is considered as if it was diced. Wild onions, whether moist or dry, whether whole or diced, we see if they have imparted their flavor.
When one pickles vegetables that are ordinary produce with those of <i>terumah,</i> they are permitted to non-priests<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In certain contexts (see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:34), pickling is considered as cooking.

If one pickled vegetables that are <i>terumah</i> with an onion that is ordinary produce, the onion is permitted to non-priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For the onion will not absorb the flavor of the other produce.</i>
[The following rules apply when] olives that are ordinary produce were pickled together with olives that are <i>terumah</i>.

Water in which <i>terumah</i> was pickled or cooked is forbidden to non-priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For it has absorbed the flavor of the <i>terumah</i>.</i>
The laws governing <i>terumah</i> apply to anise as long as it has not yet flavored a dish [of food].<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Anise is used as flavoring. Once it has flavored other foods, it is discarded. Hence, until it has flavored other foods, it is significant and the laws of <i>terumah</i> apply. Afterwards, it is considered as a wasteproduct (Radbaz).</i> Once it has flavored a dish, the laws of <i>terumah</i> no longer apply.
[The following laws apply when a person] removes a warm loaf of bread [from the oven] and places it over a barrel of wine that is <i>terumah</i>. If the loaf is from wheat, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the bread may absorb the fragrance of the wine, it does not absorb its substance and the fragrance alone is of no consequence. This is a general principle that applies with regard to all prohibited foods; see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:33.</i> If it is from barley, it is forbidden, because it draws forth [the wine itself].<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">It is considered as the actual substance of the wine has been imparted to the bread.</i>
When an oven has been heated with cumin that is <i>terumah</i>, the bread is permitted. For it does not have the flavor of the cumin, only its fragrance and fragrance does not create a prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 16:22, the Rambam writes that when an oven is heated with shells of produce that is <i>orlah</i> or mixed species in a vineyard, whatever is cooked in the oven is forbidden. The commentaries note, however, that there is a fundamental distinction between the two instances. It is forbidden to benefit from - not only to eat - the prohibited substances mentioned in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot.</i> It is, by contrast, permitted to benefit from <i>terumah</i>.</i>
When barley that is <i>terumah</i> falls into a cistern of water, the water is permitted even if [the barley] spoils the flavor of the water, for food that imparts an undesirable flavor does not bring about a prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This concept also applies with regard to all the Torah's prohibitions; see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:28.</i>
[The following law applies when] chilba<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">A pungent herb.</i> that is <i>terumah</i> and its plant fall into a cistern of wine. If the chilba seed itself<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., without the influence of the plant whose flavor is similar to that of the seeds. The rationale is that the plant is not considered as <i>terumah</i> [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 10:5)].

When there are two cups of wine: one of <i>terumah</i> and one of ordinary wine<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">And the ordinary wine is less than 100 times the amount of <i>terumah</i> wine.</i> and they were each mixed with water and then combined, we consider it as if the ordinary wine was not present and as if the wine that was <i>terumah</i>was mixed with the water alone, for water is not of its type. If that water is sufficient to nullify the taste of the <i>terumah</i> wine in the mixture, the entire mixture is permitted to non-priests. If not, it is forbidden, for as we have explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13, Halachah 9, which explains that the water is not combined with the ordinary wine to create a mixture 100 times the amount of the <i>terumah</i>.</i> water does not nullify wine.
When wine that is <i>terumah</i> falls on produce, one may wash the fruits and they are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz notes that in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 16:32, the Rambam writes a similar law with regard to wine associated with idol worship that fell on produce. There, however, he rules stringently, stating that the fruits are forbidden if the wine is poured upon them while they are broken open. The Radbaz explains that the Rambam did not mention the point here, because he relied on what he had stated earlier. Indeed, if the fruit was broken open and the wine improved its flavor, it should be sold to a priest at the price of <i>terumah</i>.</i> Similarly, when oil that is <i>terumah</i> falls on produce, one may wash the fruits and they are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Even though oil is more likely to cling to fruit than wine, it is sufficient to wash the fruit. Generally, oil does not improve the taste of fruit (Radbaz).</i><br>When oil [that is <i>terumah</i>] falls on [ordinary] wine, one should make it coagulate<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">For in this way, the oil can be removed without it mixing with the wine. Similarly, oil impairs the flavor of wine (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and the wine is then permitted to non-priests. If [oil that is <i>terumah</i>] mixes with brine, it should be made to coagulate, then the upper layer of the brine should be removed<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This stringency is necessary, because oil improves the flavor of brine (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> so that all the brine that has the taste of oil will be removed.
A pot in which <i>terumah</i> was cooked should not be used to cook ordinary produce. If it was cooked in it, it causes it to be forbidden if its flavor is recognizable. If he washes out the pot with wine or with water, it is permitted to cook in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, asking why this instance is different from the laws involving non-kosher food absorbed in a utensil. In that instance, it is not sufficient to wash out the utensil, one must perform <i>hagalah</i>, boiling water in the utensil to purge the absorbed matter. The Radbaz explains that the Rambam maintains that this concept applies with regard to sanctified foods and other prohibitions, but not with regard to <i>terumah</i>. The rationale is that if the priests consider the <i>terumah</i> insignificant - as would be the case with regard to <i>terumah</i> absorbed in a pot - it is no longer of consequence. He draws support for this explanation from the mishnah in <i>Terumot</i> 11:8 (quoted in Chapter 11, Halachah 15) which states that after one pours out the contents of a jug of wine of <i>terumah</i>, one can pour ordinary wine into the container even if there is a small amount of residue from the previous wine. This explanation is also given in one of the responsa ascribed to the Rambam in a response to a question concerning this subject by the sages of Lunil. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also cites these ideas and states that the reason the Rambam requires that the pot be washed out is because the contents are being cooked. If they were not to be cooked, even washing would not be necessary.</i> If he cooked [<i>terumah</i>] in part of the pot, it is not necessary to wash out the entire pot, only the place where it was cooked.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This leniency applies only with regard to <i>terumah</i> and not to prohibited food absorbed in a utensil. The rationale is the same as in the previous note: Since the priests consider this <i>terumah</i> insignificant, we do not show concern about it (Radbaz).</i>
The great <i>terumah, terumat ma'aser, challah,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The portion of dough that must be separated and given to a priest.</i> and the first fruits are all referred to as <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachah 4.</i> With regard to <i>terumat ma'aser</i>, [Numbers 18:26] states: "And you shall remove the <i>terumah</i> of G‑d from it" and [<i>ibid.</i> 15:20] states that it should be "like the <i>terumah</i> of your grain heap."<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This verse refers to <i>challah</i>; or it is comparing <i>challah</i> to the great <i>terumah</i>. Perhaps a scribal error crept into the text and this was intended as support for the following clause. The Radbaz, however, gives an explanation why it was included here.</i><br>With regard to <i>challah</i>, [<i>ibid.</i>] states: "You shall separate <i>challah</i> as <i>terumah</i>." And [Deuteronomy 12:17]: "You may not eat in your gates the tithes of your grain, your wine, and your oil,... and the <i>terumah</i> of your hand." Now there are no substances that are required to be brought [to Jerusalem to be eaten] that are not explicitly mentioned in the verse except the first fruits. Thus the phrase "the <i>terumah</i> of your hand" can be applied to them. Thus we see that they are [also] called <i>terumah</i>.
Therefore the laws regarding partaking of all four types of substances and mixtures of them and other substances are the same. All can be nullified in a mixture of 101 times the original substance. They are also all combined with each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to cause a mixture to be forbidden to non-priests.</i> If they become impure, they should all be burnt. The laws that apply to <i>terumat ma'aser</i> that is <i>demai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Produce from which we are unsure that the tithes have been separated.</i> are the same that apply to <i>terumat ma'aser</i> separated from produce [from which the tithes were] definitely [not separated]. It is only that its violation is not punishable by lashes.
Anyone who partakes of <i>terumah</i> should recite the blessing for that particular food and then recite the blessing:<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For partaking of <i>terumah</i> is a mitzvah and we are required to recite a blessing before the observance of all mitzvot (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> "[Blessed are You... who has sanctified us with the holiness of Aaron and commanded us to partake of <i>terumah</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hillchot Bikkurim</i> 1:2.</i> We have received the tradition and observed that people would recite this blessing even when partaking of <i>challah</i> separated in the Diaspora.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it is only a Rabbinic commandment.</i> For even partaking of sacred foods from the boundaries [of our Holy Land] is like service [in the Temple],<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 72b relates that one day Rabbi Tarfon did not come to the House of study. Rabban Gamliel rebuked him for his absence. Rabbi Tarfon answered that he was carrying out priestly worship.

Rabbi Tarfon replied that partaking of <i>terumah</i> was equivalent to serving in the Temple.</i> as [Numbers 18:7] states: "I have granted you your priestly service as a gift."
