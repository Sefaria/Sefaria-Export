Mishneh Torah, Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee



Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment to rest from performing agricultural work or work with trees<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 135) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 112) includes this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>There is a difference of opinion among the commentaries if the mitzvah is incumbent on the <i>gavra</i> (the person himself) or on the land (the <i>cheftza</i>, the object). The commentaries note that the Rambam's wording in this halachah indicates that the mitzvah is on the person, he should rest. Nevertheless, the wording he uses when enumerating the mitzvot - that "the land should rest" - puts the emphasis on the land.</i> in the Sabbatical year, as [Leviticus 25:2] states: "And the land will rest like a Sabbath unto God" and [Exodus 34:21] states: "You shall rest with regard to plowing and harvesting."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The citation of this verse reflects a general principle in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: that the Rambam will occasionally favor the understanding of a verse proposed by the Jerusalem Talmud even though the Babylonian Talmud interprets it otherwise. To explain: the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 4a) inteprets this verse as a prohibition to work the land on the Sabbath. It is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 1:3) which understands it as referring to the Sabbatical year.<br>From Chapter 4, Halachah 1, it appears that here the Rambam is speaking of harvesting for the sake of improving the land, not for gathering its crops. The intent appears to be that harvesting produce will enable the land to produce better produce in the future.</i><br>When a person<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This mitzvah is incumbent both on men and women.</i> performs any labor upon the land or with trees during this year, he nullifies the observance of this positive commandment and violates a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 220) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 326) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Leviticus 25:4] states: "Do not sow your field and do not trim your vineyard."
According to Scriptural Law, a person is not liable for lashes except for [the following labors] sowing, trimming,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by Halachah 20 and notes, the intent here is trimming the top of the tree and not the end of its branches.</i> harvesting [grain], and harvesting fruit - both from vineyards and from other trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>betzirah</i> whose root is used in Leviticus 25:5 is usually employed specifically with regard to harvesting grapes. Nevertheless, in a wider sense, it refers to harvesting any fruit.</i>
Trimming is considered in the category of sowing.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Because like sowing, trimming contributes to the growth of the tree (Radbaz).</i> And harvesting fruit is considered in the category of harvesting grain. If so, why did the Torah single them out?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In Leviticus 25:5: "The aftergrowth of your harvest you shall not reap and the grapes you had designated you shall not gather."</i> To teach that one is liable [for lashes] for performing these two derivatives alone. For the other derivatives that involve working the land<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">And performing work with trees.</i> and the other major categories of labor that were not mentioned explicitly [by the Torah] in this context, one is not liable for lashes. He is, however, given stripes for rebellious conduct.
What is implied? When a person digs or plows<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Plowing is explicitly mentioned in the positive commandment for observing the Sabbatical year, but not in the prohibition.<br>Although <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 3a uses techniques of Biblical exegesis to show that other labors are forbidden, the Rambam considers these teachings merely as <i>asmachteot</i>, citing a verse as support for a concept forbidden by Rabbinic Law.</i> for the sake of the land, removes stones,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">To improve the land, not because he needs the stones. See Chapter 2, Halachah 10.</i> fertilizes the land, or performs another similar type of work on the land or extends,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Implants the head of a branch of a vine or tree in the ground so that roots will grow to improve its nurture.</i> grafts, plants, or performs other similar types of work with trees, he is given stripes for rebellious conduct.
We do not plant even non-fruit-bearing trees in the Sabbatical year. Nor may one cut an abnormal outgrowth from a tree, remove dried leaves and branches, apply dust to the top of a tree,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 2:2), the Rambam writes that this is beneficial for certain trees.</i> or smoke a tree so that worms [that infest it] die.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained (see Halachah 7), we are permitted to perform labor to maintain a tree's wellbeing. These activities, however, are intended to foster its growth.</i> [Similarly,] one should not apply a foul-smelly potion to plants so that birds will not eat them when they are soft. One should not apply oil to unripened fruit, nor should one perforate them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Both of these activities speed their ripening (<i>ibid.</i>:5).</i> One should not bind plants,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Bind their branches so that they grow upward rather than spread out (<i>ibid.</i>:6).</i> nor trim them, nor prepare a support for a tree or perform any other work with trees. If one performs any of these labors in the Sabbatical year, he is given stripes for rebellious conduct.
One may not light a fire in an overgrowth of reeds, because this is considered as working the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For this prepares the land on which they grow to be used to plant crops.</i> We train a cow to plow only in sand.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">And not on land that could be used for crops in which instance, the plowing would benefit him.</i> We do not test [the viability of] seeds in a flowerpot full of earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For this resembles sowing them.</i> but we may test them in a flowerpot full of dung.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Because we do not usually sow in dung.</i> One may soak seeds in the Sabbatical year in order to plant them in the following year.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For this does not involve working with the land.</i> We maintain aloe<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A fragrant herb, also used for medicinal purposes.</i> plants on top of the roof,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., prevent them from being damaged. The Radbaz questions why the aloe plant is singled out; seemingly the same principle applies with regard to all plants. He explains that since the aloe grows on the roofs, it is in need of shade. Our Sages permitted a person to construct a shelter to protect the aloe from the sun. This is not considered as forbidden labor.</i> but we do not water them.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For that would promote their growth, not merely maintain them.</i>
We may apply red paint to a tree<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 78a states that this is intended to attract notice to the tree and cause people to pray that its fruit do not fall prematurely. This is permitted because it does not involve caring for the tree.</i> and we may load it with stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This weakens the tree's strength and thus prevents it from causing its fruit to fall prematurely (<i>ibid.</i>). Since it weakens the tree, it is permitted.</i> We may hoe under vines and under olive trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes Rashi (<i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 3a) who explains that the words <i>oder</i> and <i>kishkush</i> - used by hthe Rambam in this halachah - are synonymous. The difference is only with regard to the type of plants.</i> If [these activities are intended] to make the trees flourish, they are forbidden. If they are intended to close their cracks, it is permitted.
We may irrigate a <i>beit hashilechin</i>, i.e., a field that is sown [with grain] that is very arid, in the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For otherwise all the trees in the field will die, as stated in Halachah 10.</i> Similarly, we may cause water to flow from one tree to another in an orchard if there were ten trees dispersed in an area larger than that necessary to sow a <i>se'ah</i> [of grain].<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:3 defines an area in which a <i>se'ah</i> of grain is sown as 50 cubits by 50 cubits. This leniency is permitted to make sure that the trees do not die.</i> One should not, however, irrigate the entire orchard.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is unnecessary to do that to provide the individual trees with water.</i> If they are closer to each other than that, one may irrigate the entire orchard for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For that is the most effective way of watering the trees, since they are close to each other.</i><br>Similarly, [when trees grow in] a field where they are planted distant from each other,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., ten in an area larger than 50 cubits by 50 cubits. Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 2:10).</i> we can sprinkle the earth with water for the sake of the trees that they will not be ruined.
One may dig a pit at the roots of a grapevine [to collect water].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 1:1).</i> One may make an irrigation ditch at the outset and one may fill the water reservoirs<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kelayim</i> 5:4).</i> with water.
Why were all these activities allowed? For if he will not irrigate [the field], the land will become parched and all the trees in it will die. Since the prohibition against these activities and the like is Rabbinic in origin, they did not impose their decrees in these instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">So the trees will not die.</i> For according to Scriptural Law, a prohibition applies only to the two primary categories and their two derivatives, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachot 2-3.</i>
When the number of those who impose their desires by force increased and the gentile kings required the Jews to supply food<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The standard publish text follows a slightly different version.</i> for their soldiers, [the Sages] permitted [the people] to sow only those crops that are necessary for the servants of the king alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This leniency was granted even though sowing is forbidden by Scriptural Law. It must, however, be emphasized that (as stated in Chapter 10, Halachah 9), from the later years of the First Temple period, the observance of the Sabbatical year only had the status of Rabbinic commandment. The Radbaz maintains that such leniency would be granted even if the Scriptural ordinance was in effect.</i> Similarly, if a person of force compelled someone to perform labor in the Sabbatical year without pay, for the service of the king or the like, he may do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">For since he is being threatened, it makes no difference whether the person threatening him is a king or an ordinary person. Since there is danger involved, leniency is granted (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> emphasizes that this leniency is granted only when the person does not receive payment for his activity. He is forbidden to take payment, even if he is being compelled for then a person could perform such labors and excuse himself, claiming that he was compelled to do so.</i>
When a person plants [crops] during the Sabbatical year whether in inadvertent or willful violation, he should uproot them, because the Jews are suspect with regard to [the prohibitions of the] Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">There are many who sow their fields and reap their crops. See Chapter 8 which lists many safeguards instituted for that reason.</i> If we would allow a person who [sowed] inadvertently to keep the crops, a person who [sowed] intentionally would say: "I did so inadvertently."<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumot</i> 2:3 contrasts sowing on the Sabbath with sowing during the Sabbatical year, explaining that the Jews are not suspect to violate the Sabbath. Hence, the results of the inadvertent violation of the Sabbath laws are not forbidden.</i>
When one plows his field, breaks its ground,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This is the translation of the word <i>nirah</i>, based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 4:3, <i>Pe'ah</i> 2:1). The term differs from plowing in that it is a far less thorough activity. See Rashi's gloss to Jeremiah 4:3 which explains that it refers primarily to the removal of weeds, thorns, and the like.</i> or fertilizes it<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 4:2), the Rambam explains that this applies even if the field is fertilized by making it a corral for animals, so that their manure will fertilize it and improve its quality.</i>in the Sabbatical year so that it will be better to sow in the following year, we penalize him and [prohibit] him from sowing it in the following year. He may not hire it out to others. Instead, he must leave it fallow. If he dies, however, his son may sow it.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For the penalty is imposed on him personally, not on the land. Note the contrast to Chapter 3, Halachah 11.</i>
When a person removes thorns from his field in the Sabbatical year to improve it for the following year or removes stones from it, even though he is forbidden to do so,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachot 4 and 16.</i> we do not penalize him. He is permitted to sow it in the following year.
[The following laws apply when a person] buries turnips, radishes, and the like<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In these eras, there was no refrigeration and vegetables would be preserved by placing them in the ground.</i> in the Sabbatical year. If some of their leaves were revealed, he need not be concerned.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">As long as the leaves are revealed, one is not planting in the ordinary manner (Radbaz). Burying the plants in this manner is permitted, because he does not desire that the plants grow in the earth; they are merely buried there [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kilayim</i> 1:9)].</i> If not, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Because he appears to be planting them.</i> When someone buries wild onions or the like, he should place at least four <i>kabbim</i> in the height of a handbreadth<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">If they are not packed so densely, burying them resembles planting [<i>ibid.</i> (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 5:2)].</i> and place a handbreadth of earth above them. He should bury them in a place where people walk so that they will not grow.<br>It is permitted to rip off the protruding stalks of rice in the Sabbatical year,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on Rav Kappach's notes to the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i> 2:10). There the Rambam explains the term <i>yichsech</i>, but does not explain the term <i>mereis</i>. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interpret the latter term as meaning that it is permitted to sprinkle water on the rice plants. The contrast to the following clause supports Rav Kappach's interpretation.</i> but one should not cut them off.
At the outset, [the Rabbis] would say: A person may gather wood, stones, and grass from his field, provided he takes the larger ones<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Those that stick out and attract attention [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 6:11; <i>Sh'vi'it</i> 4:1)].</i> alone, so that his intent is not to clear the land,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when clearing the land, one takes smaller stones and pieces as well as larger ones, so that the land will not have any foreign matter upon it.</i> but from his colleague's field, he may take small and larger pieces.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For we do not suspect that he will be intending to clear his colleague's field.</i> When there was an increase in the number of transgressors, i.e., people who intended to clear their fields, but would excuse themselves, saying: "We are only taking the larger pieces," they forbade a person from gathering wood and stones from his own field, [permitting this] only from a colleague's field.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">It would appear that a person would be permitted to gather both larger and small pieces from his colleague's field. The Radbaz, however, grants this leniency only with regard to larger pieces.</i> Even then, [the leniency was granted] only when he does not do so in order that he exchange the favor,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 4:1). There he emphasizes that the person clearing the field is expecting something in return.</i> i.e., he does not tell his colleague: "See how much of a favor I did for you, for I have cleared your field."
When a person's animal is standing in his field, he may gather [all types of grasses]<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Not only the large ones permitted in the previous halachah. Even though the person's field will be cleared in this manner, since this is not his intent, and the labor of clearing a field involves merely a Rabbinic prohibition, stringency was not enforced.</i> and bring them to it, for [the presence of] his animal indicates his [intent].<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">That he is seeking to provide his animal with food and not clear his field.</i> Similarly, if his cooking range is located there, he may gather everything<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this leniency is granted only when the owner takes both the large and small pieces. If he takes only small pieces, it is forbidden because he is obviously intending to clear his field.</i> and kindle it, for [the presence of] his range indicates his [intent].
If a person cuts down a tree or two to use as wood,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachot 17-18, which restricts cutting down trees for kindling once they have begun to grow fruit.</i> he may dig out their roots.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it involves work with the land, since he desires the wood, it is permitted.</i> If he cuts down three or more next to each other, he should not dig out their roots, because then he is improving his land.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The place where three trees can grow is significant and can be used for planting. Thus by removing the stumps, it is as if he is clearing a field for himself [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 5:4)].</i> Instead, he should cut off the portion above the earth and leave the roots in the ground.<br>When does the above apply? In one's own field. In one's colleague's field, by contrast, it is permitted to dig out the roots.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The intent is not that one has uninhibited license to cut down a colleague's tree even in the Sabbatical year. Instead, if the tree has been cut down, one may uproot the stump.</i>
When a person is chopping [branches from] an olive tree<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This law also applies to other species. See <i>Sh'vi'it</i> 4:5 and the gloss of the Ra'avad.</i> for wood, he should not cover the place [where the branches grew] with earth, because this involves performing work [with the tree].<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">This is forbidden by Scriptural Law.</i> He may, however, cover it with stones or with straw.
One who trims the ends of branches of vines and cuts down reeds, may cut them in his ordinary pattern with a hatchet, a sickle, or a saw, or with any other utensil he desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 4:7), the Rambam explains that there is no need for a deviation in the way he trims the branches, because he is not intending to trim the tree. To explain his statements: Although trimming is one of the activities forbidden by Scriptural Law, this refers to trimming the top of the tree, not the ends of its branches (<i>Tifferet Yisrael</i> to the above mishnah).</i>
One should not chop wood from a wild fig tree from which wood has never been cut before<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 5:5)].</i> in the same way as one cuts wood from it in other years, because trimming a tree is [one of the forbidden] tasks involved with trees, for through trimming the tree, it will grow and increase. If he needs its wood, he should trim it in an unusual manner.
How should he trim it? [He should cut either] the branches close to the ground or those higher than ten handbreadths.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">For cutting these branches is not that beneficial to the tree (<i>Bava Batra</i> 80b).</i><br>When a tree is split,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Here, also, our translation is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 5:5)], which quotes I Samuel 15:33 as support.</i> it can be tied together in the Sabbatical year. [The intent is not that] it will mend,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., that the split will be healed. This is forbidden, because this would be improving the tree.</i> but that [the split] will not increase.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">This is permitted, because this is maintaining the tree.</i>

Chapter 2

A person should not remove waste materials from his courtyard and place them in his field in the Sabbatical year, because it appears that he is fertilizing his field so that it will be improved for him to sow it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4, fertilizing is a task forbidden by Rabbinic Law.</i> If he did remove them, but made a waste heap, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Because it does not appear that he is preparing to fertilize his field immediately.</i><br>He should not make a waste heap in his field until the time when it is common to fertilize the fields as is done when tilling the land passes, i.e., when the bitter<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 3:1)]. There he explains that although <i>matok</i>, the name the Mishnah uses, means "sweet," this fruit has a bitter taste and that term is used as a euphemism. Some have identified this species with the colocynth, a wild gourd with a very bitter flavor. The Radbaz identifies it with a bitter species of grass.</i> [apples] become [very dried out and] knotted. He should not make a waste heap that contains less than 150 <i>se'ah</i> of waste, so that it will be obvious that it is a waste heap.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Any thing smaller might convey the impression that he is fertilizing his field.</i> If he wishes to add to it, he may. If he has a small amount [of waste matter placed in his field before the beginning of the Sabbatical year], he can continue to increase it [throughout the Sabbatical year]. One should not make more than three waste heaps in an area large enough to sow a <i>se'ah</i> of grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:3 defines an area in which a <i>se'ah</i> of grain is sown as 50 cubits by 50 cubits. In this instance as well, if he makes more than three waste heaps, it might appear that his intent is to fertilize the field.</i>
When a person desires to make waste heaps throughout his entire field, three in each area large enough to sow a <i>se'ah</i>, he may.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we are not concerned that an onlooker might think that he is fertilizing his field.</i> If he desires to combine his waste into one large waste heap,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., create one very large waste heap that encompasses a greater area than the three waste heaps in a 2500 sq. cubit area.</i> he may.
When a person would place waste on a rock, dug out three handbreadths of the earth and then made a heap of waste, or built [a platform] three handbreadths high above the earth and placed the waste upon them, there is no required measure. Even if he made several waste heaps in an area large enough to sow a <i>se'ah</i> of grain, it is permitted. [The rationale is] it is obvious that his intent is not to improve the land,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">By fertilizing it, for the waste is not in direct contact with the earth.</i> but rather to collect his waste.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For use after the Sabbatical year.</i>
A person is permitted to remove waste from a corral of sheep and place it in his field as [is permitted to] all those who collect waste.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to the guidelines established in the previous halachot. Those halachot dealt with removing waste from one's home and courtyard. In this halachah, the Rambam is adding that the same rules also apply with regard to the waste from corrals. To establish this conceptual flow, the Rambam changes the order of the clauses in the mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 3:4). The Radbaz offers this explanation to rebut the Ra'avad's objections.</i><br>When a person makes a corral in his field in the Sabbatical year,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad cites the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 3:4) which emphasizes that the person's intent should not be to fertilize his field, but to take care of his sheep. When he does that, he can have a portion of his field fertilized as a by-product.</i> he should not make it larger than an area it takes to sow two <i>se'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">100 by 50 cubits.</i> [When it is that size,] he may bring his sheep into it. When they have fertilized the entire corral, he may leave one wall of the corral and make another corral on its side, [and then bring his sheep there]. In this manner, he can fertilize a portion of his field large enough to sow four <i>se'ah</i>.
If, however, his entire field was only large enough to sow four <i>se'ah</i>, he should leave a portion [unfertilized], because of the impression that might be created.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when an observer will see that the entire field was not fertilized, he will realize that the person did not fertilize it by hand, because then there would be no purpose in leaving part of it unfertilized.</i> [In this way,] everyone will know that the sheep deposited their wastes there and fertilized it and they will not say that the person fertilized his entire field in the Sabbatical year.
A person should not open a quarry in his field<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that the Rambam's ruling applies whether the quarry is open or underground. There are, he explains, other opinions that maintain that if the quarry is open, there is no obligation to begin extracting the stones before the Sabbatical year.</i> at the outset in the Sabbatical year, lest it be said that he intended to improve his field by removing the rocks from it. If he began before the Sabbatical year and quarried from it 27 blocks - each block being one cubit by one cubit and one cubit high or larger - from a group of stones that were three cubits by three cubits and three cubits high, it is permitted to extract from it all one desires during the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Provided one's intent is genuinely to quarry stone and not to improve the field (Radbaz).</i>
[The following rules apply when there is] a stone wall that is ten handbreadths or more high and one desired to remove all the stones. If it contained ten or more stones, each one at least [large enough to require] two people to carry it, he may take them,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., all the stones, even those smaller than the size specified.</i> for an observer will know that he is taking them because he needs the stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">When a person is taking many stones of this size, the effort involved clearly indicates that he is intending to use them for building and not merely to improve his field.</i> If the wall was less than ten handbreadths high, there were less than ten stones or the stones were smaller [and did not require] two people to carry it, he may take them, but must leave [a row] a handbreadth high above the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">So that he will not have prepared his field by removing the stones.</i>
When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">That he must leave a row of stones a handbreadth high above the earth.</i> apply? When he intends to improve his field<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">By leaving an additional area that he could sow in the following year.</i> or he began to remove the stones in the Sabbatical year.

[The following rules apply when, in a field, there are] stones that would be dislocated by a plow or which were covered [by earth] and then uncovered.

It is permitted to bring stones carried on one's shoulder - i.e., two or three are carried on one's shoulder at a time - from any place, whether from a colleague's field or from one's own field.

Chapter 3

It is a <i>halachah</i> conveyed to Moses at Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a tradition conveyed by the Oral Law, for which there is no explicit reference in the Written Law.</i> that it is forbidden to work the land<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis debate whether this prohibition applies to work with the land alone or also to work with trees. See Halachah 9 and notes.</i> in the last 30 days of the sixth year, just before the Sabbatical year, because one is preparing for the Sabbatical year. This concept - i.e., the prohibition [to work the land] established by tradition - applies in the era of the Temple [alone]. Our Sages [extended that prohibition], decreeing that one should not plow an orchard in the year preceding the Sabbatical year in the era of the Temple after Shavuot, nor a field of grain after Pesach. In the era where the Temple does not stand, we are permitted to perform agricultural work until Rosh HaShanah, as [permitted by] Scriptural Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 1:1), the Rambam explains that Rabban Gamliel released this prohibition after the destruction of the Temple, because he maintained that the prohibition applied only when the Temple was standing.</i>
What is meant by an orchard?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Which is allowed to be plowed until Shavuot.</i> Any place where there are three trees in an area large enough to sow a <i>se'ah</i> of grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., 50 cubits by 50 cubits.</i> Whether these are fruit-bearing trees or not and even when they belong to three different people, we consider them as if they were fig trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we estimate whether a fig tree with dimensions similar to this tree would produce 60 <i>maneh</i> of figs.</i> If they were fit to produce a mass of dried figs of a weight of 60 <i>maneh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>maneh</i> is one pound in contemporary measure (<i>Shiurei Torah</i>, p. 118). Rav Kehati (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 1:2) considers it to be 400 grams, a slightly smaller measure.</i> we may plow the entire field because of them. [This applies] provided there is sufficient distance between them that cattle can pass through together with their implements.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages determined this to be four cubits. The rationale is that if they are grouped closer together the cattle will uproot them when trying to pass. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 83a.</i>
[Different laws apply] if there were less than three trees in an area fit to sow a <i>se'ah</i> or there were three, but [only] one was fit to produce 60 <i>maneh</i> or more and the other two were not fit to produce [a significant amount]<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Although the one tree produced the amount required of the entire orchard, since the other trees are not fit to produce any produce at all, they are not considered significant.</i> or there were two fit to produce even 100 <i>maneh</i> and one is not fit to produce [a significant amount]. We may plow only the portion of the field necessary for [these trees], i.e., [an area whose radius is the space in which could stand] a person picking figs together with his basket.
If there were between three and nine trees and they were fit to produce 60 <i>maneh</i>, we may plow the entire field for their sake, even though there are some trees that are not fit to produce [a significant quantity of] fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam interprets this as referring to a situation where all the trees together are fit to produce 60 <i>maneh,</i> although some individual trees are not fit to produce a significant amount. The Ra'avad offers a different interpretation of <i>Sh'vi'it</i> 1:3, the Rambam's source. Rabbenu Shimshon also interprets the mishnah in that manner and the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> agree that, at first glance, their interpretation fits the wording of the mishnah more easily than the Rambam's.</i>
When there are ten or more trees in an area fit to sow a <i>se'ah</i>, whether they are fit to produce [the above quantity of fruit] or not, we may plow the entire area for their sake [until Shavuot].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For even if they are not fit to produce fruit, such a large amount of trees is significant.</i> If there were ten plantings<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Saplings that were recently planted [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 1:6)].

If [the plantings] were planted in a row or in a semi-circle,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 1:6).</i> we may only plow what is necessary for each of their needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For they will not derive nurture from the entire field and it would appear that one is plowing the field for its own sake (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> If there are squash plants together with the plantings, they can be counted in the sum of ten [plantings].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>:7), the Rambam quotes the Jerusalem Talmud which states that this applies only to a Greek squash plant which is large like a tree.

What is meant by a planting? A sapling for as long as it is called a planting.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This is Rabbi Akiva's opinion in (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 1:8). Others maintain it is given that status until three years (or seven) years have passed.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a tree was cut off and a new tree grew from its stump. If it was cut off a handbreadth or more above the ground, it is considered as a tree. If it was cut off lower than a handbreadth, it is considered as a planting.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam states that this view is accepted, because it is supported by a <i>Tosefta</i>. The commentaries have questioned which <i>Tosefta</i> the Rambam is referring to.<br>The Rambam's ruling has also attracted attention, because it appears to contradict his ruling in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 10:13 which states: "When a tree was cut down from above the earth and [a new tree grew from its roots], the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies." The implication there is that as long as the stump of the tree is above the earth, the laws of <i>orlah</i> do not apply. Only when it is cut down from below the earth is it considered like a new tree. Here, by contrast, even a handbreadth above the ground is considered as an existing tree.<br>The rationale for the distinction can be explained as follows: In this context, we follow the figures of speech employed by people at large. As long as the stump is within a handbreadth of the ground, people will consider any new growth as a new entity. When, by contrast, the stump is more than a handbreadth, it is significant and any new growth is considered as an extension of the existing plant (Rav Yosef Korcus).</i>

According to Rabbinic decree, all the <i>sifichim</i> are forbidden to be eaten. Why was a decree established concerning them?

With regard to the calculation of the cycle of the tithes and the laws of <i>orlah</i>, the fifteenth of Shvat is "the New Year of the Trees." With regard to the prohibitions of the Sabbatical year, by contrast, the new year begins on Rosh HaShanah.<br>The <i>Shelah</i>, however, states that even with regard to the Sabbatical year, the fifteenth of Shvat is the Rosh HaShanah of the Trees and wit regard to them, the laws of the Sabbatical year begin from that date.

The Radbaz justifies the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that it is based on a passage from the Jerusalem Talmud. Rav Yosef Corcus explains that even though sowing the land involves a transgression and in the Sabbatical year, the crops should be uprooted, if that did not happen, the vegetables are not forbidden.</i> If he sowed it both for its seed and to use as a vegetable, its seed is forbidden as <i>sifichin</i> and its vegetables are permitted.

Fruits produced by a tree in the Sabbatical year should not be reaped in the same manner as they are reaped every year,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition does not prevent us from reaping the fruits of the trees during the Sabbatical year. On the contrary, the fruits are ownerless and are meant to be eaten by people at large, as Leviticus 11:39 states, "[The fruit produced as] the land rests shall be yours to eat." The point of the mitzvah is that one may not reap in the same manner that he usually does [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 8:6)].</i> as [Leviticus 25:5] states: "The grapes you had designated you shall not gather."<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 223) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 329) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> One who reaps grapes to improve the vine or in the ordinary manner of reaping is liable for lashes.

Other commentaries note that <i>Bava Metzia</i> 39a speaks of "the land being declared ownerless by the King," i.e., that automatically, the person's right to his produce is removed from him by Divine order. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XVII, p. 287ff., which clarifies the difference between these perspectives.</i> to divest oneself from everything that the land produces in the Sabbatical year, as [Exodus 23:11] states: "In the seventh [year], you shall leave it untended and unharvested."<br>Anyone who locks his vineyard or fences off his field in the Sabbatical year has nullified a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes the <i>Mechilta</i> which explains that according to Scriptural Law, it would appear that one should rip down the fences around his fields.

Thus everyone<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The rich as well as the poor.</i> has equal rights in every place, as [<i>ibid.</i>] states: "And the poor of your people shall partake of it." One may bring a small amount into one's home, just as one brings from ownerless property,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although the owner of the land does not have greater privileges than others, he does not have lesser privileges either and may take some of the produce.</i> e.g., five jugs of oil, fifteen jugs of wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">For this is an ordinary amount which a person would store for immediate use.

As stated in Halachah 8 of that chapter, after the exile of the tribe of Reuven and Gad, slightly more than a hundred years before the destruction of the First Temple, this criterion was not met and the Sabbatical year and many other mitzvot are observed only because of Rabbinic decree.<br>(As will be explained in the notes to that source, there is some difference of the opinion concerning both the actual ruling and the Rambam's stance on that issue.)</i>

After the exile of the tribes of Reuven and Gad, these laws no longer applied according to Scriptural Law. When Ezra led the people back from the Babylonian exile, he sanctified the land a second time according to Rabbinic decree. At this time, however, the people settled in a much smaller area than they had originally lived. Kziv was the northern boundary of that area and is considered outside the area.

Others maintain that according to Scriptural Law, in the era of the First Temple, the Sabbatical year was to be observed there.

When a gentile purchases land in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and sows it in the Sabbatical year, the produce is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we are allowed to purchase this produce and partake of it. This applies even in the portion of the land where the Sabbatical year is observed according to Rabbinic decree.<br>The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> refer to the <i>Kaftor VePerach</i> who states that seemingly, although produce grown by a gentile in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in the Sabbatical year is permitted, it would have to eaten with respect to its holiness, as described in the following chapter. For as the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:10: "When a gentile purchases land in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, he does not cause it to be absolved from [the observance of] the mitzvot. Instead, its holiness is still intact." Thus although there is no reason to forbid one from partaking of the produce grown by a gentile, seemingly, it should be considered "holy."<br>They note that in their time this was not the common practice, (nor is it the practice in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> today). They justify this conduct on the grounds that, according to certain views (see Chapter 10, Halachah 9, where this subject is discussed) that in the present era, the observance of the Sabbatical year is a Rabbinic ordinance (and not of Scriptural authority). And our Sages did not impose any restrictions on produce grown by gentiles.</i> For our Sages decreed that <i>sifichin</i> should be forbidden only as a safeguard against transgressors and the gentiles are not commanded to observe the Sabbatical year. Thus there is no need to institute a safeguard for them.
In the cities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> that are close to the border, we appoint a trustworthy watchman so that the gentiles will not spread [through the land] and take the produce of the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the material motive involved, there is a ritual dimension to this restriction. We are forbidden to allow a gentile to partake of the produce of the Sabbatical year (Chapter 5, Halachah 13).

Produce that is set aside for human consumption should not be fed to domesticated animals, beasts, and fowl.

It is permitted to cut down trees for their wood in the Sabbatical year, before they produce fruit.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the prohibition against selling the produce of the Sabbatical year involves only selling food.</i> An important person, however, is forbidden to do so, lest they also mix other [herbs]<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">That are fit to be eaten [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Shivi'it</i> 8:11)].</i> into the kindling for him, so that it will produce a fragrant scent.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is explaining the rationale for the restriction stated in the above mishnah.

Instead, they should be sold by estimation like the produce of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For an onlooker will not understand that the produce is from the Diaspora and will think that the produce of the Sabbatical year is being sold in an ordinary manner.</i> If it was obvious that it was produce from the Diaspora, it is permitted [to sell it in the ordinary manner].
There is a stringency that applies to the produce of the Sabbatical year and not to articles consecrated [to the Temple]. When one redeems consecrated articles, the consecrated article loses its sacred status and that status is conveyed to the money.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 6:4.</i> This is not so with regard to the produce of the Sabbatical year. When one sells the produce of the Sabbatical year, the status of the produce is conveyed to the money.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And it must be used to purchase food which will be eaten with the stringencies befitting the holiness of the produce of the Sabbatical year.</i> The produce itself, however, does not lose its status and it is not considered as produce of the other years. [This is derived from] the use of the word <i>tihiyeh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:12. See the <i>Sifra</i> to this verse.</i> [in the command regarding the produce of the Sabbatical year. That term implies that the produce] will be in its state at all times.

What is implied? A person purchased meat with the produce of the Sabbatical year or the proceeds from its sale. The meat is given the status of that produce and must be eaten [as befits the holiness of] the produce of the Sabbatical year. And one must rid oneself of it when one one must rid oneself of that produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 1, which speaks about this subject.</i> If one used that meat or the proceeds from its sale to purchase fish, the meat is considered as ordinary food and [the holiness of the Sabbatical year] is conveyed upon the fish. If one used that fish or the proceeds from its sale to purchase oil, the fish is considered as ordinary food and [the holiness of the Sabbatical year] is conveyed upon the oil. If one used that oil or the proceeds from its sale to purchase honey, the oil is considered as ordinary food and [the holiness of the Sabbatical year] is conveyed to the honey. One must rid oneself of the original fruit and the honey as one must rid oneself of the produce of the Sabbatical year. Neither of them may be used to make a compress, nor may they be ruined, as is the rule with regard to the produce of the Sabbatical year.
The holiness of the produce of the Sababtical year may be transferred only through a sale. When does this apply? With regard to the original produce. With regard to the produce received [in exchange for that produce], its holiness can be transferred through a sale or through a process of transfer.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one says: "The holiness of this produce is transferred to this other produce."</i>
When one is transferring the holiness of produce that was exchanged [for produce of the Sabbatical year], one may not transfer it to a domesticated animal, fowl, or beast, that is alive,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Note the parallel to <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:6. There it is stated that if one makes such a transfer, it is not effective.

Needless to say, this<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">That the holiness may not be transferred to a living animal.</i> applies with the produce of the Sabbatical year itself.

Money received for produce of the Sabbatical year may not be used to pay a debt.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This is considered similar to using it to purchase merchandise.</i> Nor may one use it to repay <i>shushbinut</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shushbinut</i> refers to a custom where a person sends money to a friend as a present at the time of the friend's wedding.

Rabbi Yehudah's rationale is that it is not desirable for any person to have free access to a colleague's field and enter it at all times.</i> What is implied [by the idea of eating in expectation of the return of the favor]?

Chapter 7

We may only partake of the produce of the Sabbatical year as long as that species is found in the field. [This is derived from Leviticus 25:7]: "For the animal and the beast in your land will be all the produce to eat." [Implied<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Sifra</i> to that verse.<br>From the fact that a verse from the Torah is brought as support, the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> concludes that the obligation of <i>biyur</i> is of Scriptural origin. The <i>P'nei Yehoshua</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 52b), however, maintains that the verse is merely an <i>asmachta</i>, a support brought by the Rabbis for their own ordinance, and in truth, the obligation is Rabbinic. He supports this thesis by the fact that, otherwise, it would have been appropriate for the Rambam to consider the obligation as one of the mitzvot.</i> is that] as long as a beast<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a wild animal which you are not obligated to feed. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Shivi'it</i> 9:2).</i> [can be] eating from this species in the field, one may eat from [what he has collected] at home. When there is no longer any [of that species] for the beast to eat in the field, one is obligated to remove that species from his home. This is the obligation of <i>biyur</i> which applies to the produce of the Sabbatical year.
What is implied? If a person has dried figs at home, he may partake of them as long as there are figs on the trees in the field. When there are no longer figs in the field, it is forbidden for him to partake of the figs he has at home and he must instead remove them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states in the following halachah.</i>
If he had a large amount of produce, he should distribute<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">On the day of the <i>biyur</i>.</i> a quantity that can be eaten in three meals to every person [he desires]. It is forbidden - both for the rich and the poor<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion concerning this matter in the mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 5:3, 9:8).</i> - to partake of it after the time of <i>biyur</i>. If he is not able to find people to eat at the time of <i>biyur</i>, he should burn it with fire or cast it into Mediterranean Sea,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is how the Rambam [in the conclusion of his Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>et al</i>], interprets the phrase <i>yam hamelech</i>. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:2. Others interpret it as referring to the Dead Sea. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 9:2), he mentions only casting the produce into the sea.</i> or destroy it through any other means.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the Rambam interprets the word <i>biyur</i> as meaning "destruction." After the time of <i>biyur</i>, the produce must be destroyed. The Ramban (in his commentary to the Torah) and other <i>Rishonim</i>, however, interpret it as "removal" and maintain that after the <i>biyur</i>, all that is necessary is to renounce one's ownership over the produce and thus remove it from one's domain. Rav Yosef Corcus states that this view can be relied upon in the present era and, indeed, this is the practice in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> today.</i>
If one had raisins from the Sabbatical year and there were no longer any grapes left in the fields,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In a later addition to his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 9:4; see Rav Kappach's notes), the Rambam states that fields within a city are considered like gardens.

(He must, however, regard even the produce growing in his courtyard as ownerless and allow another person to enter and pick it.)</i> If, however, there are very firm grapes that do not mature until the end of the year [still growing in the field], one may partake of the raisins [he has stored] because of them. Similar laws apply in all analogous instances.
When a tree produces fruit twice a year and one still possesses fruit from its first crop, he may partake of it as long as the second crop is still in the field. For [the requirement that] this species be [available] in the field [is met]. We do not, however, [continue to] partake [of stored fruit] because of fruit that grows in the fall,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since this fruit grows in the rainy season, which begins well after Rosh HaShanah, it is considered as the produce of the eighth year and not of the Sabbatical year.</i> because it is considered as the produce of a different year.
When a person pickles three types of produce in one barrel, if one of these types of produce is no longer available in the field, that type of produce should be removed from the barrel.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">And eaten or destroyed, as stated in Halachah 3. He is not, however, obligated to remove the other two types of produce.

He explains that once a jar of pickled vegetables were opened (in pre-refrigeration eras), the vegetables would spoil rapidly. Hence, it is considered as if the entire batch was already removed from his possession.</i><br>Just as one is obligated to remove food [stored for] human consumption, so too, must he remove animal fodder from his home and he may no longer feed it to an animal if that type of produce is no longer available in the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In this context, there is no difference between the laws applying to food for humans and animal fodder.</i>
Just as one must remove the produce of the Sabbatical year, so too, one must remove the money [received in exchange for it].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 6, the holiness of the produce is transferred to the money received for it.</i> What is implied? One sold pomegranates of the Sabbatical year and used the money received in return for them [to purchase] food. When there are no longer any pomegranates on the trees in the field, but he remains in possession of the money he received for selling them, he is obligated to remove it from his possession.
What should he do? He should purchase food with this money and distribute it, [providing] three meals to every person [he desires].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As above, these activities should be performed on the day the obligation of <i>biyur</i> takes place.

[<i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is divided into] three lands [with regard to the obligation of] <i>biyur</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as the Rambam proceeds to explain, <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is not considered a single entity with regard to this obligation, for different conditions apply in each of the three regions. Each of those regions individually, however, is considered as a single integral entity although different conditions apply in each of its districts.</i><br>a) the entire land of Yehudah, its mountainous portion, its plain, and its valley, is all one region.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this region - as well as the other two - is subdivided into three districts.</i><br>b) the entire [West] Bank of the Jordan,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>Ever HaYarden</i>, literally Trans-Jordan, is most commonly used to refer to the areas on the Eastern bank of the Jordan, as mentioned at the conclusion of the Book of Numbers, throughout the Book of Deuteronomy, and in many places throughout the Mishnah. There are many authorities (among them, Rabbenu Shimshon and Rabbenu Tam) who therefore consider that as the proper interpretation in this instance as well. In this instance, however, the Rambam understands the term differently. His view is accepted by Rabbenu Asher, Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura, and explained by <i>Kaftor UPerach</i>. See also the gloss of Rav Akiva Eiger.</i> [including] the plain of Lod, the mountains [around] the plain of Lod, [the area of] Beit Choron, with the sea, is all one region; and<br>c) the entire Galilee, the upper [Galilee], the lower [Galilee], and the area of Tiberias, is one region. In each of these three regions, one may partake [of a species of produce stored at home] until the last [traces of that produce] cease [to exist in the entire region's fields].
What is implied? If one possesses produce in the land of Yehudah, one may partake of it as long as this species is found [in the fields of] the entire land of Yehudah.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Even if it is no longer available in the particular district in which one is located. See <i>Sh'vi'it</i> 9:2-3.</i> Similar laws apply if he possesses produce from the Galilee or from the [West] Bank of the Jordan.
These three regions are considered as one entity with regard to carobs, olives, and dates.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">And one may eat these species in one region even though they are no longer available in that entire region, as long as they are available in other portions of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Among the reasons given for the distinction between these species and other fruits is that there is little difference between the times these fruits grow in one region of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and another. Also, these species remain on the tree after they have ripened for longer than most fruits. Hence, there is added reason for seeking a common date.</i> One may eat dates [throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>] until the last dates are no longer available in Tzo'ar.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A village near Jericho, a region renown for its dates.

Dried figs may be eaten until Chanukah.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have questioned the Rambam's statements with regard to figs and grapes, for they imply that there is a universal time for the <i>biyur</i> of these species and yet they are not mentioned together with the three species at the beginning of the halachah. The Radbaz resolves this question by saying that the dates mentioned by the Rambam are the latest applicable in all of the three regions.</i>
When a person transports produce of the Sabbatical year from a region in which it is no longer available [in the field] to a region where it is available, or from a region where it is available to a region in which it is no longer available, he is obligated in <i>biyur</i>. [The rationale is that] we place upon him the stringencies of the place from which he departed and those of the place to which he journeyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle applied in several different contexts in Torah law to maintain unity within the Jewish community; see <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 8:20. With regard to the matter at hand, since the obligation of <i>biyur</i> has already taken effect in one of these regions, he is obligated to observe it.</i><br>When the produce of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> has been brought to the Diaspora, it should be destroyed in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it need not be brought back to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to be destroyed there as required by one opinion in <i>Sh'vi'it</i> 6:5.

A great general principle was stated with regard to [the produce of] the Sabbatical year: Whenever [produce] is [used as] food for humans, animal fodder, or as one of the dyes, if it will not be maintained in the earth, the laws of the Sabbatical year apply to it and to money received for it and the requirements of <i>biyur</i> apply to it<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For it is maintained in the earth only for a specific time.</i> and to money received for it, e.g., the leaves of wild onions, mint, and endives, are considered as food for humans, brambles and thorn are considered as animal fodder, and woad<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Which produces a bluish dye.</i> and safflower are considered as dyes. If the species is maintained in the earth, e.g., madder<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Which produces a red dye.</i> and dyer's rocket from the dyes,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam does not mention food for human's or animal fodder, for all species of these types of produce reach a point where they are no longer available in the field and the obligation of <i>biyur</i> takes effect at that time.</i> even though the laws of the Sabbatical year apply to it and to money received for it. The requirements of <i>biyur</i> do not apply to it or to money received for it, because it is maintained in the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">And thus is continually available to an animal.</i> Instead, one may benefit from it and use it as dye until Rosh HaShanah.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., until the end of the Sabbatical year. Some commentaries maintain that the text should read "after Rosh HaShanah," for the plants that grew in the Sabbatical year will continue growing into the eighth year. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 7:2), the Rambam states: "We continue to use them and benefit from them until they cease [growing in the field]." The Radbaz follows this understanding, but maintains that after Rosh HaShanah, these plants should be declared ownerless. That fulfills the requirement of <i>biyur</i> with regard to them.</i>

When carobs of the Sabbatical year were left to soak in the wine of the sixth year or in the wine of the eighth year, <i>biyur</i> must be performed with the wine, because it has absorbed the flavor of the produce of the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The wine absorbs the carobs' flavor immediately (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> This is the general principle: When the produce of the Sabbatical year becomes mixed with other produce of the same species,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., the wine of the Sabbatical year with the wine of other years (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> even the slightest amount [causes the entire mixture to be considered as the produce of the Sabbatical year].

[The rationale is that] we do not give even the slightest amount of money exchanged for the produce of the Sabbatical year<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For when one pays for the produce, the holiness of the produce is transferred to the money, as explained in Chapter 6, Halachot 6-7.</i> to a common person, lest he not partake of [food purchased with it] in a manner that befits the holiness of the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Thus by purchasing the produce and giving him money, one would be - at least indirectly - causing him to violate the prohibitions of the Sabbatical year. Although in many of the instances mentioned in the previous halachot, we followed the principle that as long as there was a possibility that he would not transgress, we do not restrict transactions with people who might violate the laws of the Sabbatical year, in this instances, it is very likely that a transgression will occur. Hence, we are more stringent.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 9:1), the Rambam mentions a different reason for the prohibition against purchasing fruit from a common person, because he is likely to have harvested them and stored them in violation of the laws of the Sabbatical year.</i>
When a person purchases a <i>lulav</i> from a common person in the Sabbatical year,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a <i>lulav</i> to use for the fulfillment of the mitzvah on Sukkot. This sale is permissible, because the laws of the Sabbatical year do not apply to a <i>lulav</i>, for it is part of the tree and not a fruit [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:9)].</i> he should give him an <i>esrog</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a fruit and hence, may not be sold.</i> as a present.

When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Prohibition against purchasing even the slightest amount of produce from a common person.</i> apply? When a person sells types of fruit that are usually protected, e.g., figs, pomegranates, or the like. If, however, he sells fruit which we could assume is ownerless, e.g., rue, amaranth, moss rose, coriander<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Both of these are fragrant herbs. Our translation is taken from Rav Kappach's notes to the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 9:1).</i> and the like, it is permitted to purchase from them a small amount, merely the worth of three meals. [This leniency was granted to allow] the seller to earn his livelihood.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">These fruits and herbs grew naturally and are not cultivated. Hence, we do not assume that the person stored them away and therefore there is room for limited leniency (Radbaz).</i>
Similarly, any species from which the tithes are not obligated to be separated, e.g., exceedingly powerful garlic, the onions of Rikpah,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Which are also very pungent tasting. Our definition of terms is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 5:9).</i> a pearled Cilcilian bean, Egyptian lentils,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">These types of beans and lentils are of abnormal shape and grow wild (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and the like, and also the seeds of plants when [the seeds] are not eaten, e.g., those of turnips, radishes, and the like, may be purchased from any person in the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since these species are not usually eaten as food, they are not bound by the Scriptural prohibitions of <i>terumah</i> and the tithes (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 2:3).

When does the above apply? To an ordinary common person.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Whose reputation vis-à-vis the observance of the Sabbatical year has not been established.</i> When, however, one is suspect to carry out transactions with the produce of the Sabbatical year or to guard his produce and sell it, we may not purchase anything from him that has any connection to the Sabbatical year. [Similarly,] we may not purchase flax - even combed out flax<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The reason that it is forbidden to purchase flax from such a person is that flax seeds are sometimes considered as food.

A person who is suspect [to sell produce of] the Sabbatical year is not necessarily considered as suspect to [sell produce of the second] tithe. [Similarly,] one who is suspect [to sell produce of the second] tithe is not necessarily considered as suspect [to sell produce of] the Sabbatical year even though they are both Scriptural commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 4:10), generally when two prohibitions are of the same degree of severity, if one is considered suspect to violate one, he is considered as suspect to violate the other. Nevertheless, this instance is an exception for the reasons stated by the Rambam.</i> [The rationale is that each possesses a stringency which the other lacks.] The [second] tithe must be brought to [Jerusalem]<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the Rambam's words mean "the place," recalling Deuteronomy 12:11: "the place which God... will choose to cause His name to dwell." See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:1. This stringency does not apply with regard to the produce of the Sabbatical year which can be eaten in any place.</i> and this does not apply with regard to [the produce of] the Sabbatical year. [Conversely, the produce of] the Sabbatical year cannot be redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even after its redemption, it remains holy (Chapter 6, Halachah 6). In contrast, once the produce of the second tithe is redeemed, it is considered as ordinary produce (<i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:1).</i> and this does not apply with regard to [the produce of] the second tithe.
A person who is suspect [of selling impure food as if it were] ritually pure is not suspect [to sell produce of the second] tithe or [that of] the Sabbatical year. For the impure food that was sold as being ritually pure imparts impurity to others only according to Rabbinic Law<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTumah</i> 8:10.</i> and one who is suspect [of causing the transgression] of Rabbinic Law is not suspect [of causing the violation] of Scriptural Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Scriptural prohibitions are more severe, we assume that the person will respect them.</i>
Whenever a person is suspect [of selling entities in violation of a prohibition], even though his word is not accepted with regard to his own property, his word is accepted with regard to [the property of] others. We operate under the assumption that a person will not violate a prohibition for the sake of others. Therefore even though a person is suspect with regard to a given [prohibition], he may judge and offer testimony regarding this matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in the notes to <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 12:17, the Ra'avad does not accept this principle and maintains that if someone is considered as suspect regarding a particular issue, he is not accepted as a judge or witness concerning such matters. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's view.</i>
Priests are considered suspect with regard to [the prohibitions of] the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we fear that they will not remove the produce of the Sabbatical year from their possession at the time of <i>biyur</i>, but instead will store it and sell it afterwards.</i> [The reason is that] they rationalize their conduct saying: Since the <i>terumot</i> are permitted to us even though they are forbidden to non-priests [and this violation is punishable] by death,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">At the hand of heaven (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 6:5-6.</i> certainly, the produce of the Sabbatical year is permitted to us.<br>Therefore when a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>terumah</i> falls into 100 <i>se'ah</i> of the produce of the Sabbatical year, a <i>se'ah</i> should be separated.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">And given to the priests. They must partake of it as if it were <i>terumah</i>, as stated in <i>ibid.</i> 13:1. As explained there, this act is necessary in order to enable non-priests to partake of the entire mixture.

Chapter 9

It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 141) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 477) includes this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. The Rambam's wording implies that the nullification of the debt comes as a result of the person's action. It is not automatically nullified at the conclusion of the seventh year. For that reason, the Rambam states in Halachah 28, when a person comes to pay a debt after the conclusion of the seventh, the creditor must say that he is nullifying the debt (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XVII, p. 289ff.).</i> to nullify a loan in the Sabbatical year, as [Deuteronomy 15:2] states: "All of those who bear debt must release their hold." A person who demands payment of a debt after the Sabbatical year passed<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For, according to the Rambam, the debt is not nullified until the conclusion of the Sabbatical year (Halachah 4).</i> violates a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 230) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 475) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as it is stated [<i>ibid.</i>]: "One shall not demand [payment] from his friend and his brother."
The nullification of debts applies according to Scriptural Law only in the era when the Jubilee year is observed<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 10, Halachah 9, after the exile of the tribes of Reuven and Gad, the laws of the Jubilee year no longer applied according to Scriptural Law.</i> and [the sale of] land is also nullified, for the land [that has been sold] returns to its original owners without financial payment.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachot 13, 15, for details regarding this concept.</i> This matter was conveyed through the chain of tradition. Our Sages declared:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 36a.</i> In the era when you nullify [the sale of] land, you nullify debts everywhere, whether in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> or in the Diaspora. In the era when you do not nullify [the sale of] land, you do not nullify debts anywhere, even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
According to Rabbinic Law, the nullification of debts applies in the present age in all places,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Gittin, loc. cit.</i>, the nullification of debts applies in the present era, even in the Diaspora. His view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 67:1). In his gloss to that text, the Rama quotes different opinions among the Ashkenazic authorities. Some maintain that the Rabbis did not ordain the observance of this law in the present age. Others maintain that it should be observed as a custom. Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Halvaah</i> 34, follows the Rambam's view.</i> even though the Jubilee year is not observed.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even according to Rabbinic Law (see <i>Tosafot, Gittin, loc. cit.</i>).</i> [This is a decree, instituted] so that the concept of the nullification of debts will not be forgotten by the Jewish people.
The Sabbatical year does not nullify debts until its conclusion. [This is derived as follows: Deuteronomy 15:1-2] states: "At the end of seven years, you shall effect a remission. This is the matter of the remission." And [Deuteronomy 31:10] states:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the <i>Hakhel</i> ceremony. The interrelation of these verses has its source in the <i>Sifri</i>.</i> "At the end of seven years, at the time of the Sabbatical year, during the holiday of Sukkot." Just as in that instance, [the event takes place] after the seven [years], so too, the nullification of the debts takes place after the seven [years].<br>Therefore if one lent money to a colleague in the Sabbatical year itself, he may demand payment of his debt for the entire year.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to other authorities, although the debt is not remitted until the end of the Sabbatical year, from the beginning of the Sabbatical year, the creditor is forbidden to demand payment. See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, loc. cit.</i> 36.</i> When the sun sets on the night of Rosh HaShanah of the eighth year,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the sunset marking the advent of Rosh HaShanah.</i> the debt is nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is forbidden to demand its payment (<i>Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.</i>).</i>
If one slaughtered a cow and divided it<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since the people considered the day as a festival, the recipients of the meat could not pay for it in an ordinary manner. Hence they promised to pay for their shares later, considering the money as a debt [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 10:2)].</i> under the supposition that today would be [declared as] Rosh HaShanah,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">When the laws of the annulment of debts would no longer apply. The Rambam is speaking about a situation that could have occurred in the time the new month was sanctified based on the testimony of witnesses (in contrast to the present era, when we follow a fixed calendar). In that era as well, the court had a presupposition of the day when Rosh HaShanah would fall and the people celebrated it as a holiday in anticipation of its sanctification. Nevertheless, the moon was not actually sanctified - and thus the holiday officially declared as such - unless witnesses came. Now it was possible, especially if the night was cloudy, that witnesses did not see the moon and hence could not go to the court to give testimony. Hence the day could not be declared as Rosh HaShanah.</i> but instead, a day was added to Elul and thus that day was the final day of the Sabbatical year, the money is lost, for the Sabbatical year ended while the debt was extant.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, based on the principle (stated in Halachah 11), that a debt stemming from money owed on account to a grocer is not nullified at the end of the Sabbatical year. Indeed, the source for this law (the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Sh'vi'it</i> 10:1) states that it follows the opinion that maintains that such an account is nullified by the Sabbatical year. The Radbaz, however, explains that the situations are not identical. For it is common practice for a grocer to sell on account. A butcher, by contrast, expects immediate payment. A similar distinction is suggested by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i>
The Sabbatical year nullifies a loan, even a loan supported by a promissory note which creates a lien on one's possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., once a loan is recorded in a promissory note, in the event the debtor does not pay, the creditor can use the promissory note to collect the debt from the landed property belonging to the debtor at the time of the loan (even if it was subsequently sold to others). Since the property is on lien, one might think that the situation is comparable to a loan supported by security (Halachah 14), which is not nullified by the Sabbatical year. That law, however, does not apply in the present instance, because although the lien applies to the debtor's property, it is not associated with a specific property.</i> If, however, the borrower designated a field [to serve as payment] for the loan, it is not nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since the land has been designated as payment, it is as if the loan has already been paid.</i> The Sabbatical year also nullifies the obligation to take an oath,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For example, a person claimed that a colleague owed him 100 <i>zuz</i> and the colleague admitted only to owing 50. In such an instance, the colleague is required to take an oath regarding the other 50 <i>zuz</i>. If he fails to take the oath before the conclusion of the Sabbatical year, that obligation is nullified.</i> for [the prooftext] states: "He shall not demand," i.e., neither payment, nor an oath.
When does the above apply? With regard to an oath imposed by the judges<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This is a specific term that, as explained in <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 11:5-6, refers to oaths administered because of the denial of a specific and definite claim that would create a monetary obligation were the defendant to have admitted to it.</i> and the like, i.e., obligations that were he to accept them, the Sabbatical year would nullify them. But oaths taken by watchmen or partners<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot, loc. cit.</i>, which explains that these individuals can be compelled to take an oath even though the plaintiff does not have a definite claim against them.</i> and the like, i.e., oaths that were he to admit [the obligation], he would be required to pay [after the Sabbatical year],<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to a watchman, the explanation is that - unlike a loan - the property being watched is considered as always being in the possession of the owner. Hence, the obligation for it is not nullified by the Sabbatical year (see Radbaz). A partner is considered as a watchman (<i>Bava Batra</i> 42b).</i> he is required to take the oath after the Sabbatical year.
If a person gave a colleague a loan and then demanded payment, [the colleague] denied the obligation and remained in denial when [the conclusion of] the Sabbatical year arrived and then he admitted his obligation or witnesses came [and testified to that effect] after the Sabbatical year [was concluded], the obligation is not nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that the obligation was not firmly established before the conclusion of the Sabbatical year, for until the borrower's admission of the debt or the substantiation of the claim by witnesses, the creditor cannot press for payment in a court of law. Hence, the end of the year does not lead to the nullification of the debt. See the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 10:1). The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, but it is supported by the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 67:7). Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> does add to the Rambam's wording the concept that the debtor took an oath to support his denial. In his gloss to the <i>Tur</i>, the <i>Darkei Moshe</i> explains that addition, stating that unless the debtor has taken an oath to support his denial, then we are speaking of an ordinary loan and the conclusion of the Sabbatical year nullifies both the loan and the obligation of an oath to support one's denial, as stated in Halachah 6.</i>
When a person lends money to a colleague and sets [the time of payment] in ten years time, it is not nullified [by the Sabbatical year. The rationale is that] although [ultimately, the command,] "Do not demand [payment]" will apply,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For in ten years time, he will demand payment of the debt.</i> at present, he may not demand payment.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For the loan has not become due. And as long as there is no payment demanded, the debt is not nullified, for the Sabbatical year only nullifies a debt for which payment is called for (the Responsa of Rabbenu Asher, sec. 86).</i> If he stipulated that he would not demand payment, [the debt] is nullified by the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz and Rav Yosef Corcus explain that even though the collector has promised not to demand payment of the debt, since there is a payment date before the end of the Sabbatical year, the borrower is under obligation to pay. Hence, it is as if payment is being demanded from him.</i>
When a person lends money to a colleague and he stipulates with [the borrower] that [the debt] will not be nullified by the Sabbatical year, it is nullified, for he cannot negate the law of the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle, applicable in many contexts. Whenever a person establishes a stipulation that runs contrary to the Torah's laws, his stipulation is nullified. For the Torah is not given over to man's will and no mortal can bend it to fit his whims (see <i>Makkot</i> 3b; <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 6:9).</i> If [the borrower] stipulates that he will not nullify this debt, even in the Sabbatical year, the stipulation is binding, for any stipulation made regarding financial matters is binding. Thus this person took on a financial obligation which the Torah did not obligate him in.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between this clause and the previous one can be explained as follows: In the previous instance, the person was attempting to postulate that the Torah's laws should not apply. This is not within a mortal's power. In the second clause, by contrast, the person is saying that although the laws of the Sabbatical Law do apply, he asks the borrower to accept an obligation even though the Torah releases him from it. Torah Law does not prevent him from accepting such an obligation. See the parallels in <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 11:15.<br>See also the comments of <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 67), that one is permitted to make such a stipulation. It is not merely that, after the fact, one is bound by it.<br>Based on this principle, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Halva'ah</i>:35 draws the following conclusion:<br>At present, in these countries, it is not customary [to employ] a pruzbol. [Some] have explained the custom [as follows]: Since it has become customary to collect all debts after the Sabbatical year, even without a pruzbol, and the borrower knows of this practice, it is as if the lender made a stipulation at the time of the loan that [the loan was being given] on condition that the borrower never nullify this debt, even in the Sabbatical year. Thus [the borrower] made himself liable for a financial obligation not required of him by the Torah in which instance, his stipulation is binding and he is obligated according to Scriptural Law.<br>Nevertheless, that text continues, stating that "any G‑d-fearing person will be stringent with regard to his own conduct and make a pruzbol, [for] it is something that does not involve a loss and is easy to arrange."</i>
An account at a store is not nullified by the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 10:1), the Rambam explains that until a summary of an account is made, it is not considered as a debt. Instead, the seller trusts the purchaser and is willing to wait for payment. Thus all of the different transactions are considered as one sale. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since it is not customary for the seller to demand payment of such accounts, the account is not bound by the prohibition: "Do not demand payment." Hence, the mitzvah to nullify the obligation also does not apply.<br>Similar concepts are reflected in the treatment of the subject by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Halva'ah</i>, subsec. 39, which states: "Since a storekeeper usually extends credit for a year or two and it is unusual for him to demand payment immediately, it is as if he set a time for payment after the Sabbatical year."</i> If it is established as a debt,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 67:14 offers two explanations for "establish[ing it] as a debt":<br>a) setting a time for payment;<br>b) totaling up the account to arrive at a sum.</i> it is nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For in such an instance, it is no different than any other debt.</i> The wage of a worker is not nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Here also the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since it is not common for a worker to demand payment of his wages immediately, until he does so, they are not considered as a debt.</i> If it is considered as a debt, it is nullified.

He therefore explains that the intent is that since these penalties are written in the Torah, it is as the debts were handed over to the court in which instance, they are not nullified by the Sabbatical year, as stated in Halachah 15.<br><i>Rambam LeAm</i> explains the difference between the two on the basis between the distinction between <i>mamon</i>, a financial obligation between men, which a man can release, and <i>k'nas</i>, a penalty required by God from the transgressor that although paid to the person violated is not an obligation to him.</i> If they are considered as debts,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 67:16) defines "establish[ing] as a debt" as calling the defendant to court. <i>Sefer Meirat Einayim</i> 67:31 emphasizes that once the court's decision is written up, it is considered as if the debt has been handed over to the court.</i> they are nullified.

When a person lends money in exchange for security, the debt is not nullified by the Sabbatical year,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 9b states: "A creditor acquires the security given him." Thus when the loan is given in return for security, it is as if he transferred ownership of the security for the loan until it is repaid [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 9:2)].

When a person hands over<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Giving them the actual promissory note, not merely assigning it to them (Rav Yosef Corcus, explaining why this is acceptable according to Scriptural Law, while a <i>pruzbol</i> is merely a Rabbinic institution).</i> his promissory notes to the court, telling [the judges]: "Collect my debt for me," the debts are not nullified by the Sabbatical year.

A <i>pruzbol</i> should be composed only by very great Sages like the court of Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Assi,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">They were the heads of the leading courts in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> shortly at the beginning of the post-Mishnaic era.

As proof of this principle, it cites examples of actions taken by Ezra the Scribe and Joshua. The Rambam understands the Talmud to be saying that even when a financial obligation is Rabbinic in origin, to absolve it, one must have authority comparable to that of Ezra and Joshua. (Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 24:6 - where the Rambam describes the above principle - and in <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 6:12 - where he shows another application of it - he does not state that the courts involved must be made up of judges of unique distinction.)</i> Other courts [of lesser authority] may not compose [a <i>pruzbol</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 67) does not accept the Rambam's ruling and maintains that a <i>pruzbol</i> may be composed by any court.

This represents the body of a <i>pruzbol</i>: "I am notifying you,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 10:4).</i> so-and-so and so-and so<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is quoting the wording of the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 10:4).

A <i>pruzbol</i> may be composed only when [the borrower possesses] land.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that when the borrower possesses land, the creditor's debt is secured, because he may expropriate the land in payment (Radbaz).

When one person borrows from five others, each one must have a <i>pruzbol</i> composed.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">For each one must entrust his debt to the court.</i> When five people borrow from one, one <i>pruzbol</i> is sufficient for him for all the debts.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">For in the one <i>pruzbol</i>, he entrusts all of his debts to the court.</i>
When a person has a <i>pruzbol</i> composed and then he makes a loan, it is not effective. Instead, the loan will be nullified unless he composes [another] <i>pruzbol</i> after giving the loan. Thus one can conclude that any loan which precedes a <i>pruzbol</i> is not nullified because of this <i>pruzbol</i>.

Accordingly, a <i>pruzbol</i> that is predated is valid, while one that is postdated, is invalid.<br>What is implied? One wrote a <i>pruzbol</i> in Nissan and predated it to Adar, it is valid, for he has impaired its legal power, for [only the loans given] until Adar are not nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Since that is the date on the <i>pruzbol</i>, its legal power takes effect from that date even though it was written later and it could have included the loans that were given until the date when it was actually composed.</i> If, however, he postdated it and dated it in Iyar, it is invalid, for he has strengthened its legal power, for [were it to be effective] the loans given until Iyar would not be nullified. This is unlawful, because it is only [the loans given] until Nissan that are not nullified, for that [is when] the matters were conveyed to the court.
When a person produces a promissory note after the Sabbatical year without it being accompanied by a <i>pruzbol</i>, the debt is lost.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">For it is nullified by the Sabbatical year.</i> If he says: "I possessed [a <i>pruzbol</i>] and it was lost, his word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ketubot</i> 9:7), the Rambam explains that the lender's word is accepted based on the principle that a person will not sin when he could achieve the same result in a permitted manner (<i>Gittin</i> 37b). Since he could easily preserve the debt by composing a <i>pruzbol</i>, we assume that he did so rather than transgress the prohibitions of the Sabbatical year, as stated in Halachah 26.</i> For from the time of the danger<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the Talmudic era, the Roman's passed many decrees with the intent of stamping out the observance of the mitzvot. One of them was a prohibition to make a <i>pruzbol</i> (for by doing so, they would undermine the observance of the Sabbatical year). Failure to observe these decrees led to very severe punishment. In fear, many people would compose a <i>pruzbol</i> so that they could collect their debts, but destroy it lest it cause them danger (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> onward,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that even though the danger passed, the Rabbis never rescinded the leniency granted to allow for a uniformity in Jewish practice.</i> a creditor was allowed to collect his debt [after the Sabbatical year] without a <i>pruzbol</i>.<br>Moreover, when a creditor would bring the promissory note [to court] or would come and demand payment of a loan supported by a verbal commitment [alone], [the court] tells the defendant: "Pay him." If the defendant claims: "Where is his <i>pruzbol</i>?", the court asks the plaintiff: "Did you have a <i>pruzbol</i> that was lost?" If he answers affirmatively, his word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin, loc. cit.</i> explains that this is like "opening the mouth of the dumb," i.e., offering support to a litigant to enable him to collect what is due him.</i> If he admits that he did not have a <i>pruzbol</i>, the debt is nullified.<br>Orphans<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Below the age of majority [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 67:28)].</i> do not require a <i>pruzbol</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz cites (<i>Gittin</i> 37a) which states that the Jewish court is considered as "the father of the orphans" and we assume that they do not want to impose Rabbinic decrees in a situation that will harm the orphan's interests. This applies both to loans that they themselves made or that their father made and which are due to his estate (<i>Sefer Meirat Einayim</i> 67:50).</i>
[When the plaintiff] produces a <i>pruzbol</i>, the defendant claims: "The loan for which he is demanding payment was made after the <i>pruzbol</i>,"<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">And thus the loan would be nullified by the Sabbatical year, as stated in Halachah 22.</i> and the plaintiff retorts: "It was made before the <i>pruzbol</i>," the plaintiff's word is accepted. [The rationale is] were he to have claimed: "I had [a <i>pruzbol</i>] and it was lost," his word would have been accepted<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the principle of <i>migo</i>, i.e., had he desired to lie, he would have told a more effective lie. This argument is reinforced by the accepted presumption mentioned previously: that if a person has a permitted way to perform a function, he will not use a forbidden path, i.e., he would make the loan with a valid <i>pruzbol</i>, rather than rely on an invalid one.<br>Generally, a <i>migo</i> is an accepted argument in its own right. Nevertheless, in this instance, the <i>migo</i> must be reinforced by the assumption, for <i>migo</i> is usually employed as an argument in defense of one's position and not to expropriate money and here the plaintiff is seeking to employ it to expropriate money (<i>Biurei HaGra</i> 67:58).</i> even though we do not know the date of the <i>pruzbol</i> that was lost.
If the defendant claims: "I owe him a debt," and the plaintiff states: "No, it is an account from a store which is not nullified [by the Sabbatical year], because I have not yet considered it as a loan,"<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 11.</i> his word is accepted, for were he to desire,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">To lie, i.e., here too, we are relying on the principle of <i>migo</i>, as reinforced by the assumption the Rambam proceeds to mention.</i> he could say: "It was a loan, but I had a <i>pruzbol</i> and it was lost." [Leniency is granted in these instances,] because once the Sages instituted [the concept of] <i>pruzbol</i>, we operate under the assumption that a person will not forgo something permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Lending with a <i>pruzbol</i>.</i> and partake of something that is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Lending without a <i>pruzbol</i>.</i>

The Rama, however, rules that not only Torah Sages, but even ordinary individuals can benefit from this leniency.<br>This leniency is part of the rationale, for the observance of the concept of <i>pruzbol</i> by the Ashkenazic community. Since all that is necessary to preserve a loan is a verbal statement made in the presence of three knowledgeable people, it is proper for everyone to do so (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Halva'ah</i>:35).</i> and one conveys his words to his students,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad (as understood by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>) objects to the Rambam's ruling, for, as stated in Halachah 17, the Rambam maintains that a <i>pruzbol</i> must be composed by a leading court, while here, he seems to imply that any few students are acceptable. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves the apparent contradiction by saying that the students the Rambam refers to here are in fact distinguished judges, and there is no difference in practive between the subjects of the two halachot. Rav Yosef Corcus (in his gloss to Halachah 17) states that as long as the important court approves of such an act, the actual <i>pruzbol</i> may be made in the presence of lesser scholars.</i> saying: "I am notifying you [that I reserve the right] to collect all the debts [owed] to me at any time I desire," he does not have to compose a <i>pruzbol</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 18</i> [The rationale is that Torah scholars] know that the nullification of debts in the present era is a Rabbinic decree and it can be negated verbally.
[Whenever] anyone returns a debt [despite the fact] that the Sabbatical year has passed,<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">And thus, according to law, the debt is nullified and need not be repaid.

The Sages thought it desirable for a debt to be returned, for in this way, people will continue lending each other money in the future.</i> [When receiving the payment,] the lender must say to the one who is making restitution: "I am nullifying [the debt] and your [obligation] to me has been released."<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">For according to law, he can no longer collect the debt.</i> If the debtor says: "Nevertheless, I desire that you accept it," he should accept it. For the Torah states: "One shall not demand [payment]," and payment was not demanded.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">And thus, by accepting it, he is not violating the Torah's commandment to nullify the debt. Indeed, he has fulfilled the commandment to release the debt, for the Deuteronomy 15:2 introduces this commandment with the phrase: "This is the matter (<i>d'var</i>) of remission." <i>D'var</i>, translated as "matter," also relates to the word <i>dibbur</i> meaning "speech," implying that it is sufficient to make a statement of remission to fulfill the mitzvah [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 10:8)].</i><br>[The debtor] should not tell [the creditor]: "I am giving them to you as [payment of ] my debt. Instead, he should tell him: "[The money] is mine,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">For the debt has been absolved.</i> and I am giving it to you as a present."
If [a debtor] returned a debt, but did not make the above statements, [the lender] should turn the conversation to the point where the debtor says: "[The money] is mine, and I am giving it to you as a present."

It is a positive commandment to count sets of seven years<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 140) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 330) includes the commandment to count the sets of years among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

These two mitzvot are entrusted to the High Court<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the court of 71 judges which served as Judaism's supreme Rabbinic authority.</i> alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., their fulfillment is not incumbent on each person individually, but on the people as a whole, and hence, on the High Court, who acts as their agent.</i>
When did the counting begin? After the fourteen years following the entry into <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>. [This is derived from Leviticus 25:3]: "Six years shall you sow your field and six years shall you trim your vineyard." [Implied is that] each person must recognize his [portion of the] land.

Thus the five days from the 25th of Elul until Rosh HaShanah are the first year referred to here. Hence, there is a theoretical conjunction of the sun and the moon for that year. See <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 6:8 and notes which mention the day and time of the first conjunction.</i> They declared the [two thousand,] five hundred, and tenth year after the creation which was the 21st year after the entry into <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as the Sabbatical year. They counted seven Sabbatical years and then sanctified the fiftieth year which was the 64th year after they entered <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>.
The Jewish people counted 17 Jubilee years<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they were in the midst of counting the seventeenth Jubilee as explained in the following note.</i> from the time they entered [<i>Eretz Yisrael</i>] until they departed.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 6:1 relates that the first Temple was built 480 years after the exodus from Egypt.

When the 410 years that the First Temple stood (as stated in <i>Yoma</i> 9a) are added, a total of 836 is reached. 836 divided by 50 equals 16. Thus the Jews were exiled in the 36th year of the seventeenth Jubilee cycle. Note the discussion of the Rambam's wording "17 Jubilees" by the Ra'avad, Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others based on Rosh HaShanah 9a.</i> The year they departed, when the Temple was destroyed the first time, was the year following the Sabbatical year and the 36th year in the Jubilee cycle. For the First Temple stood for 410 years. When it was destroyed, this reckoning ceased.<br>After it ceased, the land remained desolate for seventy years.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And for the 70 years of the Babylonian exile, the Jubilee year cycle was not followed. See Halachah 5.</i> Then the Second Temple was built and it stood for 420 years. In the seventh year after it was built, Ezra ascended [to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>]. This is referred to as the second entry.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See also Chapter 12, Halachah 15.</i> From this year, they began another reckoning.

Although the Jubilee year was not observed in [the era of] the Second Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 8. The Rambam's intent is that the mitzvot of the Jubilee year were not observed.</i> they would count it in order to sanctify the Sabbatical years.
It follows that the year in which the [Second] Temple was destroyed, [more precisely, the year] beginning from Tishrei that was approximately two months after the destruction<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For the destruction took place on the ninth of Av.</i> - for the reckoning of Sabbatical and Jubilee years begins in Tishrei - was the year following the Sabbatical year.

Thus if the reckoning of the Sabbatical and Jubilee years began in its seventh year, there is a total of 414. Eight Jubilee cycles produce a total of 400 years. Thus the year following the destruction was the 415th year and it was the year following the Sabbatical year.</i><br>According to this reckoning, this year which is the 1107 year after the destruction, which is the 1487th year according to the reckoning of legal documents,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In the Talmudic era, it was customary to date legal documents from the time of Alexander the Great's ascent to the throne.

Nevertheless, all of the <i>Geonim</i> have said that they have received a tradition, transferred from teacher to student that in the seventy years between the destruction of the First Temple and the building of the Second Temple, they counted only Sabbatical years, not the Jubilee year. Similarly, after the destruction of the Second Temple, they did not count the fiftieth year. Instead, they counted only sets of seven from the beginning of the year of the destruction. [This interpretation] is also apparent from the Talmud in <i>Avodah Zarah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 9b.</i> This reckoning is a received tradition.
[The reckoning of] the Sabbatical year is well-known and renowned among the <i>Geonim</i> and the people of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. None of them make any reckoning except according to the years of the destruction.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For it is accepted that the year following the destruction was the beginning of a Sabbatical cycle, as stated in Halachah 4.</i> According to this reckoning, this year, which is the 1107th year after the destruction is the year following the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when 1107 is divided by 7, there is a remainder of 1.</i><br>We rely on this tradition and we rule according to it<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this was the practice in his day and this is the present practice in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and throughout the world, for the Rambam's ruling is accepted by both the <i>Beit Yosef</i> and Rama (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 67:1).

When [the laws of] the Jubilee year are observed, the laws of a Hebrew servant are observed,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Avadim</i>, ch. 1-2.</i> as are the laws of homes in a walled city, the laws of a field given as a dedication offering, and the laws of ancestral fields.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The laws governing the latter three subjects are described in Chapters 12 and 13.</i> We accept [a gentile as] a resident alien<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if a gentile accepts the observance of the Seven Laws Given to the Descendants of Noah, he is granted the right to dwell in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, interprets the text differently, reading the last line as: "with the exception of the Sabbatical year in <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i> and, according to Rabbinic Law, the nullification of debts." Some commentaries have suggested that the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 135) support this interpretation.

See <i>Hilchot Avadim</i>, ch. 2.</i> and the return of fields to their owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">As described in the following chapter.</i> This is referred to as "the release of land."
From Rosh HaShanah<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the laws of the Jubilee year do not take effect until the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> on Yom Kippur, the sanctity of the year begins on Rosh HaShanah [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 1:1)].</i> until Yom Kippur, servants would not be released to their homes,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Lest the <i>shofar</i> not be sounded in the court and thus the laws of the Jubilee year not apply, as stated in the previous halachah.</i> nor would they be subjugated to their masters,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">For the likelihood is that it will be sounded.</i> nor would the fields return to their [original] owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the laws of the Jubilee year do not take effect until the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> on Yom Kippur, the sanctity of the year begins on Rosh HaShanah [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 1:1)].</i> Instead, the servants would eat, drink, and rejoice, with crowns on their heads. When Yom Kippur arrives and the <i>shofar</i> is sounded in the court, the servants are released to their homes and the fields are returned to their owners.
With regard to the land being allowed to rest, the laws of the Jubilee year are the same of those of the Sabbatical year.

Chapter 11

[The portions of] <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> that were divided among the tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For the entire passage speaks about an "ancestral heritage," i.e., land given to a person's ancestors when the land was originally divided among the tribes (Radbaz). This excludes Jerusalem which was never divided among the tribes (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>).</i> can never be sold permanently, as [Leviticus 25:23] states: "The land will not be sold in perpetuity." If one sells the land in perpetuity, both [the buyer and the seller] violate a negative commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 227) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 339) include the commandment for the land not to be sold in perpetuity among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> Their deeds are of no consequence,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For whenever a person acts in violation of Torah Law, his deeds are of no avail (<i>Temurah</i> 4b). Since their deeds are of no consequence, they are not punished by lashes (<i>Mishneh LiMelech</i>).</i> and the land reverts to its [original] owner in the Jubilee year.
When a person sells his field for 60 years, it is not returned in the Jubilee.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Even though a Jubilee year will definitely fall within the span of the sale.</i> For [the only property] that returns in the Jubilee year is property that is sold without qualification or property that is sold in perpetuity.
A person should not sell his home or his ancestral field even though it returns to him eventually, unless he becomes impoverished, as [Leviticus 25:25] states: "If your brother becomes indigent and sells his ancestral heritage." One is not permitted to sell [such property] and hold the money in his pocket, engage in commerce with them, or purchase utensils, servants, or livestock. [He is only allowed to] sell to provide himself with sustenance. [Nevertheless,] if one transgressed and sold [such property], the sale is valid.
Judgments are made with regard to a home in accordance with the laws of a walled city,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the following chapter. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 139 and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 341) include the commandment to carry out the laws pertaining to a walled city among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> and with regard to a field in accordance with the laws of a field that is an ancestral heritage.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 138) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 340) include the command to enable a field to be redeemed or for it to be returned to its owner in the Jubilee year among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> The laws of a person who sells a field that is an ancestral heritage [require] the calculation of the years remaining until the Jubilee. Whenever [the original owner] desires to redeem the field he should make a reckoning with the purchaser with regard to the years from which he benefited from the field and reduce that from the purchase price and return the remainder.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains in the following halachah, the sale of such a field is considered as a rental agreement until the Jubilee year, with the purchase price being divided equally among the years remaining until the Jubilee. Thus each year has a set value. If the seller wants to redeem his field, he must pay back the money for the remaining years.</i>
What is implied? There remained ten years until the Jubilee and a field was sold for 100 <i>dinar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the right to use the field was sold for 10 <i>dinar</i> a year.</i> The purchaser benefited from the field for three years and then the seller desired to redeem his field. He should give him 70 <i>dinar</i> and then [the seller] should return the field. Similarly, if he benefited from the field for six years, he should give him 40 <i>dinar</i> and then [the seller] should return the field. If he did not redeem it, but instead left it in the purchaser's possession until the Jubilee, and then it should return to the owner without money, as [indicated by Leviticus 25:15]: "According to the number of years of [its] crops, he will sell it to you."
If he sold it to him when it was filled with produce and then he redeemed it after two years, he cannot tell him: "Return it to me filled with produce as it was when I sold it to you." Therefore if he sold it to him filled with produce before Rosh HaShanah and redeemed it after two years, the purchaser will have benefited from three harvests in those two years. Nevertheless, [the reduction of the price] is calculated only according to two years, as [implied by <i>ibid.</i> 27:18:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Although this verse is speaking about the consecration of a field and its redemption from the Temple treasury, <i>Arichin</i> 29b-30a explains that the same principles should be applied to a sale to a private person.</i> "the priest shall calculate the money...] according to the remaining years," [i.e., the calculation is made according to years,] and not according to crops.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">As one might conclude from Leviticus 25:15 as cited in the previous halachah.</i>
The shoots, the twigs, and the fruits from the wild fig trees contained within it belong to the purchaser like its other produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For these are considered as temporary benefits which the field regularly produces.</i> If, however, [the branches of a tree] are cut down<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:5). See also the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to Chapter 1, Halachah 15.</i> or it dries,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">And thus it has value only to be cut down as firewood.</i> they are both forbidden to benefit from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The purchaser is forbidden to benefit from it alone, because the tree is considered as part of the permanent features of the field and thus was not included in the original sale. On the other hand, the owner cannot take the entire benefit for himself, for the purchaser is entitled to benefit from it for the duration of his ownership of the property.</i> What should be done? It should be sold and land purchased with the proceeds. The purchaser is entitled to benefit from that land until the [original] field is redeemed from him.
If a person purchases a field that is an ancestral heritage and plants trees<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the body of the land itself increases in value, that increase is not granted to the purchaser. See Halachah 16.</i> which increase the value [of the field], when it returns [to its original owner] in the Jubilee, we should evaluate the increase in value brought about by the trees in it and the owner of the field must pay this sum to the purchaser. [This is derived from <i>ibid.</i> 25:33]: "A home that was sold shall go out... [in the Jubilee]." [Implied is that the home] is returned, but not the increase in its value.
When a person sells his field in the era when the Jubilee year is observed as we explained, he is not permitted to redeem it in less than two years, as [<i>ibid.</i>:15] states: "According to the number of years<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The use of the plural form implies that the sale must be for at least two years.</i> of [its] crops, he will sell it to you." Even if the purchaser was willing [to return it earlier], it is forbidden, as [the same verse] states: "According to the number of years<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the body of the land itself increases in value, that increase is not granted to the purchaser. See Halachah 16.</i> after the Jubilee shall you purchase it from your colleague." [The purchaser must maintain possession for] at least two years from the date of the sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he cannot redeem it until the same date two years later. We do not count the years as beginning from Rosh HaShanah, but from the date of the sale.</i>
The purchaser must benefit from two crops in these two years and then [the seller] may redeem it, for it is written "years of its crops." Therefore if one of the two years were the Sabbatical year<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">When it is forbidden to sow a field.</i> or a year of windblast or blight,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Which prevented crops from growing in the entire land (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 106a).</i> they are not included in the reckoning.
If, however, the purchaser left it fallow one year and then benefited from it in the second year or benefited from it one year and then lightly plowed it, but did not sow it in the following year, [these years] are included in the reckoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since crops could have grown during those years, and he chose not to sow the land on his own, they are considered "years of its crops." The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that this law also applies if the purchaser leaves it fallow for two years. The Radbaz, however, does not accept this conclusion.</i> If he sold it in the Jubilee itself, the sale is not binding and the money should be returned to the seller.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 29b explains that this is a logical conclusion. If the advent of the Jubilee causes a field that was sold to be returned to its original owners, it will certainly prevent the sale of one that was not sold as of yet from taking effect.</i>
If he sold it one year before the Jubilee, the purchaser benefits from it for a second year after the Jubilee,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As implied by the phrase "<i>years</i> of its crops," a sale must take effect for at least two years. Hence, the Jubilee does not nullify this sale and the land remains his for one year after the sale. <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes that since a Jubilee is always preceded by a Sabbatical year (when the purchaser cannot benefit from it), the land must have been sold two years before the Jubilee.</i> as [implied by the phrase]: "years of its crops."
If he sold clefts that were filled with water or rocky [land] that was not fit to sow upon, he may redeem them in less than two years, as [implied by the phrase]: "years of its crops." One might infer that it is only a field that is fit to grow crops that is not redeemed in less than two years. [Nevertheless,] if the original owner did not redeem [this land], it returns to him in the Jubilee even though it is not fit to be sown.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For such land is still called "his ancestral heritage" (<i>Arachin</i> 14b).</i>
If he sold [fruit-]trees,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed addition is based on the gloss of the Radbaz who explains that this law would not apply to non-fruit trees. They could be redeemed within the two years. He also explains that the seller must have specifically stated that the sale does not include the land. Otherwise, a certain amount of land is automatically included as stated in <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 24:1-2. See also the notes to <i>Hilchot Arichin</i> 4:25.</i> they may not be redeemed in less than two years, for they are fit to produce crops. If he did not redeem them, they are not returned to the owner in the Jubilee, as [implied by <i>ibid.</i>:27]: "he shall return to his ancestral heritage." [This excludes] trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For the term "ancestral heritage" implies land.</i>
If a person sold his field to one person, that person sold it to a second, the second to a third - even if there were 100 consecutive sales - in the Jubilee, it returns to its original owner, as [implied by Leviticus 27:24]: "In the Jubilee year, the field will return to the one from whom he purchased it, whose ancestral heritage it was."<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Although the verse is speaking about the return of a purchased field that was consecrated, similar principles apply even if the field was not consecrated.</i>
If [the owner] sold it to the first purchaser for 100 <i>dinarim</i> and [the latter] sold it to the second for 200, should the original owner desire to redeem it, he makes a reckoning only with the first purchaser, as [<i>ibid.</i> 25:27] states: "[And return the remainder] to the man to whom he sold it."<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">That purchaser must reimburse the person to whom he sold the field. Although the profit of the purchaser/seller is minimized according to the number of years remaining to the Jubilee, he still retains the profit for the years the sale was viable.</i> If [the owner] sold it to a person for 200 and [the latter] sold it for 100, [the owner] makes a reckoning with the final [purchaser].<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the owner need not compensate the purchaser/seller for his loss.</i><br>Similarly, if he sold the field for 100 and it increased in value<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This is referring to an increase that comes about because of market fluctuations and not as a result of improvements made by the purchaser as indicated by Halachah 8 (Radbaz).</i> in the possession of the purchaser until it was appropriate to be sold for 200, the reckoning should be made according to the purchase price. If he sold it for 200 and its value diminished<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, the Rambam is speaking about a decrease as a result of market fluctuations. Needless to say, the same law would apply if the value of the land was reduced because of the purchaser's actions.</i> and it is now fit to be sold for 100, the reckoning should be made according to its present value. [The general principle is:] We always augment the legal power of the seller of an ancestral heritage and weaken the legal power of the purchaser.
When a person sells a field that is an ancestral heritage, but he also possesses other fields and sells some of those other fields to redeem [his ancestral heritage] that he sold, his [request to redeem the field] is not heeded, for [<i>ibid.</i>:26] states: "And he attained enough to redeem it." [We can infer that] he must attain something that was not accessible to him at the time he sold it. Similarly, if he borrowed [money] to redeem [the field], his [request] is not heeded, for that verse states: "And he acquired." [Implied is that he must obtain the means on his own], not through a loan.
If he attained a small amount [of resources] and desired to redeem half the field he sold, his [request] is not heeded, for that verse states: "enough to redeem it." Either he redeems the entire [field] or he does not redeem at all.<br>If a relative desired to redeem it, he may, as [<i>ibid.</i>:25] states: "And his redeemer who is related to him shall come...."<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The classic example of this is the redemption of the field sold by Elimelech by his relative, Boaz, as described at the conclusion of the book of Ruth.</i>
When a person gives his field away as a present, it returns to him in the Jubilee, as [<i>ibid.</i>:13] states: "Each man shall return to his ancestral heritage." This includes one who gave [it away as] a present.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As the Radbaz mentions, in several sources (e.g., Chapter 12, Halachah 4), we find the principle that a present is considered as a sale. [<i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> asks: If so, why is the prooftext necessary?]</i>
Brothers who divide [an inheritance] are considered as purchasers<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we consider it as if they sold the share the other received in return for the share that they received. We do not apply the principle of <i>bereirah</i>, i.e., consider the portion received as the portion destined for them at the outset (<i>Bechorot</i> 52b).</i> and each one should return his portion to the other in the Jubilee, but their division is not nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there is no need to nullify the entire division and recalculate. Instead, it is sufficient to merely exchange portions (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Similarly, a firstborn<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Who receives a double share of the inheritance. From the wording of Deuteronomy 21:17, our Sages conclude that this double portion is given to the firstborn as a present. Hence, since a present is considered as a sale, the share is returned and the inheritance redivided [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 9:11)].</i> and one who performs <i>yibbum</i> with his brother's wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">And is therefore given his brother's share of the inheritance (<i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 3:7). He is also called a "firstborn" (Deuteronomy 25:6  and thus the concepts mentioned in the previous note apply to him.</i> return the portion that they received in the Jubilee and take another portion instead of it.
[Different rules apply with regard to a husband] who inherits his wife's [property]. Although a husband's inheritance of this property is a Rabbinic ordinance,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 12:3; <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 1:8, 6:8.</i> our Sages reinforced their decree as if it were of Scriptural origin and he is not required to return it [to the women's family] in the Jubilee year.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is considered as a single heir and not as a purchaser.</i> If he inherited a [family] cemetery from her, he should return it to her family members lest this blemish [the reputation of] the family.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">As the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states in his gloss to <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 24:17, it is an embarrassment for the members of a family that their relatives will not be buried in the family plot.</i> They should pay him its worth after deducting the value of his wife's grave, for he is obligated to bury her.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 12:2,4.</i>

Chapter 12

A person who sells a house in a city surrounded by a wall<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 15, it is not significant whether the city is surrounded by a wall at the present time.

When he redeems it, he returns all the money he received and does not deduct anything from the purchaser.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the laws of a field that is an ancestral heritage, as mentioned in Chapter 11, Halachah 4. The return of the purchaser's money in full resembles a loan at interest - for the benefit he had in using the property is comparable to interest paid for the principal - nevertheless, because a sale is involved, there is no prohibition (<i>Arichin</i> 9:3).</i>
Relatives may not redeem it,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the law regarding an ancestral heritage (Chapter 11, Halachah 18).</i> only the seller himself if he obtains the means. He may sell his property and redeem it,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the law regarding an ancestral heritage (<i>ibid.</i>:17).</i> but he may not borrow to redeem it, nor may he redeem it partially.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In this, the laws parallel those governing an ancestral field (<i>ibid.</i>:17-18).</i>
If the purchaser dies, [the original owner] may redeem it from his son. Similarly, if the seller dies, his son may redeem it for the duration of the twelve months.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 32b derives these concepts from the exegesis of relevant verses.</i>
If [the seller] sold it to one person and he sold it to another, the reckoning is made from [the date of] the first [sale]. When the first year is concluded, the house is established<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Permanently, for it does not return to the owner in the Jubilee. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arichin</i> 9:4).</i> as the property of the [second] purchaser. For the [second] seller<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Who was also the first purchaser.</i> sold to the second [purchaser] all the rights that will accrue to him [with regard to this property].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to a difference of opinion in <i>Arichin, loc. cit.</i>, whether after twelve months, the house remains in the possession of the second purchaser or reverts to the first. Although one might argue that the Torah specifies that if the house is not redeemed it becomes the property of the first seller, that rationale is not accepted for the reason the Rambam states.</i> If twelve months pass and it is not redeemed, it is established as the property of the [second] purchaser.<br>Similarly, if [a person] gave a house as a present and did not redeem it within these twelve months, it is established<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Permanently, for it does not return to the owner in the Jubilee. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arichin</i> 9:4).</i> as the property of the recipient of the present.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For as indicated by Chapter 11, Halachah 19, a present is equivalent to a sale.</i>
During a leap year, the permanent disposition of the property is not brought about until the end of the year,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., until the end of a 13 month period.</i> as [Leviticus 25:30] states: "Until a complete year is completed for it." [This wording indicates that] the extra month [of the leap year] is included.
[The following rules apply when a person] sold two houses, one in the middle of Adar 1 and the other on Rosh Chodesh Adar II. When the month of Adar arrives in the following year,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an ordinary year with only one Adar.</i> the year for the house sold on Rosh Chodesh II is completed.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For it is a full twelve months after that sale and that sale was made after the extra month of the leap year had been completed.</i> The year for the house sold in the middle of Adar I is not completed until the middle of Adar in the following year, for the purchaser took possession in the middle of the extra month [of the leap year].
If the final day of the twelfth month arrives and [the seller] cannot find the purchaser to redeem his field from him,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And if that day passes, he will not be able to redeem it.</i> he may deposit his money in the court, break down the door, and enter his home.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is an ordinance established by Hillel the Elder to protect the rights of the seller (<i>Arachin</i> 9:4). The rationale is that since the purchaser has no choice whether to accept the money or not, it is sufficient for the money to be deposited in the court for him (<i>Arachin</i> 32a).</i> Whenever the purchaser comes, he may take his money.
When a person consecrates a house in a walled city and another person redeems it from the Temple treasury, when a year passes from the time that it was redeemed from the Temple treasury without it being redeemed by its [original] owner, it becomes established as the property of the one who redeemed it [from the Temple treasury].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">We are not concerned with the date on which it was consecrated. Instead, it is the date from which it was redeemed from the Temple treasury which concerns us, for that is when it was sold and it is its sale that brings about a change in ownership.</i> For the Temple treasury does not become the permanent owner, the purchaser does, as [implied by Leviticus 25:30]: "the one who purchases it for his generations."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for the sake of his descendants and the Temple treasury does not have descendants (<i>Arachin</i> 32b).</i>
When a person sells a house in a walled city and the Jubilee arrives within the first year after the sale, the house does not revert to its owner in the Jubilee.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The statement (Leviticus 25:30 : "It shall not return in the Jubilee" applies both before the house becomes the permanent property of the purchaser and afterwards.</i> Instead, it remains in the possession of the purchaser until the seller decides to redeem it throughout the year after its sale or it becomes established as the property [of the purchaser] after that year is completed.
When a person sells a home in a settlement or in a city that is not surrounded by a wall in the appropriate manner,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Again, what is significant is not the present state of the city, but its state at the time of Joshua's conquest, as stated in Halachah 15.</i> he may redeem it according to the advantages that apply with regard to both the redemption of an [ancestral] field and the redemption of a home in a walled city.<br>What is implied? If he desires to redeem [the home] immediately, he may,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since the sale involves a house, the seller has this advantage over the seller of a field.</i> as is the law with regard to a home [in a walled city]. If the twelve months pass and he does not redeem it, he may redeem it until the Jubilee, as is the law regarding a field.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For Leviticus 25:31 states that they will be considered as a field.</i> When he redeems it, he makes a reckoning with the purchaser and subtracts the value of the benefit he received.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 33a [quoted by the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 9:7)] explains that since the above verse specifies that these homes can be redeemed and that they are returned in the Jubilee, we derive the concept that their redemption involves a reduction of the cost of the field.</i> If the Jubilee arrives without having redeemed it, the house returns [to the owner] without payment, as is the law with regard to fields.
Any [residential property] within a city's wall, e.g., gardens, bathhouses, and dovecotes, is considered as a house,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it can be redeemed only within a year and does not return in the Jubilee.</i> for [<i>ibid.</i>] states: "that are in the city." Fields that are located in the city may be redeemed according to the rules applying to fields outside the city, as [implied the phrase (<i>ibid.</i>)]: "And the house that will be within the city will be established." [This includes] houses and anything resembling houses, not fields.
When a house is not four cubits by four cubits, it does not become the permanent property of the purchaser like the houses in a walled city.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For a house is not considered a house unless it is at least four cubits by four cubits (<i>Sukkah</i> 3b). This concept applies in several different contacts, for example, the requirement to place a <i>mezuzah</i> (<i>Hilchot Mezuzah</i> 6:1) or to construct a guardrail (<i>Hilchot Rotzeach</i> 11:1).</i> A house does not become the permanent property of a purchaser in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:14, Jerusalem was never divided among the tribes. For that reason, a person can never permanently acquire property there. Instead, houses there are bound by the laws that apply to houses in settlements (see Rashi. <i>Arachin</i> 32b; <i>Bava Kama</i> 82b).</i> A house that is built in the wall is not considered as a home in a walled city.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 9:5 records a difference of opinion on this issue between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon. Both of them base their opinion on the exegesis of the Biblical story of Rachab's home in Joshua, ch. 2.</i>
When the roofs of a city serve as its walls<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megillah</i> 5b explains that this refers to a situation where the city is not surrounded by a wall, but instead, its houses are built next to each other, so that it appears that it is surrounded by a wall (Rav Yosef Corcus).</i> or the sea serves as it wall,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For example, as in the instance of Tiberias which was surrounded by a wall on one side and the sea on the other.</i>it is not considered as a city surrounded by a wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, they are governed by the laws applying to homes in a settlement.</i>
A city is not referred to as a walled city unless it has three or more courtyards and in each of the courtyards, it has two or more houses.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, it is not large enough to be called a city.</i> [Moreover,] it must have been surrounded by a wall first and then the courtyards were built in its midst. If, however, a place was settled and afterwards, surrounded [by a wall] or it did not have [at least] three courtyards with [at least] two houses [each], it is not considered as a walled city. Instead, its houses are like the houses of a settlement.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Interestingly, the Talmud also mentions these laws with regard to reading a <i>Megilah</i> in a walled city (<i>Megilah</i> 3b), but the Rambam does not quote them there, only here.</i>
We rely only on a wall that surrounded [a city] at the time of the conquest of the land.<br>What is implied? When a city was not surrounded by a wall at the time when Joshua conquered the land even though it is surrounded now, [the houses in it] are considered as the houses of a settlement. [Conversely,] if a city was surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 9:6 gives as examples: Ancient Yodefat, Gamla, Chadid, Gedod, and Ono.</i> even though it is not surrounded at present, it is considered as walled.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that once a city's walls are destroyed, the city loses its unique status. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that the Rambam is referring to the situation in the First Temple era. If a city had a wall at the time of Joshua's conquest, but that wall was torn down, the status of the city did not change throughout that era. See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arichin</i> 9:6).</i><br>When the Jews were exiled after the first destruction [of the Temple], the sanctity of the walled cities from Joshua's time were nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">And the sanctity of the land was nullified, as the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:15, <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:26..</i> When Ezra ascended at the time of the second entry into the land, all of the walled cities of that time became consecrated. For the entry [into the land] at the time of Ezra, i.e., the second entry, was comparable to the entry at the time of Joshua. Just as [after] their entry at the time of Joshua, they counted Sabbatical years and Jubilees, sanctified the homes in walled cities and were obligated in the tithes, so too, [after] their entry in the time of Ezra, they counted Sabbatical years and Jubilees, sanctified the homes in walled cities and were obligated in the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in those sources, in contrast to the sanctification in the time of Joshua, the sanctification of the land by Ezra was only Rabbinic in origin. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam states that the cities that were walled at the time of Ezra were given the status of walled cities. From the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, it appears that the cities that were given the status of walled cities by the people who returned with Ezra were cities that were considered walled cities in the era of the First Temple.</i>
Similarly, in the Ultimate Future, upon the third entry to the land,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when the Jews return to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> led by <i>Mashiach</i>.</i> we will begin to count the Sabbatical and Jubilee years and sanctify the homes in walled cities, and every place that will be conquered will be obligated in [the separation of] tithes, as [Deuteronomy 30:5]: "And God your Lord will bring you to the land that your ancestors possessed as a heritage and you shall possess." [The verse] equates [the Jews' ultimate] possession with that of their ancestors. Just as when your ancestors took possession of the land as a heritage, they practiced the renewal of all these observances, when you take possession of the land, you should practice the renewal of all these observances.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and others question the Rambam's statements, because he accepts the principal (see <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.</i>) that through Ezra's consecration, the land was consecrated until and including the ultimate future. <i>Kina'at Eliyahu</i> suggests a resolution based on the fact that the sanctification of the land by Ezra was only Rabbinic in origin, while the sanctification by <i>Mashiach</i> will have the power of Scriptural Law. Hence, a new sanctification will be necessary.</i>

Chapter 13

Although the tribe of Levi does not have an ancestral portion within <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e, all the other tribes were given portions of the land as an ancestral heritage. Levi was not given such a portion. Indeed, as stated in Halachah 10, a Scriptural prohibition is involved in them receiving such a portion.</i> the Jewish people were commanded to give them cities<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 183) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 408) include the commandment to provide cities for the Levites among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to dwell in<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">One might infer from this wording (borrowed from Numbers 35:2  that the cities do not belong to the Levites per se. They are merely given the right "to dwell" in them. Nevertheless, from the Rambam's rulings: a) (<i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 11:17) that the Levites must recite the declaration after separating the second tithes for they possess these cities; and<br>b) his ruling (<i>Hilchot Rotzeach</i> 8:10) that an accidental killer who flees to the cities of the Levites must pay rent, we can conclude that they are the owners of these cities in a way similar to the other tribes' ownership of their ancestral heritages (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXV, p. 93).</i> and [additional] residential property.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 9:8) which defines the term <i>migrash</i> as "the settlements close to the city which we refer to as outlying districts where shepherds and workers dwell."</i> The cities include the six cities of refuge and 42 additional cities.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 35:2, 6 states: "Command the children of Israel that they shall give to the Levites... cities for dwelling and residential property.... The cities that you shall give the Levites are the six cities of refuge... and in addition, you shall give 42 cities." The names of these 42 cities are mentioned in Joshua, ch. 21.<br>Based on <i>Hilchot Rotzeach, loc. cit., Likkutei Sichot</i>, differentiates between the Levites ownership of the 42 cities and their ownership of the cities of refuge. For in <i>Hilchot Rotzeach</i>, the Rambam states that an accidental killer who flees to the cities of refuge need not pay rent. With regard to these cities, the Levites are mere caretakers.</i> When cities of refuge will be added in the era of <i>Mashiach</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In Deuteronomy, ch. 19, the Torah commands the Jewish people to set aside three cities of refuge in the portion of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> west of the Jordan and three in TransJordan. It then continues (Deuteronomy 19:8-9) states: 'When God will expand your borders... you must add three more cities.' In <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 11:2, the Rambam refers to this command as a proof of <i>Mashiach's</i> ultimate coming, for "This command was never fulfilled. [Surely,] God did not give this command in vain." Ultimately, there will come an era, the era of <i>Mashiach</i>, when this command will be fulfilled and these cities will be separated. See also <i>Hilchot Rotzeach</i> 8:2-4, 9-10.</i> all will be given to the Levites.
[The obligation to give] the non-developed land around the cities is explicitly mentioned in the Torah as being [a radius of] three thousand cubits in every direction from the wall of the city outward, for [Numbers 35:4-5] states: "From the wall of the city onward, 1000 cubits on all sides" and continues: "You shall measure from the outside of the city 2000 cubits on the eastern side." The first thousand are left as [additional] residential property and the 2000 that are measured outside this residential property are for fields and vineyards.
Every city is given a cemetery outside these boundaries, for they do not bury their dead within their cities, as [implied by <i>ibid.</i>:3]: "The residential area will be for their animals, their property, and all their vital needs." [This land] was given "for their vital needs" and not for burial.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">And additional land must be given for that purpose. Nevertheless, a person who accidentally killed a colleague and who fled to one of these cities should be buried within these cities, as stated in <i>Hilchot Rotzeach</i> 7:3 (Radbaz).</i>
In the cities of the Levites, the city itself should not be transformed into an outlying residential area and the outlying residential area should not made part of the city. This outlying residential area should not be converted to fields, nor should the fields be converted into such a residential area, as [Leviticus 25:34] states: "The fields of the residential area of their cities should not be sold."
According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Arachin</i> 33b.</i> it was taught that the phrase "should not be sold" should be interpreted as "should not be changed."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 228) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 342) include this commandment with the above interpretation among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> Instead, all of the three, field, a residential area, and a city should remain in its original circumstances forever.<br>Similarly, in the other cities of <i>[Eretz] Yisrael</i>, the outlying residential area should not be converted to fields, nor should the fields be converted into such a residential area. The city itself should not be transformed into an outlying residential area and the outlying residential area should not be made part of the city.
A person should not destroy his home to make it into a garden, nor should he plant a garden in his ruin, lest one destroy <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the intent should be to make the land a residential center.</i>
The priests and the Levites who sold fields from the fields of their cities or homes from the homes in their walled cities do not redeem their property according to the procedures [explained above].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 11 which describes the redemption of a field that is an ancestral heritage. See Chapter 12 which describes the redemption of a home in a walled city.</i> Instead, they may sell their fields even directly before the Jubilee and redeem them immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the fields of an ancestral heritage that must be sold for at least two years, as stated in Chapter 11, Halachah 9.<br>In the listing of the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot, the Rambam mentions giving the Levites the potential to redeem the land as part of the prohibition against selling the lands of the Levite. This enables that mitzvah to be understood in two contexts:<br>a) the halachic understanding expressed in halachot 4-5, that the status of the properties should not change,<br>b) the simple understanding of the verse, that the Levites' property should never be permanently sold, but rather there should always be the opportunity to redeem it.</i> If they consecrated a field, they may redeem it from the possession of the Temple treasury after the Jubilee.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When, by contrast, an ordinary person who does not redeem his field after consecrating it, it becomes the property of the Temple treasury in the Jubilee (<i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 4:20-21).</i> They may redeem houses in a walled city whenever they desire, even after several years,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">While an ordinary person can redeem such houses only during the first year (Chapter 12, Halachah 7).</i> as [Leviticus 25:32] states: "The Levites will have eternal rights of redemption."
When an Israelite inherits property from his maternal grandfather who was a Levi,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his maternal grandfather had no sons and his property was therefore inherited by his daughter. The daughter was married to an Israelite and so her children are Israelites. Whether she dies in her father's lifetime or afterwards, his property is inherited by her son, an Israelite.</i> although he is not a Levite, he may redeem [the property] as if he was a Levite. Since these cities or fields belong to the Levities, they may be redeemed forever. For this law is dependent on [the characteristics of] these places, not of the owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And when the Israelite inherited his grandfather's property, he inherited all the rights his grandfather possessed.</i>
When a Levite inherits the property of his maternal grandfather who is an Israelite,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a Levite married an Israelite women who gave birth to a son. That son is a Levite. If his maternal grandfather (an Israelite) dies without sons, his mother inherits his property and when she dies, the son who is a Levite inherits it from her.</i> he does not have the redemption rights of a Levite, only those of an Israelite, for the verse "The Levites will have eternal rights of redemption" applies only in the cities of the Levites.
The entire tribe of Levi are commanded against receiving an inheritance in the land of Canaan,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 169) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 504) include this commandment with the above interpretation among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> and they were commanded against receiving a share in the spoil when the cities are conquered,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 170) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 505) include this commandment with the above interpretation among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, elaborates in explanation why the two charges are counted as separate commandments.</i> as [Deuteronomy 10:9] states: "The priest and the Levites - the entire tribe of Levi - should not have a portion and an inheritance among Israel." "A portion" [refers to a portion] of the spoil; "an inheritance" refers to [a portion of] the land. And [Numbers 18:20]: "You<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is addressed to Aaron as the leader of the entire tribe of Levi.</i> shall not receive a heritage in their land, nor will you have a portion among them," i.e., in the spoil. If a Levite or a priest takes a portion of the spoil, he is punished by lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that it would appear that this applies only when one has destroyed the portion that he took. If, however, it can be returned, it should be returned and he is not subjected to lashes. (This is also the view of <i>Sefer HaChinuch, loc. cit.</i>) Nevertheless, the Radbaz concludes that it is possible to say that one may not compensate for this prohibition by making financial restitution and hence, lashes are required in all circumstances.</i> If he takes an inheritance in <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>, it should be taken from his possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For land can never be misappropriated from its rightful owners. Hence, his taking it is of no consequence and therefore, he is not punished (Radbaz).</i>
It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase introduces a ruling that the Rambam arrived at through deduction, without any explicit, prior Rabbinic source.</i> that the above applies only with regard to the land for which a covenant was established with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, their descendants inherited it and it was divided among them. If, however, other lands will be conquered by a king of Israel, the priests and the Levites have the same rights as the entire Jewish people.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statement, stating that if so, the priests and the Levites would not have the rights to <i>terumah</i> and the tithes in these lands, for (see the following halachah and <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 105), these presents were given to the priests instead of an ancestral portion. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> strengthens the Ra'avad's argument, noting that were it not for a special Divine commandment, the priests and the Levites would not have been given a portion of the spoil gained in the war against Midian. Nevertheless, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> as well as the Radbaz explain that the spoils from the war against Midian can be used as a source to teach that similar concepts apply with regard to other wars.</i>
Why did the Levites not receive a portion in the inheritance of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and in the spoils of war like their brethren? Because they were set aside to serve God and minister unto Him and to instruct people at large in His just paths and righteous judgments, as [Deuteronomy 33:10] states:<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In Moses' blessing to the tribe of Levi.</i> "They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Torah to Israel." Therefore they were set apart from the ways of the world. They do not wage war like the remainder of the Jewish people, nor do they receive an inheritance, nor do they acquire for themselves through their physical power. Instead, they are God's legion, as [<i>ibid.</i>:11]: states: "God has blessed His legion" and He provides for them, as [Numbers 18:20] states: "I am your portion and your inheritance."<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam cites the first portion of this verse in Halachah 10 as proof that the Levites are not entitled to a portion of the spoil nor an ancestral heritage in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. In this halachah, he explains the rationale for that exclusion. The Levites are set aside from material involvement so that they can devote themselves to the spiritual. God, however, promises that this exchange will not cause them any loss, for He will provide for their material needs.</i>
Not only the tribe of Levi, but any one of the inhabitants of the world<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This wording could also imply gentiles.</i> whose spirit generously motivates him and he understands with his wisdom to set himself aside and stand before God to serve Him and minister to Him and to know God, proceeding justly as God made him, removing from his neck the yoke of the many reckonings which people seek, he is sanctified as holy of holies.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This expression is used by I Chronicles 23:12 to refer to the holiness of Aaron, the High Priest. The Rambam is implying that every individual can reach a similar level of holiness.</i> God will be His portion and heritage forever and will provide what is sufficient for him in this world like He provides for the priests and the Levites.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Rambam is explaining that the motif that applies with regard to the priests and the Levites can be extended and in truth applies with regard to any person who is willing to devote his life to God's service.</i> And thus David declared [Psalms 16:5]: "God is the lot of my portion; You are my cup, You support my lot."<br>Blessed be the Merciful One who provides assistance.
