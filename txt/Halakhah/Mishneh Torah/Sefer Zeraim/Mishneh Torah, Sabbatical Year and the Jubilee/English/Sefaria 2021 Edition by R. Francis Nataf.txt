Mishneh Torah, Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee



Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment to refrain from working the land and caring for trees in the seventh year, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:2), "and the land shall rest a Shabbat for the Lord"; and it is stated (Exodus 34:21), "from plowing and from harvesting shall you rest." Anyone who performs one of the forbidden labors of working the land or caring for trees in this year has negated a positive commandment and transgressed a negative commandment – as it is stated (Leviticus 25:4), "you shall not sow your field, nor shall you prune your vineyard."
One only receives lashes according to the Torah for either sowing, pruning, harvesting or reaping. And it is the same whether it is [done to] a vineyard or other trees.
And pruning is included in sowing; and reaping is included in harvesting. So why did Scripture mention them in particular? To tell you that one is liable specifically for these two subcategories; and that for the other subcategories of working the land – along with the other main categories – one does not receive lashes. Rather we strike him with lashes for rebellion.  
How is this? We give rabbinic lashes for rebellion to one who digs or plows for the sake of (preparing) the ground, or removes stones or fertilizes and that which is similar to these of the other types of work on the land; and likewise to one who bends [a branch into the ground] or grafts or plants and that which is similar to these of the other types of care for trees. 
We may not plant trees in the seventh year – [not] even a fruitless tree. And one may not cut off growths or remove dry leaves and branches. And he may not sprinkle dust on its top, nor fumigate below it so that the worms will die. And he may not smear the saplings with something that has filth in it, so that the birds do not eat it when it is soft. And he may not smear the young fruit, nor puncture holes into them. And he may not wrap the saplings, nor may he snip them. And he may not cut large branches off the tree. And likewise, all the rest of caring for the tree. And if he did one of all of these in the seventh year, we give him lashes for rebellion.
And one may not kindle a fire in [a place of] thick reeds, because that is working the land. And we may only train a cow to plow in sand. And we may not check seeds in a pot full of dirt, but may rather only check them in a pot full of dung. And we may soak seeds in the seventh year in order to sow them at the culmination of the seventh year; and we may preserve the aloe plant that is at the top of the roof, but we may not water it. 
We may apply red dye [to a tree]; and encumber it with stones and hoe below vines. And [regarding] hoeing lightly under olive trees – if it is to make the tree flourish, it is forbidden; but if it is to seal the fissures, it is permissible. 
We may water an irrigated field in the seventh year – and that is a field for sowing that is very thirsty. And likewise [regarding] a field of trees: If they are at a distance from one another such that there would be ten in a <i>beit seah</i>, we may pull the water from one tree to the next, but they may not water the whole field. But if they were closer to each other than ten to a <i>beit seah</i>, we may water the whole field for their sake. And likewise , may we sprinkle water onto the dirt of a field for trees, for the sake of the trees – such that they will not be lost.
We may construct circular ditches around the  grapevines and we may make a new water channel. And we may fill fissures [in the ground with] water.
And why did they permit all these [acts]? Because if he does not water [the fields at all], the land will turn into a salt marsh and every tree in it will die. And since the prohibition of these things and that which is similar to them is [rabbinic], they did not decree [to forbid] these [things]. As, according to the Torah, only those two main categories and their two subcategories are forbidden – as we explained. 
From when the extorters increased and the kings of the idolaters required that Israel [support] camps for their soldiers, [the Rabbis] permitted sowing on the seventh year – [but] only that which the servants of the king require for themselves. And likewise, one who is forced to work on the seventh year for free – such as with the conscription of the king and that which is similar to it – is allowed to do [so].
[Regarding] one who plants in the seventh year – whether it was inadvertent or volitional – [that plant] is uprooted. For Israel is suspect about the seventh year. [For] if you say, It can be kept, when inadvertent" – the volitional one will say, "I was inadvertent."
[Regarding] one who plows his field or breaks up [its surface] or fertilizes it on the seventh year, in order that it be proper for sowing at the culmination of the seventh year – we penalize him, such that he may not sow it at the culmination of the seventh year. And it cannot be rented out from him in order that it be sowed. Rather it shall be fallow in front of him. But if he dies, his son may sow it. 
[Regarding] one who removes thorns from his land in the seventh year in order to prepare it for the culmination of the seventh year; or one who removed the stones from it – [the Rabbis] did not penalize him, even though he is not allowed [to do it]. So it is permissible for him to sow it at the culmination of the seventh year. 
One who buries a turnip or radishes and that which is similar to them (to preserve them) in the seventh year – if some of their leaves are uncovered, he need not be concerned [about having transgressed]. But if not, it is forbidden. One who buries leeks and that which is similar to them may not do so with less than four <i>kav</i>, to the height of a handbreadth. He [must then place] a handbreadth of dirt on top of them and bury them in a place that people trample, so that they will not grow. It is permissible to dampen rice, but not to trim [it].
At first, [the Rabbis] would say [that] a person may gather sticks, stones and twigs from his field. And that is when he takes that which is large, in order that he not intend to clean the land. But he may gather [this] from his fellow's field, whether it is small or large. [However,] from when transgressors increased – those who would intend to clean [the land], and say, "We are [only] taking that which is large" –  they forbade a person from [gathering] in his field. Rather [he may only do so] in his fellow's field. And that is when he does not gather as a favor – such that he should not say, "I have done so much good for you; as behold I have cleaned  your field!"
If his animal was standing in the field, he may gather and bring [the sticks and twigs in the field] in front of it (to eat), since his animal shows [his purpose in this]. And likewise, if his stove was there, he can gather everything and light [it], since his stove shows [his purpose in this].
[Regarding] one who chops down a tree or two, it is permissible to uproot them. [If, however,] he chops down three or more – one next to the other – he may not uproot them. For behold, he is improving the land. Rather he should chop them above the ground and leave their roots in the ground. To what do these words apply? [When he is on] his own [property]. But in his fellow's field, it is permissible to uproot [them].
One who chops [branches] from an olive tree to take it as wood may not cover the place of the cut with dirt, since it is work [on the tree]. Rather he should cover it with stones or straw.
One who trims grape vines or cuts reeds may cut in its [usual] manner – with the axe, sickle or saw, or with whatever he pleases.
We may not chop off [branches of] a virgin sycamore tree on the seventh year in the way that we [do so] in other years; since their being chopped off is work on the tree. For, with this chopping, it will grow and increase. So if he needs its wood, he should chop it off, not in the way of its [usual] work.
How should he chop it? [He should only chop branches that are] even to the ground or higher than ten handbreadths. We may tie up a tree that had split, in the seventh year – not that it should heal, but that [the split] not increase.

Chapter 2

A person may not remove the manure from his courtyard and place it into his field, on the seventh year, because it appears like he is fertilizing his field so that it be proper for sowing. But if he removed it and stood it into a dungpile, it is permissible. And he should not make a dungpile in his field until the passing of the time (season) in which we fertilize with it for work on the land. And that is from when the "sweet matter," gets knotty. One may not make a dungpile that is less than one hundred and fifty <i>seah</i> of manure, in order that it will be noticeable that it is a dungpile. If he [already] had a little bit, he may add continuously. And one may not make more than three dungpiles in any <i>beit seah</i>.
So one who wants to make all of his field into areas of three dungpiles – [each group] within a [different] <i>beit seah</i> – he may do [so]. And one who wants to make his manure into [one large] store – he [too] may do so.
If one stood up the manure on a boulder, or dug three handbreadths into the ground and piled the manure [into it] or built a platform of three [handbreadths] and stood the manure on top of it – he does not require a requisite measure. Even if he made many dunghills within a <i>beit seah</i> – whether big or small – it is permissible. For the thing is surely recognizable – that they are not for working the land, but rather for storage of the manure. 
It is permissible for a person to remove the manure from his sheep pen and to put it into his field, in the way of all those who collect manure [from their animals]. And someone who makes an enclosure [for the animals] in his field in the seventh year should not make it more than two <i>beit seah</i>; and [then] put his sheep into it. And once they have fertilized all of the enclosure, he leaves [only] one side of the enclosure barriers. Then he makes a different enclosure alongside of [the first one (on the other side of the remaining barrier)]. It comes out that he fertilizes four <i>beit seah</i> of his field [in this way].
If his whole field was [only] four <i>beit seah</i>, he leaves over some of it [and does not allow his animals there], because of improper appearance. [This is] so that all will know that the sheep made droppings in it and it had been enclosed; and they will not say, "This one fertilized all of his field in the seventh year."
A person may not start a quarry in his field in the seventh year, lest they say, "He intended to improve his field, to remove the bedrock from it." But if he began before the seventh year and broke apart twenty-seven stones from [bedrock] that is three by three ells with a height of three ells – each stone being one ell by one with a height of an ell, or larger – it is surely permissible to remove as much as he wants from it during the seventh year. 
[In the case of] a stone fence with a height of ten or more handbreadths, and one wants to take all its stones: If there are ten or more stones, each one of which is a load for two [people] or larger, he may surely take them. For the onlooker will know that he is taking them for the sake of the stones [themselves]. If [the fence] was less than ten, or there were less than ten stones or the stones were smaller than a load for two – he may [only] take them until he [reaches the stones that are] a handbreadth from the ground.
To what do these words apply? When he intended to improve his field (or) he began to take [them] in the seventh year. But if he did not intend to improve his field or began before the seventh year, he may take everything that he wants – in the seventh year – from any part [of it] and raze [it] to the ground. And likewise, if he is taking [them] from the field of his fellow, he may raze [it] to the ground – even if he is contracted.
[In the case of] stones that are fit to be moved by a plow or that were covered and became revealed: If there were two, each of which was a load for two [people], it is surely permissible to take them. If they were smaller than this, he may not take them.
One who removes stones from his field, in the seventh year, because he needs the stones – he may take the upper ones, but he must leave the ones touching the ground. And likewise if he had a pile of pebbles or a pile of stones on his field, he may take the upper ones but must leave the ones touching the ground. However if there is bedrock or straw under them, he may take them all.
A person may not fill a ravine with earth, nor may he fix it with earth, because he is improving the land. But he may make a partition in front of the ravine. And [regarding] any stone which he can stick out his hand and pick it up, while standing at the edge of the ravine – it may surely be taken.
It is permissible to bring shouldering stones – and they are those carried, two or three on the shoulder – from any place, whether from the field of his fellow or from his [own] field. And likewise a contractor [of the field] may bring [them] – and even (small) [large] stones –  from anywhere, whether from a field he contracted or from a field he did not contract. 
[In a case of] a gap (in a wall) that has been blocked with dirt: If it does not make the public stumble, it is forbidden to build it up. But if it did make the public stumble or it was not blocked with dirt, but rather open to the public domain, it is permissible to build it up.
It is forbidden to build a fence between one's field and the field of his fellow in the seventh year; but he may build a fence between himself and the public domain. And it is permissible to submerge it up to the bedrock, and to remove the dirt and gather it into his field in the way of all those who submerge manure. And likewise if he dug a pit, a ditch or a cave in the seventh year – he gathers the dirt into his field in the way of all those that dig [for such purposes].

Chapter 3

Work on the land in the sixth year is forbidden thirty days preceding the seventh year – [as] a law of Moshe from Sinai – since [such work] improves it for the seventh year. And that is at the time that the Temple exists that it was forbidden by the oral tradition. And the Sages ordained that, at the time of the Temple, a field of trees (an orchard) only be plowed until <i>Atzeret</i> (Shavuot) on the eve of the seventh year; and a [grain] field until Pesach. But at the time when there is no Temple, work on the land is permitted until Rosh Hashanah, like the law of the Torah.
And what is a field of trees? Any three trees in a <i>beit seah</i>. Whether they are non-fruit trees or fruit trees – and even if they belong to three [different] people – we look at them as if they were fig trees: If they would [each] be fit to produce a cake of dried figs of sixty <i>maneh</i>, we plow the whole <i>beit seah</i> on their behalf. And that is when there is a distance between each and every one of them in order for [a pair of] oxen to pass [between them] with their [plowing] implements.
If there were less than three [trees] to a <i>beit seah</i>; or there were three, but [only] one was fit to produce sixty <i>maneh</i> or more and the two [others] were not fit to produce [it]; or [even] if two were fit to produce one hundred <i>maneh</i> [each], but one does not produce [sixty] – we only plow what they need. And that is the area needed by the picker and his basket in addition to him.  
If there were three to nine, and they were fit to produce sixty <i>maneh</i> [together], we may plow the whole <i>beit seah</i> on their behalf – even though there are some of them that are not fit to produce [it].
If there were ten or more trees in a <i>beit seah</i>, we may plow the whole <i>beit seah</i> on their behalf – whether they produce [the requisite amount] or whether they do not produce [it]. [In a case of] ten saplings spread out in a <i>beit seah</i> – we may plow the whole <i>beit seah</i> on their behalf up until Rosh Hashanah. And this is a law of Moshe from Sinai.
[But] if they were arranged in a row (or) formed into a crown, we may only plow for them, for the needs of each and every one. And squash plants combine with saplings to [make] ten.
And which is a sapling? It is a small tree, so long as we call it, sapling.
[In a case of] a tree which had been cut down, and it then produced fresh shoots: If it was cut from one handbreadth or above, it is surely like a tree; from a handbreadth and below, it is surely like a sapling. 
And all of these things are at the time of the Temple, as we have said. But at this time, we are permitted with regard to working the land until Rosh Hashanah. [However] even at the time of the Temple, it is permissible to remove stones, to fertilize the fields and to hoe cucumber fields, squash fields and irrigated fields until Rosh Hashanah. And we may fertilize, remove [dry leaves and branches], sprinkle with dust, fumigate, trim, prune, remove [excess parts] and smear filth on the saplings; and we may wrap or snip them; and we may make shelters for them and water them. And we may smear the young fruit and puncture holes into them. All of these types of work are permissible on the eve of the seventh year until Rosh Hashanah of the seventh year – even during the time of the Temple.
We may not smear nor puncture holes into young fruit of the eve of the seventh year going into the seventh year; and of the seventh year going into the conclusion of the seventh year. And during the time of the Temple, we may not build steps at the entrance of the ravines on the eve of the seventh year, from the time that the rains cease, because it improves [the land] for the seventh year.
Even at this time, we only plant trees, graft or bend [a branch into the ground] on the eve of the seventh year in time for the sapling to take root and last thirty days before Rosh Hashanah of the seventh year, after taking root – and a undifferentiated [case of] taking root is two weeks. And this thing is always forbidden because of improper appearance, lest the onlooker say, "They were planted in the seventh year." It comes out that you will say that one who plants, grafts or bends [a branch into the ground] on the eve of the seventh year: [It it was] forty-four days before Rosh Hashanah, it is preserved; less than that, it is torn out. But if one did not tear it out, the fruits are permissible. And if he dies before he tears [them] out, we obligate the inheritor to tear [them] out. 

Chapter 4

Anything that the land produces on the seventh year is all permissible for eating from the Torah, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:6), "And the sabbatical produce of the land shall be for you for food": Whether it is from a seed that fell into it before the seventh year or whether it was from the roots that had been cut earlier but grew back and produced [food] – and both of those are called, "aftergrowth – or whether it is from the herbs and vegetables that grew on their own and do not have seeds. And even a field which had been improved upon in the seventh year and brought out its produce – that [too] is permissible for eating. And that which it is stated (Leviticus 25:5), "and the grapes of your untended vines you shall not reap," is that one not reap [them] in the way he reaps every year. And if he reaps in the way of reapers – for example, he reaps all of his field and places it on the threshing floor and has the oxen thresh it; or he reaped for work on the land, as we explained – he receives lashes. Rather he must reap a little bit at a time, pound [it] and eat. 
And it is from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic) that all of the aftergrowth is forbidden for eating. And why did they make a decree about it? That one not go and plant one's grain, legumes and garden seeds in his field secretly; and when they grow, he eat from them and say, "They are aftergrowth." Hence they prohibited all of the aftergrowth that grows in the seventh year.
Behold you have learned that, of the produce of the seventh year, we only eat the produce of the trees, and herbs – such as  rue, wild yarbaz, and everything which is similar to them – since most people do not plant them. But vegetables, the way of which is for most people to plant them in their gardens; and types of grain and legumes – everything that grows from them is forbidden by the words of [the Rabbis]. And one who picks them is given lashes for rebellion.
Aftergrowth which comes up in an uncultivated field, a plowed field, a field containing a vineyard, or a field sowed [with fenugreek] is permissible for eating. And why did they not make a decree about them? Since a person does not sow these places: An uncultivated field, [since] no one turns into such a field; a plowed field, [since the owner] wants its improvement (and sowing will interfere with that); a field containing a vineyard, [since the owner] does not [want to] forbid his vineyard; and a field sowed [with fenugreek, since] the aftergrowth destroys [the fenugreek]. Likewise is straw of the seventh year permissible in every place; and they did not decree about it.
Aftergrowth of the seventh year that went over into the culmination of the seventh year is forbidden for eating. And we may not pull it out by hand, but one rather plows [them over] in his usual way. And an animal may graze [it] according to its usual way.
And until when is the aftergrowth of the seventh  year forbidden at the culmination of the seventh year? From Rosh Hashanah until Chanukah. But from Chanukah and onwards, it is permissible. And [in a case of] one who plants the aftergrowth of the seventh year after the seventh year – what grows is permissible.
[In the case of] onions that went over from the seventh year into the culmination of the seventh year: If [new onions of the eighth year have grown to a size] similar to them, they are permitted; but, if not, they are forbidden. And likewise with the other produce – we do not buy them at the culmination of the seventh year unless it is from when the produce of the culmination of the seventh year has produced that which is similar to them. If the first [of the new crop in the eighth year] has produced, the slower [produce] is permitted. But it is permissible to buy vegetables (strictly defined, such that it does not include onions or the other produce mentioned above) immediately at the culmination of the seventh year.
From when is it permissible for a person to buy <i>luf</i> at the culmination of the seventh year? From when the new [crop] has become plentiful.
The new year for sabbatical years and Jubilees is on the First of Tishrei (Rosh Hashanah). Produce of the sixth year that has entered the seventh year – if it was grain or legumes or fruit of the trees that reached the time of tithing before the new year, they are surely permissible. And even though he gathers it in the seventh year, it is surely like produce of the sixth year in every way. But if it only came to the time of tithing after the new year, it is surely like produce of the seventh year.
Grain and legumes are forbidden for eating because of [the prohibition of] the aftergrowth. But we may eat the fruit of the trees [according to the provisions corresponding to] the holiness of the seventh year. 
Regarding rice, millet, poppy, sesame and Egyptian beans which one sowed for seed, we go according to the completion of the fruit: If their fruits became complete before the new year, they are surely permissible in the seventh year – like [other] produce of the sixth year. But if they became complete after the new year – even if they took root before the new year – they are surely forbidden because of [the prohibition of] the aftergrowth.
A vegetable [is determined according] to the time of its picking. And a citron (etrog) – even if it was [as small] as a fava bean before the new year, and became [as big] as a loaf [of bread] on the seventh year – is obligated in tithes like the produce of the sixth year. But even if it was like a loaf in the sixth year – since it was picked in the seventh year, it is surely like the produce of the seventh year. So the tithes are separated like the produce of the sixth year, to be stringent.
And likewise, produce of the seventh year that went over into the culmination of the seventh year: With grain, legumes and [fruit] trees, we go according to the season of [their] tithing; rice, millet, poppy, sesame and Egyptian beans which one sowed for seed, according to the completion of the fruit; and a vegetable, according to its picking.
[In the case of] Egyptian beans, which one sowed for seed in the sixth year and its fruit became complete before Rosh Hashanah of the seventh year – both its vegetable and its seed are permissible on the seventh year. But if he sowed it as a vegetable and the seventh year came in, both its vegetable and its seed are forbidden – like [the other] aftergrowth of the seventh year. And likewise is it forbidden, if he sowed it for seed and as a vegetable. 
[In the case that] he transgressed and sowed it and it went over into the eighth year: If he sowed it for seed, both its seed and its vegetable are forbidden at the culmination of the seventh year – like other aftergrowth. But if he sowed it as a vegetable – since it was picked in the eighth year, both its vegetable and its seed are permissible. If he sowed it for seed and as a vegetable, its seed is forbidden because of [the prohibition of] the aftergrowth, but its vegetable is permissible. 
Since white figs become complete after three years – if they come to the season of tithing  before Rosh Hashanah of the eighth year, they must surely be eaten in the second year of the seven–year cycle with the status of seventh year [produce].
Seedless onions and Egyptian beans from which one withheld water for thirty days prior to the new year; and [those grown in] an irrigated field from which three time periods [of water] have been withheld before the new year – they are surely like [other] produce of the sixth year. [But if] less than that, they are like [other] aftergrowth of the seventh year. 
[In the case of] gourds which one kept [in the ground] for seed: If they had hardened before the new year and had become unfit for human consumption, it is permissible to keep them in the seventh year – for they are from the produce of the sixth year. But, if not, they are forbidden – like [other] aftergrowth of the seventh year. And likewise all vegetables that hardened before the new year – it is permissible to keep them in the seventh year. But if they were soft, it is forbidden to keep them because of [the prohibition of] the aftergrowth. And we do not obligate one to uproot <i>luf</i>, but he may rather leave it in the ground as it is; and if it grew at the culmination of the seventh year, it is permissible. And we do not obligate one to uproot <i>kundas</i> (a type of bitter vegetable), but rather to cut its leaves; and if it grew at the culmination of the seventh year, it is permissible. 
[In the case of] leeks from the eve of the seventh year and summer onions from the eve of the seventh year and madder that has become complete before the seventh year: It is permissible to remove them on the seventh year with metal axes; and there is no [problem with this] on account of working the land.
[In the case of] onions which had rain fell upon them and sprouted: So long as their leaves are green, they are permissible; but if they darken, they are surely as if they were planted in the ground – so those leaves are forbidden because of [the prohibition of] the aftergrowth. And whether [they are] like this or like that, the onions themselves remain permissible. 
An onion that one removed [from the ground] in the seventh year and planted in the eighth year, and its [new] growth grew more than than the original item – its growth transformed the original item and it is all made permissible. Since just like the prohibition of the seventh year is by way of [growth in] the ground, so too is [the prohibition's removal] by way of [growth in] the ground. 
One should not gather the fruit produced by trees in the seventh year in the way that he gathers them every year – as it is stated (Leviticus 25:5), "and the grapes of your untended vines you shall not reap." And if he reaps [in order] to do work on the tree or he reaps in the [usual] way of reapers, he is lashed.
And how does he do [the reaping in a permissible way]? We do not place the figs from the seventh year on a surface for drying figs, but we may dry them in an [open place]. One may not crush grapes in a wine-press, but he may crush them in a kneading-trough. And he may not prepare olives in an olive-press, but he may pound them in a very small olive press and then grind them in an olive press and place them into a small olive press. And likewise with the other things – he should alter anything that he can.  
It is a positive commandment to release everything that comes out of the ground in the seventh year, as it is stated (Exodus 23:11), "And the seventh year, release it and forsake it." And anyone who locks up his vineyard or fences in his field in the seventh year has negated a positive commandment. And likewise if he harvests all his fruits and brings them inside his house. Rather he must render everything ownerless; and the hand of everyone is equal in every place – as it is stated (Exodus 23:11), "and the destitute of your people will eat it." So [the owner] may bring a little into his house, in the way we bring [in] ownerless property: Five pitchers of oil [and] fifteen pitchers of wine. But if he brought more than this, it is [still] permissible.
The seventh year is only practiced in the Land of Israel exclusively, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:2), "When you come to the land, etc." And it is practiced both in the presence of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple. 
All [the territory] that [the Jews] that came up from Babylonia held – up to Keziv – is forbidden for working; and all aftergrowth that grows there is forbidden for eating. And all that they did not hold, but rather only those that came up from Egypt [held] – which is from Keziv to the River and to Amanah – even though it is forbidden for working on the seventh year, the aftergrowth that grows there is permissible for eating. And from the River and from Amanah and onwards, it is permissible [even] for work in the seventh year.   
Even though the seventh year is not practiced in Syria according to the Torah, they made a decree about it, that it should be forbidden for working on the seventh year, just like the Land of Israel – so that they not leave the Land of Israel and go and become stuck there. However, even though Ammon, Moav, Egypt and Shinnar (Babylonia) are rabbinically obligated regarding tithes, the seventh year is not practiced in them.
The seventh year is practiced in Transjordan rabbinically. But the aftergrowth of Syria and Transjordan is permitted for eating – these lands are not to be more stringent than [the portions of] the Land of Israel that [only] those that came up from Egypt held.
[In the case of] an idolater (gentile) who bought land in the Land of Israel and sowed it in the seventh year – its produce is permissible. For they only decreed about the aftergrowth on account of sinners; whereas idolaters are not commanded about the seventh year, such that we should make a decree about them.
[In the case of] cities of the Land of Israel adjacent to the border – we place a responsible guard over them, so that the idolaters will not fan out and plunder the fruit of the seventh year. 

Chapter 5

The produce of the seventh year is given over for eating, drinking, smearing, lighting lights and dyeing. From the oral tradition, they learned: (Leviticus 25:7) "It shall be" - even for lighting lights and to dye with it.  
How is eating and drinking? [It is only permissible] to eat that which it is its way to be eaten, and to drink that which it is its way to be drunk - like the law of the priestly tithe and the second tithe.
And one should not alter produce from their characteristic state, in the [same] way that one does not alter the priestly tithe and the second tithe: He should not eat cooked, something the way of which it is to be eaten raw; and he should not eat raw, something the way of which it is to be eaten cooked. Hence, we do not boil animal foods and we do not exert ourselves to eat food that has gone bad or bread that has molded - in the way that one does not [do so] with the priestly tithe and the second tithe. 
And we do not cook a vegetable of the seventh year in the oil of priestly tithes, so that it will not come to disqualification (and require that we destroy the vegetable as well). But if one cooked a little and ate it immediately, it is permissible. For [then] he surely did not leave it over, such that it become disqualified.
We do not feed produce that is designated as food for humans to [domesticated] beasts, [wild] animals or birds. [But] if an animal walked on its own below a fig tree and ate [from it], we do not obligate [its owner] to bring it back - as it is stated (Leviticus 25:7), "And for your beasts and for the animals that are in your land shall all of its produce be for food."
How is smearing? To smear that which it is its way to be smeared: One should not smear wine or vinegar, but he may smear oil. However he should not make the oil fragrant. And he should not smear in the bathhouse, but he should rather smear outside and [then] go in.
We do not seal an oven or stove with the oil of the seventh year; nor do we smear a shoe or sandal with it; nor do we smear it with impure hands. [But] if it fell on his skin, he can rub it in with impure hands. And one should not smear his foot inside his shoe. However, he may smear his foot and wear a shoe; or smear his body and roll on top of a leather mat.
How is lighting lights? That one lights the light with the oil of the seventh year itself. If he sold it and bought other oil with it or he exchanged oils, they are both forbidden for lighting - as we may not light from the value (purchasing power) of the seventh year [produce]. And he should not put the oil into an open fire but rather light it in a lamp.
How is dyeing? We may dye for people with things the way of which it is to use as dye, even though they are [also] food for humans. However we may not dye for animals from produce of the seventh year - even if it is animal food. For the holiness of the seventh year does not attach itself to dyes for animals.
The holiness of the seventh year attaches itself to types of detergents - such as soapwort and aloe - and we may launder with them, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:6), "And the sabbatical produce of the land shall be for you" - for all of your needs. But we do not launder with produce of the seventh year, and we do not make a poultice (<i>melugma</i>) with it. For it is stated, "And the sabbatical produce of the land shall be for you for food" - "for food," but not for a poultice, not for sprinkling, not to cause vomiting, not for soaking and not for laundering. 
They said an important principle with regard to the seventh year: [Regarding] anything that is designated as food for humans - such as wheat, figs, grapes and that which is similar to it - we may not make a poultice with it or a bandage or that which is similar to it, even for a person. For it is stated (Leviticus 25:6), "for you for food" - all that is designated as food for you, shall be for eating and not for healing. And [regarding] anything that is not designated as food for humans - such as soft thorns and brambles - we may use as a poultice for a person, but not for an animal. And anything that is not designated for this or for that - such as savory, hyssop, or thyme - is surely dependent on one's thought: If he thought [to use it] for wood, it is surely like wood; for food, it is like produce; for food for people and food for animals, we impose upon it the stringencies of food for humans - that we may not make a poultice with it - and the stringencies of animal food - that we do not boil it.
It is permissible to sell food for humans or animal food and to [use the money received to] buy food for humans. But we may not sell animal food to buy other animal food with [the proceeds]; and it is not necessary to say that we may not sell food for humans to buy animal food with [the proceeds]. But if he did buy it or he exchanged food for humans for animal food, it is surely [treated] like animal food, such that we may not make a poultice for a person with it.
We may not transport produce of the seventh year from the Land of Israel to outside the Land, even to Syria. And we do not feed it to idolaters (gentiles), nor to a wage-worker. But if he was a wage-worker for seven years, or a wage-worker for a year or a wage-worker for a month; or if he contracted his food for him - he is surely like the members of his household and he feeds him. And we feed a lodger produce of the seventh year. 
A court may not set an allowance for a woman [from her husband's] seventh-year produce, since this is like paying one's debt with produce of the seventh year. However she may sustain herself from [the produce] of her husband.  
We may not gather produce of the seventh year when it is completely unripe, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:12), "you may eat of its produce" - it may not be eaten until it becomes produce. But one may eat a little of them in the field when they are not fully ripe - in the way that he eats in the other years of the seven-year cycle. However he should not bring them into his house until they reach the time of tithing. 
And from when is it permissible to eat of the fruit of the trees in the seventh year? One may eat unripe figs in the field with his bread from when they assume a rosy appearance; and likewise all that is similar to them. One may eat unripe grapes in the field from when they produce liquid; and likewise all that is similar to it. One may split olives and eat [them] in the field from when they produce a quarter <i>log</i> of oil for a <i>seah</i> of olives. If they produced half a <i>log</i>, he may crush [them] and smear [with the oil] in the field. If they have reached a third [of their potential], it is permissible to bring them into his home - for they have surely reached the time of tithing.
It is permissible to cut down trees for the wood on the seventh year before they have fruit. But from when they begin to produce fruit, one may not cut it down. As he surely destroys the food; and it is stated (Leviticus 25:6), "for you for food" - but not for destruction. But if it produced fruit and they reached the time of tithing, it is permissible to cut them down [again]. For it has surely produced its fruit and the law of the seventh year has been negated from it.
And from when do we not cut down trees in the seventh year? The carob trees, from when they form chains [of carobs]; the vines, from when they form [grape] kernels; the olive trees, from when they blossom; and all the other trees  from when they produce unripe fruit. And we may not cut down early date berries on the seventh year, because that is destruction of the fruit. But if it is not their way to produce dates but [just] to blossom, it is permissible to cut down those early date berries.
We may not burn straw or chaff on the seventh year, because it is fit for animal food. But we may use oil residue and grape skins of the seventh year as fuel. 
[In the case of] a public bath that has been heated with straw or chaff of the seventh year, it is permissible to bathe in it for pay. But if he is an important man, it is forbidden - lest they heat it with other things for his sake in order that its fragrance diffuses, and it would come out that they destroy produce of the seventh year. 
The holiness of the seventh year does not attach itself to shells and pits that are permissible for non-priests with regards to the priestly tithe - and they are surely like wood - unless they are fit for dyeing. But the holiness of the seventh year does attach itself to palm hearts.
[In the case of] one who bundles spices of the seventh year and places [the bundle] in a cooked food. If their taste is negated, they are surely permitted for anything. But if taste remains in them, they [retain] the holiness of the seventh year. 
We may not place straw or chaff of the seventh year into a pillow or into clay. But if one did [do so], it is as if it was destroyed. An oven that they heated with straw or chaff of the seventh year must be cooled down (so that no benefit be made from it). And we may benefit from and burn straw or chaff of the seventh year from when the second rains fall. 

Chapter 6

One does not do business with the produce of the seventh year. But if one wants to sell a little produce from the seventh year, he may sell [it]. And that money is surely like the produce of the seventh year; so he must buy food with it and eat [it according to the provisions corresponding to] the holiness of the seventh year. And that produce that was sold surely still has the holiness it had [previously].
One may not buy vegetables of the field and sell [them]; nor should he dye with seventh year food shells – because this is doing business with produce of the seventh year. If he bought vegetables to eat and [some] remained, it is permissible for him to sell the remainder; but the money [has the holiness of] the seventh year. And likewise, if he picked vegetables for himself – and his son or the son of his daughter bought some of them and [then] sold them, this is surely permissible, but the money [has the holiness of] the seventh year.
When we sell produce of the seventh year, we do not sell by measure, by weight or by number – so that it not be as if one were doing business with the produce of the seventh year. Rather he should sell the little that he is selling in a lump, to make known that it is ownerless. And [then] he takes the money to buy other food with it.
And he may bind things – the way of which it is to bind them to [take home] – to sell in lumps at the marketplace, in the same way that we bind [them] to bring home. [But] not in the way that we bind [them] for the marketplace – in order that he not be like one who sells with precision. And one may not bind things the way of which it is only to bind for the marketplace. 
Produce from outside of the Land that has come into the Land may not be sold by measure, by weight or by number, but rather by lump – like the produce of the Land. But if it was recognizable that it was from outside of the Land, it is permissible.
The stringency of seventh year [produce] over sanctified foods is that [if] one redeems sanctified foods, the sanctified foods go out to being mundane and the money is taken in its place. But the seventh year is not like this. Rather [in the case of] one who sells the produce of the seventh year, the money is taken and it becomes like the produce of the seventh year; but the produce itself is not deconsecrated  to become like the produce of other years. For it is stated (Leviticus 25:7), "it shall be" – it shall be in its [state of] being forever. But because it is called "sanctified" (Leviticus 25:12), [the holiness also] latches itself on to the money. It comes out that you will say that the last item [exchanged] is latched upon by [the holiness of] the seventh year, but the produce itself is [still holy] as it was.
How is this? If he bought meat with the produce of the seventh year or with its money (proceeds), the meat becomes like that produce and he must eat it according to [the provisions corresponding to] the seventh year. So he must eliminate it at the time of the elimination of the produce of the seventh year. If he bought fish with that meat or with its money (proceeds), the meat goes out [from its status] and the fish is latched upon. If he bought oil with that fish or with its money (proceeds), the fish goes out and the oil is latched upon. If he bought honey with that oil or with its money (proceeds), the oil goes out and the honey is latched upon. But he [still] needs to eliminate the original produce – with the honey at the end [of the chain] – in the way that we eliminate produce of the seventh year. And we may not make a poultice from, nor destroy, either of them – like other produce of the seventh year.
The produce of the seventh year is only deconsecrated (transfers its holiness) by means of purchase. To what do these words apply? To the first produce. But with the secondary produce (and onwards), it is deconsecrated both by means of purchase and by means of redemption.
And when one deconsecrates produce that has been bought secondarily, we may not deconsecrate it against a live beast, animal or bird – lest he leave them over and flocks grow from them. And it is not necessary to say [that this is the case with the produce of] the seventh year itself. But we may deconsecrate it against slaughtered ones.
We do not pay off debts with the money (proceeds) of seventh year produce. Nor do we use it for gifts from groomsmen, nor to pay back favors. And we do not allocate charity from it in the synagogue. But we may send [foods] from it as acts of kindness; however one must make it known. And likewise do we not buy slaves, land and impure animals with it. But if one bought [one of the these things], he must eat [the value] corresponding to them – in the way that he would do [this] with the second tithe. And we may not [purchase] bird-offerings for a <i>zav</i> or a <i>zavah</i> with them – nor sacrifices for women who have given birth, sin-offerings or guilt offerings. But if one did [so], he must eat corresponding to them. And we do not smear vessels and skins with the oil of the seventh year. But if he did smear, he must eat corresponding to it.
They may not give from it to a bath attendant, a barber, a sailor, or to other craftsmen. But one may give it to someone who fetches water from the well to have him drink water. And it is permissible to give it, or its money value, as a free gift to craftsmen.
[In the case of] one who says to a worker, "Here is this <i>issar</i> (a coin) for you; so go and buy me a vegetable today" – his wage is permissible and it is not like money of seventh year [produce]. Rather he may spend it for anything he wants. And they did not penalize the worker, that his wage should be like money of the seventh year. But if he said to him, "Pick me a vegetable today for this [coin]," it is surely like money of the seventh year. So he may only spend it for eating and drinking, like [the proceeds of] seventh year produce.
[In the case of] donkey drivers who do work that is forbidden in the seventh year with produce of the seventh year – such as transporting more than is enough – their wage is surely like money of the seventh year. And this thing is a penalty for them. So why did they penalize the wage of donkey drivers, but they did not penalize the wage of a worker? Since his wage is little, they did not penalize him with what is needed for his life.
[In the case of] one who buys a loaf [of bread] for a <i>fundion</i> (a larger coin) from a baker; and at the time that he bought it, he said to him, "When I pick vegetables of the field, I will bring you [some] for it" – it is surely permissible. And that loaf is like the produce of the seventh year. But if he bought it from him without differentiation, he may not pay with seventh year money [proceeds] – as we may not pay a debt with it.
We may eat produce of the seventh year with favor and without favor? How is, with favor? That he give him produce of the seventh year, as [the other] did him a favor and gave to him; or that he brings him into his garden to eat, as one who did him a favor. And [in the case] of one to whom they gave produce of the seventh year as a gift or to whom it came as an inheritance – he may surely eat it in the way he eats produce that he gathered from the field himself. 

Chapter 7

The produce of the seventh year can only be eaten as long as that species is still found in the field, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:7) "And for your beasts and for the animals that are in your land shall all of its produce be for food." The whole time the animals are eating from this species in the field, you may eat what is at home. When it has finished for the animals in the field, one is obligated to eliminate that species in his home. And that is the elimination (<i>biur</i>) of the produce of the seventh year.
How is this? Behold, if one has dried figs from the seventh year within his home, he may eat from them so long as figs are on the trees in the field. When the figs have finished in the field, it is forbidden to eat from those at home. Rather he must eliminate them.
If one has much produce, he may give out food for three meals to each and every one [he finds]. But after the elimination, it is forbidden to eat – whether for the poor or for the rich. So if he did not find eaters at the time of the elimination, he must burn [it] in a fire, throw [it] out into the Dead Sea or destroy it with anything that destroys.
If one has raisins of the seventh year, but the grapes in the fields, from the roofs and the orchards that were ownerless have [all] finished – even though there are still grapes on the vines in the courtyards, he may not eat from the raisins on account of the grapes in the courtyard, because they are not [accessible] to animals. If, however, there are very hard grapes that do not become complete until the end of the year, he may surely eat from the raisins on their account. And likewise with all that is similar to this.
[In the case of] a tree that produces fruit two times a year, and he had some of its fruit from the first time – he may surely eat them so long as fruit of the second time are found in the field, since there are surely from that species in the field. But we do not eat on account of Fall fruit (that come out at the end of the seventh year), since they are similar to fruit of the next year.
[In the case that] one pickles three [types of produce] in one barrel: When each one's species has finished in the field, he must eliminate its species from the barrel. But if he began with [this process], it is as if it is all eliminated. And in the same way as one eliminates food for humans, so too must one eliminate animal food from the home. So if that species had finished in the field, he may not feed it to animals.
And in the same way as we eliminate produce, so too must we eliminate the money (proceeds). How is this? Behold, when he sold pomegranates of the seventh year; behold, he eats with their money (proceeds). But if the pomegranates have finished in the field and money that he sold them for [still] remains with him, he is obligated to eliminate it.
How is this? He may purchase food with it and give out three meals to each and every one [he finds]; or – if he did not find eaters – throw [it] out into the Dead Sea.
There are three regions regarding elimination:  All of the region of Yehudah – the mountain[s], the plain and the valley – is one region. All of Transjordan – the plain of Lod, the mountain[s] of the plain of Lod and from Beit Horon, together with the sea – is [another] region. And all of the Galilee – the upper, the lower, and the borders of Tiveria – is a [third] region. And we eat in each and every one of the three until the last [fruit of a species] in it has finished. 
How is this? If he had produce in the region of Yehudah, he may eat from it so long as that species exists in any of the whole region of Yehudah. And likewise if he had produce in the Galilee; and likewise in Transjordan.
But all of these three regions are considered like one region for carobs, olives and dates. So we eat dates until the last one finishes in Tzoar. And when does it finish? By Purim. And we eat from the olives until Atzeret (Shavuot); from the grapes until Pesach of the [eighth year]; and from the dried figs until Chanukah.
One who brings seventh year produce from a place that they have finished to a place that they have not finished ; or from place that they have not finished to a place that they have finished – is obligated to eliminate it. For we place upon him the stringencies of the place from which he left and the stringencies of the place to which he went. And produce of the Land that left to [go] outside of the Land must be eliminated in its place; and one should not move it from place to place.  
They said an important principle with regard to the seventh year: Anything that is food for humans or animal food, or a species [of plants used for] dyeing, and cannot be preserved in the soil – it and its money (proceeds) have [the holiness] of the seventh year and require elimination, it and its money. For example,  leaves of wild <i>luf</i>, leaves of <i>luf</i>, and endives [among] food for humans. And, for example, thorns and thistles [among] animal food. And, for example, woad and <i>kotzah</i> [among] species [of plants used for] dyeing. But if it can be preserved in the soil – like madder and reseda from the species [of plants used for] dyeing – even though it has [the holiness] of the seventh year and its money (proceeds) have [the holiness] of the seventh year, they do not require elimination, nor [does] their money. For behold it can be preserved in the soil. Instead we may benefit and dye with them until Rosh Hashanah. 
And anything that is not designated as food for humans, animal food, or as a species [of plants used for] dyeing – since it is not for wood (fuel), it and its money (proceeds) have [the holiness] of the seventh year. But it does not require elimination, even though it cannot be preserved in the soil. Rather we may benefit from it or its money until Rosh Hashanah – for example, roots of wild <i>luf</i>, the root of <i>luf</i> and scolopendrium.
Pomegranate peels and blossoms, nut peels and [fruit] pits have [the holiness] of the seventh year and their money (proceeds) have [the holiness] of the seventh year. But they do not require elimination, nor [does] their money. Shoots of hawthorn and carobs – they and their money – have [the holiness] of the seventh year and [require] elimination. The shoots of the terebinth, the pistachio tree and the white thorn – they and their money – have [the holiness] of the seventh year, but they do not [require] elimination. However their leaves [require] elimination. 
Which is the time of elimination? The leaves – at the time they wither and shed from their trees. The leaves of olive trees, the leaves of reeds and the leaves of carob trees do not [require] elimination, since they do not wither and end.
And until when is a person allowed to gather fresh herbs in the seventh year? Until the sweetness dries up and congeals. [And he may gather] dry herbs, until the second rains fall at the culmination of the seventh year.
And until when are poor people permitted to enter the orchards at the culmination of the seventh year to gather produce of the seventh year? Until the second rains fall.
The rose, henna, and the lotus tree – they and their money – have [the holiness] of the seventh year. The <i>ketaf</i> – and that is the sap that comes out of the tree – from the leaves and from the roots do not have [the holiness] of the seventh year. But that which comes out of unripe fruit – it and its money – has [the holiness] of the seventh year.
To what do these words apply? To a fruit tree. But with a fruitless tree, even that which comes out of the leaves and out of the roots is like their fruit. So it and its money have [the holiness] of the seventh year. 
[In the case of] one who infuses a rose of the seventh year in oil of the sixth year – he may take out the rose, and the oil is permissible. [But] if he infused it in oil of the culmination of the seventh year, he is obligated to eliminate the oil – as since the rose is dry, [the oil] has already become liable for elimination.
[In the case of] carobs that he infused in wine of the sixth year or in wine of the culmination of the seventh year, he is obligated to eliminate the wine – as the taste of the seventh year produce is surely in it. This is the principle: Seventh year produce that has been mixed in with other produce: In its own type, [it prohibits the mixture] with the smallest amount; not in its type [it prohibits the mixture] with the giving over of [the] taste. 

Chapter 8

In the same way as it is forbidden to work the land in the seventh year, so too is it forbidden to encourage Jews who work it or to sell them work tools – because it is forbidden to encourage transgressors.
These are the tools that a craftsman is not allowed to sell on the seventh year to one who is suspected of [ignoring the laws of] the seventh year: A plow and all its implements, a yoke, a winnowing fan, and a pick. This is the general rule: It is forbidden to sell to someone suspected, any [tool] the designated work of which is work that is forbidden on the seventh year. But it is permissible to sell to someone suspected, [a tool the work of which] is possible to be forbidden and possible to be permissible.
How is this? He may sell a scythe and a cart with all its implements. For if one harvests a little and he brings a little on a cart, it is surely permissible. But if he reaps in the way of the reapers or brings all of the produce of his field, it is forbidden.
And it is permissible to sell without differentiation to someone who is not suspected in the seventh year – even something the designated work of which is work that is forbidden in the seventh year. As behold, it is possible that he bought it in the seventh year to do work with it after the seventh year. 
A potter may sell five jugs of oil and fifteen jugs of wine. And it is permissible to sell more than this to an idolater (gentile); and he need not concern himself lest [the gentile] sell it to Jews. And he may sell many jugs to Jews outside of the Land, and need not concern himself lest they will bring them to the Land.
And one may sell a plowing cow in the seventh year to someone suspected, as he may surely slaughter it. And one may sell him one's field, as he may surely leave it fallow. But one may not sell him a field of trees, unless he stipulated with him that [the one suspected] has no [stake] in the trees. And one may lend him a <i>seah</i>-measure with which to measure, even though he knows that he has a threshing floor. For he may surely measure with it in his home. One may exchange coins for him, even though he knows that he has workers. But all these [things] are forbidden [in a case in which] it is expressed explicitly [that they will be used for a forbidden purpose].
So too may a woman lend to her neighbor who is suspected of [ignoring the laws of] the seventh year, a sifter, a sieve, a hand-mill, or an oven. But she may not sift or grind with her.
We may only encourage [gentiles] in the seventh year with words. For example, if one saw him plowing or sowing, he may say to him, "Be strong," or "Be successful" or that which is similar to these things. For they are not obligated about the resting of the land. However, one should not assist them manually. But it is permitted to detach honeycombs with them, and to rent newly plowed land from them (to plant the following year) – since they are not obligated, such that we should penalize them (as we do with Jews in this situation).
It is permissible to do [work] upon that which is detached [from the ground] in Syria, but not with that which is connected. How is this? We may thresh and winnow, stamp and make bundles; but we may not harvest or reap, nor detach olives – and likewise anything that is similar to these [acts].
Just like it is forbidden to do business with the produce of the seventh year or to store it, so too is it forbidden to buy [it] from an ignoramus (<i>am haarets</i>). [That is] since we do not give money [from] seventh year produce to an ignoramus – even if it is the smallest amount – lest he not eat [what he buys with it, according to the provisions corresponding to] the holiness of the seventh year. 
[In the case of] one who buys a lulav from an ignoramus in the seventh year – [the seller] should [also] give him an etrog as a present. But if he did not [agree to] give it to him, [the buyer] includes the price of the etrog in the price of the lulav.
To what do these words (of not buying from an ignoramus) apply? When he was selling produce the likes of which are stored – such as figs, pomegranates and that which is similar to them. But if he sold produce, the assumption of which is that they are ownerless – such as rue, goosefoot, purslane, hill coriander and that which is similar to them – it is surely permissible to buy from them a little, like the amount of only three meals. [This is] in order [that there be] enough for the livelihood of the seller.
And anything that is not liable for tithing – such as garlic from Balbeck, onions from Rikpa, Cicilician beans and Egyptians lentils; and likewise garden seeds that are not eaten, such as turnip and radish seeds and that which is similar to them – they may surely be purchased from any person in the seventh year. 
To what do these words apply? To an undifferentiated ignoramus. But [regarding] someone who is suspected of doing business with the produce of the seventh year or of storing produce of the seventh year and selling some of it – we do not buy from him anything that has a relation to the seventh year at all. And we  may not buy flax from him, even combed. But we may purchase spun thread and woven fabric from him.
One who is suspected with regard to the seventh year is not suspected with regard to tithes; and , one who is suspected with regard to tithes is not suspected with regard to the seventh year. For even though this and that are from the Torah (and not merely rabbinic), tithes require bringing [them to] a place, which is not the case with seventh year [produce]. And seventh year [produce] does not have redemption, which is not the case with tithes.
One who is suspected with regard to pure foods is not suspected with regard to tithes, nor with regard to the seventh year. For this impure food that he sold with the [incorrect] assumption of being pure only renders others impure from the words of the Scribes (it is only rabbinic). And one who is suspected with regard to the words of the Sages is not suspected with regard to the words of the Torah.
One who is suspected with regard to something – even though he is not trusted about his own – is trusted about that [thing] of others: There is an assumption that a person will not sin for [the benefit of] others. Hence one who is suspected with regard to a thing may [serve as a] judge or witness about it.
Priests are suspected about [produce of] the seventh year on account of their saying, "Since the priestly tithes are permissible to us – even though they are are forbidden to non-priests with the death penalty – all the more so is the produce of the seventh year [permissible to us]." Hence a <i>seah</i> of priestly tithe that fell into a hundred <i>seah</i> of seventh year produce, may [still] be removed. [But] if it fell into less than a hundred, all of it must rot; and it should not be sold to the priests, like [other such mixtures in which the priestly tithe can no longer be removed] – since they are suspected about the seventh year.
Dyers and animal fatteners may buy bran from any [source]; and they do not need to concern themselves, lest it is from the aftergrowth of the seventh year.
In the seventh year, charity administrators do not need to be exacting in the courtyards of those that eat [forbidden produce of] the seventh year. So if [the latter] gave them bread, it is permissible; and we do not need to concern ourselves with it, lest it is from the aftergrowth of the seventh year. For Jews are not suspected of giving [forbidden seventh year produce], except for money (proceeds of the produce) of the seventh year or eggs bought with money of the seventh year. And it is permissible to borrow produce of the seventh year from poor people; but we must return it [with] produce of the eighth year.

Chapter 9

It is a positive commandment to release a loan in the seventh year, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 15:2), "every creditor shall release his hand." And one who claims a debt that was passed over by the seventh year has transgressed a negative commandment – as it is stated, "he shall not exact it of his neighbor and of his brother."
The release of monies is only practiced according to the Torah when the Jubilee – in which the land is released – is practiced. For behold that the return of the land [in the Jubilee] is without money. And this is a received tradition. The Sages said, "In a time when you release land, you must [also] release money in every place – whether in the Land or outside of the Land. But in a time when there is no release of the land, you need not release the monies of the seventh year, even in the Land."
But it is from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic) that the release of monies is [nevertheless] practiced at this time in every place – even though the Jubilee is not practiced. [This is] so that the law of releasing monies will not be forgotten from Israel.  
The seventh year only releases money at its end. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 15:1-2), "From the end of seven years, shall you make a release. This is the matter of the release"; and there, He says (Deuteronomy 31:1), "From the end of seven years at the time of the sabbatical year, on the holiday of Sukkot." Just as there, it is after seven years; so too is the release of monies after seven years. Hence, if one gave a loan to his fellow in the seventh year itself, he may collect his debt the whole year. But from when the sun sets on the night of Rosh Hashanah at the culmination of the seventh year, the debt is lost.
If one slaughtered a cow and divided it [for later repayment], with the understanding that today is Rosh Hashanah at the culmination of the seventh year, and it came out that today was the the [last day] of the seventh year – the money is lost. As the seventh year surely passed over the debt [on that day].
The seventh year releases a loan. Even a loan in a contract that is liened to properties is surely released. But if he assigned a field to his loan, it is not [released]. And the seventh year releases [ the obligation for] an oath, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 15:2), "he shall not exact" – in any case, not to pay and not to swear.
To what do these words apply? To oaths of judges and all that is similar to them – from things that, if he would admit, the seventh year would release. But oaths of guardians and of partners and oaths which are similar to them – that if he would admit, he would [still need to] pay – he must [still] make the oath after the sabbatical year.
If one borrowed from someone and [the latter] made a claim against him, but [the borrower] denied it – and [then] he confessed after the seventh year passed; or witnesses came and testified against him after the seventh year – the seventh year does not release [the debt].
[In the case of] one who lends to his fellow and designated a time [to repay] in ten years, [it is not released]. Even though he will come to [eventually be in a situation relevant to], "he shall not exact" (Deuteronomy 15:2), he surely cannot exact [it] now. If he stipulated with him that he will not make a claim against him, the seventh year releases [it nevertheless].
[In the case of] one who lends to his fellow and stipulates with him that the seventh year not release [it], it is surely released. For he may not negate the law of the seventh year. If [the borrower] stipulated with [the creditor] that he will not release this debt even in the seventh year, his stipulation holds – for any financial stipulation holds. So it comes out that this one obligated himself about money that the Torah did not obligate him. 
The credit [account] of a store is not released; but if he made it into a loan, it is released. The wage of a wage worker is not released; but if he established it as a loan, it is released.
Penalties of a rapist, of a seducer and of one who put out a bad name [against his wife] are not released. But if they established them as a loan, they are released. And from when is it established as a loan? From the time of standing trial.
[In the case of] one who divorces his wife before the sabbatical year, [the debt promised in] her marriage contract is not released; but if she compromises it [by redeeming part of it] or establishes it as a loan, it is released.
[In the case of one] who borrows against collateral, [the loan is not released]. And that is when the debt is the equivalent of the collateral; but if  it was more, the surplus is released.
[In the case of] one who delivers his contracts to the court and said to them, "Collect this debt for me" – it is not released. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 15:3), "you must release what is due to you from your brother." But [here] the court is making the claim against him. And likewise [in the case that] a court decided a case and wrote, "Person x, you are obligated to give such and such to this one" – it is not released. For this is like it is [already] collected, and it is as if it has come to his hand – and it is not like a loan.
When Hillel the Elder saw that [people] refrained from giving loans to each other and transgressed what is written in the Torah (Deuteronomy 15:9), "Beware lest there be a thing, etc." – he ordained the <i>prozbul</i> in order that the debt not be released, so that they would extend loans to each other. But the <i>prozbul</i> is only effective with regard to the release of monies at this time – as it is from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic). But the <i>prozbul</i> is not effective with regard to the Torah [level] sabbatical year.
Only the greatest sages – like the court of Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Assi – may write a <i>prozbul</i>. For they are worthy of extracting the money of people. But other courts may not write [it].
This is the body of the <i>prozbul:</i> "I entrust to you, judges x and y in place z, that I will collect any debt [due] to me any time I please." And the judges, or witnesses, sign below.
We may only write a <i>prozbul</i> with land [as collateral]. If the borrower does not have land, the lender should give him the smallest amount from within his field – even [space enough for] a stalk of cabbage. If he lent him space for an oven or a stove, we may write a <i>prozbul</i> with it. If he has a field that is liened, a <i>prozbul</i> may be written with it. 
We may write [one] for a man with the property of his wife [as the collateral]; or for orphans with the property of the guardian. If he does not have land, but the guarantor has land – we may write a <i>prozbul</i> with it. If he has a debt against his fellow, and his fellow has land – since it is subject to his lien, they may write a <i>prozbul</i> with it.
If one borrows from five [people], they need a separate <i>prozbul</i> for each [creditor]. But if five [people] borrow from one [person], one <i>prozbul</i> is enough for all of them.
If one first wrote a <i>prozbul</i> and afterwards made a loan, it is not effective. Rather [the seventh year] will release [it], until he writes a <i>prozbul</i> after he makes a loan. It comes out that you will say that any loan that precedes the <i>prozbul</i> is not released, due to this <i>prozbul</i>. But if the <i>prozbul</i> is before the loan, it is released [in spite of] this <i>prozbul</i>.
Hence a pre-dated <i>prozbul</i> is valid, but a post-dated one is disqualified: If he wrote it in Nissan and pre-dated it to Adar, it is valid – for behold, he weakened its power; as he [now] only releases [loans] until Adar. But if he post-dated and wrote it for Iyar, it is disqualified. For he strengthened its power, since he [would now] not release until Iyar, [which is] not in accordance with the law. For its law is that he not release [the loans] until Nissan at the time that he entrusts the things to the court.
One who brings out a contract after the seventh year but does not have a <i>prozbul</i> with it has lost his debt. But if he said, "I had [one] and I lost [it]," he is trusted. For from the time of the Danger and onwards, someone who holds a debt can collect it without a <i>prozbul</i> [document]. And not only that, but when the one who holds a debt brings his contract, or when he comes to make a claim about an oral loan, we say to the defendant, "Pay him." But if the defendant makes a [counter-]claim and says, "Where is his <i>prozbul</i>," we say to the claimant, "Did you have a <i>prozbul</i> and lose it?" If he says, "Yes," he is trusted. But if he admits that he he did not write a <i>prozbul</i>, he loses his debt. However orphans do not need a <i>prozbul</i>.
If he brought out a <i>prozbul</i> and the defendant made a claim and said, "The loan that he is claiming [came] after this <i>prozbul</i>, the [first] claimant is trusted. For if he had said, "I had one and it was lost," he is trusted – even though we do not know the time of the <i>prozbul</i> that was lost.
If the defendant claimed and said, "He has a loan that I owed him [but it was released]"; and the claimant said, "No, rather it was a store credit account that was not released. For behold I did not establish it as a loan" – he is surely trusted. As behold, if he wanted, he could say "It was a loan, but I had a <i>prozbul</i> and it was lost." For once the Sages ordained the <i>prozbul</i>, there is an assumption that 'a person will not leave over something permissible and eat something forbidden.'
[In the case of] Torah scholars who lent to one another and one entrusted his words to the students and said, "I entrust to you, that I will collect any debt [due] to me any time I please" – he does not need to write a <i>prozbul</i>. For they know that the release of monies at this time is only [rabbinic], so it can be overridden with words alone. 
[Regarding] anyone who returns a loan, over which the seventh year has passed – the spirit of the Sages is pleased with him. However the creditor must say to the borrower, "I release the debt, and you have already been exempted from me." If he [then] said to him, "Nevertheless, I want you to accept it," he may accept it from him. For it is stated (Deuteronomy 15:2), "he shall not exact" – and he surely did not exact [it]. But he should not say to him, "I am giving it to you as my obligation." Rather, he should say, "It is mine and I am giving you a present."
If he returned the money but did not say this to him, [the creditor] should circle around it with words, until [the borrower] says, "It is mine and I have given it to you as a present." But if he did not say [this], he should not take [it] from him. Rather [the borrower] should take his money and go. 
One who prevents himself from lending to his fellow before the Sabbatical year – lest the debt that [would be] coming to him is delayed, and it be released – has transgressed a negative commandment, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 15:9), "Beware, etc." And it is a big sin – for behold the Torah prohibited it with two commandments, "Beware lest" – and in every place where it is stated, "Beware," or "lest" or "do not" – it is surely a negative commandment. And the Torah was particular about this commandment and called it, "unrestrained." And behold, Scripture added to warn and command not to refrain; but rather to give, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 15:10), "You must surely give him, and let your heart not hurt when you give him, etc." And the Holy One, blessed be He, promised reward in this world for this commandment, as it is stated, "for because of this thing will He bless you."

Chapter 10

It is a positive commandment to count off seven times seven years and to sanctify the fiftieth year, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:8-10), "You shall count seven weeks of years, etc. And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year." And these two commandments are given over to the Great Court alone.
From when did they begin to count? From after fourteen years from when they entered the Land. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:3), "Six years shall you sow your field and six years shall you prune your vineyard" – [(so it is not operative) until every one will recognize his land. And they spent seven years] in the conquest of the Land and seven years in its division. It comes out that you will say that they began to count in the year 2503 from creation – from Rosh Hashanah following the birth of the first man (Adam), which was the second year of creation. And they made the year [2]510 from the creation – which was the twenty-first year from when they entered the Land – the [first] sabbatical year. And they counted seven sabbatical years and sanctified the fiftieth year, which was the sixty-fourth year from when they entered the Land.
The Israelites counted seventeen Jubilees from the time they entered the Land until they left. And the year in which they left – when the First Temple was destroyed – was an [eighth] year and the thirty-sixth year of a Jubilee [cycle]. As the First Temple stood four hundred and ten years. Once the Temple was destroyed, this counting was aborted. From when it was aborted, the land remained desolate for seventy years. And [then] the Second Temple was built, and it stood four hundred and twenty years. And Ezra came up [from Babylonia] in the seventh year of its being built – and this was the second arrival [to the Land]. So from that year, they began a different count – and they made the thirteenth year from the building of the Second Temple, the seventh year. And they counted seven sabbatical years and sanctified the fiftieth year. Even though there was no Jubilee there during [the period of] the Second Temple, they counted it in order to sanctify the seventh years.
It comes out that you will learn that the year in which the last Temple was destroyed, beginning with Tishrei, which was two months after the destruction – as the count of sabbatical years and Jubilees is from Tishrei – was an [eighth] year, and the fifteenth year of the ninth Jubilee. According to this calculation, the present year – the year 1107 [from] the destruction, which is the year 1487 for the dating of contracts, which is 4936 [from] the creation – is a sabbatical year and the twenty-first year from the [current] Jubilee [cycle].
However all of the Geonim say that it is a tradition in their hand – one man from the mouth of another – that they only counted the sabbatical year, and not the Jubilee, during those seventy years between the destruction of the First Temple and the building of the Second Temple. And likewise from when the last one was destroyed, they did not count the fiftieth year but rather only seven [years] each time – from the beginning of the year of the destruction. And likewise does this calculation emerge in the Gemara, Avodah Zarah, as it is a tradition.
And the [time of the] sabbatical year is well-known and famous among the Geonim and the people of the Land of Israel. And all of them only counted from the years of the destruction, going back seven years, each time. And according to this calculation, this year – which is 1107 [from] the destruction – is an [eighth] year. And we rely upon this [calculation]; and we issue rulings regarding tithes, the seventh year and the release of monies according to this calculation. For tradition and practice are great pillars in the issuance of rulings; and it is appropriate to depend upon them.
The Jubilee year does not count in the tally of the years of the seven-year cycle. Rather the forty-ninth year is a sabbatical year, the fiftieth year is a Jubilee and the fifty-first year is the beginning of the six years of the seven-year cycle. And likewise is it with each and every Jubilee [cycle].
The Jubilee years were aborted, from when the tribe of Reuven and the tribe of Gad and part of the tribe of Menashe were exiled. As it states (Leviticus 25:10), "and you shall proclaim freedom in the land for all of its inhabitants" – at the time when all of its inhabitants are upon it. And that is not when one tribe is mixed up with another, but rather when they are all dwelling as befits them. At the time that the Jubilee [is practiced in the Land], it is practiced outside the Land. As it is stated, "it is the Jubilee" – in every place. [It is practiced both] in the presence of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple.
And at the time that the Jubilee is practiced, the law of the Hebrew slave is practiced; and the law of the houses of walled cities; and the law of dedicated fields; and the law of ancestral fields; and we accept a resident stranger; and the seventh year is practiced in the Land and the release of monies [is practiced] everywhere according to the Torah. But at the time that the Jubilee is not practiced, none of these are practiced except for the seventh year in the Land and the release of monies everywhere [rabbinically], as we have explained. 
It is a positive commandment to blow the shofar on the tenth of Tishrei in the Jubilee year. And this commandment was given over to the court first (as it is stated [Leviticus 25:9], "And you [singular] shall sound the shofar"). But each and every individual is [also] obligated to blow [it], as it is stated, "you (plural) shall sound the shofar." And we blow nine [blasts] in the manner that we blow on Rosh Hashanah; and we sound the shofar within all the borders of Israel.
The [laws of the] shofar of the Jubilee and of Rosh Hashanah are the same for everything. And Rosh Hashanah and Jubilee are the same regarding the blows – except that in the Jubilee, we may blow [the shofar] both in a court that is [qualified] to sanctify the new moon and in a court that is not [qualified] to sanctify the new moon; and each and every individual is obligated to blow so long as the court is in session, [even] not in the presence of the court. 
But on Rosh Hashanah that came out on Shabbat, they could only blow in a court that is [qualified] to sanctify the new moon; and each and every individual may only blow in the presence of the court.
Three things are essential regarding the Jubilee: Blowing [the shofar]; sending away the slaves; and the return of fields to their [original] owners – and that is the release of land.
From Rosh Hashanah until Yom Kippur, the slaves [who were to be freed on the occasion of the Jubilee] neither left for their homes, nor were they [still] subjected to their masters. Neither did the fields return to their [original] owners. Rather the slaves would eat and drink and rejoice with their crowns on their heads. Once Yom Kippur arrived, the court would blow the shofar. [Thereupon] the slaves left for their homes and the fields returned to their owners.
The law of the Jubilee regarding the rest of the land and the law of the sabbatical year are the same in every matter: Every matter of working the land that is forbidden in the seventh year is [also] forbidden in the Jubilee year. And everything that is permissible in the seventh year is permissible in the Jubilee year. And the types of work for which we give lashes in the seventh year, we [also] give lashes for on the Jubilee. And the law of the produce of the Jubilee year regarding eating, selling and elimination is like the law of the produce of the seventh year in every matter.
The seventh year exceeds the Jubilee in that the seventh year releases monies, but the Jubilee does not. And the Jubilee year exceeds the seventh year in that it discharges the slaves and releases the land. And that is the law of the selling of fields mentioned in the Torah – and it is a positive commandment, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:24), "redemption shall you give to the land." The Jubilee releases land at its beginning, but the seventh year only releases monies at its end – as we have explained.

Chapter 11

The [parts of the] Land of Israel, which had been apportioned to the tribes cannot be sold in perpetuity – as it is stated (Leviticus 25:23), "The land shall not be sold in perpetuity." If one sold it in perpetuity, both [seller and purchaser] transgress a negative commandment; and their actions are ineffective. Rather the land returns to its [original] owners in the Jubilee [regardless].
[In the case of] one who sells his field for sixty years – it does not revert in the Jubilee. As only something which was sold without specification, or which was sold in perpetuity, returns in the Jubilee.
One may not sell his house or his ancestral field – even though they will return after [a certain] time – unless he has become poor. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:25), "If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his ancestral holding." But he is not allowed to sell it and put the money into his purse or do business with it or to spend it on vessels, slaves or livestock – but rather only to sell it for provisions. However, if he sold them regardless, they are surely sold (the sale is effective).
And we apply the law of a house of a walled city to a house; and the law of an ancestral field to a field. The law of one who sells an ancestral field is to calculate the value according to the years that remain until the Jubilee. So anytime he wants to redeem [it] – he calculates with the buyer, the years [the buyer] consumed [produce from the field]; then he subtracts [that] from the money [originally received by] the seller and returns the remainder to [the buyer].
How is this? Behold [in the case] that ten years remain to the Jubilee and one sells a field to another for one hundred dinar: If the buyer consumed [produce from the field] for three years and the seller wants to redeem [the field], he must give him seventy dinars and [the buyer] must return his field. And likewise, if he consumed [it] for six years, [the seller] must give him forty dinars, and he must return his field to him. If he did not redeem it but left it in the hand of the buyer until the year of the Jubilee, it returns to the [original] owners without [him needing to pay any] money. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:15), "according to the number of produce years, he shall sell it to you."
If he sold it to him and it was full of produce, and he redeemed it after two years, he is not able to say to him, "Give it back to me full of produce, like I sold it to you." Therefore, if he sold it to him full of produce before Rosh Hashanah and he redeemed it after two years – this one surely consumes three crops in two years, so he only calculates with him according to the two years. As it is stated (Leviticus 27:18), "according to the years" – not according to the crops. 
The reeds, the twigs and the fruit of sycamores within it are surely the buyer's, like the rest of its produce. But [in the case of a] tree that was chopped or dried up – it is forbidden to both of them. What should he do? He should sell it and buy land with its [proceeds]; and [then] the buyer will consume the produce [of that land] until the [first] field is redeemed from his hand.
[In the case of] one who buys an ancestral field and plants trees and improves it – when it returns in the Jubilee, we estimate the improvement [from] the trees in it, and the [original] owner of the field gives the buyer the value of the improvement. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:33), "then the house sold shall revert" – the sale returns, but not the improvement.
[In the case of] one who sells his field at the time that the Jubilee is practiced – as we explained – it is not permissible for him to redeem [it after] less than two years. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:15), "according to the number of produce years, he shall sell it to you." And even if the buyer wants [to sell it back], it is [still] forbidden, as it is stated, "According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall purchase from your neighbor" – there is no [possibility to redeem it] less than exactly two years from the date of the sale.
And the buyer must consume two crops in two years; and [only] afterwards may [the original owner] redeem it. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:15), "the number of produce years." Hence if one of the two years was a seventh year or a year of blight or mildew, it is not counted in the tally.
If the buyer left it fallow for a year and consumed [its produce] for a year; or he consumed it for a year and [only] plowed it, but did not sow it, for a year – these are surely counted in the tally. If he sold it in the Jubilee year itself, it is not sold (it is not effective) – and the money goes back to the owners. 
If he sold it one year before the Jubilee, the buyer surely consumes [the produce] of that second year, [in the year] after the Jubilee – as it is stated (Leviticus 25:15), "the number of produce years."
If one sold crevices that are full of water or bedrock that is unsuitable for sowing – he may surely redeem it after less than two years. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:15), "according to the number of produce years" – it is [only] a field that is suitable for produce which may not be redeemed before two years. But if he did not redeem it, it returns to the owners in the Jubilee – even though it is unsuitable for sowing.
If he sold trees, they [too] may not be redeemed [after] less than two years – as they are surely suitable for produce. However, if he did not redeem them, they do not return to their owners. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:18), "and he shall return to his ancestral holding" – and not to [his] trees.
If he sold his field to the first person, the first person sold it to the second person, the second person sold it to the third person – even [if there are] one hundred [purchasers], one after the other – it returns to the first master in the Jubilee year. As it is stated (Leviticus 27:24), "In the year of the Jubilee, the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, to him whose ancestral holding of the land it is."
If he sold it to the first person for one hundred dinars, and the first person sold it to the second person for two hundred, and the [original] owner wants to redeem [it] – he only calculates [the redemption price] with the first person. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:27), "to the man to whom he sold it." [But] if he sold it to the first person for two hundred, and the first sold it to the second for one hundred, he should surely calculate [it] with the latter. And likewise, if he sold it for one hundred and it improved in the possession of the buyer – and it surely became fit to sell for two hundred – he calculates [it] according to what he sold. However, if he sold it for two hundred and it depreciated – and it surely became fit to [only] sell for one hundred – he calculates [it] according to what it is [now]. So we always strengthen the power of the one who sells his ancestral field and weaken the power of the buyer.
[In the case of] one who sells his ancestral field, but he had other fields [as well]; and he [now] sells some of those fields to redeem the field that he sold – we do not listen to him. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:26), "and finds enough to redeem it" – [this is not the case] until he finds something that was not found at the time that he sold [it]. And likewise, if he borrows to redeem [it], we do not listen to him. As it is stated, "and his hand acquired it" – not that he borrow. 
If he found a little [money] and wanted to redeem half of his field – we do not listen to him. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:26), "enough to redeem it" – either he redeems all of it, or he does not redeem [it at all]. But if his relatives want to redeem [it], they may redeem [it] – as it is stated (Leviticus 25:25), "and a close relative of his comes."
[In the case of] one who gives his field as a gift – it surely returns to him in the Jubilee. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:13), "each man shall return to his ancestral holding" – [this comes] to include a gift.  
[In the case of] brothers that divided [an inherited field] – they are like purchasers and they return their parts to each other in the Jubilee. [However] their division is not negated. And likewise, a firstborn, and one who performs levirate marriage upon the wife of his [dead] brother, return – in the Jubilee – the portion they took, and take a portion that corresponds to it [instead].
But one who inherits [the property of] his wife does not return [it] in the Jubilee – even though the inheritance of a husband is rabbinic, they strengthened their words to be like [those] of the Torah. However if he inherits a graveyard, he returns it to the members of [her] family, on account of the [potential] slight to the family. They then give him its value, but subtract the value of his wife's grave – for he is certainly liable for her burial.

Chapter 12

[In the case of] one who sold a house within a city encircled by a wall: He may surely redeem it anytime he wants during the entire twelve months from the day that he sold [it] – even on the day that he sold [it] And if he wants to redeem [it], he must give all of the money that he took, and he may not deduct anything from the purchaser.
But relatives may not redeem it, but rather only the seller, himself – if he has the means. And he may sell some of his [other] properties and redeem [it]. But he may not borrow and redeem; nor may he redeem partially. 
If the buyer died, [the original owner] may redeem [it] from the hand of his son. And likewise if the seller died, his son may redeem during all of the twelve months.
If he sold it to the first person and the first person sold it to the second person, we count [from] the first. Once the first year is completed, the status of the house is finalized in the hand of the second person. As the seller sold the second person all the rights coming to his hand. If [the full] twelve months have arrived, its status is finalized in the hand of the [second] buyer. And likewise if he gave the house as a present and did not redeem it all of the twelve months – its status is surely finalized in the hand of this one to whom he gave the present.
If the year was intercalated (adding a thirteen month), its status is not finalized until its end. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:30), "before a full year has elapsed" – [this is] to include the intercalated month.
If one sold two houses – one in the middle of the first Adar; and one at the beginning of the second Adar: The one that he sold at the beginning of the second Adar – once the first of Adar of the next year arrives, the year has been effectuated. But the year of the one that he sold in the middle of the first Adar is not effectuated until half of the month of Adar in the next year – since the buyer encountered the intercalated month.
If the day [ending] the twelve months arrived and the buyer was not found – to redeem [it] from him – the [original owner] may surely place his money with the court, break the door and enter his house. And when the buyer comes, he can come and collect his money.
[In the case of] one who consecrates a house in a walled city and another [person buys] it from the jurisdiction of consecrated properties: Once a year has been effectuated from when it was [purchased] from the consecrated properties – and the [original] owners did not redeem it – its status is finalized in the hand of the [buyer]. As consecrated jurisdiction does not finalize status, but rather [only] a buyer. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:30), "to the one who bought it throughout his generations."
If one sold a house in a walled city and the Jubilee arrived within the year of the sale – it does not revert in the Jubilee. Rather it remains with the buyer until the seller is willing to redeem [it], the whole year of the sale. Otherwise, its status is finalized when the year is completed.
[In the case of] one who sold a house in a village, or in a city that is not adequately encircled by a wall – it is surely redeemed according to the stronger right found in the law of the sale of fields, or that [found] in the law of houses encircled by a walled [city]. How is this? If he wanted to redeem it immediately, he may redeem [it] according to the law of houses. If twelve months arrived and he did not redeem – this one may surely redeem [it] until the year of the Jubilee, according to the law of the fields. And at the time that he redeems, he must calculate [it] with the one who sells it [back to him] and subtract what he consumed. If the Jubilee arrived, and he did not redeem, the house returns without money, like the law of the fields.
Anything that is within the walls – such as gardens, bathhouses and dovecotes – are surely like the houses, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:30), "within the city." But fields within the city are redeemed according to the laws of fields outside of the city. As it is stated, "the house within the city that is surrounded by a wall shall then remain'' – a house and all that is similar to a house, not the fields. 
The status of a house that does not contain four by four ells is not finalized like the [other] houses of walled cities. The status of a house is not finalized in Jerusalem. And a house that is built into the wall is not [considered to be] like the houses of a walled city.
A city the roofs of which are its wall; or the sea is its wall – is not [considered to be a city] encircled by a wall.
A place is not called a walled city until it has three or more courtyards, each of which having two or more houses; and it was first encircled by a wall, and the courtyards were built afterwards. But a place that was settled and was encircled afterwards, or where there were not three courtyards of two houses, is not a walled city. Rather the houses in it are like the houses of villages.
We only rely upon an encircling wall [that stood] at the time of the conquest of the Land. How is this? A city that was not encircled by a wall at the time Yehoshua conquered the Land – even if it is walled now – is surely like the houses of a village. But a city that was encircled by a wall at the time of Yehoshua – even though it is not walled now – is surely like an encircled one. And once they were exiled during the destruction of the First Temple, the sanctity of the walled cities that existed at the time of Yehoshua was negated. [But] once Ezra came up in the second arrival [to the Land], all the cities encircled by walls at that time were consecrated – because their arrival at the time of Ezra, which was the second arrival, is like their arrival at the time of Yehoshua: Just like [at] their arrival at the time of Yehoshua, they counted sabbatical years and Jubilees, consecrated the walled cities and became liable for tithing; so too [with] their arrival at the time of Ezra, did they count sabbatical years and Jubilees, consecrate the walled cities and become liable for tithing.
So too, in the future, with the third arrival: At the time when they will enter the Land, they will begin counting sabbatical years and Jubilees, they will consecrate the walled cities and every place that they will conquer will become liable for tithing. As it stated (Deuteronomy 30:5), "And the Lord, your God, will bring you to the land that your forefathers inherited and you will inherit it." It compares your inheritance to the inheritance of your forefathers – just like [with] the inheritance of your forefathers, you practice the implementation of all these things [in it]; so too [with] your inheritance, you practice the implementation of all these things in it.

Chapter 13

Although the tribe of Levi was not allotted a share in the Land, the Israelites had already been commanded to give them cities to settle and pasture lands [surrounding them]. Those cities were the six cities of refuge as well as forty-two other cities. And when we will add other cities of refuge in the days of the Messiah, [they] will all be for the Levites.
The pasture lands of the cities have already been explained in the Torah as being three thousand ells from the wall of the city, outwards in each direction. As it is stated (Numbers 35:4), "And the pasture land of the cities, that you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city outwards a thousand ells round about." And later, He says (Numbers 35:5), "And you shall measure from outside the city on the east side two thousand ells, etc.'' The first thousand are pasture land, and the two thousand that we measure outside of the pasture land are for fields and vineyards.
And we give a cemetery to each city outside of this perimeter. For they may not bury their dead in the perimeter of their cities. As it is stated (Numbers 35:3), "and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle, and for their propery, and for all their beasts (<i>chayatam</i>, literally, living beings)" – they were given for life, and not for death. 
We may not make cities, from the cities of the Levites, into pasture land, nor make pasture land into a city; neither pasture land into a field, nor a field into pasture land. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:34), "But the pasture land of their cities may not be sold."
And from the oral tradition, they learned that that which is stated (Leviticus 25:34), "may not be sold" – [means,] may not be changed. Rather – a field and pasture land and a city – each one of these three must be as it is forever. And likewise, with the other cities of Israel.
A person may not destroy his house to make it into a garden, nor plant a garden on the ruins of his house – in order that they do not destroy the Land of Israel
Priests and Levites who sold one of the fields of their cities, or a house from their walled cities – do not redeem in this way (as discussed previously). Rather they may sell their fields even [right before] the Jubilee and redeem them immediately. And if they consecrated a field, they may redeem [it] from the jurisdiction of consecrated properties after the Jubilee. And they may redeem houses of the walled cities anytime they want – even after several years –as it is stated (Leviticus 25:32), "perpetual redemption will there be for the Levites." 
An Israelite who inherited [one of these items] from the father of his mother – a Levite – may redeem [it] like the Levites, even though he is not a Levite. Since the cities or fields are the Levites', they may be redeemed perpetually. For this law is dependent upon these places, not upon the owners.
And a Levite who inherited [one of these items] from the father of his mother – an Israelite – must redeem [it] like an Israelite. As, "perpetual redemption will there be for the Levites"  (Leviticus 25:32), was only stated regarding the cities of the Levites.
The whole tribe of Levi is prohibited – that they not inherit [land] in the Land of Canaan. And they are likewise prohibited – that they not take a part in the spoil at the time that we conquer the cities. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 18:1), "The priests the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel" – "portion," in the spoil; "inheritance," in the land. And likewise, He said (Numbers 18:20), "You will have no inheritance in their land, and you will not have a portion among them" – in the spoil. And a priest or Levite that takes a portion in the spoils is lashed. And if he took an inheritance in the Land, we dislodge him from it. 
It appears to me that these things are only said about the land about which a covenant was made with Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov; and which their descendants inherited and divided [among] themselves. But [regarding] other lands that one of the kings of Israel conquers – the priests and Levites are surely like all of Israel with regard to these lands and their spoil. 
And why did Levi not merit in the inheritance of the Land of Israel or in its booty along with their brothers? Because they were separated out to serve the Lord and minister to Him, to teach His upright ways and His righteous laws to the masses – as it is stated (Deuteronomy 33:10), "They shall teach Your statutes to Yaakov, and Your instruction to Israel." Therefore, they were separated from the ways of the world: They do not wage wars like the rest of Israel; they do not inherit land; and they do not acquire [anything] for themselves by the strength of their body. Rather, they are the Lord's troop – as it is stated (Deuteronomy 33:11), "Bless, O Lord, His troop." And He, blessed be He, acquires [their necessities] for them, as it is stated " (Numbers 18:20), "I am your portion and your share."
And it is not only the tribe of Levi, but rather each and every one of those that come to the world whose spirit moves him and who understands it from his knowledge, to separate himself to stand in front of the Lord, to minister to Him and to serve Him, to know the Lord; and who has walked uprightly as God has made him and has cast off his neck the yoke of the many calculations that people seek out – this one is [also] surely consecrated. He is a holy of holies, and the Lord will be his portion and his inheritance forever and ever. So He will acquire enough for him for what he requires in this world; just as He acquired [such] for the priests, for the Levites. Behold, David, peace be upon him, says, "The Lord is my allotted portion and my cup; You support my lot" (Psalms 16:5).
