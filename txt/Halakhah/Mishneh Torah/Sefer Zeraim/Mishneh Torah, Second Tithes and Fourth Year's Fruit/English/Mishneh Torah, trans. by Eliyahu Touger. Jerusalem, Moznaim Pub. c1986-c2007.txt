Mishneh Torah, Second Tithes and Fourth Year's Fruit



Chapter 1

After<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For preferably, the tithes should be separated in order, as stated in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 3:23.</i> separating the first tithe every year, we separate the second tithe,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 128) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 473) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam states that separating the second tithe and partaking of it in Jerusalem are considered two facets of one mitzvah. The Ramban (in his <i>Hosafot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>) differs and considers partaking of the produce in Jerusalem as another positive mitzvah.</i>as [Deuteronomy 14:22] states: "You shall certainly tithe the produce of your crops."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From the context of the passage, it is obvious that it is referring to another tithe and not to the first tithe which is given to the Levites.</i> In the third and sixth years [of the seven year agricultural cycle], we separate the tithe for the poor instead of the second tithe, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim</i> 6:3; <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 9:3-4.</i>
The first of Tishrei is the beginning of the year with regard to the reckoning of the tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., with regard to the reckoning of the years of the agricultural cycle. These concepts also apply to with regard to the Sabbatical year.</i> for grain, legumes,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is the popular translation of the Hebrew term <i>kitniyot</i>. More particularly, the Hebrew term includes many species that are not legumes.</i> and vegetables. Whenever the term Rosh HaShanah is used [with regard to crops], the intent is the first of Tishrei. The fifteenth of Shvat is the beginning of the year with regard to reckoning the tithes for fruit-trees.<br>What is implied? If grain or legumes<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Vegetables are not mentioned here, because different laws apply to them, as stated in Halachah 4. With regard to <i>kitniyot</i>, note, however, Halachah 8.</i> reach "the phase of tithing"<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one third of their full growth, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 2:5.</i> before Rosh HaShanah of the third year,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they reached this level of growth during the second year of the agricultural cycle. As mentioned above, the second tithe is separated in the second year of the agricultural cycle and the tithe for the poor in the third year.</i> the second tithe should be separated from them even though they became fully developed and were gathered in the third year. If, however, they did not reach "the phase of tithing" until after Rosh HaShanah of the third year,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Even though their initial growth was in the second year.</i> the tithe for the poor should be separated from them. Similarly, if fruit from trees reaches "the phase of tithing" before the fifteenth of Shvat in the third year, it should be tithed according to the previous year and the second tithe should be separated from it even though it became fully developed and was gathered at the end of the third year. Similarly, if it reaches "the phase of tithing" before the fifteenth of Shvat in the fourth year, the tithe for the poor should be separated from it even though it became fully developed and was gathered at the end of the fourth year. If it reaches "the phase of tithing" after the fifteenth of Shvat, it should be tithed like the produce of the coming year.
Even though the fruit of carob trees begin to ripen<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Black spots begin to appear upon them. This is "the phase of tithing" for them, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 2:5.</i> before the fifteenth of Shvat, they should be tithed according to the coming year,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the year when they are harvested.</i> since [the obligation to] tithe them is of Rabbinic origin.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 3:3; <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 1:9.<br>Because the obligation is Rabbinic in origin, they are tithed like vegetables for the obligation to tithe them is also of Rabbinic origin.</i><br>It appears to me that this applies only with regard to the carobs that grow in Tzalmona or other similar species that are not fit to be eaten by most people. [Hence,] the obligation to partake of them is Rabbinic in origin.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to Scriptural Law, there is no obligation to tithe them, because most people do not partake of them. Nevertheless since there are some who do partake of them, our Sages imposed this obligation.</i> It appears to me that other carobs are similar to the rest of the fruit of the trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">And the mitzvah of tithing them is of Scriptural origin.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, maintaining that the carobs of Tzalmona need not be tithed at all and that the obligation to tithe all trees is Rabbinic in origin. The Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> discuss these points at length.</i>
Vegetables should be tithed according to the year when they are harvested.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages (<i>Kiddushin</i> 3a) explain the difference between vegetables and other crops. Unlike other crops for which the water from the rains suffice, vegetables require irrigation.</i> What is implied? If they are harvested on the day of Rosh HaShanah of the third year,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden for a Jew to harvest produce on Rosh HaShanah. We are speaking about produce belonging to a Jew harvested by a gentile.</i> the tithe for the poor should be separated from them even though they reached "the phase of tithing"<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the fruit mentioned in Halachah 4.</i> and [indeed,] fully matured<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the species mentioned in Halachah 8.</i> in the second year. If they were harvested in the fourth year, the second tithe should be separated from them.
Similarly, among fruit from trees, only an esrog is like a vegetable,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For it also requires water from irrigation.</i> [i.e., the laws governing it] whether for tithes or the Sabbatical year are dependent on when it is harvested.<br>What is implied?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Here the Rambam is outlining the laws governing the tithes. The laws governing the Sabbatical year are described in <i>Hilchot Shemitah</i> 4:12.</i> If it was harvested in the third year after the fifteenth of Shvat, the tithe for the poor should be separated from it even though its growth was completed in the second year. Similarly, if it was gathered in the fourth year before the fifteenth of Shvat, the tithe for the poor should be separated from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Because with regard to trees, the fourth year does not start until the fifteenth of Shvat.</i> If it was harvested in the fourth year after the fifteenth of Shvat, the second tithe should be separated from it.
Although the laws governing an esrog depend on when it was reaped, when an esrog that grew<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., reached "the phase of tithing."</i> in the sixth year entered the seventh year, tithes must be separated from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad has a different understanding of Rosh HaShanah 15a-b, the source for the Rambam's ruling and differs on that basis. The Radbaz justifies the Rambam's understanding of that passage and hence his ruling here.</i> [This applies] even though it was only an olive size [at the beginning of the Sabbatical year] and became the size of a loaf of bread [during that year].
We apply both the stringencies that apply to trees and those that apply to vegetables to caper berries.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad notes that the Rambam's ruling appears to contradict <i>Berachot</i> 36a which cites the position quoted by the Rambam in the name of the School of Shammai, while the School of Hillel considers it only as the fruits of a tree. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that capers are considered as the fruits of a tree only with regard to the prohibitions of <i>kilayim</i> and <i>orlah</i>. With regard to the second tithe, by contrast, since there is no loss in observing both stringencies, we follow the stricter ruling.</i> Thus if they grew<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Reaching one third of their growth.</i> from the second year and then they entered into the third year and were harvested before the fifteenth of Shvat, the first tithe should be separated. Afterwards, another tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Which as reflected in the continuation of the halachah will serve as both the second tithe and the tithe for the poor.</i> should be separated. Afterwards, it should be redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As is done with the second tithe.</i> and then given to the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As is done with the tithe for the poor.</i> The proceeds of the redemption [should be used to purchase food that] is eaten according to the laws of the second tithe. Thus it is as if he separated both the second tithe and the tithe for the poor.
With regard to rice, millet,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">According to some opinions, the translation of these two terms should be reversed.</i> poppy seed, and sesame seeds, even if the plants took root before Rosh HaShanah, we are concerned only with the completion of [the maturity of] the fruit and thus the tithes are separated as is the produce of the coming year. Similarly, with regard to Egyptian beans, even though a portion of the crop took root before Rosh HaShanah and a portion afterwards, he should gather the entire crop together<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions that Rambam's ruling, for seemingly, if everything depends on when the produce reaches maturity, it is not necessary to gather all the produce together. Instead, it can be tithed as it is gathered. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam is saying that even if the produce is gathered all together, there is no difficulty. We do not say that the produce is from different years, because everything depends on when the produce reaches maturity. He is not, however, required to gather the produce together.</i> and separate <i>terumah</i> and tithes from the entire crop as one. For everything depends on the produce reaching maturity.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 10 where the Rambam mentions other particulars with regard to Egyptian beans.</i>
When one withheld water from onions that do not produce sprouts<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of the Rambam's words (taken from <i>Shivi'it</i> 2:9) is "eunuch onions." In his Commentary to the Mishnah, he explains that term: "[Generally,] when onions are left in a moist place after being uprooted from the ground, they sprout forth green leaves. There is one type that does not do this. They are called 'eunuch onions,' for they represent a eunuch who does not produce seed."</i> for 30 days or when one withheld water from onions that are irrigated from three periods<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., three periods in which they would ordinarily be watered. For example, if it was customary to water them every week, the laws that follow would apply if one withheld water from tem for three weeks.</i> before Rosh HaShanah, they should be tithed as produce of the previous year.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Even though they are not harvested immediately, their growth has already ceased.</i> If water was withheld from them for less than this - and thus they began to dry up before Rosh HaShanah<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">And thus one might think that their growth has been completed.</i> - they should be tithed like produce of the coming year.
[The following rules apply when] Egyptian beans reached a third of their growth before Rosh HaShanah. If they were sown to produce seed,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to take the beans. See Rav Kappach's version of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Shivi'it</i> 8:2).</i> they should be tithed as produce of the previous year.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even the vegetables. For the vegetables are considered as secondary to the seed (beans). Thus these plants are judged as other legumes in which case, the ruling depends on when the beans reach one third of their growth as stated in Halachah 2.</i> If they were sown to produce vegetables,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the leaves of the plant.</i> they should be tithed as produce of the coming year.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even the seed. For the seed are considered as secondary to the vegetables and vegetables should be tithed according to when they are gathered as stated in Halachah 4.</i> If they were sown to produce seed and vegetables or they were sown to produce seed and then [the owner changed his mind and] thought to use them for vegetables [as well], he should tithe from the seeds for the vegetables and from the vegetables as seeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he separates one tithe for both the vegetables and the seeds, even though there is reason to say that the tithes for each of the two should be separated separately. If he harvested the plants primarily for the seeds, even the vegetables should be tithed as if they were seeds. Conversely, if he harvested the plants primarily as vegetables, even the seeds should be tithed as such.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, questioning why he bases his ruling on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shivi'it</i> 2:8) when - the Ra'avad states - that ruling is problematic. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's view.</i><br>[Different rules apply if the beans] did not reach one third of their growth before Rosh HaShanah. If they were sown to produce seed, they should be tithed as produce of the previous year, but the vegetables that grow should be tithed as they are harvested, provided they are harvested before Rosh HaShanah.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Only in such a situation should the produce be tithed as produce of the second year. The Ra'avad notes that this ruling is problematic: Since the produce has not reached a third of its growth, why is there a need to tithe it? The Radbaz explains that since the person gathers, it is significant for him, and - as far as he is concerned, it has reached its full growth.</i> If they were harvested after Rosh HaShanah, both the vegetables and the seeds should be tithed as produce of the coming year.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For the vegetables, this ruling is obvious and even for the seeds, it applies because the plants did not reach one third of their growth in the previous year.</i><br>If they were sown to produce seed and then [the owner changed his mind and] thought to use them for vegetables [only], the ruling follows his thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">And they should be tithed according to when they are harvested.</i> If they were sown to produce vegetables and then [the owner changed his mind and] thought to use them for seed, the thought to use it as seed has no effect on the ruling unless he withholds water from it for three periods<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">When produce is grown to be used as a vegetable, it is watered before it is harvested. When it is grown for seeds, it is not (Radbaz). The Ra'avad questions the Hebrew term used by the Rambam. The Radbaz states that it means "harvests," because, as explained above, vegetables are usually watered before they are harvested.</i> when [the plants] would be ordinarily be watered,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For his intent to be significant, it has to be reinforced by a deed.</i> and [then,] only when [the plants] reached a third of their growth before Rosh HaShanah.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, it would not be appropriate for them to be tithed as produce of the second year.</i><br>[They are, however, governed by different rules] if they did not reach a third of their growth before Rosh HaShanah even though he withheld water from it for three periods when [the plants] would be ordinarily be watered.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling in this instance as well and again the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justify the Rambam's approach.</i> If he sowed it for the purpose of seed and the entire crop grew into fully grown plants before Rosh HaShanah, the seed is tithed as produce of the previous year<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For they reached a level of growth obligated them to be tithed at that time.</i> and the vegetables are tithed according to when they are harvested.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Since he intended to use the plants for vegetables, we do not say that the vegetables are entirely insignificant.</i> If some of the plants reached their full growth and some did not, to this situation, we apply our Sages' statement:<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 13b.</i> "He should gather the entire crop together." [Thus he should separate tithes from the entire crop as one,] separating tithes from the seed for the vegetables and from the vegetables as seed.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Halachah 8.</i>
When produce from the second year becomes mixed with produce from the third year or produce from the third year becomes mixed with that of the fourth year, we follow the majority.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the entire quantity of produce is tithed according to the laws governing the majority. For we assume that any individual fruit was separated from the majority.</i> If it is half and half, we separate the second tithe from the entire quantity, but not the tithe for the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the tithe for the poor should also be separated, for if it is not separated, the produce is <i>tevel</i>. Rav Yosef Korcus differs, explaining that the same logic could be used with regard to the first clause of the halachah, and that ruling is based on an explicit mishnah (<i>Makshirin</i> 2:11). This explanation provides us with a new definition of <i>tevel</i> - produce from which the separations have been made to the best of man's ability.</i> [The rationale is that] the second tithe is a more severe obligation, because it is sacred,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is considered as sacred property, as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 17.</i> while the tithe for the poor is ordinary produce. Similarly, when there is a doubt whether produce is from the second year or from the third year, the second tithe should be separated from it.
Whenever [produce] is exempt from the first tithe, it is also exempt from the second tithe and the tithe for the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 1:7.</i> Whenever produce is obligated in the first tithe, it is also obligated in these two. All of the individuals who may separate <i>terumah</i> may also separate [these] tithes and those who are not entitled to separate <i>terumah</i> may not separate these tithes. When any of the individuals with regard to whom it is said that [they should not separate <i>terumah</i>,] but if they separate <i>terumah,</i> the separation is effective<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 4:4.</i> separate these tithes, their separation is effective. When any of the individuals with regard to whom it is said that their separation of <i>terumah</i> is ineffective<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>:2.</i> separate these tithes, their separation is ineffective.
When a person separated the first tithe from produce before the obligation to tithe was established,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., through one of the six situations mentioned in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 3:2-3.</i> he may snack from it before separating the second tithe. For [separating] the first [tithe] does not create an obligation to separate the second. If, however, an obligation to tithe was established, it is forbidden to snack from it until he separates the second tithe or the tithe for the poor even though he has already separated the first tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">For the prohibition against partaking of <i>tevel</i> applies until all the tithes have been separated. See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 10:20.</i>
Since the second tithe must be brought [to Jerusalem],<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the following chapter.</i> it should not be brought from the Diaspora,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The Scriptural obligation to separate the second tithe applies only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Furthermore, not only is there no Rabbinic obligation, one should not do so.</i> like the firstborn of animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The firstborn offspring of kosher animals must be offered as a sacrifice. Nevertheless, a firstborn animal in the Diaspora should not be brought to Jerusalem. Indeed, even if it is brought to the Temple, it is not offered as a sacrifice. See <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 1:5.</i> For this reason, our Sages did not obligate the separation of the second tithe in Syria.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the second tithe should not be brought from Syria to Jerusalem, our Sages did not require its separation there. The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling, but it is justified by the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i><br>It appears to me that the second tithe that is separated in Babylonia and in Egypt<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 1:1 which states that our Prophets and Sages ordained that <i>terumah</i> should be separated in these lands.</i> should be redeemed and the proceeds taken to Jerusalem. Similarly, it appears to me that the obligation to separate the second tithe in these places was established only so that there would be an obligation to separate the tithe for the poor, so that the poor of the Jewish people could rely on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there was always a substantial Jewish community in these lands and our Sages wanted to provide the poor with an opportunity to receive their livelihood. This provision was not enacted with regard to Syria, because it was relatively close to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the poor could receive their livelihood from the tithe for the poor separated there (Radbaz). The Ra'avad maintains that the second tithe should also be separated in Syria, but the commentaries follow the Rambam's view.</i>

Chapter 2

The second tithe should be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, it can be used as a beverage or for anointing oneself, for these are also considered as "eating."</i> by its owners within the walls of Jerusalem,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes to the previous chapter, there are authorities who consider partaking of the second tithe as an independent mitzvah. The Rambam, however, considers it as part of the mitzvah of separating the second tithe.</i> as [Deuteronomy 14:23] states: "And you shall eat before God, your Lord, in the place He chooses to cause His name to dwell."<br>It must be observed whether the Temple is standing or it is not standing.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:15 which states that the holiness of Jerusalem is not nullified even though the Temple is destroyed, for the city's holiness derives from the manifestation of God's presence and that holiness can never be nullified.</i> Nevertheless, we partake of it only while the Temple is standing,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When the Temple is not standing, the second tithe must be separated, but we do not partake of it. Instead, we redeem it, as stated in the following halachah.</i> for [the verse states]: "the tithe of your grain, your wine, your oil, and the firstborn of your cattle or your sheep." According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifri</i> to Deuteronomy 14:23.</i> Just as a firstborn is not eaten except while the Temple is standing, so too, the second tithe is not eaten except when the Temple is standing.
It is pious behavior<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A commitment to observance that goes beyond the basic requirements of the law.</i> to redeem the second tithe for its full value<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:1) relates that the Sages of the Talmud would conduct themselves in this manner.</i> in the same manner as it should be redeemed while the Temple is standing.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 1, 18.</i> Our Sages, [however,] ruled that, in the present age, if one desires, he may redeem a <i>maneh's</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">100 silver coins.</i> worth of produce for a <i>p'rutah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A copper coin of minimal value. Since when the Temple is standing, after the fact, such an exchange is acceptable, in the present era, it can be accepted as an initial and preferable measure (Radbaz).</i> as an initial and preferable measure,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For, after all, it is being destroyed (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:149).</i> [for this produce] need not be considered more stringently than consecrated property.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Which can be redeemed in this manner as an initial and preferable measure (<i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 8:10).</i> That <i>p'rutah</i> should be discarded in the Mediterranean Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in a place where it will permanently be lost. If it is being thrown to a river, it must first be ground to dust so that it will never be able to be used [<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:133)].<br>Here the Rambam uses the term <i>yam hagadol</i>, "the Great Sea," which in relation to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> means the Mediterranean Sea. Sometimes, the term <i>yam hamelech</i>, "the Salt Sea, is used. Although in contemporary usage, the term is used in reference to the Dead Sea, the Rambam understands it as referring to the Mediterranean.</i>
Similarly, if one transferred the holiness of a <i>maneh's</i> worth of produce that is the second tithe for a <i>p'rutah's</i> worth of other produce, the holiness is transferred. He should then burn the produce to which he transferred the holiness so that it will not present an obstacle to others, [following the same procedure] as the redemption of <i>neta rivai'i</i> in the present age, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 10:17. Both here and in that source, the Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that a silver coin must be used for these redemptions. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's position. See also Chapter 2, Halachah 4 and notes.</i>
Just as we do not partake of the second tithe in the present era in Jerusalem,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For the Temple is not standing, as stated in Halachah 1. Moreover, we are all ritually impure, and the second tithe may not be eaten in a state of ritual impurity, as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 1.<br>It must be emphasized that with the term Jerusalem, we mean the city limits in the era of the Second Temple. The fact that an area is included in the contemporary metropolis of Jerusalem is not at all significant.</i> so too, we do not redeem it there,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For money.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that if produce from the second tithe becomes ritually impure, it can be redeemed as indicated by Halachah 8. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331) [based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:6)] writes that we can water produce that has been detached so that it will become susceptible to ritual impurity. When it becomes ritually impure, it can be redeemed. These concepts are quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:135).</i> nor transfer its holiness,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For other produce. The rationale is that produce from the second tithe should not be redeemed or exchanged in Jerusalem as stated in Halachah 8.</i> or sell it.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See also Chapter 3, Halachah 17.</i> If [produce which is the second tithe] is brought into Jerusalem in the present era, it should not be removed from there.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 9.</i> Instead, we leave it there until it rots.

[With regard to produce from the second] tithe: One should eat produce that is normally eaten,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:1), the Rambam explains that this phrase implies an exclusion: Something that is normally eaten must be eaten.

Indeed, the ruling is difficult to understand because it runs contrary to the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah that serves as the source for the Jerusalem Talmud.<br>To explain: The Mishnah states: "This is the general principle: Whenever the improvement is obvious, the improvement is judged proportionately. Whenever the improvement is not obvious, the improvement is accredited to the second [tithe]."<br>The Rambam comments: "I.e., the entity that was improved had its weight... and volume increased, it is not [merely] that the effect of the ordinary produce increased the quality of the produce from the second tithe."<br>The Jerusalem Talmud cites the following difference of opinion between Rabbi Yochanan and Reish Lakish in connection with our Mishnah:<br>Rabbi Yochanan says: "Whenever the volume of the produce has increased, the increase is proportionate. Whenever the volume has not increased, the increase is accredited to the second tithe."<br>Reish Lakish says: "Whenever the improvement in flavor is obvious, the increase is proportionate. Whenever the improvement in flavor is not obvious, the increase is accredited to the second tithe."<br>Now the general rule is that whenever there is a difference of opinion between Rabbi Yochanan and Reish Lakish, the halachah follows Rabbi Yochanan. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> understand Rabbi Yochanan to be explaining and amplifying the Mishnah, stating that the improvement must be both in flavor and in size, while Reish Lakish maintains that an improvement in flavor is also sufficient.</i> is obvious, if the volume of the produce is increased, the improvement is judged proportionately. If the volume of the produce is not increased, the improvement is accredited to the second tithe alone. Whenever the improvement is not obvious, the improvement is attributed to the second tithe alone even when the volume is not increased.
What is meant by the phrase "the improvement is judged proportionately"? Honey and spices worth a <i>zuz</i> fall into wine from the second tithe that is worth three [<i>zuz</i>], increasing its volume and improving its flavor.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Thus meeting the two requirements mentioned above.</i> The combined worth is now five <i>zuz</i>, we consider the worth [for the tithes] as four and a fourth.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling and states that four <i>zuz</i> minus a fourth should be considered as the second tithe. Some commentaries suggest that there is a printing error and the Rambam also agrees with this ruling. "According to that version, the reckoning is straightforward. The <i>zuz</i> of increase is divided proportionately according to the ratio of the original value of the substances.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains the present text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and explains as follows: When everything belongs to one person, three and three quarters <i>zuz</i> are considered as the second tithe as the Ra'avad maintains. When, however, the honey and spices belong to two people, the value of the entire mixture is considered as four and a fourth <i>zuz</i>. One and a fourth is given to the owner of the honey. Thus the owner of the wine has three and three fourths <i>zuz</i> worth which he must eat in accordance with the laws of the second tithe. Note the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:1) which follows these same principles, but describes the situation differently.</i> Similar rules apply with regard to other substances.
Although produce from the second tithe may be used for smearing,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 10.</i> it should not be placed on a foot infection or on boils, nor may it be used as an amulet or the like, because it was not intended to be used as medication.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">But rather as food, or for smearing that is pleasurable like eating (Radbaz). Note the parallel in <i>Hilchot Shemitah</i> 5:11.</i>
The second tithe is considered the property of the Most High, as [Leviticus 27:30] states: "It is God's."

Chapter 4

A person who desires to redeem produce from the second tithe should<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Although there is a difference of opinion concerning this matter in the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:7), the variance in views applies only after the fact.

As long as they are within his possession, it is acceptable. See Halachot 11-13.</i> take the place of this produce" or "The holiness of this produce is transferred to these coins."<br>If he did not make such an explicit statement, but merely set aside the coins equivalent to [the value of] the produce, it is sufficient. He need not make an explicit statement.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For the circumstances clarify the nature of his intent [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:7)].<br>In some printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, there is a note (which some ascribe to the Ra'avad) that states that for the redemption to be acceptable when he does not make an explicit statement, he must have been involved with the matter beforehand. Rav Yosef Corcus discusses this issue at length, noting that this is indeed the law with regard to the consecration and divorce of a woman (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:8, <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 1:11). He makes two distinctions regarding the situations:<br>a) in contrast to consecration and divorce, setting aside money for produce from the second tithe is a self-explanatory act; the intent is directly obvious;<br>b) consecration and divorce must be observed by witnesses. Hence, one must make his intent clear to them. There is no such obligation with regard to the redemption of produce. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 31:136) quotes the Rambam's ruling.</i><br>The produce then is considered ordinary produce and the coins must be taken to Jerusalem and spent there,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">To purchase food. See Chapter 7, Halachah 3.</i> as [Deuteronomy 14:24] states: "When the journey will be too great for you, because you cannot transport it...."
Similarly, if a person desires to transfer the holiness of produce from the second tithe to other produce, he should bring the other produce<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The original produce, by contrast, is now considered as ordinary produce and can be eaten anywhere. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the transfer is not effective, for he maintains that the holiness of the produce from the second tithe can only be transferred to money. Nevertheless, as a stringency, he maintains that the second batch of produce must also be taken to Jerusalem. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justify the Rambam's ruling.</i> to Jerusalem and eat it there. He should not transfer the holiness of produce from one species to produce from another species,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam on this issue as well and again the commentaries justify the Rambam's position.</i> nor from high quality produce from one species to lower quality produce even if it is of the same species. If, however, he transferred the holiness of produce in these instances, the transfer is effective.
A person who redeems produce from the second tithe should recite a blessing:<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Before separating the produce.</i> "[Blessed are You...] who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the redemption of the second tithe." If he transferred the holiness to other produce or he transferred the holiness of money to produce,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 6.</i> he should recite the blessing: "...concerning the transfer of the holiness of the second tithe."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In continuation of his comments on the previous halachah, the Ra'avad states that a blessing should not be recited. Since the person is not allowed to transfer the holiness of the produce in this manner, he should not recite a blessing.</i> A person who redeems or transfers the holiness of <i>demai</i> need not<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, he should not, lest he be taking God's name in vein.</i> recite a blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Because there is no definite Scriptural obligation incumbent on this produce.</i>
When one redeems produce from the second tithe, he should not redeem it as the second tithe, but rather as ordinary produce. He should say: "How much is this ordinary produce worth." [This applies] even if everyone knows that the produce is from the second tithe, so that it will not be disgraced.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Produce from the second tithe is sold for a lower price than ordinary produce, because restrictions apply with regard to its consumption. Hence, if produce from the second tithe is offered for evaluation and its identity is known, people will look at it less favorably. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions this rationale, noting that once this produce is redeemed, there is no difference between it and ordinary produce and hence, its price should not be reduced. He explains that, nevertheless, since it originally was from the second tithe, it is still viewed less favorably.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling and maintains that such a ploy is not necessary. The commentaries follow the Rambam's view.</i>
The holiness of coins [used to redeem produce from] the second tithe should not be transferred to other coins.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> state that the Rambam derives this from the fact that <i>Demai</i> 1:2 states that such a redemption may be made with coins upon which the holiness of the second tithe of <i>demai</i> had been transferred. Implied is that if we are certain that the produce is from the second tithe, no such redemption can be made. See the Rambam's Commentary to that mishnah where he states that the concept is derived from Deuteronomy 14:25 which states: "And you shall exchange it for silver and you shall bundle the silver," i.e., the silver originally used for the redemption must be the silver taken to Jerusalem.<br>See the conclusion of Chapter 5 and the beginning of Chapter 6 which mentions some exceptions to this general principle.</i> [This applies] whether both sets of coins were silver or both were brass, the first set was silver and the second brass, or the first set was brass and the second silver. If one transgressed and transferred the holiness, the transfer is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See also Halachah 7 which states that redemption may be made in a pressing situation.</i>
[Outside of Jerusalem,] the holiness of money of the second tithe should not be transferred to produce. If such a transfer was made, the produce should be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the produce was purchased intentionally with money of the second tithe. See Chapter 7, Halachot 1, 15.</i> [Similarly, the holiness of money from the second tithe] should not be transferred to living domesticated animals, beasts, or fowl. If one [attempted to] make such a transfer, the holiness of the second tithe is not transferred. [This is a decree,]<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., our Sages rescinded the transfer of the holiness to the animal for the reason stated (<i>Sukkah</i> 40b).</i> lest one raise them in herds. If one transferred the [holiness of such funds] to animals that were slaughtered, they are considered as produce. They must be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there and the money is considered as ordinary funds.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 16.</i>
In a pressing situation,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., the situation described in Chapter 6, Halachah 2. This example is also discussed by the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:6).</i> it is permitted to transfer the holiness of silver coins to brass ones. One should not maintain this situation, however.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one should not leave the brass coins in a state of holiness (<i>ibid.</i>). Among the reasons silver coins are preferred is that they are more prestigious and they do not corrode.</i> Instead, [when he has] a respite he should transfer the holiness of the brass back to silver coins.
As an initial preference,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since the separation of the second tithe from <i>demai</i> is merely a Rabbinic stringency, our Sages granted leniency in its application.</i> one may transfer the holiness of coins of the second tithe from <i>demai</i>, transferring the holiness from silver to silver, from silver to brass, from brass to brass, and from brass to produce.

The produce from the second tithe may only be redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz distinguishes between <i>pediah</i>, "redemption," which requires coined silver, and <i>chillul</i>, "the transfer of holiness." The latter does not require coinage at all.</i> for silver, as [implied by Deuteronomy 14:25]: "And you shall bundle the silver." Similarly, if a person redeems the silver for himself and adds a fifth,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">As required by Chapter 5, Halachah 1.</i> that fifth must be silver like the principal.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See parallels in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 10:15; <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 7:2.</i><br>One should not use uncoined silver for the redemption [of the second tithe]. Instead, one must use silver imprinted with an image or with writing.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This is also derived from the above prooftext. <i>Vitzarta</i>, translated as "you shall bundle," relates to the word <i>tzurah</i> meaning "form" or "image." Thus the prooftext is implying that one may redeem produce from the second tithe with silver with an imprint [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 1:2); based on <i>Bava Metzia</i> 47b].</i> If one [attempted to] redeem [produce from the second tithe] with silver bullion or the like - this is referred as an <i>asimon</i> - his actions are of no consequence.

One may not use a silver coin less valuable than this copper coin. The rationale is that its minimal value causes it to be considered as uncoined silver (Radbaz; <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> because this is considered as redeeming with an <i>asimon</i>.
We may not redeem [produce from the second tithe] with a coin that is not legal tender in that place and at that time,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it has an imprint and was once issued by a government as currency, but is no longer accepted by the present ruling authorities.</i> as [implied by <i>ibid.</i>:26]: "And you shall exchange the silver for anything your heart desires."

[The following rules apply when] one was traveling on the road, carrying money, and a man of force was approaching him.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">And he is certain that he will rob him.</i> If he could save [his money, even] with difficulty, he can use it to redeem produce of the second tithe in his home.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the person knows that he will lose his money. Hence, rather than forfeit it without receiving anything for it, he decides that it is preferable for him to use it for something - to redeem his produce. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that the Rambam is not stating that, a priori, he may use the money to redeem his produce. Instead, the intent is that after the fact if he redeems the produce with this money, after the fact, the redemption is effective.</i> If he cannot, and he says: "The holiness of the produce that is in my house is transferred to this money," his statements are of no consequence.
When a person sets aside money upon which to transfer the holiness of produce from the second tithe, he may [continue to] redeem his produce under the assumption that the money exists in his possession. If he discovers that the money has been lost, he must be concerned about all the produce that he redeemed with that money.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he must operate under the premise that the money was lost immediately after he saw it last and all the produce that he sought to redeem from that time onward was thus not redeemed. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 7:4, however, which mentions a similar situation with regard to tithing produce and rules that although the produce must be tithed again, the status of that tithing is only doubtful.</i>
When a person located in Tiberias has money in Babylonian coinage in Babylon, he may not transfer the holiness [of the produce of the second tithe] to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Rambam's perspective is that in these instances, there are two negative factors: a) the coinage is not legal tender in the place where he is located; b) he does not have the money at hand.

When a person says: "The holiness of produce from the second tithe is transferred to the first <i>sela</i> that I will take out of this wallet," "...on the <i>sela</i> I will receive when I exchange this golden <i>dinar</i>," "...on the <i>pundiyon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">All of the italicized terms are coins used in the Talmudic era.</i> I will receive when I exchange this <i>sela</i>, the transfer is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In all these instances, the transfer of holiness is effective even though the coin was not singled out at the time when the declaration was made. Nevertheless, the transfer of holiness is not effective retroactively, i.e., we do not say that once the coin is taken, the transfer of holiness takes effect from the time the declaration was made.<br>The above follows the explanation given by Rav Yosef Corcus who notes that the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 1:21) does not accept the principle of <i>bereirah</i> with regard to questions of Scriptural Law. The Radbaz explains that this explanation is not necessary, because the Rambam rules that the obligation to separate the second tithe in the present age is Rabbinic in origin.</i> The <i>sela</i> that he will take out or receive in exchange is money of the second tithe.
When a person says: "The holiness of the produce of the second tithe is transferred to the <i>sela</i> in my son's possession, the holiness is not transferred. Perhaps the <i>sela</i> was not in his possession at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the coin was later discovered in the son's possession, the transfer of holiness is not effective, because we do not know whether it was in his possession at the time the declaration was made (Rashas). One might conclude that if one knows that the coin was in the son's possession at the time of the declaration, the separation is effective.</i>
When a person redeems the produce from the second tithe before he separates it, e.g., he says: "The second tithe of this produce<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Which he has not yet separated.</i> is redeemed with this money," his statements are of no consequence and the tithes have not been defined. If, however, he says: "The second tithe from this produce is in its northern portion" or "...in its southern portion<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Making such a statement is equivalent to separating the second tithe.

When the produce of the second tithe is redeemed, it should be redeemed for its fair value.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., at the time the Temple was standing; alternatively, in the present age, as an expression of piety (Chapter 2, Halachah 2).</i> One may, however, value it at the buying price, i.e., what the storekeeper would pay if he purchased it and not the price he would charge if he sold it.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the storekeeper obviously sells the produce for a higher price than the price at which he purchases it.</i> Similarly, he may pay money according to the rate that a moneychanger would pay and not according to the rate he would charge.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:2), the Rambam explains that a moneychanger will take 25 <i>me'ah</i> for a <i>sela</i>, but will only give 24.

[The following laws apply if] a <i>sela</i> was lacking a sixth or less [than its weight].<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In previous eras, the minting of coins was less precise and it was possible that a coin would weigh slightly less than the standard weight for it.

One should not redeem produce from the second tithe by estimation.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated above, the initial preference is to redeem the produce of the second tithe at its fair market price.

The Ra'avad maintains that the proper version of that source is: "We compel him to make the first bid. If he desires to retract he may. This is the stringency of consecrated property over the second tithes." The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this is indeed the version of the <i>Tosefta</i> commonly followed. There is an added difficulty with the Rambam's ruling, because in all instances of consecrated property, he requires the owner to make the first bid.

We should not transport produce<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">By contrast, money to which the holiness of the second tithe has been transferred may of course be transported.</i> from the second tithe from one place to another to redeem it there.

Chapter 5

When a man redeems his produce for the second tithe for himself - whether it is from his own crops, he acquired it as an inheritance, or it was given to him while <i>tevel</i> as we explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 17. Otherwise, it is forbidden to give the second tithe as a present.</i> he must add a fifth [of the new total].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Although the produce of the second tithe belongs to God, as it were, since the person partakes of it, the Torah considers as his, with regard to the obligation to add a fifth (<i>Bava Kama</i> 69b).</i> [Thus] if it was worth four, he should give five,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is true in all instances that the Torah requires that a fifth be added.</i> as [Leviticus 27:31] states: "If a man will redeem from his tithes, he shall add a fifth to it."
When a woman redeems produce for the second tithe that she separated, she is not required to add a fifth. According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 24a.</i> we have learned: "If a man [will redeem from] his tithes," excluding a woman. Similarly, if a man redeems [money used to] redeem produce from the second tithe for himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Using it to purchase peace sacrifices or the like.</i> he must add a fifth.
When a person redeems the produce of his second tithe and adds a fifth, and then redeems the money itself a second time, he must add a second fifth of the principal alone. He need not add a fifth for the original fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For example, if the produce was worth 4, the person redeeming it must originally pay 5 and then, if he must pay an additional 1. He need not pay an additional 1.2.</i>
When the fifth of the produce of the second tithe is not worth a <i>p'rutah</i>, [the person redeeming it] need not add a fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Because anything less than a fifth is not considered as financially significant. According to the Rambam, he must, however, redeem the produce. Rashi (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 54b), by contrast, maintains that it need not be redeemed at all.</i> Similarly, when the worth of the produce of the second tithe is unknown,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz distinguishes between this instance and Chapter 4, Halachah 20, which states that when the value of produce is unknown, it should be assessed by three experts, explaining that that halachah is speaking about an instance where the produce has genuine worth, but it can only be determined by experts, not a common person. This halachah, by contrast, is speaking about an instance where its worth is not known at all.</i> it is sufficient for him to say: "The holiness of the produce and its fifth are transferred to this <i>sela</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is acceptable, for as mentioned above, after the fact, the transfer of holiness from produce to money is acceptable even if the money is not of equal worth as the produce.</i> Whenever a person does not redeem produce from the second tithe with his own money, he need not add a fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:3) derives this concept from the exegesis of Leviticus 27:31.</i> [When one redeems] produce from the second tithe that is <i>demai</i>, he need not add a fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since the obligation to redeem the second tithe of <i>demai</i> is merely Rabbinic in origin, this added stringency was not imposed.</i>
When a person is redeeming produce of the second tithe and he has other produce from the second tithe that was not redeemed whose fifth is not worth a <i>p'rutah</i>, it is sufficient for him to say: "The holiness of it and its fifth are transferred to the money [set aside] originally."<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The reason why it is acceptable to use the money used to redeem other produce is explained in the following halachah and notes. This leniency is granted because the obligation to set aside the second tithe from such produce is Rabbinic in origin as stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 9. We grant him this leniency rather than require him to bring that produce to Jerusalem or to wait until he has enough other produce so that the fifth will be worth a <i>p'rutah</i> [Rashi (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 53b)].</i> [This leniency is granted,] because it is impossible to require a person to be precise with his money.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">And we assume that, as a safeguard, a person will be somewhat generous in the money he sets aside in redemption of the second tithe, setting aside a little more than the worth of the produce. The holiness of the produce whose fifth is worth less than a <i>p'rutah</i> is transferred to that extra amount (<i>ibid.</i>; Radbaz).</i>
When a person redeems produce from the second tithe for more than its worth, that additional value is not considered as money from the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, when a person redeems consecrated money for more than its worth, the extra amount is considered as consecrated [the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:3)].</i>
When the owner of the produce bids a <i>sela</i> to redeem it and another person also bids a <i>sela</i>, the owner is given precedence, because he is required to add a fifth. If, however, the owner bids a <i>sela</i> and another person bids a <i>sela</i> and a <i>p'rutah</i>, that other person is given precedence, because he increases the principal.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:3; based on the Jerusalem Talmud), the Rambam explains that an increase in the principal is favored over a lesser amount of principal but a greater total, because there are "guileful" means to avoid paying the additional fifth as will be explained.</i>
It is permitted to act "guilefully" with regard to the redemption of produce of the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the intent of the person's "guile" is to avoid paying the additional fifth.</i> What is implied? A person may tell his son or daughter who are beyond majority or his Hebrew servant:<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">All three of these individuals have an independent financial capacity. Hence, they are not considered as acting on behalf of the owner.</i> "Here is this money. Use it to redeem this produce from the second tithe," so that they will not have to add a fifth. He should not say, however: "Use them to redeem it for me."<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For then it appears that they are acting on his behalf.</i> Similarly, he is not required to add a fifth if he tells them: "Redeem it for me using your money."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For then the other people are considered as acting on their own initiative, even though he gave them instructions. This applies even if the owner of the produce gives the other person an equivalent amount of money, but that person does not use it to redeem the produce.</i>
He should not, however, give money to redeem [the produce] to one of his sons or daughters who are below majority<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 4:5, this is speaking about an instance where the child has reached the age when his vows are significant.

Nevertheless, at present, because she is a minor, she can act on behalf of others only with regard to matters of Rabbinic Law.</i> his words are effective if [the obligation to separate] the second tithe from this produce is Rabbinic in origin, e.g., produce grew in a flowerpot without a hole.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 5:14-16.</i> [The rationale is that] a Hebrew maidservant is a minor and a minor can acquire property for others only with regard to matters of Rabbinic Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Lulav</i> 8:10 and <i>Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i> 4:7 which explain that a minor can acquire for his or her self, but cannot do so on behalf of another person.</i>
Similarly, a person may act with guile and give produce from the second tithe as a present while it is still <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Once, however, the second tithe has been separated, it cannot be given as a present - except to be eaten immediately thereafter - for it is considered as "the property of the Most High."

He can give the produce to another person and redeem it for him. Thus the produce is being redeemed by a person other than its owner at that time. Hence a fifth need not be added.</i>
Two brothers,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if they are partners in other matters. As <i>Chasdei David</i> emphasizes, this leniency does not, however, apply to the redemption of produce which is owned in partnership.</i> two partners, a father and his son, may redeem produce from the second tithe for each other so that they will not have to add a fifth. When a woman brings produce from the second tithe to her husband's home,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">When a woman marries, all of the property she owns is given to her husband to use.

A person who redeems produce from the second tithe for himself, who paid the principal, but did not pay the additional fifth, should not partake of [the produce] until he pays the fifth. [This applies] even on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, it is a mitzvah to delight in food and drink.</i> [And it applies] even though the payment of the fifth does not hold back the transfer of holiness [from the produce to the coins].

If a person desires to exchange money from the redemption of the second tithe for golden <i>dinarim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, the second tithe must be redeemed with silver.

Even<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The addition of this word is based on the gloss of the Radbaz.</i> if he exchanged [the two] with his own money, he need not add a fifth, for this is not considered as redemption.

Instead, it should be divided into a <i>shekel's</i> worth of silver coins and a <i>shekel's</i> worth of brass coins.
It is permissible to transfer the holiness of money of the second tithe together with produce from the second tithe to money,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, although generally, a person cannot transfer the holiness of money of the second tithe to other money, an exception is made here, because of the produce that is included in the transfer.</i> provided the produce is worth less than a <i>dinar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that when the produce is worth less than a <i>dinar</i>, it is not fit to be redeemed.

Thus we assume that the money fell from one of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. One might, however, object and say that perhaps the money fell from one of the pilgrims during the festivals (see below), but was not discovered until afterwards. Our Sages (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 26a) resolve that query by explaining that since - as a precaution, to remove dead lizards or other objects that impart ritual impurity - the streets of Jerusalem are swept every day, we can assume that any money lost on the festivals would already have been discovered and these are ordinary funds.</i> If a shard upon which was written <i>ma'aser</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">"Tithes," i.e., the second tithe, for it is the only money of the tithes that may not be used in an ordinary manner.</i> it is considered as the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">We do not suspect that perhaps the person was carrying ordinary money and the shard from a container in which he had once stored money from the second tithe [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:9)].</i><br>When does the above apply? During the majority of the days of the year. On the pilgrimage festivals, by contrast, all [the money found] is considered as from the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For then the majority of people in Jerusalem are pilgrims. They bring the money from the second tithes that they collected throughout the year to purchase food in Jerusalem. Thus at that time, most of the money circulating in Jerusalem is from the second tithe.</i>
Money which is found in front of a seller of livestock in Jerusalem is always<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., not only during the pilgrimage festivals, but throughout the year.</i> considered as from the second tithe.

Even during the remainder of the year, there were some pilgrims who came to Jerusalem and they were the majority of the purchasers of animals for slaughter.</i> [Money] which is found on the Temple Mount is always considered as ordinary funds. We operate under the assumption that it came from the Temple treasury and the treasurers had already transferred its holiness to an animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">People were not allowed to bring money to the Temple Mount (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:2). Hence it is most likely that the money found there came from the Temple treasury. Now the priests would not take the money from the Temple treasury until they transferred its holiness to an animal. Hence we can assume that the holiness of the money had already been transferred and the status of the money found was ordinary [see the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:2)].</i>
[The following rules apply when] money is found in a chest that had been used for both ordinary produce and the second tithe.

The Radbaz also suggests that they should be considered as from the second tithe and redeemed for other money.</i>
When one find produce between produce of the second tithe and produce that is <i>terumah</i>, it should be included among the type to which it is closest.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See parallels in <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 3:15; <i>Hilchot Gezeilah ViAveidah</i> 15:18.</i> If it is equidistant [from both], it should be eaten according to the stringencies that apply to both.

When produce that is from the second tithe of <i>demai</i> and produce that is definitely from the second tithe are mixed together, [the mixture] must be eaten according to the more stringent requirements.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this is also speaking about a situation where the mixed produce is equidistant from the other two. <i>Chasdei David</i> emphasizes that the Rambam does not say "according to the stringencies that apply to both," because there are no stringencies in the laws applying to the second tithe of <i>demai</i> over produce that is definitely from the second tithe.

Produce that was purchased with money from the second tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that since the produce was redeemed once, it should not be redeemed a second time.</i> should not be redeemed outside Jerusalem unless they contracted ritual impurity from a primary source of ritual impurity. Instead, they should be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there.
This is the stringency of produce purchased with money from the second tithe over the produce of the second tithe itself. If, however, it contracted ritual impurity from a secondary source of ritual impurity,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows authoritative manuscripts and early printings. The standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> adds the phrase "because of Rabbinic decree."</i> it should be redeemed and eaten in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The rules governing this produce have a double dimension of severity. Since according to Scriptural Law, this produce is ritually pure, our Sages were stringent and required it to be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there. Nevertheless, to support their decree of ritual impurity, they also required that it be redeemed (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
Money from the second tithe should be used only to purchase food for humans<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and not animal fodder.</i> that grows from the earth or grows from the products of the earth, e.g., those entities explicitly mentioned in the Torah [Deuteronomy 14:26]: "Cattle, sheep,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., these types of livestock do not grow from the earth, but they derive their nature by pasturing on the earth's products.</i> wine, and strong drink."
For this reason, we do not purchase water, salt,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Moreover, even if water and salt are mixed together with produce, that produce should not be purchased with money from the second tithes (Radbaz).

A mixture of water and grapes<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 1:3), the Rambam explains that <i>timed</i> is made by mixing grape dregs with water and leaving it to turn into vinegar.</i> that has not turned to vinegar should not be purchased with money from the second tithe, because it is like water. Once it turns to vinegar, it can be purchased [with these funds] like wine or strong drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For the water originally included in it is not considered significant.</i> If one purchased it before it fermented and then it fermented, it is acquired by the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that when the transaction was first made, it was invalid. Hence, the money remained holy. Afterwards, when the mixture turns into vinegar, the transaction is completed and the holiness of the money is transferred.

When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the restriction against purchasing a mixture of grape dregs and water with money from the second tithe.</i> apply? When one mixed three units of water and received less than a fourth unit of the mixture.

Safron may not be purchased [with these funds], for it serves only as a coloring. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations involving herbs that provide an aroma, color, or taste.

There the Mishnah has two clauses: one quoted in this halachah which states that that the items are not acquired and one quoted in the following halachah which states that the money should be returned. The variance in wording indicates that there is a difference in law. The Radbaz states, however, that the Rambam would agree that the holiness of the funds of the second tithe is not nullified entirely.

Similarly, a domesticated animal<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">We are speaking about a kosher animal that does not have a blemish and hence is fit to be offered as a sacrifice.</i> should not be purchased with money from the second tithe outside of Jerusalem.

The sale is nullified only when the sale is made unintentionally. The Rambam's ruling here is based on <i>Kiddushin</i> 56b.</i> [with money from the second tithe]. If the seller fled,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">So that the money could not be returned and the sale nullified.</i> [the purchaser] should [purchase food] with the amount of money he spent and eat it in Jerusalem under the restrictions applying to the second tithe. This is the general principle: If the seller fled or died, whenever one spent the money of the second tithe on matters other than food, drink, and daubs, he must partake of an equivalent [value of food in Jerusalem]. If the seller was present, the money should be returned to [the original owner].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">And the sale nullified.</i> Similarly, if a person brought burnt offerings, sin offerings, or guilt offerings from the money of the second tithe,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This is forbidden, because the animal - partially or entirely - is offered on the altar and/or eaten by the priests. Thus the money from the second tithe is not being used for its designated purpose.</i> he must partake of an equivalent [value of food in Jerusalem].<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For once the offerings were brought, the transaction cannot be nullified.</i>
When a person [used money from the second tithe to] purchase a non-domesticated animal for a peace offering<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This is unacceptable, because peace offerings may be brought only from domesticated animals.</i> or a domesticated animal to be eaten as ordinary meat,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">This is also unacceptable, because as stated in Halachah 12, our Sages forbade using money from the second tithe for such a purpose [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 1:4)].</i> it is as if he [used it to] purchase an ox for plowing and the animal is not designated as a peace offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, the sale is nullified. If the animal was already slaughtered, the hide is considered as consecrated with the holiness of the second tithe and the proceeds from its sale must be used as the money of the second tithe.</i> If he purchased a domesticated animal to be offered as a peace offering and it became blemished, the holiness of the second tithe leaves it. It should be redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">As is required when an animal designated as a peace offering becomes blemished in a manner that prevents it from being sacrificed.</i> and the funds are not considered as money from the second tithe. Nevertheless, if he redeems it himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, one redeems a sacrifice for someone else, a fifth need not be added, as stated in <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 7:4.</i> he must add a fifth of its value.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's wording, for he considers it obvious that a fifth must be added. The Radbaz explains that one might think a fifth is unnecessary based on the following reasoning: Since the animal is a peace offering, from the standpoint of the second tithe, it does not belong to him, because it is not his private property, but instead is consecrated. From the standpoint of the peace offering, it can be said that it does not belong to him, because it is the second tithe which is "the property of the Most High."<br>Alternatively, the explanation of the Rambam's wording depends on a concept explained in <i>Hilchot Arachin, loc. cit.</i>: "[One is] obligated to add a fifth [when redeeming the article that was] consecrated originally, but one [need] not add a fifth [when redeeming an article] whose consecration was a derivative." A derivative means that it was consecrated in the process of redeeming another article (see <i>ibid.</i>:5).<br>To apply those concepts to the question at hand: Since the consecration of the animal as a peace offering comes as part of the redemption of the money from the second tithe, one might think that there is no need to add a fifth. For that reason, the Rambam [based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:2)] emphasizes that in this instance, the additional fifth is necessary, because since the holiness of the second tithe was removed from it, it is as if it was consecrated initially and it is not considered as a derivative (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>)</i>
When one consecrates money from the second tithe for [the purpose of purchasing] a peace offering, the consecration is not effective,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 12, one can - and according to many opinions, it is desirable - to purchase an animal to be sacrificed as a peace offering with money from the second tithe. Here, however, we are speaking about a situation where the person designates the money to be used for that purpose, but does not make the purpose as of yet. The Rambam is clarifying that the designation is not effective and the money may be used to purchase any other types of food.</i> for the sanctity of the peace offering does not encompass [an entity already] sanctified to the second tithe. For the second tithe is the property of the Most High.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 3, Halachah 17. I.e., when a person consecrates his own money for a peace offering, the consecration is effective, because the money belongs to him and he has the authority to consecrate it. Money from the second tithe, by contrast, does not belong to him. Hence, it cannot be consecrated as a peace offering.</i> Needless to say, this applies if he consecrates the produce of the second tithe itself for the purpose of purchasing] a peace offering, the consecration is not effective.
[The following laws apply when a person] partakes of entities consecrated to the second tithe as ordinary produce [outside of Jerusalem], even intentionally. If he partook of the produce from the second tithe itself, he should cry out to heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he should cry out to G‑d in repentance. He, however, has no other way of atoning for his conduct, because he has eaten the produce upon which the holiness of the second tithe rested.<br>Our text follows manuscript versions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and the versions suggested by the Ra'avad, the Radbaz, and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. The standard printed text follows a different version.</i> If he [used] money from the second tithe [to purchase other food that] he ate, the money should be returned to its [owner]<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Since the money exists, the holiness from the second tithe has not departed from it.

Alternatively, if the money cannot be returned, he should [purchase food] with the amount of money he spent and eat it in Jerusalem.

Chapter 8

When a person [used money from the second tithe to] purchase a domesticated animal for a peace offering or a non-domesticated animal for ordinary meat from a person who is not a merchant and is not precise, the hide is considered as ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the sacred quality of the second tithe no longer applies to it. It is as if the seller gave it to him as a present.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 1:3), the Rambam explains that when a seller is not meticulous in his business dealings and thinks that he sold only the meat and does not think about the hide, none of the money of the second tithe was used for the hide. Hence, the hide is considered as ordinary property.</i> This applies even if the value of the hide is greater than the value of the meat. When, by contrast, a person purchases an animal from a merchant, the hide is not considered as ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For a merchant is careful about getting a full price for his merchandise and will make sure to include the value of the hide in the price. Since the person will be using the money from the second tithe for the purchase, that purchase will also encompass the hide. Hence the hide is considered as the servants and land mentioned in Chapter 7, Halachah 17, and one must eat an equivalent amount of food in Jerusalem. Although ordinarily, one may not purchase non-food items with money from the second tithe, in this instance, an exception is made, because the meat cannot be purchased without the hide. See Radbaz.</i>
Similar laws apply when a person purchases jugs of wine that are sealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">But not while they are open as the Rambam continues stating.</i> In a place where it is customary for these jugs to be sold while sealed from a person who is not a merchant, the jugs are considered as ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., like the sale of the hides mentioned in the previous halachah, when an ordinary person buys or sells wine, he does not take the value of the jugs into consideration. For the container is considered as subservient to the wine it contains. Indeed, the flavor of the wine is somewhat dependent on its container. Accordingly, the two are considered as a single entity. (See <i>Eruvin</i> 27b which derives this concept through Biblical exegesis.) Hence, the money of the second tithe is not used for the containers.</i> Therefore the seller must open the tops of the jugs so that they will not become ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">By opening the jugs, the seller indicates that he desires to consider the jugs independently [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:13)]. By opening a jug, the seller indicates that he wants the purchaser to pour it into his own containers.</i> If the seller wishes to be stringent with himself and sell the wine in exact measure, the container is considered ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is selling the wine at an exact fee per measure, he is not including the price of the jug in the price of the wine (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
If he purchased [the jugs of wine] while they were open<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, opening the container is an indication that the container should be considered as an independent entity.</i> or sealed in a place where it is customary to sell them open<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is customary in this place to sell the containers open, even if one sells them while sealed, he is considered to have followed the general practice of considering the container as a separate entity.</i> or he purchased them from a merchant who is precise in his sale,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Following the same reasoning as in Halachah 1.</i> the jugs are not considered as ordinary property. If a person purchases baskets of figs and grapes together with their container,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the basket.</i> the container is not considered as ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For the fruit is sold independently of the baskets (Radbaz).</i>
If a person purchases nuts, almonds, or the like, the shells are considered as ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For they are obviously secondary to the fruit within them. Even a merchant is not concerned about them. Hence, one may benefit from them without worrying about purchasing their worth in food to be eaten in Jerusalem.</i> If a person purchases a frond of dates,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The dates together with the branches from which they are suspended.</i> the frond is considered as ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the dates are crushed, the container is obviously subservient to them, for they could not be sold without it. Hence, it is not considered as a separate entity.</i><br>[The following rules apply if] one purchases containers of dates. If they are pressed, the containers are considered as ordinary property.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For the containers are considered as subservient to the dates.</i> If not, they are not considered as ordinary property.
When a person has wine<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As opposed to other liquids as indicated by the conclusion of the halachah.</i> from the second tithe and he lends<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">We are speaking about a person using his own jugs. Nevertheless, the term "lends" is used because the person desires to retain possession of the jugs as ordinary property. He is merely "lending" them temporarily to be used for the second tithe. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:12), the Rambam writes that the person must make an explicit statement of the above intent.</i> his jugs for that [wine from] the second tithe, the second tithe does not acquire the jugs, even though he seals them.<br>[The following laws apply if] he stored the wine in them without making any statement:<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he stored wine from which the second tithe had not been separated in jugs and then desired to set aside several jugs as the second tithe. This reflects a reversal of the Rambam's understanding in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>). The Radbaz explains, however, that the two rulings are not contradictory.</i> If he designated [certain jugs] as the second tithe before he sealed their openings, the second tithe does not acquire the jugs.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Thus after the wine is poured out from them, he may use the jugs as ordinary property, without any further measures.</i> If he designated [the jugs] as the second tithe after he sealed their openings, the second tithe acquires the jugs.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For the wine and the container have an integral relationship as mentioned above. Indeed, our Sages compare it to separating wine in its jug to separating fruit in its peal. Thus if the value of the wine is transferred to money, the value of the jugs must also be included (Radbaz). Nevertheless, if one drinks the wine, the jug is no longer considered as consecrated to the second tithe and may be used for other purposes (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>).</i> If [the owner] stored a <i>revi'it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A measure of 86 or 150 cc depending on which Rabbinic authority one follows.</i> of ordinary wine in the jug,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">By putting ordinary wine in the jug, he indicates that he does not desire that the jug be acquired by the second tithe.</i> or put oil, vinegar, brine,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., brine that was purchased with money from the second tithe.</i> or honey from the second tithe without making any statement - whether before or after he sealed [the jugs] - the second tithe does not acquire the jugs.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For in contrast to wine and its containers, the containers of these liquids are not necessary for the liquid itself and are always considered as separate from them.</i>
When a deer that was purchased with money from the second tithe dies, it should be buried with its hide.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since the animal was never eaten, the hide is not considered as a separate entity. Thus since it and the animal are consecrated with the holiness of the second tithe, they must be buried. The deer may not be redeemed, because "we do not redeem consecrated entities in order to use their meat to feed dogs [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:11); <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 2:10]. Rabbi Akiva Eiger questions this ruling, citing sources which indicate that in similar circumstances, the hide can be considered a separate entity and should be redeemed.</i> If it was purchased while alive and slaughtered and then it became impure, it should be redeemed like other produce that became impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 8; Chapter 7, Halachah 1. Needless to say, this same law applies when a person purchases meat and later that meat becomes impure (Radbaz, based on the above mishnah).</i><br>[The following laws apply when a person] sets aside a <i>dinar</i> of money of the second tithe to purchase food against until he has exhausted its value and it becomes ordinary funds<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the person set aside money that was consecrated from the second tithe. Nevertheless, instead of using that money, used ordinary money with the intent that the holiness associated with the second tithe is transferred to the ordinary money as that money was spent to purchase food.</i> [and then the value of the coinage changes. For example,] the rate of exchange for a <i>dinar</i> was 20 <i>me'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is obviously speaking in hyperbole. The ordinary exchange rate of a <i>dinar</i> is six <i>me'ah</i> (<i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 1:12).</i> The person consumed ten <i>me'ah's</i> worth of food and then the value of the latter coinage decreased. Afterwards, the rate of exchange of a <i>dinar</i> was 40 <i>me'ah</i>. The person must spend another 20 <i>me'ah</i> on food before [the <i>dinar</i>] is considered as ordinary money.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he must use half a <i>dinar</i> for food. Now, however, the value of that half a <i>dinar</i> in <i>me'ah</i> has doubled. The rationale is that the value of the coinage from the second tithe is calculated at the time and place it is transferred.</i><br>If the value of a <i>me'ah</i> increased and the rate of exchange for a <i>dinar</i> was ten <i>me'ah</i>, he must spend another five <i>me'ah</i> on food. Afterwards, [the <i>dinar</i>] is considered ordinary money.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Again, he is using half a <i>dinar</i>, but now the value of that half a <i>dinar</i> in <i>me'ah</i> has been halved.</i>
When a person purchases produce with a <i>sela</i> of money from the second tithe and draws the produce into his domain, but did not pay for it before the value of the produce increased and it became worth two <i>selaim</i>, he is required to pay only a <i>sela</i> for the [produce]. [This is derived from the phrase]:<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording has attracted the attention of the commentaries who note that there is no Biblical verse which uses that exact wording. See Leviticus 27:19 which uses somewhat similar expressions.</i> "And he paid the money and it was acquired by him." [Implied is that the produce] is acquired by paying money.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording has attracted the attention of the commentaries. Seemingly, the reason for the Rambam's ruling is that once the purchaser performed <i>meshichah</i>, he acquired the produce. Hence, when he pays for it, he pays the price at the time of its acquisition. This is not implied by the Rambam's wording. Indeed, as the Ra'avad emphasizes, the Rambam's wording implies the very opposite.</i> The profit is realized by the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e.., he must eat the entire amount of produce according to the stringencies required of produce of the second tithe. One might think that the purchaser would profit from the rise of the value of the produce, i.e., he could eat half of it as the second tithe and use the other half as his private property. Hence, the Rambam clarifies that this is not so. The Radbaz explains the Rambam's wording, explaining that the transfer of the holiness does not take place until he pays the money, but that afterwards, the produce is acquired by the second tithe according to its price at the time of acquisition.</i>
If he drew the produce into his possession when it was worth two <i>selaim</i>, but did not pay for it until the value of the produce decreased and it was worth only a <i>sela</i>, he should pay only one <i>sela</i> for them from the money of the second tithe. He must add another <i>sela</i> from ordinary funds and give it to the seller.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since he drew the produce into his possession when it was worth two <i>selaim</i>, he must pay that amount to the seller. Nevertheless, he may not pay that entire amount from the money of the second tithe, because now the produce is not worth that amount. Indeed, if the purchaser would give the seller the second <i>sela</i> from the money of the second tithe, the holiness of that money would not be transferred to the produce and the seller would be obligated to use it to purchase food which he would eat according to the stringencies of the second tithe.</i> If the seller was a common person, it is permitted for him to give him a second <i>sela</i> from money from the second tithe of <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:6), the Rambam explains the rationale for this ruling. Since we are speaking about <i>demai</i>, there is only a question if there is a prohibition involved. Accordingly, since a common person is more lax in his observance and will violate even more severe prohibitions, we assume that he is not precise in his observance of <i>demai</i>. Hence, it can be given to him. The commentaries question that explanation, for even though he is not careful in his observance, we should not be responsible for him possibly performing a transgression. See Halachah 13 where this concept is also mentioned.</i><br>If [the purchaser] gave the seller a <i>sela</i> of money from the second tithe, but did not draw the produce into his possession until they were worth two [<i>selaim</i>], what he redeemed is redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the entire amount of produce is considered as produce of the second tithe, because as soon as the money from the second tithe is paid, its holiness is transferred to the produce.</i> and there is a judgment between the two of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., were it ordinary produce, the law would be that the seller should keep his word and complete the transaction. Nevertheless, since according to Rabbinic Law, a transaction is not completed with the payment of money, but rather when the purchaser draws the object into his possession, the purchaser does have the option of retracting. If he does so, however, he must be given the adjuration <i>mi shepara</i> (<i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 7:1). Should the seller choose that option and retract entirely, he must treat the produce in his possession as produce of the second tithe. If he still wants to carry out the sale at one <i>sela</i>, he must give the purchaser back a <i>sela</i>. The purchaser must consider all the produce as the second tithe, but the <i>sela</i> he was given is ordinary money.</i>
If [the purchaser] gave the seller two <i>selaim</i> of money from the second tithe, but did not draw the produce into his possession until its worth decreased to a <i>sela</i>, what he redeemed is redeemed,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the entire amount of produce is considered as produce of the second tithe, because as soon as the money from the second tithe is paid, its holiness is transferred to the produce.</i> and the attribute of judgment must be exercised between them.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the holiness of the second tithe is transferred to the produce. Nevertheless, from the financial point of view, the purchaser has the option of accepting the adjuration <i>mi shepara</i> and retracting from the transaction. If he takes that option, the seller must return the two <i>selaim</i> to him and from that time on, he may treat them as ordinary money. And the seller must treat the produce as produce of the second tithe.</i> [The rationale for these laws is that] the redemption<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The exchange of money for produce or vice versa.</i> of the second tithe is like drawing it into possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., just as a business transaction is completed when the purchaser draws it into his possession, the transfer of the holiness of the second tithe is completed upon the payment of money.</i>
If a person possessed ordinary produce in Jerusalem and money from the second tithe outside of Jerusalem, he may say: "The holiness of that money is transferred to this produce," and partake of them there in a state of ritual purity. The money then becomes ordinary funds in its location.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states at the conclusion of the following halachah, the money and the produce do not have to be in the same place when the holiness of one is transferred to the other.</i>
If one had money from the second tithe in Jerusalem and produce outside of Jerusalem, he may say: "The holiness of this money is transferred to that produce." The money then becomes ordinary money and the produce must be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:4), the Rambam mentions another general principle that can be derived from this law: the holiness of money in the second tithe can be transferred even when the money is in Jerusalem. As mentioned above, the holiness of produce from the second tithe may not be transferred when that produce is in Jerusalem.</i> For it is not necessary that the money and the produce be in the same place when the holiness of one is transferred to the other.
When a person possesses money from the second tithe in Jerusalem which he needs [for other purposes]<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for purposes other than food, drink, or smearing.</i> and a colleague possesses ordinary produce that he desires to eat, he should tell his colleague: "The holiness of this money is transferred to your produce." Thus that produce is considered as purchased with the money of the second tithe. The colleague should then partake of them in a state of ritual purity. Thus he does not lose anything and [his] money becomes as ordinary funds.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Which he may use at will, in Jerusalem or outside that holy city.</i>
When does the above apply? When his friend who owns the produce is a <i>chavair</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">A person who is precise in the observance of the laws of the agricultural laws and the laws of ritual purity. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i>, ch. 10.</i> For produce that is definitely of the second tithe may be given only to a <i>chavair</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For this produce must be eaten in a state of ritual purity and a common person is not precise in his observance of those laws. See Chapter 3, Halachot 8-9.</i> Therefore if the produce was [the second tithe of] <i>demai</i>, he may make such a stipulation with a common person as well.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes to Halachah 8, since the obligation above is only Rabbinic in origin, we allow it to be given to a common person even if he might be lax in its observance.</i><br>It is permitted to transfer the holiness of produce from the second tithe to produce or money belonging to a common person. We are not concerned that perhaps they are from the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since the common person is not careful in his observance of the second tithe, one might think that he already separated it from his produce, but is considering it as ordinary produce regardless. Were that the case, one could not transfer the holiness of other produce from the second tithe to it [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>T'vul Yom</i> 4:5)].<br>The Ra'avad cites the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:9) which places certain limitations on making such a transfer. The Radbaz explains that it is possible that these limitations were not accepted as halachah.</i>
[The following laws apply when a person] sets aside a <i>dinar</i> from the second tithe to [which to transfer the holiness of food that] he eats continuously. If he proceeded to do so to the extent that less than a <i>p'rutah's</i> worth [of its value] remained [consecrated],<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he continued using that coin to redeem produce from the second tithe until all but less than a <i>p'rutah's</i> worth of the coins value had been used to redeem produce.</i> the coin is considered as ordinary money.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">And may be used for purposes other than the purchase of food and drink. The rationale is that anything less than a <i>p'rutah's</i> worth of value is not financially significant [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:8)].</i><br>When does the above apply? With regard to [the second tithe of] <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Since the obligation is only of Rabbinic origin, we are more lenient.</i> With regard to produce that is definitely of the second tithe, [the coin] is not considered as ordinary money until less than a <i>p'rutah's</i> worth [of its value] remained [consecrated] after a fifth was added to it, e.g., less than four fifths of a <i>p'rutah's</i> worth [of its value] remain.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In that way, when the fifth (one fifth of the new total) is added, the worth of the entire amount will be less than a <i>p'rutah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
[The following laws apply when people who are] ritually impure and others who are ritually pure were eating together in Jerusalem and those who were ritually pure desired to [use their money from] the second tithe for food. They should place a <i>sela</i> from the second tithe aside and say: "The holiness of this <i>sela</i> is transferred to everything which those who are ritually pure eat."<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad [based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:10)] states that we are speaking about a situation where the person says: "When the person eats or drinks, what he eats or drinks will be retroactively considered as the second tithe from the present time." It is necessary to make this qualification, because otherwise, at the time he eats or drinks, he will be partaking of ordinary food and the consecration would not take effect until the object no longer exists.<br>The Ra'avad also states that this ruling depends on the principle of <i>bereirah</i>, that retroactively the status of an object can be changed. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that there is somewhat of a difficulty in ascribing such a position to the Rambam, for the Rambam maintains that in questions of Scriptural Law, the principle of <i>bereirah</i> does not apply. The Radbaz explains that since there is no prohibition involved, merely the question of when the transfer of holiness takes effect, all authorities agree that the principle of <i>bereirah</i> applies.</i> The <i>sela</i> is then considered as ordinary property, for they eat and drank its value in a state of ritual purity. [This applies] provided the people who are impure do not touch the food<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">In certain instances, they may, however, touch the container in which the food is stored. See <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:10 and the Rambam's commentary for more details.<br>The commentaries suggest that the restrictions mentioned in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 9:21 should also be observed.</i> and thus cause it to contract impurity.

In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:1; based on <i>Bava Kama</i> 69a), the Rambam explains that it is necessary to make such provisions in the Sabbatical year alone. In an ordinary year, one need not do so, because it is forbidden to take produce from another person's field. Why should he? He knows the status of his own fruit and he need not make any provisions so that a thief will not transgress the prohibition against partaking of this produce.</i> If [the produce is] within the [three] <i>orlah</i> years,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the first three years if its growth when it is forbidden to partake of it entirely.</i> it should be marked with baked clay<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> so that [people] will shun it.

In truth, however, in this instance, we are not relying on <i>bereirah</i>, because the money is set aside and the redemption does not take place until the produce is harvested (Radbaz).<br>In addition, there is a further problem. When the reaper takes the produce, it is no longer in the owner's possession, and hence, one might think that it is not in his power to redeem it (see the Responsa of the Ramban, quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:4; <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 1:14.</i> [This applies] provided the planting takes root before these thirty days [begin]. How long does it take?

Thus if a tree was planted on the 28th of Tishrei, three years later on the 28th of Tishrei, its fruit is permitted as <i>neta reva'i</i>.</i> I have seen <i>Geonim</i> who have a different approach<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this as referring to the approach of the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> (as quoted by <i>Tosafot, Rosh HaShanah</i> 10a), Rabbenu Shimshon (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:1), and Rabbenu Asher (at the conclusion of his <i>Hilchot Orlah</i>).</i> regarding the reckoning of <i>orlah</i> and <i>neta reva'i</i>.

[The restrictions of] <i>neta reva'i</i> applies to all [plants to which] the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is speaking about plants within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As mentioned above, according to the Rambam, the laws of <i>neta reva'i</i> do not apply in the Diaspora (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> And all [plants] that are exempt from <i>orlah</i> are not obligated for <i>neta reva'i</i>, as [Leviticus 19:23-24] states: "For three years [your plants] will be <i>orlah</i>....

When a person plants a fruit tree with the intent that it serve as a hedge for a garden or he planted it to use it as lumber and not for its fruit, it is exempt from the prohibition of <i>orlah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i> 1:1), the Rambam explains that this concept is alluded to by Leviticus 19:23. When that verse states the prohibition against <i>orlah</i>, it says: "When you plant a tree of which you eat...," i.e., for the prohibition to apply, one must have the intent of partaking of the tree's fruit.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 294:23) states that it must be evident that the owner did not desire to grow the trees for their fruit, e.g., he planted them to close together to grow fruit properly.</i> If he planted it to serve as a hedge and then changed his mind and thought to use its fruit or he planted it for the sake of its fruit and then thought to use it as a hedge, since an intent that obligates it was involved, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The three years of <i>orlah</i> are counted from the time the tree is planted regardless of when he thought of using it for food (Radbaz).</i> If he planted it for three years as a hedge and afterwards, intended to use it for food, the laws of <i>neta reva'i</i> do not apply,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> does not apply, because he did not have the intent of growing it for its fruit until the three years in which the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> would apply were completed.</i> because whenever the laws of <i>orlah</i> do not apply, the laws of <i>neta reva'i</i> do not apply.
When one planted a tree with the intent that the inner side will produce food and the outer side will serve as a hedge or the lower portion will produce food and the upper portion will serve as a hedge,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The converse is also true. Even when the lower portion is prohibited because it was intended for food and the upper portion is permitted, because it was intended to be used as a hedge, we do not say that the lower portion causes the upper portion to be forbidden. Even though it grows from it, it remains permitted [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>294:23; <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 294:34).</i> the portion that was intended for food is liable in the prohibitions of <i>orlah</i> and the portion intended as a hedge or for lumber is exempt. For the matter is dependent on the intent of the one who plants it.<br>The prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies to only the caper berries of the caper tree, but its leaves are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although they are edible, they are not considered as food to this extent. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 294:3) differs and accepts the Rambam's ruling only in the Diaspora. In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, even the leaves are considered as food.</i>

When a person plants trees in the public domain<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In all the situations mentioned in this halachah, there is reason to think that the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> does not apply.

Those texts state that even if a gentile raises a tree himself, the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> apply.

We are forced to say that for the previous halachah already mentioned a tree that grew on its own accord in the public domain (Radbaz).<br>The rationale for this law is that since the soil is not good, the trees will not grow well and will only produce a minimal amount of fruit. Hence, it is considered as if one has planted these trees for purposes other than their fruit and the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> does not apply as stated in Halachah 2.</i> Even one who plants trees in an unsettled place is exempt, provided the tree does not produce enough fruit so that it would be worthwhile for a person to care for its produce until he brings it to a settled land.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the person who planted the tree shows concern for the tree's fruit, he is not considered to have planted a tree for the purpose of fruit, for the nature of the situation prevents us from considering it as such.</i> If, however, the tree produces enough that it is worthwhile to maintain it, the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies to it.

The obligation to observe them is not nullified by the consecration of the tree.</i>
When a person plants [a tree] in a flowerpot<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Whether of wood or earthenware (Radbaz).</i> without a hole, the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies. [Although planting in such a pot] is not considered as [planting] in the earth with regard to smaller plants, it is considered as planting in the earth with regard to trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A smaller plant that is planted in a flowerpot without a hole does not derive nurture from the ground. A tree's roots, by contrast, have more power and can derive nurture from the ground even when there is no hole [Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Orlah</i> 1:2)].</i>
When a tree is planted in a house, the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies. Trees planted by gentiles before our ancestors entered the [Holy] Land<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Before the conquest of the land by Joshua.</i> were exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This law is not merely a historical point. It shares an element of contemporary relevance. At present, all of the agricultural laws relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> are observed only by virtue of Rabbinic decree. It will not be until the entire Jewish people return in the era of Mashiach, that these mitzvot will have the status of Scriptural commandments (see <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:26 and notes). Thus the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> does not apply to trees planted by gentiles in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> at present. If such trees are less than three years of age when Mashiach leads the entire people back into the land, the laws of <i>orlah</i> will not apply to them (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>).</i> After our ancestors entered the land, the prohibition applies even to [trees] planted by gentiles,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">If the plant was for the sake of a Jew, as stated in the notes to Halachah 5.</i> as Leviticus 19:23] states: "When you enter the land and you plant...." [The prohibition begins from] the time of the entry into the land.
When a gentile grafts<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 14, grafting is equivalent to planting.</i> a fruit tree on a non-fruitbearing tree, the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden for a Jew to make such a graft. Once it is made, however, a Jew can benefit from the fruit. He must, however, wait the three <i>orlah</i> years (Radbaz).</i> If a gentile desires to observe the mitzvah of <i>neta reva'i</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 10:10 which states that, with a few exceptions, if a gentile desires, he may observe any of the mitzvot of the Torah and he receives a reward for doing so.</i> its laws apply to him and it is consecrated like <i>neta reva'i</i> belonging to a Jew.
[With regard to] the prohibition of <i>orlah</i>, [planting a tree refers to] planting a seed,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz mentions that in warmer climates, it is possible for a tree to grow from a seed to the point that it can produce fruit in three years. In his Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III., ch. 37, the Rambam states that the Torah mentions three years because it speaks about the majority of instances where trees are grown by planting boughs from other trees.</i> a bough from a tree, or uprooting the entire tree from one place and planting it in another.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rambam LeAm</i> questions why it is necessary for the Rambam to mention "another place." Even if he replanted the tree in its original place, the laws of <i>orlah</i> apply.</i> We begin counting [the three years] from the time of the planting.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the case of a replanted tree, we do not consider the years it grew in its previous place.</i><br>[The following laws apply if] a tree was shaken from its place, but not uprooted and then one filled the surrounding area with earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Replanting it, as it were.</i> If it could live without the surroundings having been filled with earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the connection via its roots was strong enough to sustain it without filling the earth in around its roots.</i> it is exempt. If not, it is considered as if it was uprooted and replanted, and the prohibition does apply.
Similarly, when a tree was uprooted and there remained a root, even one as thin as a needle over which embroiderers wind thread,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i> 1:4; <i>Keilim</i> 11:15; 13:5) for a more particular definition of this term.</i> if one returned it to its original place and replanted it, it is exempt [from the prohibitions of <i>orlah</i>], because it could live.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">That thin root would be sufficient to provide it with its nurture even if one would not have replanted it.</i><br>[The following rules apply if] the tree was uprooted entirely together with the clod of earth<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam, quoting <i>Orlah</i> 1:3, uses the term <i>sela</i>, usually translated as "rock" for the clod of earth, because the earth hardens around the mass of roots, as he explains in his Commentary to the Mishnah.</i> to which its roots were attached and he replanted it as it is, together with that earth. If it could live from that clod of earth even if it was not replanted, it is as if it was not uprooted. If not, [the laws of <i>orlah</i>] apply.
When a tree was cut down from above the earth<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording implies that if the stump of the tree is above the earth, the laws of <i>orlah</i> do not apply. The commentaries have noted that this ruling appears to conflict with his ruling in <i>Hilchot Shemitah</i> 3:8.</i> and [a new tree grew from its roots], the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For this is considered like a new tree. See also Halachah 19.</i> [The three years] are counted from the time [the first tree] was cut down.
Whether one plants a tree, one extends one,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Havrachah</i>, translated as "extending," is a technique that was used particular with regard to vines. After a vine had grown for a long time, the head of the vine is planted in the ground where it grows new roots and thus has the potential to better nurture the new growth. As evident from the continuation of the halachah, sometimes the connection to the original vine is severed and it continues to grow as entirely independent plant. Other times, the connection is allowed to continue and then it is considered only as an extension of the original plant. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i> 1:5) and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 294:16).</i> or grafts it, [the laws of <i>orlah</i>] apply. When does the above apply? When one cut off a bough from the tree and planted it in the earth or grafted it to another plant. If, however, one extended a branch of an elder plant and then implanted it in the earth or grafted it onto another tree,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the grafted branch will be receiving nurture from two sources (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> [leaving] the bough connected to the elder tree, [the new growth] is exempt [from the prohibition of <i>orlah</i>].
If the new growth which was originally extended grew and produced fruit and, afterwards, the source from which it was connected to the elder tree was separated, we count [the years of <i>orlah</i>] from the time that it was separated.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For severing the connection is considered like planting it.</i> The fruit [that was growing on the tree before it was separated] is, however, permitted, because it grew while permitted. If he left [the fruit on the new tree] after the connection to the original tree was severed until their growth increased by a two-hundredth,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 5:22 which explains how this measure is calculated.</i> the fruit is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> is nullified in a mixture one/twohundredth the size of the forbidden matter. In the instance mentioned above, once the connection to the original tree is severed, everything which grows is considered as <i>orlah</i>. Thus the fruit remaining on the tree has both permitted and forbidden elements to its existence. If it grows more than the amount stated above, the prohibited substance within it is not nullified and it causes the entire fruit to become forbidden.</i>
When a young tree<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one that was not yet three years old.</i> was grafted on to an elder tree and there were fruit on the younger tree, the fruit on the younger tree<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Which are forbidden because they are <i>orlah</i>.</i> are forbidden even if the fruit increases 200 times its size.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's wording [which is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 294:22), the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 294:32 infers that the new fruit that grows on the grafted branch afterwards is permitted.</i> For the basic fruit that comes from a forbidden entity<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since at the outset, this fruit was forbidden, its fundamental nature is considered as forbidden and everything added to it is incidental.</i> cannot be elevated by the new permitted substances that grow.
[The following rule applies when] a branch was extended from a tree and implanted in the earth and afterwards, the tree itself was entirely uprooted and it derives its nurture only from the branch implanted in the earth. The tree is considered as if it was planted at this time and the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Since its original connection to the earth was severed, the tree is considered as having been planted at this time.</i> [The three years] are counted for the tree and for whatever grew from the implanted branch from the time it was uprooted.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">For until then, whatever grew from the implanted branch was considered as part of the original tree and the years of <i>orlah</i> were never counted for it. Even though the years of <i>orlah</i> were counted for the original tree, since it is now being considered as part of the implanted branch, we must count the years of <i>orlah</i> again.</i>
When a person extended a branch and implanted it in the earth and it grew, he then extended and implanted a branch from the new growth and it grew, and then he extended and implanted a branch from the third growth - and continued doing so even for 100 implants each connected with each other - since the connection with the primary plant has not been severed, all [of the fruit]<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Even from the later implants.</i> is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Because they are all considered as part of the original plant.</i> If [the connection to] the original plant is severed,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The implanted plants are considered as new entities and the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies to them.</i> [the <i>orlah</i> years] are counted from the time of the severance.
A tree which grows from a stump is exempt from the prohibitions of <i>orlah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For the new growth is considered as an extension of the previous tree.</i> [If it grows] from the roots,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it did not have a portion that projects above the ground (<i>Bava Batra</i> 82a).</i> the prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">For it is considered as an entirely new tree.</i><br>The prohibition of <i>orlah</i> applies to a dwarf vine which is less than a handbreadth high throughout its entire life,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">This is a Rabbinic decree, enacted for the reason stated by the Rambam.</i> because it looks like a tree that is one year old. When does the above apply? To one tree or to [a group of five, planted in a pattern where] two are planted opposite another pair and a fifth is planted behind them.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">This was a common pattern to plant trees and was referred to as "a small vineyard" (<i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 7:7). Even though it is a separate entity, because it is small, it is subject to the above Rabbinic decree.</i> If, however, an entire vineyard is less than a handbreadth high, it would be a matter of common knowledge and its age is calculated in the same way as other trees.
We may plant a branch from a tree that is <i>orlah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Because the prohibition against <i>orlah</i> applies only to the fruit and not to the plant as a whole [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Orlah</i>1:9)].</i> but we may not plant a nut that is <i>orlah</i>, because it is produce and it is forbidden to benefit from it, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 10, Halachah 9.</i> If one transgressed and planted a nut that is <i>orlah</i>, [the tree] that grows from it is permitted like other trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">It is even permitted to partake of its fruit, as explained in the following halachah.</i>
Similarly, one may not graft underdeveloped clusters of dates,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is taken from Rav Kappach's translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>). The standard published text of that work and similarly, the gloss of the Radbaz to this halachah understands the term differently.</i> that are orlah, because they are considered as food. If one transgressed and grafted them, the fruits are permitted. [The rationale is that] whenever an entity has two causes, one forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The date cluster.</i> and one which is permitted,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The permitted date tree.</i> since it comes as a result of both of them, it is permitted. Therefore [a plant] that grows from fruit that is <i>orlah</i> is permitted, because its growth was caused by the forbidden fruit and the earth which is permitted.

Chapter 11

It is a positive commandment to make a declaration<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In other contexts, the term used by the Rambam here (and by the previous Rabbinic sources) usually means "confession." Among the reasons why this term is used is because the fact that the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes are given to the priests and Levites is a result of the Jews' sin. Had that not occurred, these agricultural separations would have been given to the firstborn.</i> before G‑d<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the Temple.</i> after all the presents<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 12.</i> from the agricultural products.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 131) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 607) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> This is called the declaration of the tithes.
This declaration is made only after the year in which the tithe for the poor is separated,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The third and the sixth years of the seven year cycle.</i> as [Deuteronomy 26:12-13] states: "When you complete tithing, and you shall declare before God your Lord: 'I have removed all the sacred substances from the house...'"
When is this declaration made? On the afternoon of the last festival<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi and others, by contrast, maintain that this declaration should be made on the first day of the Pesach holiday. The Rambam's opinion is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:10) which states that the Jews were given the opportunity to partake of the second tithe throughout the Pesach holiday so that they would have ample resources with which to celebrate and partake of this food. For that same reason, the declaration is delayed until the afternoon.</i> of the Pesach holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For on Sukkot, there are still many fruits from the sixth year in the field (Radbaz; <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:159).</i> of the fourth and seventh year, as [the prooftext] states: "When you complete tithing...," i.e., on the festival when all the tithes are completed. Pesach of the fourth year will not arrive before all of the produce - both those that grow from the earth and those that grow from trees - have been tithed.
The declaration may only be made during the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A declaration made at night is unacceptable.</i> The entire day<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">From sunrise to sunset. The above statement that it is made in the afternoon was a leniency intended to provide a person with latitude.</i> is appropriate for this declaration. Whether the Temple is standing or not,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For, as stated in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:1, the laws of <i>terumah</i> and the other agricultural requirements apply even if the Temple is not standing.</i> he is obligated to remove [all the agricultural presents from his possession] and make the declaration.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the mitzvah to make a declaration applies only in the Temple. The Radbaz supports the Rambam's ruling, explaining that it is based on Halachah 6. Since, after the fact, one fulfills his obligation if he makes the declaration outside the Temple, when there is no Temple, there is no choice but to accept that alternative.</i>
This declaration may be made in any language,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">It must, however, be an exact translation. Note the contrast to the declaration made when bringing the first fruits (<i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 3:10).</i> as [indicated by the prooftext]: "You shall declare before God your Lord," i.e., in any language in which you declare.<br>Each person should make this declaration individually.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this is the desirable manner of performing the mitzvah (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:161).</i> If many desire to recite it together, they may.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Not the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 607) which states that the Rambam is speaking about a situation where one person speaks out loud and the others fulfill their obligation by listening.</i>
[The proper way of performing] the mitzvah is to recite the declaration in the Temple, as [implied by] the phrase: "before God." [Nevertheless,] if he made the declaration in any other place, he fulfilled his obligation.
A person may not make this declaration until he has disposed of all the agricultural presents in his possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> and others question why the removal of the presents from one's property is not considered as an independent mitzvah.</i> For in the declaration he states: "I have removed all the sacred substances from the house."<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And if he still possessed these presents, he would be lying. See the following halachot.</i> On the day before the final day of the Pesach festival,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The standard published text of <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:6 states "The day before the first holiday of the Pesach festival." The Rambam apparently had a different version of that mishnah. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's version, explaining that on the passage from the Jerusalem Talmud cited above which explains that the declaration was delayed so that the people would be able to partake of the presents during the festival indicates that they would not have to remove the presents from their possession until the festival's conclusion.</i> one must remove [the last of the presents] and on the following day, the declaration is made.
What must one do? If he has <i>terumah</i> or <i>terumat ma'aser</i> in his possession, he should give them to a priest. The first tithe should be given to a Levite and tithe of the poor to the poor. If produce that was definitely from the second tithe or <i>neta reva'i</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is based on <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:6. That mishnah does not mention <i>neta reva'i</i>. Nevertheless, the Rambam adds it because all the laws that apply to the second tithe apply to it (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> or money from their redemption remained in his possession, he must destroy it and cast it in the sea or burn it.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Thus there are two types of <i>biur</i>, removal of agricultural presents: giving presents to those to whom they are supposed to be given and destroying, those which one keeps for oneself (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> If the second tithe of <i>demai</i> remains in his possession, he is not obligated to destroy it.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Since the obligation to separate it was imposed only because of a doubt, we rule leniently.</i> If the first fruits remain in his possession, they may be destroyed in any place.
When does the obligation to burn and remove apply? When there remains in his possession [fresh] produce that one cannot consume before the commencement of the holiday. If, however, cooked food from the second tithe or <i>neta reva'i</i> remain, it need not be removed, for cooked food is considered as if it was removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For if it is left for any significant amount of time, it will spoil [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:6)].</i> Similarly, wine and spices are considered as if they were removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For they also will spoil if left for any significant amount of time.</i>
Produce that has not reached the "phase of tithing"<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">One third of its growth, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'aserot</i> 2:5.</i> by the time the removal [of the agricultural presence] arrives does not prevent a person from making a declaration, nor is he obligated to remove them from his possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since the produce has not reached this stage of development, there is no obligation to tithe it. Hence, it need not be removed or included in the declaration.</i>
When produce belonging to a person was distant from him [when] the time for its removal arrived,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:9 relates that once when the time to remove produce arrived, Rabban Gamliel was on a sea journey and could not physically give the produce to anyone else. He therefore transferred the presents to other sages in the manner described here. Since Rabbi Elazar ben Arach was a priest, he gave him <i>terumah</i>, Rabbi Yehoshua was a Levite and so he gave him the tithes, and since Rabbi Akiva was a collector of gifts for the poor, he gave him the tithes for the poor.</i> he should designate the presents [appropriately]<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">And specify in which portion of the grainheap they are located.</i> and transfer them to their owners by giving them together with land.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i>, ch. 6, which describes how this transfer of property operates. This means of transfer is used, because this is the only way the ownership of the produce can be given to these individuals without an actual physical transfer.</i> Alternatively, [he may give them to] someone who will acquire them for their owners. He may then recite the declaration the following day.<br>[The rationale is] that transferring movable property to a person together with landed property is a present that has been strengthened. He may not, however, transfer [the produce from] the tithes to them via an exchange,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The term "exchange" is translated from the Hebrew <i>kinyan chilipin</i>, a legal act that formalizes a transaction. See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i>, ch. 5, for a description. Although this legal act is frequently employed, it is not appropriate in this instance, because the gift would resemble a sale and not a present.</i> because it resembles a sale and [the Torah] speaks of giving, not selling, the tithes, <i>terumah</i>, and the other presents.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Deuteronomy 26:13.</i>
What source teaches that he cannot recite the declaration until he removes all the presents [from his possession]? [It is written:] "I have removed all the sacred substances from the house." "The sacred substances" refers to the second tithe and <i>neta reva'i</i> which are called "sanctified."<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 1.</i> "From the house" refers to <i>challah</i>, for it is a present given to the priests in one's home.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is not given until the grain is made into dough [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:10)].</i> [The prooftext continues:] "I gave it to the Levite" - this refers to the first tithe. "And I also gave it" - this implies that it was preceded by another present, i.e., the great <i>terumah</i> and <i>terumat ma'aser</i>. "To the stranger, the orphan, and the widow" - this refers to the tithe given to the poor, <i>leket, shichachah</i>, and <i>pe'ah</i>. [The latter three are mentioned] even though [the failure to give them] does not prevent recitation of the declaration.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have pointed out a difference between <i>leket, shichachah</i>, and <i>pe'ah</i> and the other presents. For the Torah does not prescribe giving the latter three to the poor, but rather leaving them for them.</i>
The presents must be separated according to the desired order<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 3:23 with regard to the desired order of the presents.</i> and afterwards, the declaration is made, as [implied by the continuation of the verse:] "according to all Your mitzvot which You commanded me." Thus if he gives the second tithe before the first tithe, he cannot recite this declaration.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">For he cannot say: "As You commanded me," since by deviating from the desired order, he did not fulfill the mitzvot "as commanded." Indeed, he committed a transgression.</i><br>If a person's <i>tevel</i> is burnt, he cannot make this declaration, for he did not separate the presents or give them to the people designated. In the era when the first tithe was given to the priests,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">When Ezra led the Jews back to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> after the Babylonian exile, by and large, the Levites did not accompany him. Therefore, he punished them, decreeing that the tithes should be given to the priests instead (<i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 1:4). From the Rambam's statements here and also in that source, some have inferred that Ezra's decree applied only in his generation and not in later eras. This conclusion is not, however, borne out by his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i> 5:15)].</i> the declaration was not made, [because it contains the words:] "I gave it to the Levite."
When a person possesses only the second tithe, he should make the declaration, for the fundamental dimension of the declaration concerns the [second] tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Of them all, it is the only one that must be destroyed as stated in Halachah 8.</i> Similarly, if he possesses only the first fruits, he should make the declaration, for [the prooftext] states: "I removed the holy substances" and the first type of produce that is holy is the first fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">And it must also be removed from one's possession.</i> When, however, a person only possesses <i>terumah</i>, he does not recite the declaration,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the same rule applies to the first tithe.

[The prooftext continues:] "I did not violate your commandments,"<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam explains the details of this declaration, the intent is not that one should explain it while reciting it. Instead, he should merely read the passage as it is stated in the Torah [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:13)].</i> i.e., he did not separate from one species for another, nor from produce that has been reaped for produce that is still attached to the ground, nor from produce that is attached to the ground for produce that has been reaped, nor from produce from the present year for that of the previous year, nor from produce of the previous year for that of the present year.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 5:18; 5:9, 5:11, and <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 1:12 which explains that separating the presents in such a manner is forbidden.</i><br>[The prooftext continues:] "I did not forget," I did not forget to bless Him and recall His name with regard to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Some interpret this as referring to the recitation of a blessing when making the separations. The commentaries question these interpretations, however, because the blessings were instituted by the Rabbis and here we are speaking of the exegesis of a Biblical verse.

"I did not partake of it in a state of impurity," thus if he separates it in a state of acute mourning, he does not recite the declaration. "I did not give of it to a corpse." This implies that he did not use [money from the redemption of the tithes] for a coffin or shrouds, nor did he give it to other people in a state of mourning. "I heeded the voice of God my Lord," i.e., I brought it to the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first fruits. The second tithe need not be brought to the Temple.</i> "I performed everything that You commanded me," I rejoiced. And I shared that rejoicing with others with it, as [Deuteronomy 26:11]: "And you share rejoice in all the good."
[The passage continues:] "Look down from Your holy habitation heaven... as You swore to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey." This is a prayer that the fruits be flavorful.

Note the contrast to the declaration concerning the first fruits which they are required to make (<i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 4:3).</i> and in the declaration one says: "And the land that You gave us." Priests and Levites may make the declaration.
