Mishneh Torah, Tithes



Chapter 1

After separating the great <i>terumah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the preferable course of behavior. If, however, one separates the tithes before <i>terumah</i>, the separation is binding.</i> one should separate one tenth of the remaining produce<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it is not a tenth of the entire crop.</i> and this is called the first tithe. Concerning it [Numbers 18:24] states: "For the tithes of the children of Israel that they will separate to God."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 127) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 395) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i><br>These tithes are given to Levites, males and females, as [<i>ibid.</i>] states: "And I gave the Levites all of the tithes of the children of Israel as an inheritance."
An Israelite is permitted to partake of the first tithe, and it may be eaten in a state of ritual impurity, because it is not holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., unlike <i>terumah</i> where these restrictions apply.</i> Whenever the term "holy" or "redemption" is used with regard to the tithes, the intent is the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Which must be eaten in Jerusalem in a state of ritual purity.</i><br>What is the source from which we learn that the first tithe is ordinary produce? [<i>Ibid.</i>:27] states: "And your <i>terumah</i> will be considered for you as grain from your grainheap and the fullness of the vat." Just as a grainheap and a vat [contain] ordinary produce, so, too, once <i>terumat ma'aser</i> has been separated from the first tithe,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Until <i>terumat ma'aser</i> has been separated from it, however, we may not partake of it (Radbaz).</i> it is ordinary produce in all regards. For this reason, when the daughter of a Levite has been taken captive<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">And we fear that she was raped by her captors. With regard to <i>terumah</i>, by contrast, once the daughter of a priest engages in forbidden relations, she is forbidden to partake of it (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 6:7). Our Sages did not decree that a Levite's daughter who engages in forbidden relationships should not be allowed to partake of <i>terumah</i>, for it is uncommon for a woman to engage in forbidden relationships (<i>Yevamot</i> 91a).</i> or she engaged in forbidden relations, she can be given tithes and she may partake of it. When, however, there was a report that a woman's husband died or one witness testified that he died, she married<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, she did not marry, she is not forbidden, even if she was consecrated by another man.</i> and then her husband appeared, our Sages penalized her and ruled that she is forbidden to partake of the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this is a Rabbinic decree, enacted to maintain the moral level of the Jewish people.</i>
The Levites and the priests should separate the first tithe so that they can separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the priests and the Levites are allowed to keep the tithes, one might ask: Why is it necessary for them to separate it at the outset? The Rambam answers that the separation is necessary, because until <i>terumat ma'aser</i> is separated from the tithes, it is forbidden to partake of them.</i> Similarly, the priests must separate other types of <i>terumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">With the expression "other types of <i>terumah</i>," the Rambam includes <i>challah</i> and <i>bikkurim</i>. See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:20.</i> and tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The intent is only the first tithe. The second tithe and the tithe for the poor are not given to the priests.</i> for themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">They may not, however, partake of the produce without making these separations as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> Since the priests receive all types of agricultural gifts, is it possible for them to partake of the produce without these separations having been made? [Numbers 18:28] states: "And so shall you separate, also you...." "You" includes the Levites. "Also you" includes the priests.
We do not expropriate the tithes from the priests, as [<i>ibid.</i>:26] states: "When you take from the children of Israel...."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from an Israelite and not from a priest.</i> Similarly, none of the presents given to the priests must be given from one priest to another priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A priest must separate the presents. He need not, however, give them to another priest, but instead may keep them for himself.</i><br>Ezra penalized the Levites in his time<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">There are some who interpret the Rambam as implying that the penalty was applied only in Ezra's era, but not in subsequent generations. Indeed, we find that even Sages gave their tithes to Levites (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:9). For this reason, it appears that Ezra's penalty was that if there was both a priest and a Levite present, the tithes should be given to a priest, but they could also be given to a Levite (Radbaz). Alternatively, in Ezra's generation, the tithes should be given only to the priests. Subsequently, however, when more Levites ascended and settled in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the decree was rescinded and tithes could also be given to the Levites. Nevertheless, in order not to nullify Ezra's words entirely, it was still possible to give the tithes to the priests (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). [Note, however, the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:15) which indicates that the tithes were given to the priests in the generations after Ezra as well. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 11:14.] All agree that the Levites themselves were never required to give the tithes to the priests.<br>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 395) asks: How was it possible for Ezra to nullify the Torah's command? For the Scriptural obligation is to give the tithes to the priests. He answers that in Ezra's time, the mitzvah to tithe was only Rabbinic in origin (see <i>Hilchot Terumot</i>, ch. 1). Hence, it was possible for him to make the priests the recipients.</i> because they did not ascend to Jerusalem with him<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezra 8:15 which states that the descendants of the Levites were not found among the people who returned to Israel from Babylon. There were many among the Jewish people who had achieved financial security and comfortable living circumstances in Babylon and did not want to give this up to live in the Holy Land. Nevertheless, aside from the Levites, there was no distinct group that did not return to Israel in significant numbers.</i> and ordained that the first tithe should be given solely to the priests.
When a person partakes of his produce while it is <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., before <i>terumah</i> and the tithes have been separated.</i> or a Levite partakes of the tithes while they are <i>tevel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., before <i>terumat ma'aser</i> has been separated.</i> although they are liable for death at the hand of Heaven,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Se <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 10:19.</i> they are not liable to make reimbursement to the owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the priests (or the Levites) who would be given the <i>terumah</i> or the tithes. With regard to <i>terumah</i>, by contrast, when a person partakes of <i>terumah</i> unknowingly, he is required to make restitution. See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 6:6.</i> [This is derived from <i>ibid.</i>:24:] "...that they will separate to God." [Implied is that the recipients] do not have any share in them until they have been separated.<br>In the Diaspora,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In the lands directly bordering on <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> where our Sages ordained that the agricultural laws be observed. See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:6.</i> it is permitted for a person to continue eating and afterwards, separate <i>terumah</i> and the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since the obligation to make these separations from the crops is Rabbinic in origin, our Sages granted this leniency. See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:21.</i>
We can separate tithes from produce in one place for produce in another place. They need not be grouped together.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to <i>terumah</i>, in which instance, the initial preference is to separate the <i>terumah</i> from the same produce for which it is being taken (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 3:17).</i> We do not, however, separate tithes from one species for another species,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This holds true for <i>terumah</i> as well, as stated in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 5:3.</i> nor from produce for which we are obligated to separate tithes for produce from which we are exempt from separating, nor from produce for which we are exempt from separating tithes for produce from which such a separation is required.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This also applies with regard to <i>terumah</i>, see <i>ibid.</i>:2, 12.</i> If one made a separation in any of the above instances, [the produce separated] is not considered as tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">It need not be given to a Levite and if necessary, new tithes must be separated.</i>
Whenever we said with regard to <i>terumah</i>, that <i>terumah</i> may not be separated from one type of produce for another,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., produce that has been reaped for produce that is attached to the ground (<i>ibid.</i>:9), produce reaped in one year for produce reaped in another year (<i>ibid.</i>:11), or produce from the Diaspora for produce from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:12).</i> tithes may not be separated from one such type of produce for another such type. And whenever we said that the separation of <i>terumah</i> from [one type of produce] is acceptable [after the fact],<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., instances where a separation of <i>terumah</i> is undesirable, nevertheless, after the fact, it is acceptable. For example, one separated produce for which all the work concerning it was not completed (<i>ibid.</i>:4); one separates lower grade produce as <i>terumah</i> for higher grade produce (<i>ibid.</i>:8); or one unknowingly separated impure produce as <i>terumah</i> for pure produce.</i> if one separated tithes from such produce, it is acceptable. Whenever produce is exempt from the obligation to have <i>terumah</i> separated,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For example, produce not fit for human consumption (<i>ibid.</i> 2:1); produce that was <i>leket, pe'ah</i>, or the like (<i>ibid.</i>:9).</i> it is also exempt from the obligation to have tithes separated. All those individuals who may separate <i>terumah</i> may separate the tithes. And all those concerning whom it was said that they should not separate <i>terumah</i>, but if they did separate it, the separation is effective,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A person who is deaf, but not mute, a mute who can hear, but not speak, a person who is naked, a person who is drunk and a blind person (<i>ibid.</i> 4:4).</i> so too, if they separate the tithes, the separation is effective. And whenever a person's separation of <i>terumah</i> is not effective,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A deaf-mute, a mentally or emotionally unstable person, a minor, a gentile who separated <i>terumah</i> from produce belonging to a Jew, even with his permission, and a person who separate <i>terumah</i> from produce that does not belong to him without the owner's permission (<i>ibid.</i>:2).</i> his separation of tithes is also not effective.
When a person tells a colleague: "I will tithe through your agency," he does not have to stand with him to see whether he tithed or did not tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since he willingly appointed him as an agent, we assume that he relies on him and can follow the accepted presumption that an agent will carry out the task assigned to him. [Our translation and commentary follow the gloss of the Radbaz. Others offer different interpretations.]</i> If [the agent] tells a colleague: "Tithe using me as an agent," he must stand with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since he did not appoint him voluntarily, we are not certain that he will carry out the agency in good faith.</i>
The obligation to tithe carobs is only Rabbinic in origin,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that according to Scriptural Law, the only trees from which we are required to separate the tithes are grapes and olives. As explained in the notes to <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 2:1, this is a difference of opinion involving many authorities.</i> for they are not eaten by most people.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 1:3, it appears that here the Rambam is speaking of carobs that grow in Tzalmona or other species that are usually not eaten. The carobs that grow commonly and are eaten by many must be tithes according to Scriptural Law.<br>Those that grow in Tzalmona and the like are also eaten by some people. Hence the Rabbis ordained that they be tithed. Species of produce that are not usually consumed by people are exempt, as stated in the following clause.</i> Bitter almonds, whether large or small,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">When such almonds are small, they are not bitter. Nevertheless, they are still unfit to be eaten because they have not fully matured (see Rashi, <i>Chullin</i> 25b).</i> are exempt, for they are not considered food.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Even though some may partake of them, the majority do not. Indeed, the minority is so insignificant that we do not require a separation of <i>terumah</i> even according to Rabbinic Law.</i>
A tree that is planted inside a house is exempt from the obligations of the tithes, as [indicated by Deuteronomy 14:22]: "You shall certainly tithe all the produce of your crops that grow in the <b>field</b>."<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">It is produce of the field from which we must tithe (the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Orlah</i> 1:2).</i> It appears to me that tithes must be separated from this produce according to Rabbinic Law, for one is required to tithe the fruit of a fig tree that stands in a courtyard if it was harvested at one time.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the fruit is picked one by one, a person is not obligated to tithe it.<br>This law is stated in the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 3:8). Now a courtyard is not considered a field. Hence in order that this law not contradict the law cited from the Jerusalem Talmud, we must assume that the Mishnah is speaking according to Rabbinic Law, while the Jerusalem Talmud is speaking according to Scriptural Law. The Ra'avad differs with this ruling and differentiates between produce growing in a courtyard and that which grows in a house. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's ruling.</i>
When onions [stored in a home] grew roots next to each other, even if they grew roots in the earth of a loft, they are exempt from tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are exempt according to Scriptural Law, and even according to Rabbinic Law, there is no obligation to separate tithes, because the person would not desire to have the plants grow (<i>Or Sameach</i>).</i> If a landslide covered them,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Destroying the roof of the loft.</i> and they are thus open [to the skies], it is as if they have been planted in the field and one is obligated to tithe them.
[The following laws apply when someone is] protecting his field because of grapes<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is speaking about an instance where the figs and the other fruits growing in the field have for the most part been harvested. There were, however, a few figs left growing in scattered places around the field. The grapes, however, grow later than the other crops and hence, had not been harvested yet. The owner was protecting his field for the sake of his grapes. The question is: Are the other fruits considered as ownerless because the owner is no longer primarily concerned with them? Or do we say that since he is guarding his field because of the grapes, he is also guarding the other produce?</i> and another person comes and collects the figs that remain in that field or he was guarding his field because of the zucchini and squash<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Which grow even later than grapes.</i> and another person came and gathered the grapes which were scattered in the field. When [it is known] that the owner of the field is concerned with the leftover produce, it is forbidden to take it; [doing so] is stealing.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it has little value. We are forbidden to take even the slightest amount of a colleague's property against his will.</i> Hence, tithes and <i>terumah</i> must be separated from the crops. If the owner of the field is not concerned with it, it is permitted [to take it;<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">It is as if he has declared them ownerless (Radbaz). See a parallel ruling in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 5:8.</i> it is not] theft. Hence, they are exempt from the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For ownerless produce need not be tithed. Similarly, <i>terumah</i> need not be separated from it (Radbaz, based on <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 2:11).</i>
Only the most choice produce should be separated as tithes,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The same concept applies with regard to <i>terumah</i>, as stated in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 2:4,6.</i> as [Numbers 18:30] states: "When you separate the choice portion from it, and it will be considered for the Levites<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This is both the correct wording of the verse and the manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The standard printed text is in error.</i> as the produce of the grainheap and the produce of the vat." Just as the Levites must separate the choicest portions of the tithes, the Israelites who separate from the grainheap and the vat separate the choicest portions.
We may not separate tithes by estimation.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Avot</i> 1:16. In contrast <i>terumah</i> should be separated in this manner (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 3:4).</i> Instead, one must do so through measuring,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The volume of the produce.</i> weight, or number.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The order of preference is number, volume, weight. See <i>Terumot</i> 4:6.</i> One who is precise in the measurement is praiseworthy. When one gives an extra amount as the tithes, his tithes are flawed, because untithed produce is mixed with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For the extra amount of produce is not tithes, because the tithes represent an exact sum. Nor is it considered ordinary produce from which tithes were separated, because it was placed with the tithes. Instead, it is considered as ordinary produce from which tithes were not separated.</i> [The remainder of] his produce has, however, been made fit for use.
When a person separates a portion of the tithes, they are not considered as tithes. Instead, it is as if someone divided the grainheap. He must, however, separate from the portion set aside the tithes that are appropriate for it.<br>What is implied? A person had 100 <i>se'ah</i>. He set aside five <i>se'ah</i> as the tithes. [These five <i>se'ah</i>] are not considered as tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">For giving them does not fulfill the requirement.</i> He cannot separate tithes for [these five <i>se'ah</i>] from another source.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Although usually, one may set aside tithes from one collection of produce for another (Halachah 6), an exception is made in this instance, because he originally separated this produce with the intent that it be tithes [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Terumot</i> 4:1)]. it would appear that one is separating tithes from produce for which one is required to separate tithes for produce for which one is not obligated to make such a separation (see notes to Halachah 7). The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam concerning this ruling, advancing a different interpretation of <i>Terumot</i> 4:1.</i> Instead, he should separate half a <i>se'ah</i> from them. It is their tithes.
When a person separates the [first] tithe, he should recite a blessing first, as one recites a blessing [before observing] any of the mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:6, 12; <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 2:16.</i> Similarly, he should recite a blessing [before separating] the second tithe, the tithe given to the poor, and the tithe of a tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <i>terumat ma'aser</i>.</i> He should recite a blessing for each one individually. If he made all the separations one directly after the other without speaking in between, he should include them all in one blessing, [praising God who commanded us] "to separate the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes."<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This applies if one sets aside <i>terumah</i> and tithes for his own produce. If he sets it aside for others, he should conclude the blessing "concerning the separation of tithes" (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:12-13).</i>

Chapter 2

A person is not obligated to tithe his produce by Scriptural Law unless he completes [the work associated with its preparation<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">At which point the obligation to tithe takes effect (Chapter 3, Halachah 1).</i> with the intent of] partaking of it himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Akiva Eiger and the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (mitzvah 395) explain that even if the person changes his mind and desires to sell the produce afterwards, he remains obligated to tithe.</i> If, however, he completes those tasks with the intent of selling it, he is exempt according to Scriptural Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If the person changes his mind and desires to partake of the produce himself afterwards, he is not obligated according to Scriptural Law. Since he was not obligated at the time of the initial requirement, he does not become obligated afterwards (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> He is, however, obligated by Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages adopted this measure as a safeguard. Ignoring it can have serious repercussions as <i>Bava Metzia</i> 88a states the shopping area of Beit Hino was destroyed three years before Jerusalem because they did not tithe produce that was sold in the marketplace.</i> [This is derived from Deuteronomy 14:22:] "And you shall certainly tithe... and you shall partake...." One is obligated only when he completes the tasks with the intent of partaking.
Similarly, one who purchases such produce is exempt according to Scriptural Law, [for <i>ibid.</i> states]: "the produce of your crops."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., crops that you made ready for use.</i> He is, however, obligated according to Rabbinic Law.<br>When does the above apply? When he purchased it after the work necessary to prepare it was completed while it was in the possession of the seller. If, however, these tasks were completed while it was in the possession of the purchaser, he is obligated to tithe according to Scriptural Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, maintaining that the purchaser of the produce is never liable to tithe according to Scriptural Law. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite interpretations of Talmudic passages that support the Rambam's position, but explain that there are other <i>Rishonim</i> who follow the Ra'avad's position.</i>
Produce which is not fit to be eaten because it is too small, e.g., unripened produce<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 4:8).</i> and the like, is not required to be tithed<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Even according to Rabbinic decree.</i> until it grows and becomes food, as [implied by Leviticus 27:30 which states that we must tithe:] "From the crops of the earth, from the fruit of the trees," i.e., [there is no requirement to tithe the crops] until they grow and become fruit. Similar concepts apply with regard to grain and legumes, as [implied by Deuteronomy 14:22:] "the produce of your crops," i.e., [there is no obligation] until it becomes produce.<br>This refers to the "phase of tithing."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachot and Chapter 3 which discusses this subject in detail.</i> Before grain and fruit reach this phase, one is permitted to eat as much as one wants from them,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For this is not considered as the ordinary way of eating.</i> in any manner he desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he may even salt them and roast them, even though these actions bring about the obligation to tithe when fruit has matured (Chapter 3, Halachah 3).</i>
Produce that is fit to be eaten when it is small, e.g., zucchini or cucumbers, but is left [to grow] only in order to increase its bulk, is required to be tithed while it is small, [for] they are fit to be eaten at the outset. As soon as they emerge, they are considered to have reached the "phase of tithing."
When is "the phase of tithing"? When the produce will reach a stage that it produces seed [that could] grow, each species according to its nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Our Rabbis interpreted this as meaning reaching a third of its natural growth. All the examples mentioned in the continuation of the halachah refer to this stage of growth as it applies to each individual species.</i><br>What is implied? For figs, it is when they become soft enough to be fit to be eaten within 24 hours after they have been harvested.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if one partakes of them within 24 hours from their harvest without tithing them, he is not liable, for they are not ready to be eaten yet (<i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>).</i> For grapes and <i>biushim</i>, i.e., thin wild grapes, it is when their seeds can be seen from the outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">That indicates that their shell has softened and the fluid has been generated within the fruit. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 1:2).</i> For pomegranates, it is when their seed<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on authentic manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and is reinforced by the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>). The standard printed text reads slightly differently.</i> will be crushed easily between one's fingers and produce liquid. For dates, it is when they swell like yeast.<br>For peaches, it is when red strands appear within them.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This is a sign that they have begun to ripen (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> For nuts, it is when the fruit becomes distinct from its outer shell. For sweet almonds, it is when their external shell becomes distinct. Bitter [almonds] are always exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 9, and notes.</i> For other fruits with shells, e.g., acorns, chestnuts, and pistachios, it is when the lower shell that is next to the fruit forms.<br>For olives, when they produce one ninth of the amount of oil that they will produce when they are entirely ripe;<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling based on a different version of <i>Sh'vi'it</i> 4:7. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's ruling.</i> this is one third of their growth. For apples and <i>esrogim</i>, it is when they become round,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Ma'aserot</i> 1:4 states that we are required to separate tithes from apples when they are small, it does not mention a stage of development. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the source for the Rambam's statements.</i> for they are fit to be eaten when they are small. For berries and sumac, it is when they become red. Similarly, for every fruit that becomes red, it is when it becomes red.<br>For carobs, it is when black spots begin to appear. Similarly, for any fruit that becomes black, it is when spots begin to appear. For pears, small pears,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is the common translation of these terms. In his notes to the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kilayim</i> 1:4), however, Rav Kapach suggests that the two terms may refer to apricots and peaches.</i> quince, and thorn apples,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on Rav Kapach's notes to the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 1:1).</i> it is when their hairs begin to fall off.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">When these fruits are unripened, they are covered by a fuzz of hair.

Since one grape has already ripened sufficiently, the others will ripen shortly thereafter.</i> It is as if the entire cluster reached that stage of development. [Indeed,] not only that cluster, but the entire side of the vine on which that cluster grew [is considered to have reached the stage when the tithes must be separated].

Chapter 3

When produce has reached the "phase of tithing,"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachot 3-5, which also dwell on this subject.</i> it was detached [from the earth], but the work preparing it was not completed, e.g., grain that he harvested and threshed, but [the reaper] did not winnow it or straighten the grain pile, he may partake of it as a snack<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to Scriptural Law, there are no restrictions at all on partaking of this produce. Nevertheless, our Sages only allowed one to partake of it as a snack. They, however, did not allow him to partake of it as part of a significant meal (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 31a).</i> [without tithing] until those tasks are completed. Once those tasks are completed, it is forbidden to partake of it as a snack [without tithing].
When does the above apply? When one is completing the work [necessary to prepare] the produce to be sold in the market place. If, however, his intent was to bring it to his home,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between the two instances can be explained as follows: If he intends to sell it, then he will sell it when he meets a purchaser even before taking it to the marketplace. And the produce must be tithed before it is sold. Hence, as soon as the work associated with it is completed, he must tithe it. In contrast, when he intends to bring the produce home, everything is dependent on his own intent. Hence, he is given this leniency [the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 1:5)].<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that since the Torah mentions grain from the grainheap and wine from the vat, the obligation to tithe these types of produces takes effect when they are in the grainheap and the vat. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's ruling and it is cited as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:82).</i> he may partake of it as a snack [even] after the work involving it is completed until a situation occurs which obligates the separation of tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The definition of such acts is the subject of the following halachot.</i>
Six situations<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad asks why the Rambam does not mention pickling, for that is also cited by the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 4:1). According to the Rambam, that act is including in salting, because he interprets the mishnah as meaning pickling in brine (see his Commentary to the Mishnah). It is, nevertheless, difficult why the mishnah mentions salting and pickling as separate activities. Note, however, Chapter 5, Halachah 14, which could also be interpreted as referring to pickling in vinegar.</i> obligate the separation of tithes from produce:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Accoridng to Rabbinic Law. With regard to Scriptural Law, see the following chapter.</i> [bringing it into] a courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A courtyard that is protected (Chapter 4, Halachah 8). Here the intent of mentioning a courtyard is to refer to any dwelling as explained in Chapter 4.</i> a transaction,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 1ff.</i> [subjecting it to] fire,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5, Halachah 14.</i> salting it,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:18.</i> separating <i>terumah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:19.</i> and [the commencement of] the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>:20.</i> These situations require the separation of tithes only when the work necessary to prepare the produce has been completed.
What is implied? One may eat a snack from produce which he intends to bring home [without tithing], even though the work necessary to prepare it has been completed until he enters his home. Once he enters his home,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Or even, as indicated in the previous halachah, it is brought into a courtyard that serves the home.</i> the obligation to separate tithes takes effect and he is forbidden to partake of it<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Even partaking from it as a snack is forbidden.</i> until he tithes it.<br>Similarly, if he sold it, cooked it by fire, pickled it in salt, separated <i>terumah</i> from it, or the Sabbath commenced, he may not partake of it until he separates the tithes even though it has not reached the house.<br>If he brought the produce into his home before he completed the work associated with it, he may continue to snack from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 6.</i> If he began to complete the work associated with its completion, he is obligated to tithe the entire amount.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Not only the portion for which he completed the work.</i><br>What is implied? A person brought zucchini and squash home before he rubbed them [to remove the hairs on their surface]. Once he begins rubbing one of them, he is obligated to tithe all of them. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>Similarly, when one separates <i>terumah</i> from produce for which all the tasks necessary to prepare it have not been completed, it is permitted to snack from them with the exception of a basket of figs.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Neither here, nor in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 2:4), does the Rambam explain why figs are singled out from other fruit. The Radbaz quotes the gloss of Rabbenu Shimshon as stating that the intent is not only figs, but all fruit that is set aside for drying. Even though one's original intent is that the fruit be dried, since it is home and it is in a basket, it may be served at any time. Therefore, it is necessary to tithe it.</i> If one separates <i>terumah</i> from them before the work associated with preparing them is finished, the obligation to tithe takes effect.
[The following laws apply if] fig-branches to which figs were still attached or date fronds to which dates were still attached<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since the fruit was not removed from the branches, it is considered as if the tasks preparing this fruit are not completed.</i> were brought home. If children or workers brought them [to a person's home], the obligation to tithe does not yet take effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since the produce is not their own, their intent in bringing the branches in is not significant.</i> If the owner of the home brought them, he is obligated to tithe them.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For the fact that he brings them home indicates that from his perspective, all work has been completed.</i><br>If he brought in stalks of grain to make dough, the obligation to tithe does not take effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For he will be performing further work to prepare the grain for produce.</i> If he intended to eat them as kernels, it does take effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In such an instance, the kernels are basically ready to be eaten and bringing them home is considered as collecting them in a grainheap.</i> When does the above apply? With regard to grain. With regard to legumes, the obligation to tithe does not take effect [in that instance].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For the kernels of legumes are generally not collected to be eaten at this stage of preparation and hence, there is no obligation to tithe.</i>
It is permitted to be crafty and bring [grain that has been harvested] into one's home while it still has its outer shell<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., without having threshed it or winnowed it.</i> so that one's livestock can partake of it<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Feeding one's livestock is considered equivalent to eating a snack. Note, however, Halachah 20 which could qualify this statement (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and thus it is exempt from tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since the work to prepare it for human consumption has not been completed.<br>The reason for this leniency is that according to Scriptural Law, there is no obligation to tithe until all the tasks associated with the produce are completed and it is brought within a home.

Moreover, he can perform this activity several times. Different laws apply with regard to humans. They may snack from such produce, but may not partake of a significant amount of it (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:114).</i> He is thus exempt from [the obligation to separate] <i>terumah</i> and tithes forever, since he has not begun to complete [the tasks necessary to prepare] the entire [harvest].
When a person completes the task necessary to process a colleague's produce without his knowledge or he brings the produce to one of the six situations<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., those described in Halachah 3. In particular, the Radbaz asks questions concerning two of those situations: selling the produce and the commencement of the Sabbath. Seemingly, a sale cannot be made without the owner's consent and the Sabbath is not dependent on the other person's activity. The Radbaz explains that with regard to a sale, we are speaking about an instance where afterwards the owner consented to the sale. And with regard to the Sabbath, we are speaking about a situation where the other person completed the work associated with the produce before the Sabbath commenced. Thus when the Sabbath commenced, the produce was fit to be ready to be obligated in the tithes.</i> that establish an obligation to tithe without [the owner's] knowledge, [this produce] incurs the obligation to be tithed.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For the produce has reached the stage when it is necessary to tithe it. This is not dependent on the owner's intent.</i>
What is meant by completing the work associated with produce? For zucchini, squash, and watermelon, it is when one rubs them with his hands and removes the golden hairs upon them. If he does not rub them,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For there are those who do not make these preparatory steps, but rather sell the fruit as is.</i> it is when he makes a pile. For a watermelon,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For it is not common to make a pile of watermelons.</i> it is when he arranges them in a designated place, one watermelon next to another. If one rubs the fruit one by one, when he completed [rubbing] all that he needed, that [specific produce] is considered as if the tasks necessary to prepare it were completed.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">And it alone must be tithed (Radbaz).<br>The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that in Halachah 4, the Rambam states that as soon as he rubs the hair off one fruit or vegetable, the entire quantity is required to be tithed, while in this halachah, he states that only those he seeks to use immediately must be tithed. Among the resolutions they offer are:<br>a) in Halachah 4, the person's intent is to prepare the entire quantity of produce. Therefore, as soon as he begins, that entire quantity must be tithed. Here, he only desires to prepare a limited quantity. Hence, it is only the quantity that he actually prepares that must be tithed.<br>b) Halachah 4 speaks about an instance when he prepares them in his home, while this halachah speaks about preparing them in the field to bring home.</i> We may separate <i>terumah</i> from zucchini and squash even though the hairs have not been removed from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this is allowed as an initial preference. The Radbaz explains that although the Rambam mentions only the separation of <i>terumah</i>, he also means the separation of the tithes, because it is unfeasible to think that <i>terumah</i> should be separated but not the tithes.</i>
For vegetables that are [sold while] bound together,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., like garlic or onions that are woven together.</i> it is when they are bound together. If the vegetables are not bound together, it is when the container is full. If he does not fill the container, he may snack from the produce until he gathers all that he needs.
For a basket [of produce], it is when the produce will be covered by leaves, straw, and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 1:5), it appears that after reapers would gather fruit, they would cover it with leaves or straw to protect it from the sun.</i> If he does not cover it, it is when the container is full. If he does not fill the container, it is when he gathers all that he needs.
[When a person is gathering produce] in a large container, but he desires to fill only a portion of it, once he fills that portion, [the produce] must be tithed. If he intends to fill the entire container, [the produce is] not required to be tithed until he fills the entire container. If he has two containers and desires to fill both of them, [the produce is] not required to be tithed until he fills both of them.
When a person made a large weave of vegetables in the field, the obligation to tithe takes effect<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">For the work in the field associated with their preparation has been completed.</i> even though he intended to [undo the larger weave and] make a smaller weave for the marketplace.<br>Dried pomegranate seeds, raisins, and carobs, [become obligated to be tithed] when a person sets up a pile on top of his roof. Onions [become obligated] when one removes the leaves and shells that he would generally discard. If he does not remove them, [there is no obligation to tithe the onions], until one stores them in a pile.
Grain [becomes obligated] when one is <i>mimareach</i> it. What is meant by <i>mimareach</i>? When one straightens the surface of the grainheap with a pitchfork at the conclusion of the entire process, as one would do when he concludes all his work.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is obvious that the person's intent is not to add other sheathes to the grain heap. Significantly, the Rambam's definition here is slightly different than the definition he gives in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 1:6).</i> If a person is not <i>mimareach</i>, [the obligation takes effect], when he makes a pile.<br>Legumes [become obligated] when one sifts them<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For it is common for pebbles to become mixed together with legumes and the legumes are sifted to remove them.</i> and takes them from under the sifter and partakes of them. If he does not sift them, [the obligation takes effect when] he is <i>mimareach</i>.<br>Even though he is <i>mimareach</i>, it is permitted to take from the scattered stalks,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 1:6).</i> those on the side, and the kernels that are in the straw, and partake of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This is considered as a snack and hence, tithes are not required.</i>
Wine [becomes obligated] when it is stored in a barrel and the peels and seeds are removed from the top of the barrel. When, however, it is in the vat and one takes out some to put it in a barrel, one may drink from it casually.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., drink the equivalent of a snack. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that when one takes the wine before it reaches the storage vat, one may drink from it without tithing even though he removes the peels and seeds.</i> Similarly, he may collect [wine] from the upper vat,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the place where the grapes were crushed to produce wine (<i>ibid.</i>:7).</i> from a conduit, or from any place and drink it [without tithing].
Oil [becomes obligated] when it descends to the vat.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The storage pit (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> Even though it has descended, one may take from the rope basket,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that a basket was made of ropes and olives were placed within. Afterwards, they would press the olives in that basket. The translation of the two terms that follow are also from the same source.</i> the stone [used to grind the olives], the boards or stones of the olive press. One may place [untithed] oil into cooked food in a small dish or a large pot even though [the food] is hot, because it will not cook in a secondary vessel.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The term "secondary vessel" refers to a utensil in which hot food was placed after it was removed from a fire. The Rambam is referring to the following difficulty. As stated in Halachah 3, subjecting produce to fire establishes an obligation to tithe. Thus as the Rambam states in Chapter 5, Halachah 16, if a person places oil into a pot that is on the fire or just removed from the fire, the obligation to tithe is established. In the instance described in our halachah, that is not the case, because food will not cook in a secondary vessel.</i> If [the food] was very hot, so much so that one's hand would burn, he should not put [untithed oil] into it, because it will be cooked.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">And an obligation to tithe will have been established. The Radbaz explains that this clause is not speaking about a secondary vessel, because a secondary vessel never cooks (<i>Shabbat</i> 40b). Alternatively, the laws of cooking are different with regard to the establishment of an obligation to tithe than with regard to the Sabbath laws or the laws of Kashrut. In this instance, when a secondary vessel is very hot, it can be considered as having cooked.</i>
A cake of dried figs [becomes obligated] when it is smoothed. Dried figs [become obligated] when they become crushed [into the container in which they will be stored].<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is taken from the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 1:8).</i> If they were placed in a storage container, [they become obligated] when one smoothes out the surface of the storage container by hand. If one was crushing dried figs into a jug or into a cake at the opening of a storage container and the jug becomes broken or the storage container is opened, he should not partake of [the figs] until they are tithed.
When figs and grapes have been set aside [to dry], it is permitted to snack from them in the place where they were set aside.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Since they have not been dried out, it is considered as if the tasks necessary to prepare them have not been completed.</i> If, however, he took some from the place where they were set aside, he should not snack from them, because the tasks involved [in their preparation] have been completed, even though they have not dried out totally.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., moving them causes it to be considered as if the tasks have been completed.</i>
Carobs [become obligated] when he collects them on top of the roof to dry.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Since he will ultimately do so, until he does so, the tasks associated with their preparation have not been completed.</i> He may take some down [from the roof] for fodder for his livestock. He is exempt [from tithing],<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he has brought the produce into his courtyard.</i> because he will put back what is left over. He is thus using it as fodder as a temporary measure.
When a person separated the first tithe while the produce was still in stalks,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Before it was threshed.</i> it is forbidden to partake of it until <i>terumat ma'aser</i> is separated from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">There is, however, no necessity to separate the great <i>terumah</i>.

Just as it is permitted to partake of produce as a snack when the work [involved in its preparation] has not been completed,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 1.</i> so too, it is permitted to feed such produce to animals, livestock, and fowl as one desires.

It is permitted to feed an animal <i>tevel</i> in an insignificant manner, even in one's home.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions this ruling based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 1:6) which quotes Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar as stating that once produce is brought into a person's courtyard (i.e., his residence), it cannot be fed to an animal without tithing. The Radbaz explains that according to the Rambam, our Sages differ with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar on this point and do not require tithing. The rationale is that since the entire obligation to tithe animal fodder is Rabbinic in origin, this obligation was instituted only when the animal was fed a significant amount.</i> One can feed [an animal] rolls of <i>chilba</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the <i>Rambam LeAm</i>.

Similarly, if he found broken pieces of cakes of dried figs, it should be considered as if they came from produce for which the work involved in its preparation was completed.

Nevertheless, since they lead to and/or are auxiliaries to an area that is considered part of a permanent dwelling, they are considered as part of that dwelling.<br>The Radbaz notes that in Halachah 4 and in the following halachah, the Rambam states that bringing produce into a potter's outer <i>sukkah</i> does not create an obligation, while bringing it into the inner <i>sukkah</i> does. Why don't we, he asks, apply the same principle? Let us say that the outer <i>sukkah</i> is an entrance and/or auxiliary to the inner one. He explains that for the inner <i>sukkah</i> to create an obligation is itself a new development and the obligation is not strong enough to be extended to the outer <i>sukkah</i>.</i> If [bringing produce into] a courtyard would establish an obligation to tithe, [bringing produce into these] establishes an obligation.

He also cites a version of the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 2:10) which supports his understanding.<br>Rav Yosef Korcus offers two justifications for the Rambam's ruling. First of all, he states that the phrase "he should not partake of them" could be interpreted as referring to the owner of the courtyard and not to the owner of the produce. Alternatively, he explains that even if it refers to the owner of the produce, since the courtyard he brings it into is part of a permanent dwelling, he should not partake of it until he tithes it. Leniency was given to traveling salesmen (Halachah 13), because they brought the produce into the courtyard with the intent of removing it immediately. In this instance, however, the owner does not necessarily intend to remove it immediately. Why then should he not be obligated to tithe?<br>In his gloss to Chapter 5, Halachah 8, the Ra'avad notes a seeming contradiction to the Rambam's ruling here. In his gloss to that halachah, the Radbaz explains that the stringency here is to correct a misimpression that might result in the eyes of an observer. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, finds the Rambam's rulings difficult to reconcile and suggests that there is a printing error here.<br>Nevertheless, Rav Yosef Korcus continues, the Rambam's statements appear to be self-contradictory, because in the previous clause it appears that if one brings produce into a home after forgetting, he is not obligated to tithe it, but this clause states that if he brings it into his colleague's courtyard, he is. Seemingly, bringing it into one's own home would be a stronger factor than bringing it into a colleague's courtyard. Among the resolutions he offers is that when a person forgets and brings the produce into his own home, he is certainly acting inadvertently, without intent. If, however, he brings it into his colleague's courtyard, that could be considered as a conscious change of mind.</i>
When a courtyard has been plowed, it is considered like a garden<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is no longer considered as an extension of the home, but as a separate entity like a field.</i> and one may snack in it.

He explains that the Rambam used an incorrect version of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 3:10). For the Rambam's version of that passage conflicts with the rulings of <i>Eruvin</i> 23a regarding <i>eruvin</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the obligations of <i>eruvin</i> and tithes are governed by different principles and deductions cannot necessarily be made from one situation to the other.</i> If he planted trees in the courtyard to make it attractive,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This indicates that he is not intending to uproot them and return the area to the function of an ordinary courtyard.

When a person tells a colleague: "Here is an <i>isar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A coin used in the Talmudic era of moderate value.</i> and give me five figs for it," he may eat them one by one and he is exempt [from the obligation to tithe].

When a person exchanges [produce]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 5:1, an exchange is considered as equivalent to a sale.</i> with a colleague and each have the intent of eating, an obligation has been established to tithe both lots of produce, for they have been purchased while detached.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is forbidden even to snack from them.</i> [If they are exchanged while attached, with] each one having to reap the other's crops, an obligation has not been established for either of them, for a sale does not establish an obligation [to tithe] unless the work associated with its preparation is completed as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 3, Halachah 3.</i><br>If one purchased produce to eat<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., detached produce.</i> in an exchange and the other purchased produce to reap in the same exchange, the one who purchased produce to eat is obligated to tithe, while the obligation to tithe has not been established for the one who purchased produce to reap.
When a person tells a colleague: "Go out and gather 20 figs of mine for yourself<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the produce is on the trees and it does not become the other person's until he picks it.</i> and I will fill my gut with your produce," both are exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that the person who partakes of a particular number of figs is obligated to tithe them.

[Giving produce as] a present does not establish an obligation to tithe as a sale does.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">There are certain dimensions of Jewish business law in which a present is considered as a sale and others in which it is not (see <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 9:13; <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 29:14). The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 2:1) states that even those authorities who maintain that giving a present should be considered as a sale (see <i>Hilchot Shemitah VeYoval</i> 11:19) agree that this stringency should not be enforced in the present age, because in the present age, the obligation to tithe is of Rabbinic origin. The Rambam mentions this leniency without differentiating between the era when the obligation to tithe was Scriptural and the present age, because he maintains that the entire obligation to tithe produce obtained through purchase is of Rabbinic origin.</i> When a common person<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Who is not necessarily relied upon with regard to tithes.</i> is passing through the marketplace and saying: "Take figs,"<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">As presents [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 2:1)].</i> one may partake of them<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As a snack.</i> and one is exempt [from the obligation to tithe], for a present does not establish such an obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For we assume that the produce has not been taken home and thus has not incurred the obligation to be tithed.

Furthermore, we proceed on the assumption that he has not taken the produce home yet and thus it never incurred the obligation to be tithed. Therefore when the recipients take it home, it incurs that obligation for the first time. Indeed, they must separate not only the tithes, but also <i>terumah</i>.</i> If most of the people take the produce directly to the market place, he should only make the separations<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">These separations must be made, for in such a situation, the produce incurs the obligation to be tithed after the work associated with its preparation was completed (see Chapter 3, Halachah 1).</i> as one does for <i>demai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained in Chapter 9, in the Second Temple period, the common people became somewhat lax with regard to the mitzvah of separating tithes. When they became aware of this situation, the Sages ordained that one should not partake of produce from a common person without tithing it, for perhaps he did not do so. One should not, however, recite a blessing, for it is possible that it was tithed. Similarly in this instance, it is possible that the common person tithed his produce, but it is possible that he did not.</i> for perhaps he tithed it and then brought it to the marketplace.<br>If [the common person] said: "Take them and bring them to your homes,"<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is assuring the recipients that they may take the produce home without qualms because it has already been tithed [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>)].</i> when one takes them home, he must tithe them as one tithes <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For we do not accept the common person's word (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> If [the common person] gave him a large amount of produce - even if he told him: "Take it and eat it,"<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Which could be interpreted as assurance that the produce had not been taken home by the common person and thus it has not yet been tithed.</i> - it is as if he told him, "Take it and bring it home."<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Because a large amount of produce will certainly not be eaten in the marketplace.

If there were two [prospective recipients] and [the common person] said to one: "Take it and partake of it [here in the marketplace]," and he told the other: "Take it and bring it home," the first may partake of it and be exempt [from the obligation to tithe],<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As in the first clause of the previous halachah.</i> while the second is obligated if he eats.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As in the later clause.

Similarly,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., here to, the above principles produce seemingly contradictory rulings.</i> if there were people sitting at the gate [of a courtyard] or in a store and [the common person] told them: "Take [this produce] and partake of it," they may partake of it<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As a snack.

[The following rules apply when one] hires workers to perform work with him concerning produce, whether produce that has been detached or that which is attached.

Instead, he is eating because of the Torah's license. Hence, he is not required to separate tithes (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:123).</i><br>[Different rules apply if the employer] agreed to a condition that allowed them to partake of produce to which the Torah did not entitle them, e.g., the worker stipulated that his son could partake of the produce with him, his son could partake of the produce as payment of his wages, or that he would be able to [continue] partaking of the produce which was harvested after the work [involved in its preparation] was completed, he is forbidden to partake of the produce until he tithes it. [The rationale is that] since he is partaking of the produce because of the condition, he is like a purchaser.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Who must tithe his produce as stated above.</i>
If [an employer] hired [a worker] to hoe around olive trees<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">To remove weeds so that the tree will grow better.

If he gathered them together, he is obligated to tithe. [The rationale is that] since he is eating a fixed measure, he is considered as a purchaser and [in such an instance,] if the produce is gathered together, his obligation to tithe is established.

When a person buries his produce in the ground, in straw, or in fertilizer before preparing them to be eaten,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains that when produce was picked before it was ripened, it would be buried in this manner to hasten its ripening and softening process.</i> the obligation to tithe them is not established.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Although this activity helps prepare them to be eaten, it is not considered as cooking or pickling (Radbaz; see also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, loc. cit.).</i>

If he mixes wine with hot water, he establishes an obligation to tithe. Needless to say, that if he cooks wine, even in the wine press, it is forbidden to drink from it unless he tithes it.
When garlic, cress, or mustard seed were crushed in the field and mixed with oil,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this applies whether the spices were untithed and the oil had been tithed previously or the oil was untithed and the spices had been tithed previously.</i> an obligation to tithe was established.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">If they were not brought home.

When a person salts produce in the field, an obligation to tithe is established.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 3.</i> If, however, he dips olives into salt one by one and eats them, he is exempt.

If, however, he salted [several] and served them, he is obligated [to tithe]. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
[Even though] a person separates <i>terumah</i> from his produce in a manner that requires him to make a second separation,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 5:14,15 which give examples of instances where a person made an improper separation of <i>terumah</i> and hence, was required to separate <i>terumah</i> a second time.</i> the obligation to tithe is established.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 3, Halachah 3, states that separating <i>terumah</i> creates an obligation to tithe the remaining produce.

When the work associated with the preparation of produce has been completed<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 3, the onset of the Sabbath establishes an obligation to tithe.

Now eating any food on the Sabbath is significant for it is a dimension of the mitzvah of <i>oneg Shabbat</i>, taking pleasure in the Sabbath. Hence, the obligation to tithe is established (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:127).</i> One may not partake of them<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Even a snack.</i> even after the Sabbath until they are tithed.
When children hid figs for the Sabbath and forgot to tithe them, one should not partake of them Saturday night until they are tithed.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">For the onset of the Sabbath establishes an obligation to tithe as above.<br>The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 4:2). The Jerusalem Talmud raises the question: Why is it necessary to state that the children were intending to partake of them on the Sabbath? Even if that was not their intent, the commencement of the Sabbath would have established the obligation to tithe. The Jerusalem Talmud answers that the new insight is that since it was children who hid the produce, it would be permitted to be eaten as a snack on Friday. If, however, adults set aside the produce for use on the Sabbath, it is not permitted to snack from it on Friday. See also <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:129.</i>
If there was a fig tree that was designated for one to partake of its produce on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Its figs were of a high quality and hence, set aside to be used on the Sabbath when one must use produce of the highest quality.</i> and one gathered a basket [of these figs], one may not partake of them<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Even during the week (Radbaz).</i> until he tithes them. [This stringency was established,] because these figs are designated for the Sabbath and the Sabbath establishes an obligation to tithe.
If a person was eating<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., snacking.

Indeed, it would be undesirable to do so, for it is improper to tithe produce that has already been tithed. Nevertheless, in this instance, there is an obligation to tithe. The rationale is that the new growth of the onions outweighs their initial mass and that initial mass is considered as <i>betal</i>, insignificant and subsumed in the greater whole. This concept is illustrated in other contexts; see <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 11:22; <i>Hilchot Shemitah</i> 4:21, <i>et al</i>.</i>

When a person rents a field from a gentile on the condition that he pay him a specific amount of produce, he must tithe the produce before giving it to him.

The Radbaz explains the difference between the two situations: When a person rents a field for a specific amount of produce, he usually does so as a last resort and receives only a minimal amount. Therefore, if there are restrictions made against him doing so, he may sell the land. When, by contrast, a person seeks a sharecropper, he is reserving the option to sow it himself. Hence, he is less likely to sell it.</i> In this way, the field will lie fallow [before the gentile]<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">For no one will seek to hire it from him.</i> and, of necessity, he will sell it to a Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">This and the measure mentioned in the following clause were part of the safeguards the Sages employed to uphold the Jews' possession of our Holy Land. For in the Roman era, gentiles would frequently seize Jewish property without cause. Rather than have it remain in the gentile's possession, our Sages desired that he be compelled to sell it back to a Jew.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 6:2), the Rambam states that this ruling applies only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, for it is only there that we are careful about land not being sold to a gentile. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:121), however, quotes this law without making that restriction. It is possible to explain that even in the Diaspora, there is a concept of maintaining the stability of the Jewish community by not giving up Jewish land to gentiles.</i><br>Similarly, when a person accepts his ancestral field from a gentile as a sharecropper,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the gentile seized a field which a Jew had inherited from his ancestors. Because of his connection to the field, the Jew desired to till it and promised to give the gentile a share under a sharecropping agreement.</i> he was penalized and required to tithe the produce before giving the gentile his share of produce after it was tithed. [This measure was instituted] so that a person should not jump at the opportunity to receive it because it was his ancestral field.

What is meant by a <i>chokar</i> and what is meant by a <i>mekabel</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">These terms refer to sharecroppers operating under different types of agreements.</i> A <i>chokar</i> hires the field for a specific amount of produce - these-and-these many <i>se'ah</i> - whether the field produced a lot or a little.

A <i>sochar</i> is one who rents the land for [a sum of] money.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 8:1-2 which also discusses these distinctions.</i>
When two people receive a field as sharecroppers together, they inherit the field, or join as partners with regard to it, one may tell the other: "Take the wheat in this-and-this place and I will take the wheat from that-and-that place.

When a priest or a Levite purchased produce from an Israelite after the tasks [associated with their preparation] were completed,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">But before <i>terumah</i> and the tithes were separated. Since the priests or Levites are entitled to the tithes and/or the <i>terumah</i>, they wished to purchase the produce and separate them for themselves.

This is a penalty imposed on them so that they will not hurry to the grainheaps and winepresses and purchase <i>tevel</i> to grab the presents of their priestly brethren.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad accepts the Rambam's ruling, but differs with regard to its motivating rationale. He explains that since the Israelite completed the tasks associated with the preparation of the grain, he has the right to give away the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes and the priest or Levite is not entitled to take that from him. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that the rationale given by the Rambam is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 1:6) and thus question the Ra'avad's position.</i> If, however, they purchase [the produce] before [these] tasks are completed, we do not expropriate [the presents] from their possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Since there is a certain amount of difficulty involved in the completion of these tasks, we do not penalize them.</i>
When a priest or Levite sold produce that was detached to an Israelite<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">But not to a fellow priest or Levite.</i> before the tasks [associated with their preparation] were completed - and certainly, if they sold the produce while it was attached - the <i>terumah</i> or the tithes belong to [the priest or Levite].<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that we operate under the presumption that when the priest or Levite sold the produce, he included a stipulation that the <i>terumah</i> and/or the tithes were his. Even though this stipulation was not explicitly made, we assume that it was understood (Rav Yosef Korcus).<br>Although they sold <i>tevel</i> - and thus it would be appropriate to penalize them - since they made it known that the produce was <i>tevel</i>, no penalty is imposed.</i> If they sold it after these tasks were completed, the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes belong to the purchaser.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Since the tasks associated with the produce were completed, the obligation to tithe is immediate. Hence, if the priest or Levite desired to retain possession of the <i>terumah</i> and tithes, they would have to make an explicit stipulation.</i> He must separate them and may give them to the priest or Levite of his choice.
When a priest or Levite receive a field from an Israelite under a sharecropping agreement, they should divide the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes, as they divide up the ordinary produce. The Israelite should take his portion and give it to the priest or Levite of his choice. When, however, an Israelite receives a field from a priest or a Levite under a sharecropping agreement, the <i>terumah</i> and/or the tithes belong to the owner of the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, since the field belongs to the priest or Levite, it is as if he made a stipulation that the <i>terumah</i> and/or tithes should be given to him.</i> The remainder of the presents<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The second tithe or the tithe given to the poor.</i> should be divided.
When a person - whether an Israelite from a priest or Levite or a priest or Levite from an Israelite - receive olives<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., olives that have already been harvested from the tree (Radbaz).</i> to produce oil, they should divide the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes, as they divide up the ordinary produce. [The rationale is that] oil is an important [commodity].<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Hence if the priest or Levite desired that the <i>terumah</i> and/or tithes be left for him, he would have to make an explicit stipulation to that effect. Thus if the olives - or any other produce - have not been harvested, if the land is owned by a priest or Levite, he retains the right to the <i>terumah</i> and/or tithes as above.</i>
When a priest sells a field to an Israelite and tells him: "[I am selling it] on the condition that the tithes from it belong to me forever," they belong to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the purchaser later sells that field to another person, he cannot override the stipulation that was part of the original sale.</i> [The rationale is that] saying "on the condition that" is tantamount to setting aside for himself [the portion of the field] where the tithes [grow].<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Were his stipulation not to be powerful enough to retain a portion of the land itself, it would not be effective, because it would be tantamount to purchasing an entity that has not come into existence. Such a purchase is not effective (<i>Bava Batra</i> 63a).<br>The commentaries note an apparent contradiction between the Rambam's ruling here and his ruling in <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 9:11. Although there are explicit Talmudic sources for both rulings, their logic appears contradictory. Among the resolutions offered is that here, the Rambam is speaking about landed property, while in <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i>, he is speaking about an animal and the principles of ownership are different in these two instances.</i><br>If the priest [who sold the land] dies, his son is like all other priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he no longer has any special rights to the <i>terumah</i> or tithes.</i> If [the priest] told [the purchaser]: "[I am selling it] on the condition that the tithes from it belong to me and my son," [when] he dies, his son<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">His grandson, however, does not have a right to them (<i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>).</i> should take [the tithes]. If he sold it "...on the condition throughout the time it is in your possession," should the purchaser sell it to another person - even if he later buys it back, the priest is no longer entitled to those tithes.
When an Israelite received a field under a sharecropping agreement from a priest or Levite and stipulated that [the agreement is being made] "on the condition that the tithes are mine<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Israelite's.</i> for four or five years," this is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelite is stipulating that he retains the right to separate the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes for all of the produce and give them to any priest or Levite he desires. Although as stated above, when the owner of the field is a priest, he can retain the rights to the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes. Nevertheless, as part of his contractual arrangement with the renter, he may give him the right to distribute them (Radbaz).</i> "...On the condition that they are mine forever," this is forbidden. [The rationale is that] one priest cannot make another priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a priest cannot give his right to collect <i>terumah</i> to a person who is not a priest. Similarly, a Levite may not make another Levite. Since the renter desires to make the arrangement permanent, it is forbidden, for a person who does not have a right to take the <i>terumah</i> and tithes is taking them.</i><br>Similarly, if a Levite owed money to an Israelite, the Israelite may not collect produce from others and set aside the tithes for himself until he repays his debt.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the creditor will continue to deduct the value of the tithes from the debt until the debt is paid.</i> For a Levite cannot make his creditor a Levite so that he can collect the tithes from others.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the creditor is taking them for the Levite, since he does not have an inherent right to them, he may not collect them.</i>
When an Israelite inherits <i>tevel</i> that was found in a grainheap whose edges had been straightened<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., at this stage, the tasks associated with the preparation of the produce were completed and tithes are required to be separated from it.</i> from his maternal grandfather who was a priest who in turn inherited it from his maternal grandfather who was an Israelite, [the Israelite who was the heir] may separate the tithes and keep them as his own. [The rationale is that] presents which are fit to be separated are considered as if they have already been separated although in actual fact they were not separated.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">To summarize the situation: The first testator, the Israelite, had completed the tasks involved with the preparation of his produce, but died before he had the opportunity to separate the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes. The first heir and second testator, the priest, also died before he had the opportunity to make these separations. Nevertheless, since had he in fact separated them, he would have been allowed to keep them as his own, we consider it as if he actually did so. Therefore when the final heir, the Israelite, takes possession of the produce, he must separate the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes to fulfill the mitzvah. He may then, however, keep them as his own property. (He may not, however, partake of the <i>terumah</i>, he must sell it to a priest.)</i>
When a person gives his field<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is speaking about an instance where the person worded the arrangement with the gentile in such a manner that the gentile does not receive possession of the produce until after it reaches the "phase of tithing."

On the other hand, since the source of the mitzvot are Scriptural, even though their observance now is Rabbinic, we follow stringencies as if the Scriptural mitzvah still applies.</i> If he says: "The two <i>lugim</i> that I will separate are <i>terumah</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is giving one fiftieth which is the ordinary measure separated as <i>terumah</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 3:2).</i> the ten are the first tithe, and the nine are the second tithe,"<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For the second tithe is given as a tenth of the new total once the first tithe has been separated.</i> he should not begin drinking and leave over the quantity designated as <i>terumah</i> and the tithes at the end. Instead, he should make the separations and then drink. We do not say that the wine he left over at the end is retroactively considered as if it was set aside in the beginning.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 10.</i> [The rationale for this stringency is that] the obligation [to separate] <i>terumah</i> and the tithes is Scriptural in origin, and with regard to [matters of] Scriptural Law, we do not say that we will consider it as if a separation has been made unless it actually has been made.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion among the Sages of the Talmud if this principle, referred to as <i>bereirah</i> should be applied or not (see <i>Beitzah</i> 37b). Because the matter is not resolved, with regard to questions of Scriptural Law, we are stringent, but with regard to matters of Rabbinic Law, we rule leniently.</i>
When a person specifies that his tithes were located at the opening of a jug [of wine], he should not drink from the bottom of the barrel. If he specifies that they are at the bottom, he should not drink from the top. [The rationale is that] the liquids intermingle.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">And there is no way one can drink from the top without drinking from the bottom or drink from the bottom without drinking from the top.</i> If, by contrast, one specified [that the tithes for produce] were at the opening of a storage container, one may eat from the bottom.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This does not represent a contradiction to the previous halachah. In that instance, the person had not separated the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes. He had merely stated that he would.

A person can designate certain produce as the second tithe and then redeem it.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i>, ch. 4, which describes how the second tithe can be redeemed for silver coinage.</i> [Afterwards,] he may designate that same produce as the first tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this is referring to a situation where the person did not make the separations in the desired sequence. This is undesirable, as stated in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 3:23.</i> for this batch of produce or <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for other produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">He may not, however, separate it as <i>terumat m'aser</i> for this batch of produce, for it is not proper to separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> before one separates the tithes themselves. See Chapter 9, Halachah 5.<br>The Ra'avad states that one may use it as <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for other produce, but not as ordinary <i>terumah</i>.</i>
When a person sets aside produce to use them for the separation of tithes,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he puts aside this batch of produce. Whenever he has new produce, he measures it and calculates a tenth. Afterwards, he considers that quantity of the produce set aside as tithes. When that entire batch of produce has been designated as tithes, he gives it to a Levite. See also (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 5:26).</i> he may continue to separate tithes relying on this produce on the assumption that it is intact, eating and drinking [from the produce from which he intended to separate tithes] until the entire quantity that was set aside has become tithes. He then gives that to a Levite. [If later] he discovers that the produce that he set aside [for tithes] has been lost, he must show concern for all the tithes that he set aside.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he must separate tithes again, lest he had made the original separation after the produce which he designated for his tithes was lost. The Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 3:8) mentions the opinion of Rabbi Elazar who maintains that one shows concern only for the separations made within the last 24 hours. Other Sages differ, however, and maintain that one must show concern for all produce separated (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>; see Rav Kapach's edition of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah).<br><i>Tosafot Yom Tov (Gittin, loc. cit.)</i> states that the Rambam's wording implies that one should separate tithes for one's produce even if that produce has already been eaten. Other authorities, however, do not accept this deduction.</i> He should not, however, tithe [the second time] with certainty.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For perhaps, the produce that he had set aside was intact at the time he made the separation.</i>

How should he make these separations on their behalf?

Even though ultimately the lender will be receiving the produce, he must make the separations so that the main batch of produce will not be <i>tevel</i>.</i> If [the debtors] would frequently take these separations from him or if he was accustomed to give these separations to them alone, he need not give them to another person on their behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">He must, however, make these separations. He need not give them to another person, because since these individuals are accustomed to receiving this produce, it is considered as if he already received them (Rashi, <i>Gittin</i> 30a).</i><br>After [the lender] makes these separations, he calculates the worth of the produce he separated and deducts it from the loan. [He continues doing this] until he repays the entire debt. He may sell the <i>terumah</i> to any priest of his choice and may partake of the tithes [himself].
When he calculates the worth of the produce that he set aside, he has the right to consider their value according to the lower market price.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., whenever produce is sold, there is a buyer's bid and a seller's bid.

He made a public statement of despair, acknowledging that he no longer expected to be able to collect the debt, because his fields would not grow enough crops. If, despite this condition, his fields produced crops, he is not entitled to keep the <i>terumah</i> and/or tithes for himself. The rationale is that he has already given up hope of their recovery.</i><br>If the priest, Levite, or poor person who borrowed money dies, he cannot continue to separate on their behalf unless he receives permission from the heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the arrangement to pay the debt is not automatically transferred to the heirs of the estate.

When an Israelite tells a Levite: "I am in possession of a <i>kor</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A measure of volume.</i> of tithes for you," the Levite has the right to designate that produce as <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for other produce even if he did not draw it into his possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and thus, he has not formally acquired it as his own. Nevertheless, he can rely on the assumption that a Jew will not act unfaithfully and will keep his word (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 49a).</i> If the Israelite gives it to another Levite, the first individual has nothing more than complaints against him.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that by changing his mind and failing to keep his word, the Israelite caused a spiritual difficulty for the first Levite - for he caused him to violate a transgression by partaking of tithes for which <i>terumat ma'aser</i> was not separated - does not create a financial liability.</i>

[The following laws apply when] poor people exchange the presents given them with the owner of the field, i.e., they gave him a <i>se'ah</i> of <i>leket, shichachah, peah</i> or the tithes for the poor and they took a <i>se'ah</i> of grain from the grain pile.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the owner acted generously with the poor people, taking a <i>se'ah</i> of their presents - which is usually produce of inferior quality - and exchanging it for a <i>se'ah</i> of quality produce from the grain pile.</i> [The grain] he takes from them is exempt from the tithes,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For there is no obligation to separate tithes from the presents of the poor (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 2:9).</i> even though it was prepared in the domain of the owner.

[The following laws apply when] there are two baskets of <i>tevel</i> from which <i>terumah</i> was separated in front of a person and he says: "Let the tithes from this one be in the other one." The tithing of the first basket is effective. If he says, "Let the tithes from this one be in the other one and [the tithes for] the second one be in this one," the tithing of the first basket is effective, for he has established its tithes within the second basket.

If one says: "With regard to the tithes for these two baskets. The tithes for each one are established in the other," he has designated the tithes by name and has established the tithes within them.

Chapter 8

Produce from which the great <i>terumah</i> and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> have been separated are referred to as "ordinary produce."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because the elements of the produce that are sacred have been removed from it [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 7:7)]. <i>Terumat ma'aser</i> should not be separated before the tithes themselves.

[The following laws apply when] <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, the term <i>tevel</i> refers to produce from which the tithes and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> have not been separated.

The rationale is that it is a <i>devar sheyeish lo matirin</i>, i.e., the prohibition can be corrected by making the appropriate separations (<i>Hilchot Issurei Ma'achalot</i> 15:6).</i> If he has other produce, he should separate the <i>terumat [ma'aser]</i> and the tithes for the <i>tevel</i> according to the appropriate reckoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if he knows how much produce was mixed in, he can make the appropriate separations even if the produce itself is not distinct.</i> If he does not have other produce from which to make the separations for that <i>tevel</i>, the entire mixture is forbidden until he makes separations from it.

What is implied? 100 [<i>se'ah</i> of] tithes become mixed with 100 [<i>se'ah</i> of] ordinary produce that has been made acceptable. He should separate 110 <i>se'ah</i> from the entire mixture.

There is a basis for such leniency, since ultimately, no separation had been made and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> was never mixed with the produce.

Chapter 9

In the age of Yochanan the High Priest who served after Shimon the Just,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., not the Hasmonean High Priest of that name who became a Sadducee (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> the High Court sent emissaries who searched throughout the entire territory of Israel. They discovered that everyone was careful with regard to the great <i>terumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is punishable by death at the hand of heaven, people were meticulous in separating it [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 1:1).</i> and would separate it. But with regard to the first tithe, the second tithe, and the tithe for the poor, the common people among Israel would be lax and would not separate it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The majority of the common people would separate the tithes as well. Nevertheless, because there was a significant minority who did not, our Sages imposed this stringency.</i> Therefore [the Sages] decreed that only the word of trustworthy people<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachot 1-2.</i> would be relied upon with regard to tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if such people say that their produce was tithed, we accept their word.</i> [The status of the produce of] the common people, by contrast is doubtful. We do not rely on them if they say that they separated the tithes. This is called <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The name <i>demai</i> is a composite of the Aramaic words <i>da mai</i>, meaning "This, what is its status?" (Radbaz).<br>See also <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:20 which states that it is necessary to recite a blessing before partaking of <i>demai</i>. That indicates that although our Sages ordained that one should separate the tithes before partaking of it, they did not consider partaking of it an outright prohibition. For if so, reciting a blessing would not be in place.</i>
They ordained that a person should separate only <i>terumat ma'aser</i> from the <i>demai</i>, for it is a transgression punishable by death and the second tithe, for there is no loss in doing so since the owner partakes of it. One need not, however, separate the first tithe or the tithe for the poor from <i>demai</i> because [the obligation] is doubtful and [whenever one desires] to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is on him. Therefore he tells the Levite or the poor person:<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to whom these tithes would be given.</i> "Bring proof that it is not tithed," and then take the tithes.
Even though one does not separate the tithe for the poor from <i>demai</i>, it is necessary to designate it without separating it. One says: "A tenth of what is here is the tithe for the poor. [This is done] to firmly establish [the obligation of] the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Sages ordained this stringency with regard to the tithe for the poor, so that the people will be careful in their observance of the second tithe.</i> For the tithe for the poor is given in the third and sixth years instead of the second tithe given in the other years of the Sabbatical cycle.
When <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and the second tithe are separated from <i>demai</i>, a blessing is not recited, because [the obligation was instituted because] of a doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Although one's observance fulfills a decree of our Sages and blessings are recited for the observance of Rabbinic commandments, e.g., the recitation of Hallel, lighting Shabbat and Chanukah candles, washing hands, and the like, a blessing is not recited in this instance, because this obligation was instituted only because of doubt, not as a practice with inherent positive virtue.</i> Therefore it is permitted to separate it when one is naked.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., were a blessing required, one would be forbidden to separate it in such a state, because a blessing could not be recited [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 1:4)].</i>
How should tithes be separated from <i>demai</i>? One should set aside an amount equivalent to the measure of <i>terumat ma'aser</i>, i.e., one hundredth of the entire amount, and place it next to the produce and say: "This is the tithe as is the remainder of the tithes that are adjacent to it." He then says: "This [portion] which I [first] set aside as the tithes, is <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for the remainder of the tithes that are adjacent to it."<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz emphasizes that he need not set the remainder of the tithes aside. Indeed, he continues, doing so would be an indication that he should give this produce to the Levite.</i> He then takes it and gives it to a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As a present. There is reason to say that since the matter is one of doubt, one is not required to give it to the priest, but instead, could sell it to him, our Sages ordained that it be given away. See the commentaries to <i>Sotah</i> 48a.</i> This order is required, because idealy, it is forbidden to separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> before the tithes themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 3:23.</i> Afterwards, he should separate the second tithe.
It is permissible to set aside the second tithe before the first tithe [when tithing] <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, the tithes must be separated in the appropriate order (<i>ibid.</i>). An exception is made with regard to <i>demai</i>, for the obligation to separate it is only a Rabbinic stringency (the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Demai</i> 1:4). See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 11:13.</i> If one desires,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., if rather than partaking of the produce in Jerusalem as is required with regard to the second tithe, he chooses to redeem it, transferring its holiness to money. That money should be taken to Jerusalem and used to purchase food there. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i>, chs. 4-5.</i> he should say: "The second tithe of this produce is located in the northern portion - or the southern portion - of the produce and its [holiness] is transferred to this money."<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is not necessary to actually take this produce to Jerusalem and partake of it as the second tithe.

Instead, one should slice a piece from the loaf, without cutting the slice away entirely. The commentaries question whether this is the intent here or that here, the Rambam changed his mind and is speaking of a complete separation.</i> from it the amount to be separated as <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and as <i>challah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 5:1-2, before one is permitted to partake of bread, one must separate a portion as <i>challah</i>. According to Scriptural Law, there is no minimum amount required for this separation. According to the Rabbis, a private person must separate one twenty-fourth of the loaf and a baker one forty-eighth. In this instance, the latter amount should be separated together with one hundredth for <i>terumat ma'aser</i>.</i> and say: "The one hundredth of [the total] that is here is [part of] the tithes as well as the remainder of the tithes that are next to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As in Halachah 5.</i> May this portion that I set aside as tithes, serve as <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for the remainder of the tithes that are next to it. The remainder of what I set aside that exceeds one hundredth of the total is <i>challah</i> and the second tithe in its northern - or southern - portion, and its [holiness] is transferred to this money." He may then partake [of the bread].
Similarly, if a person invites a colleague to dine with him [on the Sabbath]<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">When it is forbidden to separate tithes (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:14).</i> and [the guest] does not trust [the host] with regard to the separation of the tithes,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Although a person who is meticulous in his observance of the tithes should not eat in a common person's home (Chapter 10, Halachah 1), it can be explained that this is speaking about an instance where the person accepted the invitation without knowing that the host was not meticulous in his observance of the mitzvah. We are, however, speaking about a situation where the guest merely suspects that his host is not meticulous in his observance. If he is certain that he is not meticulous, different rules apply, as the Rambam states in the final clause of the halachah. The leniencies to follow were granted only for the sake of the Sabbath, but not during the week.</i> [the guest should do the following]: On Friday, he should say: "[The produce] that I will separate tomorrow is [part of] the tithes, as is the remainder of the tithes which are adjacent to it. That portion which I [first] designated as the tithes is <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for the remainder which is adjacent to it. The second tithe in its northern - or southern - portion, and its [holiness] is transferred to [this] money."<br>[This is permitted,] because a person may make such stipulations with regard to <i>demai</i> even though it is not in his possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This leniency is granted because the obligation to make these separations is Rabbinic in origin.</i> When, however, we are certain [that the tithes have not been separated,] he may make stipulations only concerning produce that is in his possession.
What is implied?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., how can a stipulation be made before the Sabbath for produce that we know is <i>tevel</i> to be tithed on the Sabbath?</i> If, [on Friday,] he had 100 figs that were <i>tevel</i> in his home and he is in the house of study or in the field<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And thus he cannot physically separate them before the onset of the Sabbath.</i> and he is afraid that night will fall and he will not be able to tithe the produce on the Sabbath, he should say: "The two figs that I will separate are <i>terumah</i>. The ten that I will separate after them are the first tithe. And the nine that I will separate after them are the second tithe." On the morrow, he makes these separations and may then partake [of the figs].<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">He may not, however, partake of the figs and then leave the tithes. The rationale is that in questions of Scriptural Law, the principle of <i>bereirah</i> is not applied and we do not consider it as if the separation that he will ultimately make was made from the outset [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 7:5)]. See also Chapter 1, Halachah 9.</i>
He must whisper inaudibly [the appropriate statements]<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Stating that he had made a stipulation on the previous day.</i> when he is making these separations one after the other.

If a common person gave him a cup [of wine] to drink [on the Sabbath], he should say:<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This is an extension of the principles stated in Halachah 7.

That portion which I [first] designated as the tithes is <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for the remainder which is adjacent to it.

He is penalized, because he should not have mixed his produce with that of a common person. The Radbaz amplifies this explanation, stating that by mixing his produce together with that of a common person he caused the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> that will be separated to become impure. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that initially when the separation was first made, the two batches of produce were not mixed together. Hence, it is not appropriate to say that the separation he is making now will affect the entire quantity.<br>If, however, they were full partners and did not make a division until the wine was produce, the person who is conscientious in his observance need not separate more than the tithes for his own portion. There is no need for him to be concerned about the share of the common person. For within this context, we apply the principle of <i>bereirah</i> and assume that retroactively, each one is receiving his own share and hence has no responsibility for the share of his colleague.</i> Similarly, if his share was a third or a fourth, he must separate [the tithes from the produce he takes] proportionately.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">If his share of the produce was one-third, he would have separated that amount of the total yield.

Chapter 10

When a person makes a commitment to be considered trustworthy<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Such a person is called a <i>chavair</i>. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 2:3), the Rambam explains that this term is used because, as indicated by the following halachah, the term refers to Torah scholars. <i>Chavair</i> means "friend." This term is appropriate to be used with regard to Torah scholars, because since their friendship is based on the Torah, it is true friendship, for its motivation is for the sake of heaven.</i> with regard to the tithes [so that] his produce will not be considered as <i>demai</i>, he must tithe [the produce] he eats,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Whether his own produce or produce he is given by others.</i> that which he sells, and that which he purchases,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Both produce that he purchases for his own consumption and that which he purchases for commercial purposes.</i> and he must not accept the hospitality of a common person. He must make these commitments in public.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Hilchot Tumat Mishkav UMoshav</i> 10:5, it appears that he must make these statements in the presence of three people who are themselves considered as trustworthy in this regard.</i> When trustworthy witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., witnesses who meet the criteria for acceptable witnesses spelled out in <i>Hilchot Edut</i>.</i> [testify] that he made these commitments in public and that he continually observe these practices, he is considered trustworthy [and his word is accepted if] he says that his produce has been tithed.
Every Torah scholar is always considered trustworthy. There is no necessity to investigate his [conduct]. His children, the members of his household, his servants, and his wife, are given the same status. When a Torah scholar dies and leaves produce, even if it was gathered on the day of his death, we assume that [the appropriate separations were made].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we assume that he separated the tithes from the produce before he died, for "We can presume that a <i>chavair</i> will not release anything from under his hand unless the appropriate separations have been made" (<i>Pesachim</i> 9a).</i>
When the daughter of a common person or his wife<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after she is divorced or widowed from the common person.</i> marries a <i>chavair</i> or the servant<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a Canaanite servant, for a Jewish servant is not sold to another master (<i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 4:10).</i> [of a common person] was sold to a <i>chavair</i>, they must accept the [above] requirements as at the outset.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if a woman or servant does not have a history of non-observance, it is assumed that when they become part of a <i>chavair's</i> home, they will accept the standards of the home.

If the <i>chavair</i> who is the agent asks to purchase produce without qualifying his statements and explaining who he is purchasing it for, the seller must give him tithed produce.

Hence, the seller might not tithe the produce (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>If the <i>chavair</i> was explicit and did not buy the produce without explanation, but instead said: "This bunch of produce that I am purchasing from you is being bought for my colleague and this bunch is being bought for myself," he is obligated to tithe [only] the produce that he took for himself.

If, however, he asks the seller and the seller states that the produce was tithed, the agent does not have to make any separations, since the seller is also trustworthy (<i>ibid.</i>). <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> questions the very basis of the Rambam's assumption. For if the seller is a <i>chavair</i>, he would always tithe his produce and there would be no obligation to tithe produce purchased from him.

When five people tell one person: "Bring us five bunches of vegetables," and [the agent] brings each person one bunch individually, the <i>chavairim</i> among [the recipients] are required to tithe only their portions.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">We do not require them to separate tithes for the entire amount.

When a common person tells a <i>chavair</i>: "Collect figs for me from my fig tree," the <i>chavair</i> may snack from them<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Without tithing.

[The rationale is that] a <i>chavair</i> will not release produce from his domain unless the appropriate separations were made. [Thus] we can assume that [the owner] separated [<i>terumah</i> and the tithes for this produce] from other [produce].

Chapter 11

It is forbidden to sell <i>demai</i> to a common person or to send <i>demai</i> [as a present to a common person], because one assists him in partaking of forbidden food. It can, however, be sold or sent to a Torah scholar, for a Torah scholar will not partake of it until he tithes it or until a trustworthy person tells him that it has been tithed.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Produce which definitely has not been tithed may not be sent even to a Torah scholar. It may, however, be sent to him in a pressing situation (Chapter 6, Halachah 6).</i>
All of those who add to the measure when they sell in large quantities, e.g., wholesalers and grain merchants are permitted to sell and send <i>demai</i> [as a present].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to Torah scholars, but not to common people, as stated in the previous halachah.</i> Since they add to the measure,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">And the purchaser receives more than what he deserves [the Rambam's Commnentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 2:4)].</i> our Sages ordained that the purchaser or the recipient be the one who separates the tithes from the <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, the purchaser must assume that the produce is untithed.</i> When, by contrast, people measure with a small measure, since the seller is the one who profits, he should make the separations.

What is meant by a large measure?

One might think that since the seller is selling by estimation, he is considered as being generous like the wholesalers mentioned above. The Rambam (based on <i>Demai</i> 2:5) teaches us that this is not so.<br>The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, noting that the mishnah quotes Rabbi Yossi as exempting the seller in this situation and does not mention a differing opinion.

When a <i>chavair</i> and a common person inherit [the estate] of their father who was a common person,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">And thus we cannot assume that the produce was tithed beforehand.</i> [the <i>chavair</i>] may say: "Take the wheat in this-and-this place and I will take the wheat in this-and-that place.

The rationale is that with regard to matters concerning Rabbinic Law, including <i>demai</i>, we apply the principle of <i>bereirah</i>, and retroactively - after the division of the property has been made - we consider that from the outset, it was as if the estate had originally been bequeathed to each of the sons separately, according to this division.</i> He should not say: "Take wheat and I will take the barley. Take the produce that is fresh and I will take what is dry," for this is considered as selling <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For we do not apply the principle of <i>bereirah</i> with regard to two different types of produce.</i>

Hence, he is required to tithe it.</i>
[The following laws apply when a person] discovers produce on the way. If the majority [of the local populace] bring the produce to their homes, he is not required to tithe it, for the obligation to tithe has not yet taken effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since the obligation to tithe will take effect when the person brings it home, we assume that he tithed it. Hence, the person who discovers it is not required to tithe it again [(the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Machshirin</i> 2:10)]. It must be noted that the Radbaz and many other commentaries offer different interpretations of this law. Indeed, the Rambam in Chapter 3, Halachah 22, appears to operate according to another perspective.</i> If, however, the majority bring it to sell in the marketplace, it is considered as <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The person bringing his produce to the marketplace may not tithe it until he reaches there, because until that point it is not common to partake of it in an substantial manner only as a snack. Hence, it is possible that it is <i>tevel</i> (<i>ibid.</i>).

One might ask: Seemingly, the situation is a <i>sefek-sefeikah</i>, a situation where the doubt is compounded, i.e., perhaps it came from those who bring it home.

Nevertheless, extra stringency is shown with regard to the prohibition against <i>demai</i> than is shown with regard to other prohibitions (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to Halachah 13).</i>

We do not know whether he tithed them.

Perhaps the gentile did not exchange the grain. Even if he exchanged it, perhaps he exchanged it with grain from a common person which need be tithed only because of a doubt. (The Ra'avad himself accepts the Rambam's ruling, but uses it as support for his thesis that there is an obligation for a Jew to tithe produce belonging to a gentile if it comes into his possession, for he maintains that the possibility is that the gentile exchanged it with his own produce.)<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> does not accept that thesis and instead offers a resolution, explaining that extra stringency is shown with regard to the prohibition against <i>demai</i> than is shown with regard to other prohibitions. He supports that contention based on <i>Shabbat</i> 23a which states that the majority of the common people separate tithes and yet our Sages imposed stringencies.</i> Similarly, if one entrusts [produce] to a common person for safe-keeping, it is permitted. He is not suspect to exchange the produce entrusted to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to produce given to a gentile for safekeeping, see Halachah 15.</i>
When a common person is managing a store belonging to a <i>chavair</i>, it is permitted [to partake of the produce].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Without tithing.</i> We do not suspect that he exchanged it.

The Radbaz notes that the previous ruling implies that a Jew who is a common person would not be suspect to exchange the produce even if the owner did not enter from time to time. He therefore suggests that this phrase be omitted from the text. There are, however, other commentaries who offer explanations why a manager is judged more stringently than the bailee mentioned in the previous halachah. After all, he is working on an ongoing basis.</i>
When produce was entrusted to a gentile for safekeeping, [the produce one receives is] considered as the gentile's produce, for we assume that he exchanged it for his own produce.<br>What are laws that govern it? If the tasks necessary to prepare the produce were not completed as of yet and they were completed by the Jew after he took back the produce he entrusted, he must separate the tithes as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 1:11.</i> If the produce that he entrusted was <i>tevel</i> and the tasks necessary for its preparation were completed, he is obligated to separate the tithes, for perhaps the gentile did not exchange it.

As we explained in <i>Hilchot Terumot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Terumot, loc cit.</i>.</i> [the obligation to tithe] is on "your grain," and not the grain of a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">We do not suspect that the gentile exchanged the grain with grain belonging to a Jew who did not separate the tithes, because it is not that common for people to entrust their produce to others. In contrast, people do bring containers of grain to a miller. Hence as mentioned in Halachah 13, we fear that the miller exchanged one person's grain with another's (the Radbaz and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> in resolution of the Ra'avad's objections).</i>

Thus one might think that we could rely on this person's word, even during the week. Hence, it is necessary to explain that we rely on his statements only on the Sabbath. The rationale is that the presumption that he will not lie applies to most people. There are, however, some that will lie even on the Sabbath [the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Demai</i> 4:1)].</i> [This applies] even if he possesses other produce of that type from which the separations have been made. [The rationale is that] the awe of Sabbath affects the common people and they will not violate a transgression on that day.
Even though one relies on the word of a common person to eat on the Sabbath, he should not partake of that produce after the conclusion of the Sabbath until he separates the tithes as appropriate for <i>demai</i> for the entire amount, what he ate on the Sabbath and what remains. For the leniency [to] trust him was granted only out of necessity for that Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is clarifying that the statement made in Halachah 2: that we trust that the common person will not lie on the Sabbath is conditional.

The oath is taken to emphasize to the colleague that the failure to accept his hospitality is a sign of serious enmity between them. Hence, this leniency was granted to encourage feelings of closeness.<br><i>Kaftor VePerach</i>, ch. 39, states that we are speaking about a situation where the oath was taken on the Sabbath itself. Otherwise, the guest could make a stipulation allowing for a retroactive separation as described in Chapter 9, Halachah 7.

The rationale is that partaking of such substances is punishable by death at the hand of Heaven.</i> and they are not suspect to cause others to partake of such produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offer interpretations that substantiate the Rambam's ruling.</i>
When we see that a person who is not trustworthy separates the first tithes from such produce and he says that he separated the second tithes, his word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Demai</i> 4:1) explains the logic: If he is willing to separate the first tithe which is given to a Levite, he is certainly willing to separate the second tithe which remains his own (but must be eaten in Jerusalem). See Halachah 15.</i> If he separated the second tithe in our presence and said that he separated the first tithe, his word is not accepted, because the second tithe belongs to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">While the first tithe must be given away as above.</i> [Thus] one who is trusted with regard to the second tithe is not trusted with regard to the first, but one who is trusted with regard to the first is trusted with regard to the second.<br>Accordingly, when a person who is not trusted brings produce from his home and says: "This is the first tithe," his word is accepted<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to this ruling, stating that it is not necessarily a logical continuation of the ruling in the previous clause.</i> and there is no need to separate <i>terumot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <i>terumah</i> and <i>terumat ma'aser</i>, if he said that he made these separations (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., both the first tithe and the second tithe.</i> from [the produce separated].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This bracketed addition represents the resolution offered by the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to the Ra'avad's objection.</i> If he says: "This is the second tithe," his word is not accepted. [The produce separated] is considered as <i>demai</i> and we must separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> from it. It appears to me that he must redeem the entire amount.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even the amount separated as <i>terumat ma'aser</i>. For although we are stringent and do not accept his word, we do not reject his statements entirely. Certainly, he himself must bear their consequences and consider the separated produce as if it is required to be redeemed (Radbaz).</i>
When one tells a person whose word is not accepted with regard to the tithes: "Purchase [produce] for me from someone who tithes." And that person went and brought him produce, his word is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is not trustworthy in this regard, his word is not accepted with regard to others as well. Even though one might say that he would not lie since his falsehood could easily be revealed, for it is possible to ask the identity of the seller and determine if he is trustworthy, the agent could always excuse himself saying: "I thought he was trustworthy" (Radbaz).<br>Although one might argue that there is no reason for him to sin, for he will not benefit from it, that argument is not accepted. For the ease the person experiences in bringing the produce from a close person could be considered enough of a benefit to influence him to lie.</i> If he told him: "Purchase [produce] for me from so-and-so," the other person's word is accepted if he says that he purchased it from him, for he will fear [to lie], lest [the principal] ask that person.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">And the lie be detected.</i> If he went to purchase [the produce] from the person who was named, but said: "I could not find him, so I purchased it for you from another person who is trustworthy," his word is not accepted.
[The following rules apply when a person] enters a city where he does not know anyone and asks: "Who is trustworthy? Who tithes?" If someone answers: "I am," his word is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Because he would personally benefit from the wayfarer's acceptance of his statements.<br>The Ra'avad clarifies the Rambam's ruling, noting that his text of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Demai</i> 4:5) states: "In the presence [of the person being recommended], his word is not accepted. Outside his presence, his word is accepted." The Radbaz states that this concept is implied by the Rambam's words, since "so-and-so" implies that the person is not present. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets the standard version of the Jerusalem Talmud as follows: "If he says he is not trustworthy, in his presence, he is not considered trustworthy (for he would not say so unless it was true). If he says so outside his presence, he is considered trustworthy (for the other person's statements are considered as slander)." This interpretation fits the Rambam's ruling.</i> If he says: "So-and-so," his word is accepted<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Because we follow the principle that a person will not sin unless he personally benefits (<i>Kiddushin</i> 63b). This, however, is a leniency, granted to the person, because he is a wayfarer [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 4:7)].</i> and [the wayfarer] may purchase [produce] from that person and eat on that basis. If [the wayfarer] went and purchased from that person and asked him: "Who here sells vintage wine?" and the person answers: "The one who sent you," his word is accepted even though it appears that they are in collusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">And thus could be lying. See parallels in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 20:11.</i>
When does the above apply? When [the wayfarer] is not familiar with any person in that place.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad qualifies the Rambam's ruling, stating that it applies only when the person he knows is trustworthy. If he is not trustworthy, his recommendation cannot be relied upon. Rav Yosef Korcus states that this is also the Rambam's intent.</i> If, however, he is familiar with people there, he should purchase only from a person [with an established reputation] for observance.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In the present age, this problem is solved by Rabbis and/or institutions giving kashrut certificates that are hung in the respective stores or institutions.</i> If he stays in that place for 30 days, even if he is not familiar with anyone there, he should purchase produce only from an expert.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For after 30 days have passed, the person has had ample time to familiarize himself with the place and there is no need for further leniency. He will certainly have found a place that will offer him hospitality (Radbaz).</i>
These leniencies were granted only with regard to <i>terumot</i> and the tithes,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for the leniency is that the majority of the common people do separate tithes. The laws of <i>demai</i> are merely an additional stringency.</i> but with regard to produce of the Sabbatical year and questions of ritual purity, one should purchase only from a person [with an established reputation] for observance.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For the common people are generally lax in observance of these prohibitions.</i>
When donkey-drivers<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Who bring produce from other places to a city for sale.</i> enter a city and one says: "The appropriate separations have not been made from my produce, but they have been made from my colleague's produce," his word is not accepted. [We fear that] perhaps they are colluding in deception.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz asks: Why are we more suspicious here than in the situation mentioned in Halachah 7. In resolution, he explains that people coming to sell their merchandise from another place are more likely to act in collusion than two businessmen in a city.</i>
When a person sells produce in Syria<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Terumot</i>1:3, the status of Syria is an intermediate level between that of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the Diaspora. There <i>terumah</i> and the tithes have to be separated because of Rabbinic decree, but not because of Scriptural Law. For this reason, our Sages did not enforce the restrictions of <i>demai</i> on such produce [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 6:11)].</i> and says that it comes from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">And was purchased from a common person so that the restrictions associated with <i>demai</i> apply.</i> the purchaser is required to tithe it.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that they have been taken out of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is not significant.</i> If he says that it has been tithed, his word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">And tithing is not required.</i> [The rationale is that] the same person whose words aroused our suspicion also allayed it.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle applicable in many areas, both in Jewish business law and with regard to the Torah's prohibitions. When our suspicions are based only on one person's statements, if that person makes a statement that allays those suspicions, we accept it. For our knowledge of the suspicious factor stems from his statements alone; there is no other evidence of such (<i>ibid.</i>). The rationale is that had he desired to lie, he would not have mentioned the factor that arouses the suspicions at the outset.</i><br>If he says: "They are mine,"<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. "from my field in Syria;" i.e., a place from whose produce tithes must be separated according to Rabbinic decree and he does not say that he tithed the produce.</i> [the purchaser] is obligated to tithe it.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Were he not to have said that they were from his own field, there would be no obligation to tithe the produce, because we would have assume it came from a gentile's field.</i> If he says that it has been tithed, his word is accepted. [The rationale is that] the same statement that aroused our suspicion also allayed it. If it is known that [the seller] owns land in Syria and most [of the produce] he sells is from his own field, one who purchases from him is obligated to tithe,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if he does not say specifically that they are his.</i> for we assume that he brought the produce from his own field.
When poor people<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Even if they are common people whose word is not ordinarily accepted with regard to tithes.</i> say: "This produce is from <i>leket, shichachah,</i> and <i>pe'ah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Presents given the poor that are exempt from the obligations to tithe (Chapter 2, Halachah 9).</i> their word is accepted as long as there are granaries in which <i>leket, shichachah,</i> and <i>pe'ah</i> can be found and provided [a poor person] is close enough to the granary so that he can go [to it] and return on the same day.<br>If they said: "They are from the tithes given to the poor,"<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance we would assume that the <i>terumot</i> and the first tithe were also separated.</i> their word is accepted throughout those years.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the third and sixth years of the seventh year agricultural cycle.</i> The word of these individuals is accepted only with regard to objects which people would ordinarily give [to the poor].
What is implied?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., what is meant by the last statement that the ruling depends on whether it is common for people to give such articles as <i>leket, shichachah, pe'ah</i>, or as tithes to the poor.</i> [Poor people say:] "This wheat is from <i>leket, shichachah,</i> and <i>pe'ah</i>,"<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pe'at HaSadeh</i> states that the Rambam's words are chosen carefully. It is customary to give <i>leket, shichachah,</i> and <i>pe'ah</i> in the field. Hence, it is not likely that they were given as flour. The tithes for the poor, by contrast, are generally given from the home (see <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim</i> 6:10). Hence it is possible that flour was given to a poor person in fulfillment of that mitzvah.</i> their word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For it is common for people to leave grain as <i>leket, shichachah,</i>and <i>pe'ah</i>, but not to process the grain any further before giving it [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 8:3)].</i> [If they say:] "This flour<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if he says that a homeowner gave him flour, his word is not accepted. If, however, he says that he was given grain and he had it ground into flour himself, his word is accepted.</i> from <i>leket, shichachah,</i> and <i>pe'ah</i>," their word is not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is not common for a person to have grain ground into flour and then give the flour to the poor.</i> Needless to say, their word is not accepted when they say that bread comes from presents to the poor. Instead, [such articles] should be tithed as <i>demai</i> is.
Similarly, their word is accepted with regard to kernels of rice [while in their husks]. Their word is not accepted, however, with regard to husked kernels or cooked ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">For it was customary for people to give presents from rice while the kernels are still in their husks and not when they have been processed [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>)]. Our interpretation of the following clauses is also based on that source.</i> Their word is accepted with regard to beans [in their kernels]. Their word is not accepted, however, with regard to raw, husked beans or cooked beans.<br>Their word is accepted when they say that oil was from the tithe for the poor. Their word is not accepted, however, if they say it comes from leftover olives.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Which are left for the poor. We do not accept their word in this instance, for it is not common for a sufficient quantity of such olives to be left to make oil.</i> Their word is accepted with regard to raw vegetables, but not with regard to cooked vegetables unless we are speaking about a small quantity. For it is customary for homeowners to give a poor person some vegetables from their pot. And since he can say: "A homeowner gave it to me," he can say: "I cooked it from the presents given me."<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we accept his word based on the principle of <i>miggo</i>; were he to have desired to lie, he could have chosen a more plausible falsehood.</i>
Similarly, the word of a Levite<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Even if he is a common person.</i> who says: "This produce is from the first tithe from which <i>terumah</i> was separated" is always<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to <i>leket, shichachah, pe'ah</i> and the tithe for the poor concerning which the poor person's word is accepted only at certain times.</i> accepted with regard to <i>terumat ma'aser</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Levite's word is accepted if he says that he separated <i>terumat ma'aser</i> from the tithes that he was given.</i> just as the word of an Israelite is always accepted with regard to the great <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 9, Halachah 1. In both cases, the transgression is punishable by death at the hand of Heaven.</i> [The Levite's<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Unless he is a <i>chavair</i>.</i> word] is not accepted, however, with regard to exempting [the grain] from the second tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if an Israelite purchases produce from a Levite who is not a <i>chavair</i> and the Levite states that the produce has been tithed and also the second tithe has been separated, the Levites word is not accepted.

The rationale is that an Israelite makes a sacrifice when separating the first tithe, but a Levite does not.</i>
All of the above<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., that produce could be purchased from a common person and the separations made afterwards. This concept applies also with regard to the subsequent laws mentioned in this chapter. See similar concepts in <i>Hilchot Shemitah VeYoval</i> 8:14.</i> applies with regard to a common person who is neither suspect [to violate these prohibitions], nor trustworthy [in their observance]. If, however, someone is suspected of selling <i>terumah</i> as ordinary produce, it is forbidden to purchase anything from him that has a connection to <i>terumah</i> and the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">For if <i>terumah</i> was mixed with the produce, the prohibition is much more severe.</i> Even the intestines of fish [may not be purchased from him] because oil is mixed with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">And we fear that the oil might be <i>terumah</i> or mixed with <i>terumah</i>.</i> It is, however, only forbidden to purchase the produce that is being sold by such a person at that time. It is, by contrast, permitted to purchase from his storehouse, because he will fear to mix <i>terumah</i> into his stores [of produce], lest the matter become known and he lose everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the Rabbis would discover that such a mixture would be made, they would declare his entire store of produce forbidden.</i><br>Similarly, it is forbidden to purchase anything that has a connection to tithes from a person who is suspect of selling the second tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">That has not been redeemed.</i> as ordinary produce. All of this is a penalty [imposed] by Rabbinic decree.
When a person who is suspect to transgress attests [to the tithes being separated from produce] belonging to another person, his word is accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the word of a person who is suspect is never accepted even when he testifies with regard to the produce of another person. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's view.</i> [The rationale is that we operate] under the presumption that a person will not sin without receiving any benefit. Needless to say, this applies with regard to a common person.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">For his word is accepted more readily than that of one who is suspect.</i> Therefore, if a common person says: "[This produce] is <i>tevel</i> and this is <i>terumah</i>. This is definitely untithed and this is <i>demai</i>," his word is accepted, even with regard to his own produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">For in these instances, his statements do not enable ordinary produce to be eaten.</i> If he said: "The required separations have been made from this produce," his word is accepted with regard to the produce of others<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">But not with regard to his own.</i> provided it does not appear that they are acting in collusion, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 10.</i>
When a person sells produce to a colleague and, after the produce leaves his hand, he tells the purchaser: "The produce I sold you is <i>tevel</i>. The meat is meat from a firstborn animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Which was slaughtered before it was clarified that it possessed a disqualifying blemish. Thus it is forbidden to partake of it and it must be buried.</i> And the wine is wine that was poured as a libation to a false deity.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">And is hence, forbidden and must be destroyed.</i> The letter of the law dictates that the seller's word should not be accepted, even if he is a <i>chavair</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the seller claims that the sale was made in error. He wants to nullify the sale so that he can fulfill the mitzvah of tithing the produce and destroying the forbidden produce. Since the objects have already left the seller's hand, his word is not accepted whether he is a <i>chavair</i> or not.</i> A person who is eager should be stringent with himself. If he accepts his word, [his conduct] is praiseworthy, even if [the seller] is a common person.

When [our Sages] issued a decree concerning <i>demai</i>, the decree did not apply to produce from the Diaspora that was brought into <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this applies to produce that was sold to a Jew who completed the tasks associated with its preparation. Even though such produce must be tithed, the stringency of <i>demai</i> does not apply.</i>
When the majority of the produce [in a mixture] is from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and not from the Diaspora, [the laws of] <i>demai</i> apply.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For as in all matters, the ruling is dependent on the majority (Radbaz).</i> If the majority of the mixture is produce from the Diaspora, it is exempt from <i>demai</i>. [This law applies] also to species that we can presume that most frequently come from the Diaspora, e.g., nuts and plums.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The particular species of plums the Rambam mentions grew primarily in Damascus and the laws of <i>demai</i> do not apply to produce that grows there (Chapter 12, Halachah 11).</i>
[When there was a doubt whether] produce came from the Diaspora or not, our Sages [maintained that the ruling] is not dependent on the appearance [of the produce], its flavor, or its fragrance,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one might say that as a result of these factors one could identify the source of the produce.</i> but rather where the majority [of produce in the marketplace originated]. If produce [from the Diaspora] constitutes the majority, it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., without tithing.</i> If not, it is forbidden.<br>What is implied? When there is a majority [of produce from the Diaspora] in a city, but not in its outlying areas, or in the outlying areas<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This is the interpretation of the term <i>medina</i> followed by most authorities. From the Rambam's wording in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 13:17, the interpretation of this halachah would be: "When there is a majority in a town, but not in a metropolis...."</i> and not in the city, in the mountain, but not in the valley, in the valley, but not in the mountain, for a storekeeper, but not for a private homeowner, for a private homeowner and not for a storekeeper, for those where [produce from the Diaspora] is the majority, they are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">To partake of it without observing the restrictions of <i>demai</i>.</i> For those where it is not in the majority, they are obligated [to heed the restrictions of] <i>demai</i>.
If, at first, there was a majority of produce from the Diaspora in the market place and then, that quantity was reduced, the market place returns to its original status, and one who purchases [produce] is obligated in [the restrictions of] <i>demai</i>.
At the time the decree concerning <i>demai</i> was issued, it was not applied in the following situations. All of the [following] instances are exempt from the obligations of <i>demai</i>: One who purchases: produce for seed or as animal fodder, flour for the processing of hides<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 1:3) for clarification regarding this and the other subjects mentioned in this halachah.</i> or for a compress or a bandage, oil to kindle a lamp or to apply to utensils, wine for an eye ointment.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Produce used for purposes other than for food.</i> [This ruling also applies to] <i>challah</i> separated by a common person,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>challah</i> like <i>terumah</i> carries a punishment of death at the hand of heaven and even the common people were careful with regard to its observance.</i> a mixture of <i>terumah</i> and ordinary produce,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since such a mixture contains <i>terumah</i> which involves such a severe penalty, the common people were careful with regard to the prohibitions involved.</i> produce purchased with money from the second tithes,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after the second tithe is redeemed, the money used for its redemption must be used to purchase food in Jerusalem.</i> flour left over from a meal offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The priest would take a handful of flour from a meal offering to offer on the altar. The remainder was eaten by the priests. We do not suspect that the remainder was <i>demai</i>.</i> and produce added to the <i>bikkurim</i> offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The first fruits of the seven species for which <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is praised must be brought to the Temple and given to the priests as the <i>bikkurim</i> offerings. Occasionally, fruits of the same species were added to the offering to make it more impressive. These are referred to as "produce added to the <i>bikkurim</i>."</i> If a common person tells him that the appropriate separations have been made, there is no obligation to tithe it.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, even in these instances, the initial preference should be to purchase the produce from a trustworthy source (Radbaz).</i>
When a person purchases produce to eat and changed his mind and thought to use it as animal fodder, he should not sell them to a gentile<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The separations are necessary in this instance, for the gentile may sell the produce to another Jew (Radbaz).</i> or feed them to an animal - even an animal belonging to others - until he makes the separations associated with <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For once he has incurred the obligation to make the separations associated with <i>demai</i>, he is not absolved from that responsibility until he does so (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
Fragrant oil<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Olive oil mixed with fragrant spices [Rav Kappach's translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 1:3)].</i> is exempt from [the obligations of] <i>demai</i> for we assume it will not be eaten. When a comber of wool purchases oil to put it in the wool,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Wool would be combed to remove its dirt and other impurities attached to it. Oil was applied to the wool to make the combing process easier.</i> it is exempt from [the obligations of] <i>demai</i>, because it is absorbed by the wool.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Like the oil applied to utensils mentioned in Halachah 14.</i> When, however, a weaver purchases oil to apply between his fingers,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As protection for them in the weaving process.</i> it is obligated in [the laws of] <i>demai</i>. The rationale is that it is absorbed in his body and the application of oil is considered as drinking in all instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shivitat Esor</i> 1:5.</i>
When a gentile asks a Jew to place oil on his wound,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is asking a <i>chavair</i> to use the <i>chavair's</i> own oil for this purpose.</i> he is forbidden to use oil from which he is certain the appropriate separations have not been made. He is, however, permitted to use <i>demai</i> for this purpose.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As a salve. If a <i>chavair</i> knows that produce has not been tithed, he may not use it in a manner that removes it from his possession or destroys it until he tithes it. For using it to benefit another person is equivalent to a sale (<i>Chasdai David</i>). With regard to <i>demai</i>, however, leniency may be shown, for he is using it for medical purposes for a gentile. If, however, he is using it for a Jew, the tithes must be separated even in this instance.</i> If a gentile places oil<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This refers even to oil from which we are certain separations have not been made.</i> on a tablet to twist around,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">One of the ways people would apply oil to their flesh was to place it on a marble tablet and then roll on the tablet.</i> after he arises, it is permitted for a Jew to sit on it afterwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the oil will be applied to his flesh. The rationale is that once the gentile used it, the holiness vested in the <i>terumah</i> has been defiled and it is no longer necessary to make any separations from it. Note a parallel in <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 11:8 (<i>Chasdei David</i>). In this instance, we are speaking about <i>demai</i> (which is feared to be <i>tevel</i>) and not <i>terumah</i> and in its present state, it is not holy. Nevertheless, the same principles can be applied.</i>
When oil that is <i>demai</i> falls on a person's flesh, he may rub it without concern.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, one should not apply oil that is <i>demai</i> to one's body. In this instance, however, the oil fell on the person's body against his will and its holiness is defiled at that time. Hence, what happens afterwards is not significant and he can continue rubbing that oil into to his flesh.</i> When a person purchases wine for fishbrine or a mixture of wine and water or legumes to crush and mix with honey, he is obligated in the restrictions of <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Because they were already distinct entities obligated in the restrictions of <i>demai</i> before the mixture came into being.</i> If, however, he purchased fishbrine that contains wine, a mixture of wine and oil, or a mixture of crushed legumes and honey, he is exempt from the restrictions of <i>demai</i>, for [our Sages] did not apply their decree to a mixture of <i>demai</i> and other substances. If the entity that was <i>demai</i> that became mixed with other substances was something like spices or yeast,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an entity that has an effect that is far greater than what could be expected from its size. This is a general principle applied with regard to all of the Torahs prohibitions; see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 16:1-2.</i> since its flavor is evident, the restrictions involving <i>demai</i> must be observed for the entire mixture.
In all those situations where one is exempt from <i>demai</i> because [our Sages] did not apply their decree in these instances, if one corrected [the produce as one does] <i>demai</i>, separating <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and the second tithe, his actions are considered of consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">He must give the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> to a priest and redeem the second tithe and use it to purchase food in Jerusalem.</i> If, however, he sought to correct [produce that is] <i>demai</i> like one does produce from which we are certain that no separations were made,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the text suggested by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.

Since that is undesirable, we assume that had he known what he was required to do, he would have made the separations in the appropriate order. Hence the separation that he did make is considered to have been made in error and therefore invalid.</i>
[The following laws apply when] all [of the individuals in] a town sell produce that is definitely [<i>tevel</i>], one person sells <i>demai</i> , and one purchases [produce] from a person without knowing from whom he purchased. How should he correct the produce?<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is possible that it is <i>demai</i> and it is possible that it is definitely <i>tevel</i>. Generally, we follow the principle that whenever the existence of an entity is fixed, we do not look at the actual ratio of permitted and forbidden entities. Instead, we consider it as if half are forbidden and half are permitted (see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 8:11) . Now, in this instance, there is a stringency in considering the produce as <i>tevel</i> - that one must separate the great <i>terumah</i>. And there is a stringency in considering the produce as <i>demai</i> - that he must separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and the second tithe. To permit the use of the produce, he must fulfill both stringencies. He must also separate the first tithe and the tithe for the poor. He does not have to give this produce away, because of the doubt concerning its status. Instead, he may keep it for himself.</i> He should separate <i>terumah</i> and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and give it to the priest. And then he should separate the second tithe and it is considered as the second tithe of <i>demai</i>.
Similar [concepts apply] if there were two containers [of produce] before a person: one containing <i>tevel</i> and one containing produce from which the separations were made. If one of them is lost,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">But we do not know which one.</i> one must separate <i>terumah</i> and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> from the other one and give it to any priest he desires. And he should separate the second tithe and it is considered as the second tithe of <i>demai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, since it is possible that the separations have already been made, we do not require him to give the first tithe and the tithe of the poor. Those separations that involve prohibitions, by contrast, must be made.</i>

Chapter 14

When a person purchases [produce] from a wholesaler and then purchases [produce] from him a second time, he should not separate tithes from one batch for another. [This applies] even if they are of one species, and even from one container, and even if he himself recognized the barrel [from which the produce was taken].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">And thus one might think that both batches came from the same person.</i> [The rationale is that] a wholesaler purchases from many different people and sells [it]. Perhaps the produce he first sold was from a common person whose produce is <i>demai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since the wholesaler sells in large quantities, he is permitted to sell <i>demai</i> (Chapter 11, Halachah 2).</i> and the batch he sold later was from a <i>chavair</i> who made the appropriate separations. As we already explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 6; <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 5:12.</i> we do not separate tithes from produce that is obligated to be tithed for produce that is exempt or from produce that is exempt for produce that is obligated. If the wholesaler said that [both batches] are from one person, we rely on his word.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he is a common person. The rationale is that he has nothing to gain by lying.</i>
When [a wholesaler] sells hops or vegetables and they are being brought and collected before him, a purchaser should tithe each bunch of hops, each bundle [of vegetables], and each date individually.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The tithes cannot be separated from one for the other for the reason stated in the previous halachah.</i>
When a person purchases [produce] from a private individual and then purchases [the same species] from him a second time, he may separate the tithes from one batch for the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For each person may separate tithes from one batch of his own produce for another. Since the person who grows this produce has this option, it is also granted to one who purchases from him.</i> [This applies] even when he purchases [produce] from two containers, and even from two cities. [The rationale is that] we operate under the presumption that a private person sells only his own produce.
[Different rules apply when] a private person sells vegetables in the market place. When [produce] is brought to him from his gardens, [a purchaser] may tithe from one batch for the entire quantity. If, however, he is also brought [produce] from other gardens, should one purchase a batch from him and then purchase a second batch, he should not tithe from one for the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For it is possible that the second batch came from a different person and the difficulties mentioned in the first halachah might apply. This suspicion also applies in the halachot that follow.</i>
When a person purchases bread from a baker, he should not tithe from the warm bread for the cool bread, for one might say that the wheat [used for] yesterday's [bread] was from one person and that [used] for today's is from another.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if the appearance of the bread is similar and they were baked in the same mold [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 5:3)].</i>
When a person purchases [bread] from a bakery<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> he may tithe from one loaf for all the others even if [the loaves] are from different molds. For a baker who sells to a bakery<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Our version of the text is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>).

If, however, one purchases [bread] from a distributor, one should tithe each mold individually,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When many loaves were made from the same mold, it is sufficient to separate tithes from one loaf for all those made in the same mold.

When nine distributors purchase [bread] from ten bakers, since one of them purchases from two [bakers], anyone who purchases [bread] from one of the nine must tithe each mold individually.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even when the majority of the distributors bought their bread from one baker.</i>
When a person purchases [bread] from a poor person and similarly, if a poor person was given<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as charity. If he was given them as part of the presents given to the poor, he is not liable to make separations from them.</i> slices of bread or slices of a cake of dried figs, he should tithe each one individually. For dates and dried figs, he should group the entire quantity together and tithe them.<br>When does the above apply? When he was given a large present.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the donor is generous, we assume that he also separated the tithes. Hence, the obligation to separate the tithes is merely a stringency. Therefore we are lenient with regard to its observance and do not suspect that the produce was given to the poor person by different people [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 5:5)].</i> If he was given a small present, he should tithe each present individually.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since the donor was tightfisted, it is unlikely that he separated the tithes. Hence, the obligation to separate the tithes is more compelling and we are stringent with regard to the above suspicion (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
If a person ground a loaf of bread [into] crumbs or ground dried figs and made them into a cake,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A loaf of bread and a cake of dried figs is considered as a large present.

When workers or guests were reclining and eating and they left over slices [of bread], one should tithe each one individually.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">We are speaking about the guests or workers of one person. Nevertheless, one cannot be lenient and separate tithes for the entire batch as one, for it is possible that one of the workers or guests separated the tithes and others did not and thus one might be separating tithes from produce from which tithes had been separated for produce from which they had not been. Although <i>demai</i> may be fed to guests (Chapter 10, Halachah 11), there may be some who desire to separate tithes as a stringency, but others will not.</i>
