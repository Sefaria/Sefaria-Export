Mishneh Torah, Gifts to the Poor



Chapter 1

When a person harvests his field, he should not harvest the entire field. Instead, he should leave a small portion<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 15, according to Scriptural Law, there is no minimal requirement for the amount of grain one must leave.</i> of the standing grain<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., ideally, the mitzvah of <i>pe'ah</i> is fulfilled by leaving a portion of one's field unharvested and allow the poor to harvest it. See <i>Pe'ah</i> 4:1.</i> at the end of his field,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 12.</i> as [Leviticus 23:22] states: "Do not completely remove [the grain in] the corners of your field when reaping."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 210) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 217) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> [This prohibition applies] to one who reaps<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., harvests by cutting off produce above its roots.</i> and one who uproots.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., harvests by pulling the plant up by its roots.</i> [The grain] left [standing] is referred to as <i>pe'ah</i>.
Just as one leaves [<i>pe'ah</i>] in his field, so too, [he must leave <i>pe'ah</i>] for trees. When he gathers his produce, he should leave some for the poor. If he transgressed and harvested the entire field or gathered all of the produce of the trees, he should take some of what was harvested or gathered and give it to the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he can compensate for his initial failure to fulfill the mitzvah, by giving some of the produce already harvested.</i><br>Giving [this produce] fulfills a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 120) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 216) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as it is stated [<i>ibid.</i>]: "Leave it for the poor and the stranger."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Halachah 9, the term "stranger" refers to a convert to Judaism.</i> Even if one ground the flour, kneaded it, and baked it into bread, he should give <i>pe'ah</i> from it for the poor.
If the entire harvest that was reaped<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, his crops were destroyed before he harvested them, he is not liable.</i> was destroyed or consumed by fire before he gave <i>pe'ah</i>, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, he should give the <i>pe'ah</i>. By doing so, he corrects the transgression he performed previously.<br>The wording used by the Rambam clarifies his approach with regard to a difference of opinion among our Sages (<i>Makkot</i> 16b). Rabbi Yochanan says that for a person to be liable for the transgression of a negative commandment that can be corrected by a positive commandment, he must personally perform an action that prevents the positive commandment from being fulfilled. Resh Lakish differs and maintains that as long as he no longer has the opportunity of fulfilling the mitzvah, he is liable for the transgression. From the wording here, it appears that the Rambam follows the second view.</i> [The reason is that] he violated a negative commandment and he did not fulfill the positive commandment that could correct it.
Similarly, with regard to <i>leket</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 1, for more details concerning <i>leket</i>.</i> When one harvests<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew terms imply both harvesting with a sickle or reaping by hand.</i> or binds sheaves, he should not gather the stalks that fall during the harvest. Instead, he should leave them for the poor, as it is stated [<i>ibid.</i>]: "You shall not gather the gleanings of your harvest."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 211) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 219) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> If he transgresses and gathers them - even if he ground them [into flour] and baked [them], he must give it to the poor, as it states [<i>ibid.</i>]: "Leave it for the poor and the stranger."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 121) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 218) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> If [this produce] is lost or consumed by fire after he gathered it, but before he gave it to the poor, he is liable for lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the negative commandment can be corrected by the positive commandment, as stated in the previous halachah.</i>
Similar [laws apply to] individual grapes that fall during the grape harvest and to underdeveloped grape clusters, as it is stated [<i>ibid.</i> 19:10]: "Do not harvest underdeveloped grape clusters from your vineyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This term is more specifically defined in Chapter 4, Halachah 15.</i> nor gather individual grapes that fall in your vineyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This term is more specifically defined in Chapter 4, Halachot 17-18.</i> Leave it for the poor and the stranger."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 212) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 221) include the prohibition against harvesting underdeveloped clusters of grapes among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 123) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 220) include the commandment to leave them for the poor in that grouping.<br><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 213) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 223) include the prohibition against gathering individual grapes that fall among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 124) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 222) include the commandment to leave them for the poor in that grouping.</i><br>Similarly, if a person is binding sheaves of wheat into bundles and forgets one bundle, he may not go back and take it,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">More details concerning this mitzvah are found in Chapter 5, Halachah 1.</i> as [Deuteronomy 24:19] states: "If you forget a sheave in the field, do not return to take it."<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 214) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 593) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> If he transgressed and gathered it - even if he ground it [into flour] and baked [it], he must give it to the poor, as it states [<i>ibid.</i>]: "They shall be for the stranger, the orphan, and the widow." This is a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 122) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 592) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i><br>Thus you have learned that they all are prohibitions that can be corrected by positive commandments. If one [transgresses and] does not fulfill the positive commandment involved, he is worthy of lashes.
Just as [the prohibition against taking] forgotten produce (<i>shichichah</i>) applies with regard to sheaves, so too, it applies to standing grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The prooftext speaks about forgetting "a sheave in the field." Nevertheless, the <i>Sifri</i> interprets the word "field" as indicating that standing grain in a field is also included in the prohibition.</i> If one forgot standing grain and did not harvest it, it should be [given] to the poor. Just as [the prohibition against taking] forgotten produce applies with regard to grain and the like, so too, it applies to all [fruit-bearing] trees, as it is stated [<i>ibid.</i>:20]: "When you beat your olive tree,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">One of the ways of harvesting olives is to beat the trees so that the olives fall.</i> do not go back and take its glory." This law also applies to [produce from] other trees.
Thus it can be concluded that there are four types of presents given to the poor in a vineyard: individual grapes that fall, underdeveloped grape clusters, <i>pe'ah</i>, and forgotten produce. There are three presents from a grain crop: <i>leket</i>, forgotten produce, and <i>pe'ah</i>, and two from trees: forgotten produce and <i>pe'ah</i>.
The owners do not have the right to give these presents to the poor to the individual of their choice.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The above translates the halachic construct <i>tovat hana'ah</i>. The intent is that the owner cannot say: "I will give the produce to the poor, but let me choose the poor man to whom I desire to give it."</i> Instead, the poor may come and take it against the owners' will.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For when commanding that these presents be given, the Torah does not use the word "give," but rather "leave." Implied is that all the owner can do is leave it; he cannot take it and give it to a person at will (see <i>Chullin</i> 131b).</i> [These presents] are expropriated even from a poor Israelite.
Whenever the term "stranger" is used with regard to [these] presents to the poor, the intent is a convert to Judaism.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and not a non-Jew visiting <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> even if he accepts the Seven Universal Laws Commanded to Noach's Descendants (a <i>ger toshav</i>).</i> [This is evident from the wording used by Deuteronomy 14:29] with regard to the tithe [given to the] poor:<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on manuscript copies and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. There is a printing error in the standard published text.</i> "And the Levite and the stranger will come." Just as the Levite is a member of the covenant, so too, the "stranger" is a member of the covenant. Nevertheless, we do not prevent gentiles from [taking] these presents. Instead, they [are allowed to] come together with the poor of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz interprets the Rambam's wording as implying that if gentiles come alone, not in the company of Jews, they should be sent away. Rav Yosef Corcus adds that if there are no Jewish poor, these presents should not be left for the gentile poor.</i> and take them as [an expression of the Torah's] ways of peace.
With regard to [these] presents for the poor, it is said: "Leave it for the poor and the stranger." [Implied is that the obligation exists only] when the poor demand them. If the poor cease seeking them and searching for them, the remainder is permitted for any person.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Even the owner of the field. See the notes to Halachah 134 regarding this issue.</i> For - in contrast to <i>terumah</i> - the physical substance [of the crops] does not become consecrated. Nor is he required to give their worth to [the poor], for it is not stated [that he should] give them to the poor, but that he should "leave it." He is not commanded to leave it for the beasts and the wild fowl, but for the poor, and there are no poor.
When is everyone allowed to collect the <i>leket</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah gives examples that illustrate the general principle stated in the previous halachah.</i> When a second wave of gatherers gather after the first wave of gatherers and then depart.<br>When is everyone allowed to collect individual grapes that fall and underdeveloped grape clusters? When the poor walked through the vineyard and departed. What remains afterwards is permitted for every one.<br>When is everyone allowed to collect olives that were forgotten in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in Halachah 14, according to Scriptural Law, this is the only place of consequence for these presents.</i> If they were forgotten while on the tree, one is permitted to take them from Rosh Chodesh Kislev<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">From this time onward, the olive-picking season is completed.</i> which is the time of the second rain<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The early winter rain which follows the spring rain.</i> in a late year.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Jewish calendar follows the moon, while the secular calendar follows the sun. Although adjustments are made to keep the two in sync, there are years when the Jewish months come earlier in the solar year and others when they come later.</i> One is permitted, by contrast, [to take] masses of collected olives forgotten under a tree after the poor have ceased seeking them.
As long as a poor person has the right to take olives left on the earth under the trees, he may take them,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">And ordinary people may not.</i> although people at large have already been granted license [to take] the forgotten produce on the tree itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For the appropriate time has already passed.</i> As long as one has the right to take forgotten produce from the tree itself, he may do so, even though he does not have the right to take forgotten produce from under the tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For the poor might still consider collecting it.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling, stating that it does not agree with the Rambam's source, <i>Pe'ah</i> 7:2. Indeed, in his own Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam offers a different interpretation than here. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's ruling here is dependent on his understanding of the treatment of the subject by the Jerusalem Talmud.</i>
Presents to the poor from [the crops in] the field with which the poor are not concerned<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i> interprets this as referring to produce that the poor have walked by several times without picking up.</i> belong to the owner,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Since they are ownerless, he acquires them by virtue of their presence in his property.</i> even though the poor have not ceased searching for their presents.
According to Scriptural Law, all of these presents for the poor must be given only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The boundaries of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> are outlined in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i>, ch. 1.</i> like <i>terumah</i> and the tithes, as [indicated by Leviticus 19:9]: "When you reap the harvest of your land" and [Deuteronomy 24:19]: "When you reap your harvest in your field." <sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The emphasis of the terms "your land" and "your field" is land that has an inherent connection with the Jewish people.</i> It has already been explained in the Talmud that [the mitzvah of] <i>pe'ah</i> must be observed in the Diaspora according to Rabbinic decree. It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase introduces a conclusion developed by the Rambam on the basis of deduction without an explicit source in previous Rabbinic literature.</i> that this law applies to all the remainder of these presents to the poor. All of their [obligations] must be observed in the Diaspora according to Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In this context, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 332:1) states: "If Jewish poor are not commonly found there, it is not necessary to leave [these presents]." (Significantly, the commentaries cite the Rambam, apparently Halachah 10, as the source.) The Rama continues stating that on this basis, it is no longer customary to leave these presents, because the likelihood is that they will be taken by gentiles. The statements of the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 332:1 imply that this leniency is granted only in the Diaspora and not in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There is, however, a difference of opinion concerning this issue and, in practice, even within the observant community, these mitzvot are not observed today even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. For these reasons, the laws concerning these mitzvot are not included in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>.</i>
What is the minimum obligation for <i>pe'ah</i>? According to Scriptural Law, there is no minimum measure. Even if one leaves only one grain stalk, he fulfills his obligation. According to Rabbinic law, however, one must leave one-sixtieth [of the crop], whether in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> or in the Diaspora. And one should add to the measure of one-sixtieth based on the size of the field, the amount of poor people, and the blessing in his crop.<br>What is implied? When a field is very small and leaving one-sixtieth would not be of any advantage to the poor person,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is too small an amount to be significant.</i> he should increase the measure. Similarly, if there are many poor people, he should increase [the measure]. And if he sowed only a small amount and reaped a lot, he has been granted blessing and he should increase according to the blessing. Whoever adds to the <i>pe'ah</i> will be given additional reward. There is no limit to this increase.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one can give as much as he desires. This is the intent of the mishnah recited each morning after the Blessings for Torah Study: "These are the matters for which there are no measure: <i>pe'ah, bikkurim</i>, appearing in the Temple, and Torah study," i.e., just like all the other subjects mentioned in that source, there is no upper limit to how much <i>pe'ah</i> one may leave.</i>

Chapter 2

Any food that grows from the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In the following halachah, the Rambam explains how each of the five factors he mentions here is significant and excludes a different type of produce.</i> is guarded,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., protected against thieves.</i> is harvested at the same time, and is placed in storage<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">To keep over a long period of time.</i> is required that <i>pe'ah</i> [be separated from it], as [Leviticus 19:9 / Leviticus 23:22] states: "When you reap the harvest of your land."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">All these concepts are implied by the word "harvest"; see the <i>Sifri</i> to the prooftext cited.</i>
Anything that resembles a crop that is harvested by having these five qualities requires that <i>pe'ah</i> be separated from it, e.g., grain, legumes, carobs, nuts, almonds, pomegranates, grapes, olives, dates - whether dried or fresh - and any similar produce.<br>By contrast, indigo, rubia, and the like are exempt, because they are not food.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are used for dye and the like.</i> Similarly, truffles and mushrooms are exempt, because they do not grow from the earth, like other produce of the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they don't have roots in the earth through which they derive nurture (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> Similarly, ownerless produce is exempt, for there is no one to watch it, for it is free for anyone to take. Similarly, figs are exempt, because they are not harvested at one time. Instead, on the tree, there are some that will become ripe on one day and others that will not become ripe until after several days. Similarly, vegetables are exempt, for they are not placed in storage. Garlic and onions require that <i>pe'ah</i> [be separated], for they are dried out and placed in storage. Similarly, seed onions that are placed in the earth to produce seed require that <i>pe'ah</i> [be given from them]. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
A portion of land of any size<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a field does not have to be of a given size.</i> requires that <i>pe'ah</i> [be separated from its produce]. [This applies] even if it belongs to partners, for [the prooftext (ibid)] states "the harvest of your<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The prooftext uses a plural term.</i> land," even if it belongs to many people.
When gentiles harvested a field for their own sake,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., taking the produce for themselves. If, however, they harvested it for the sake of the Jews, <i>pe'ah</i> must be given, as stated in Halachah 10.</i> thieves harvested it, ants destroyed its produce, or the wind or an animal crushed it, it is exempt from <i>pe'ah</i>. For the obligation of <i>pe'ah</i> lies on the standing grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>pe'ah</i> must be given even if the grain was harvested (Chapter 1, Halachah 2), that is only because the obligation was incurred at the time of harvest. In these instances, the field was destroyed and the Jew received no benefit from the harvest. Hence, there is no obligation to leave <i>pe'ah</i>.</i>
If he harvested half of it and thieves harvested the remaining half, it is exempt, for the obligation was incumbent on the half that was harvested by the thieves.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>pe'ah</i> is included in the standing grain. Since that was stolen by the thieves, it is considered as if they stole the portion due the poor.</i> If, however, thieves harvested half of it and [the owner] harvested the remaining half, he should leave <i>pe'ah</i> according to the measure of what he harvested.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">He need not, however, leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the portion stolen by the thieves.</i><br>If he harvested half and sold the [remaining] half, the purchaser must leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire field.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>pe'ah</i> is in the remaining half. Since the purchaser was obviously aware that the first half of the field had been harvested, he implicitly accepted the responsibility to leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the part of the field that had been harvested previously. For the owner has no right to sell the portion of the crops belonging to the poor [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 2:8)].</i> If he harvested half and consecrated half, the person who redeems [the half] from the Temple treasury must leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire [field].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he purchases the field from the Temple treasury with the understanding that he must leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire field.</i> If he harvested half [the field] and consecrated [what he harvested], he should leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire field from the remainder [of the crop].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since he consecrated the crop after he harvested it, he was already obligated to leave <i>pe'ah</i> for it.</i>
[The following rules apply when a person] harvested [some of] the grapes in his vineyard to sell in the market place, but had the intent to leave the remainder for the vat to press [for wine].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 23, which mentions laws that are relevant to this situation.</i> If he would harvest for the marketplace from either side [of the vineyard], he should give <i>pe'ah</i> for [the grapes] that he harvests for the vat according to the amount that remain.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">He does not have to leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the amount that he harvested previously. The rationale is that since he harvested it indiscriminately, his act is not considered as significant. It is as if he picked some grapes haphazardly. As the Rambam continues to state, <i>pe'ah</i> is not required for such a harvest. Hence, when he harvests the grapes for the vat, he must leave <i>pe'ah</i> only for the grapes he is harvesting at that time.</i> If he would harvest for the marketplace from only one side, he should leave the amount of <i>pe'ah</i> appropriate for the entire field from the amount remaining. [The rationale is that] since he harvested from only one side, he is not considered as harvesting haphazardly in which instance, he would be exempt [from leaving <i>pe'ah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As explained above, a person is obligated to leave <i>pe'ah</i> only when he "harvests" his field. If he just gathers his food in a haphazard sporadic manner, he is not considered to have harvested and hence, is not liable to leave <i>pe'ah</i>.</i><br>Similarly, when a person harvests ears of grain bit by bit and brings them home, he is exempt from <i>leket, shichachah,</i> and <i>pe'ah</i>, even if he harvested his entire field in this manner.
When a person harvests his entire field before it becomes completely ripe, before it reaches a third of its growth, he is exempt [from <i>pe'ah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Here, also, the same rationale applies. Since the produce did not ripen completely, reaping it is not considered as a "harvest" (<i>Menachot</i> 71b).</i> If it reached a third of its growth, he is obligated. Similarly, with regard to fruit from trees, if a third of their growth is completed, there is an obligation [to leave <i>pe'ah</i>].
When a person consecrates his field while his grain is standing and redeems it while it is [still] standing, there is an obligation [to leave <i>pe'ah</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Or any of the other "presents to the poor" [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 4:7)].</i> from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For at the time he harvested it, it was his private property.</i> If the Temple treasurer harvested it and then he redeemed it, it is exempt, for at the time when the obligation for <i>pe'ah</i> became relevant, [the field] was consecrated and thus there was no obligation [to leave <i>pe'ah</i>] from it.
When a gentile reaps his field and then converts, he is exempt from <i>pe'ah</i>, <i>leket</i>, and <i>shichachah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Because at the time he harvested it, he was not obligated to observe these mitzvot.</i> [This applies] even though [Scripture mentions the obligation of] <i>shichachah</i> only with regard to the time when sheaves [are transferred].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording is perplexing, for he refers to two differing opinions in <i>Pe'ah</i> 4:6. To explain: That mishnah states: "When a gentile harvested his field and afterwards, converted, he is exempt from <i>pe'ah</i>, <i>leket</i>, and <i>shichachah</i>. Rabbi Yehudah obligates him in <i>shichachah</i>, because <i>shichachah</i> applies only when sheaves [are transferred]."<br>The first opinion in the mishnah maintains that we draw an equation between the obligation of <i>shichachah</i> that applies to standing grain and the obligation of <i>shichachah</i> that applies to sheaves. Since <i>shichachah</i> does not apply to one, it does not apply to the other. Rabbi Yehudah, by contrast, maintains that each obligation of <i>shichachah</i> should be considered independently. The Rambam subscribes to the first opinion, but borrows the wording used by Rabbi Yehudah.</i>
One may not hire non-Jewish laborers to harvest, because they are not knowledgeable with regard to the laws of <i>leket</i> and <i>pe'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that we suspect that they will give either less than the required amount and thus disadvantage the poor or give more than the required amount and thus disadvantage the owner.</i> If one hired them and they harvested the entire field, he is obligated [to leave] <i>pe'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that the individuals who did the actual harvesting were not obligated to fulfill the mitzvah does not remove the responsibility from the owner of the field.</i>
When a landowner harvested his entire field and did not leave <i>pe'ah</i>, he should give some of the stalks of grain as <i>pe'ah</i> to the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 2.</i> He does not have to tithe [the grain he leaves as <i>pe'ah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For the produce he leaves as <i>pe'ah</i> is not his, and hence, he is not obligated to tithe it. Nor are the poor, because they were not the owners at the time it was harvested. See <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 2:9.</i> Even if he gives the majority of the harvest as <i>pe'ah</i>, he is exempt from tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one might think that he is liable, because such a large gift would be considered as a present (for which tithes must be given) and not as <i>pe'ah</i>. Hence it is necessary to state that this is not so (Radbaz).</i><br>Similarly, if he threshed the grain, but did not winnow it, he should give them <i>pe'ah</i>, before he tithes. If, however, he threshed and winnowed the grain with a pitchfork and a shovel and completed the task, he should tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For he is already obligated to give tithes once he completes winnowing.</i> and give [the poor] tithed produce equivalent to the appropriate measure of <i>pe'ah</i> for that field.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Without subtracting the amount set aside as tithes from the <i>pe'ah</i>.</i> Similar [concepts apply] with regard to trees.

Instead, they could judge when he would complete his harvest and come at that time alone.</i> so it will be obvious to passersby and they will not suspect [that the owner did not leave <i>pe'ah</i>], and so that deceivers will not intend to harvest their entire field and [will excuse themselves by] telling the observers: "I left it in the beginning of the field." Also, [leaving it there will prevent him from] waiting until a time when no one is present and leaving it for a poor person with whom he is close.<br>If a person transgressed and left <i>pe'ah</i> in the beginning or the middle of his field, it is considered as <i>pe'ah</i>, but he must leave an appropriate measure of <i>pe'ah</i> for the portion of the field that remained after he separated the initial [<i>pe'ah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">He need not, however, leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire field.

It is forbidden for workers to harvest the entire field.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For they are acting on the owner's behalf.</i> Instead, they should leave the appropriate measure [of grain] for <i>pe'ah</i> at the end of the field.

At three times during the day,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Neither less, nor more.</i> <i>pe'ah</i> is divided among the poor or left for them to take: at daybreak, at noon, and at <i>minchah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <i>minchah ketanah</i>, an hour and fifteen minutes before sunset.</i> When a poor person does not come at these times, he is not allowed to take, so that there will be fixed times for the poor so that they will all gather together to take [<i>pe'ah</i>].<br>Why wasn't only one time a day established [for the poor to take]?

[These laws] also apply with regard to <i>leket</i> and to a sheave that was forgotten.
[The following rules apply if a person] took <i>pe'ah</i> and said: "This is for the poor person, so-and-so."

When the owner of a field leaves <i>pe'ah</i> for the poor people standing before him and a poor person comes from behind him and takes it, that person acquires it.

Chapter 3

<i>Pe'ah</i> should not be left in one field for another field.<br>What is implied? If [a person] owned two fields, he should not harvest one entirely and leave the amount of <i>pe'ah</i> appropriate for both in the second field. [This is derived from Leviticus 23:22:] "Do not completely remove [the grain in] the corners of your field." [Implied is] that one should leave in each field the <i>pe'ah</i> that is appropriate for it. If one left [<i>pe'ah</i>] from one field for another, it is not <i>pe'ah</i>.
Although one's entire field was sowed with one crop, if there was a stream - even if did not flow<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if at the time the stream was dried out, the ravine itself constitutes a separation (Radbaz). The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, interprets the Rambam as referring to a stream with water.</i> - or an irrigation ditch - provided water flowed through it and it was established<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an irrigation ditch constitutes a separation only when water flows through it throughout the year.</i> - in the midst of the field that would prevent one from harvesting both sides at the same time,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 2:2), the Rambam explains that this refers to a situation where a person standing on one side of the irrigation ditch cannot extend his hand and harvest the produce growing on the other.</i> it is considered as two fields and one should give <i>pe'ah</i> on each side for the portion there.
Similarly, a path belonging to a private individual which is four cubits wide or a public thoroughfare which is sixteen cubits wide separates [between one field and another]. [Different rules apply regarding] a private path that is less than four cubits wide or a public path that is less than sixteen cubits wide.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam makes a distinction between a path owned by a private individual and one used by people at large, explaining that a path owned by a private person is continually used by him. Hence, even if it is narrow, it is considered a separation. The public, by contrast, has many paths at their disposal and will not necessarily follow a particular path. Hence, unless a public path is very wide or permanent, it is not considered as a separation.</i> If it is permanent, i.e., it is maintained in the summer and in the rainy season, it is considered as a separation. If it is not permanent in the rainy season, it is not considered as a separation and [the entire area] is considered as one field.
There are other factors which constitute a separation into two fields:<br>a) land that was uncultivated, that was neither sown, nor plowed;<br>b) land left fallow, that was plowed, but not sown;<br>c) crops were interrupted with another crop, e.g., there was wheat on either side and barley in the middle;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">We are speaking here about a situation where it is unnecessary to make a separation because of the laws of <i>kilayim</i> (mixed species; see <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i>, the latter part of ch. 3). If it is necessary to make a separation for that reason, that separation will be large enough to constitute a separation for <i>pe'ah</i> as well.</i><br>d) one harvested in the middle of his field before the grain reached a third of its maturity and plowed the portion which he harvested.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 7, one is not obligated to leave <i>pe'ah</i> for such a field if he harvested it in such a preliminary state. Nevertheless, unless he plows it, the harvest alone is not considered significant enough to have divided the field with regard to the other crops (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Needless to say, if it already grew to a third of its development and hence required <i>pe'ah</i> for its own crop, it is only considered as a divider if the land was plowed (Radbaz).</i><br>[The above applies] provided the width of each of the above is three rows of plowing. [This is] less<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam's opinion, this is a far smaller figure, while according to the Ra'avad, the difference is not that great (Radbaz). The Ra'avad bases his interpretation on the treatment of this subject in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 2:2), claiming that that text does not support the Rambam's ruling. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that there is a version of the Jerusalem Talmud that supports the Rambam's position and maintains that the Ra'avad's version is in error.</i> than the area necessary to sow a quarter [of a <i>kav</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The latter measure is slightly more than ten and one fifth cubits by ten and one fifth cubits (<i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 3:9 and notes).</i><br>When does the above apply? With regard to a small field that is 50 cubits by two cubits or less. If it is larger than this uncultivated or fallow land does not cause it to be divided in two unless it was as wide as the area necessary to sow a quarter of a <i>kav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since the entire field is larger, the area which creates the separation must also be larger.</i> [In this instance,] even the smallest amount of another crop creates a separation.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz questions why leniency is granted with regard to separation when another crop is sown and explains that it is uncommon to sow a small amount of a second crop in between two larger portions of one crop. Hence, one can assume that it was done so only for the sake of making a distinction.</i>
If locusts consumed [a field] in its midst or ants destroyed it, should one plow the portion that was consumed,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, one does not plow the consumed portion, it is not considered as a separation (<i>Menachot</i> 71b).</i> it is considered to be a separation.
[The following law applies when one] sows [crops] on a mountain [slope] that is not level, but instead has knolls and hollows. Even though he cannot plow it all at once and sow it all at once, but instead must plow the knolls by themselves and the hollows by themselves, it is considered as a single field. He should leave one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> at the end of the mountain for the entire mountain.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This follws the second interpretation given by the Rambam in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 2:2).</i>
[The following laws apply when one sows crops on] terraced land. [When each terrace] is ten handbreadths higher than the other, one should leave <i>pe'ah</i> [separately] for each terrace. If the heads of the rows are joined together, he should leave one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire area. If they were less than ten handbreadths higher, he should leave one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> even if the heads of the rows are not joined together.<br>[The following rules apply] if there was a rock covering the surface of the entire field. If he must lift up the plow from one side and place it on the other side, it is considered an interruption.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since the rock divides the field, it is considered as two separate entities. Hence, he must leave <i>pe'ah</i> for each portion of the field individually. The commentaries question why this instance is different than the terraces that are less than ten handbreadths higher than each other mentioned in the first clause, for there too, he must lift the plow and move it to the side while plowing. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the terraces are different because they can be sown and hence they appear as a single field, while the rock cannot be sown.</i> If not, it is not considered an interruption.
When a person sows a field that has trees - even though he sows it in squares<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The term the Rambam uses literally means "the mold used to make bricks." That term is employed because the squares resemble such a mold [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 3:1).</i> between the trees and thus the entire crop does not come together as one - he should give one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire field. For it is known that it is one field; it is only the place of the trees that causes the crop to be divided.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., had there not been trees in the field, the entire field would have been sown as a single entity. It was the presence of the trees alone that caused him to divide it. Thus since it is essentially one field, he leaves one portion of <i>pe'ah</i>.</i>
When does the above apply? When all ten trees were located in an area in which a <i>se'ah</i> [of grain can be sowed].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">An area 50 cubits by 50 cubits (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:3; <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 4:7).</i> If, however, all ten trees were located in an area larger than that in which a <i>se'ah</i> [of grain can be sowed], he should leave <i>pe'ah</i> from every square separately. For the trees are far apart and they did not cause him to sow the field in squares.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, he considered each block separate for other reasons. Hence, <i>pe'ah</i> should be left for each one individually. The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam, basing his objections on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 3:1). The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that the Rambam had a different version of the Jerusalem Talmud and that accounts for the difference between their positions. They also maintain that the Rambam's position is sounder logically, for the larger the field, the more likely it is that each separate block should be considered an independent field.</i>
Similarly, if squares of onions [grow] between vegetables,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, there must be a distinction between the vegetables and the onions so that the laws of <i>kilayim</i>, mixed species, are not violated.</i> one should leave a single portion of <i>pe'ah</i> for all the onions even though the vegetables grow between them and cause them to appear as separate squares.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, the physical separation does not cause the squares to be considered as separate fields. The Radbaz suggests that the reason the principle stated in Halachah 4 - that if another crop separates between two plantings of one crop, separate portions of <i>pe'ah</i> should be left - does not apply here is that there is no obligation to leave <i>pe'ah</i> for vegetables.</i>
[The following laws apply when a person] sowed an entire field with one crop, but when certain places in the field began to dry out, he uprooted or pulled out the crops that had dried out on either side until the fresh crops appeared as separate blocks. If it was customary for people to sow that crop in individual rows, e.g., dill or mustard seed,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that the Rambam's statements here appear to contradict his statement in <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 1:9, in which he states that it is customary to sow entire fields of mustard seed. They are, however, reinforced by his statements in <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 3:18.</i> he should leave <i>pe'ah</i> for each individual square, for an observer would say: "It was planted in separate rows."<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">And thus each square is considered as a separate field, requiring its own <i>pe'ah</i>.</i> If it was a species that was usually sown throughout an entire field, e.g., grain or legumes, he should leave one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire [field].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For the whole field will be considered as a single entity.</i>
When does the above apply? When there were dried out portions on either side and the fresh portion in the center.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For then it appears as a single field.</i> If, however, the fresh portions are on either side and the dried out portion is in the center, he should leave <i>pe'ah</i> separately for the dried out portion and the fresh portions.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For then each portion appears as a separate field. The Ra'avad disputes the Rambam's ruling based on his interpretation of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 3:1). The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain the Rambam's position within the context of that passage.</i>
[The following law applies when a person] sowed a field with onions, beans, peas,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that there are some species of peas that are considered vegetables - and for which <i>pe'ah</i> need not be left - and others are considered as legumes. Here we are speaking about a species that are considered legumes.</i> or the like. If he had the intent to sell some of the fresh produce in the marketplace and leave part of the field to dry out and to be put aside in storage, he is obligated to leave <i>pe'ah</i> separately for both the portion he sells and the portion he harvests for storage.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For each is considered as a separate harvest. The Radbaz explains that even if the person does not divide the field into separate portions, but rather harvests a small amount from each place both times, the two harvests are considered as separate. The difference in the time when they are harvested and the purpose for which they are harvested distinguishes them from each other.</i> For [produce sold in] the market and produce set aside in storage are considered as two separate types.
When a person sows his field with one species, he should leave one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> even though he collects the crops in two grain heaps.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is speaking about a situation where a person transgressed and harvested his entire field and then desires to correct his actions by leaving <i>pe'ah</i>. The Radbaz states that the Rambam's ruling applies even if he makes these grain heaps at separate times.</i> If he sows two species, even though he makes only one grain heap, he should leave <i>pe'ah</i> for each species separately.
[The following law applies when a person] sows two types of the same species, e.g., he sows two types of wheat<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 2:5), the Rambam gives examples: "thin kernels or thick kernels, red wheat and green wheat."</i> or two types of barley. If he stores them in one grain heap, he should leave one portion of <i>pe'ah</i>. If he stores them in two grain heaps, he should leave separate portions of <i>pe'ah</i>. This is a halachah communicated by Moses from Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a point from the Oral Tradition for which there is no direct source in the Written Law.</i>
When brothers have divided [the estate they inherited], they should leave <i>pe'ah</i> separately. If later<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Before the harvesting of the field (Radbaz).</i> they joined together in partnership, they should leave only one portion of <i>pe'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As is the law concerning partners (Chapter 2, Halachah 3).</i> When partners who have harvested half of a field break up the partnership, [one taking the grain that was harvested already and one taking the standing grain,] the one who took the grain that was harvested does not separate anything<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For at the time the grain was harvested, there was no obligation to separate <i>pe'ah</i> from it, for the obligation to separate <i>pe'ah</i> applies to the standing grain (Chapter 2, Halachah 4). Hence the partner who receives the harvested grain considers the situation analogous to that of a person who harvests half a field and then sells the remainder, in which instance, the purchaser - i.e., the second partner - is obligated to separate <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire field (<i>ibid.</i>:5).</i> and the one who took the standing grain is required to separate only for the half which he took.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that the second partner does not accept that rationale. Instead, he claims that we apply the principle of <i>bereirah</i> - that retroactively, it is considered as if the two partner's portions were divided from the outset. Thus from the outset, he was never required to do more than divide <i>pe'ah</i> from his individual portion.<br>One might protest that in this situation, the outcome is that the poor people do not receive their <i>pe'ah</i>. Indeed, that is the case. Our Sages did not resolve whether the principle of <i>bereirah</i> should be applied or not. Hence, each partner can claim that the responsibility for leaving <i>pe'ah</i> for the first half of the field lies on the other partner and not on him. Neither is not obligated to pay from his own funds, because in financial matters, we follow the principle: When one desires to expropriate money from a colleague, the burden of proof is upon him.</i> If, afterwards, they reestablished their partnership<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Before harvesting the second half of the field, agreeing that each one received half of the grain that was harvested and half of the grain to be harvested (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> and harvested the second half as partners, either one may separate [<i>pe'ah</i>] for his colleague's portion of the standing grain from his own portion of the standing grain,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since they reestablished their partnership, one <i>pe'ah</i> can be left for the remaining portion of the field.

[There are situations in which <i>pe'ah</i> may be given from different parts of a field for other parts of the same field that were harvested afterwards. For example, the grain of] half of a field ripened to a third of its maturity and half did not ripen to that extent. [The owner] harvested half of the portion that reached maturity.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">And did not leave <i>pe'ah</i> for this harvest although he was obligated to do so.</i> Afterwards, the remainder of the field ripened to one third and then he completed the harvest of the first half that reached [a third of its maturity] previously. He may separate [<i>pe'ah</i>] from [the crops] harvested first for the middle portion<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the crops that ripened initially, but were not harvested.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that this is preferable, because as mentioned previously, <i>pe'ah</i> should be left from standing grain for the portions harvested previously.</i> and on the last portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Since this portion ripened before the second portion was harvested, it and the second portion could be considered as part of a single field and one measure of <i>pe'ah</i> would be sufficient for them both.</i>
[The following laws apply when a person] sells separate portions in his field to different people. If he sold his entire field, each one of the purchasers should leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the portion that he purchased.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For each portion of the field is considered as a separate entity.</i> If the owner of the field had begun to harvest his field and sold a portion and retained a portion, the owner of the field should leave [the amount of] <i>pe'ah</i> appropriate for the entire field. [The rationale is that] since he began harvesting [the field] he became obligated to [separate <i>pe'ah</i> for] the entire [field].<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 138a derives this from the exegesis of Leviticus 23:22: "When you reap the harvest of your land" which implies that the obligation to leave <i>pe'ah</i> begins when on starts reaping.</i> If he sold [the portions of the field] before [he began harvesting], the purchaser should separate [<i>pe'ah</i>] for the portion he purchased and the owner for the remainder.
Only a high fence that separates between [the branches of] the trees divides an orchard with regard [to the laws of <i>pe'ah</i>]. If, however, the fence separates on a lower level, but the branches and the trellises are intermingled above and touch the top of the fence, the orchard is considered a single entity and [only] one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> should be given.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 2:3), it appears that if trees are separated by a fence that is ten handbreadths high, they are considered as in separate fields unless their branches are intermingled above. If their branches are intermingled above, they are considered as one field, regardless of the height of the fence.</i>
When two people purchased one tree [in partnership], they should leave one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> from it.

[The following laws apply to] carob trees:<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in contrast to other trees that are separated by fences, different laws apply with regard to carobs (Rav Yosef Corcus). The Ra'avad offers a different interpretation of this law.<br>The Ra'avad explains that carobs and olives (mentioned in the following halachah) are governed by different laws than other trees because they are tall and the branches of one tree are likely to become intermingled with another. The Radbaz does not accept this explanation, because palm trees are taller than carobs and olives and pear trees are also taller and more likely to be intermingled. He explains instead that these trees are singled out, because they are extremely common in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> Whenever one person stands next to one carob tree and his colleague stands next to another carob tree and they can see each other, [the trees] are considered as in one field and one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> should be left for them.<br>[Different rules apply] if, however, those on the extremes can see those in the center, but those on the extremes cannot see each other, he may separate from those on the extremes for those on the center and from those in the center for those on the extremes.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since they can see each other, the principles stated in the first clause apply.</i> He may not, however, separate from those on one extreme for those on the other extreme.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Because they cannot see each other.</i>
[The following laws apply to] olive trees: All the trees on one of the sides of a city, e.g., all of the olive trees on the entire western side or the entire eastern side of a city are considered as being from one field and one portion of <i>pe'ah</i> should be left for all of them.
A person who harvests a portion of his vineyard from either side in order to lessen [the demand] on the vines so that the other clusters will have more room and increase in size is called one who reduces.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The owner is not obligated to leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the fruit harvested for this reason, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> We already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halachah 6.</i> that a person who harvests from one side is not considered as one who reduces. Therefore he must leave the amount of <i>pe'ah</i> appropriate for the entire field even though he harvested [with the intent of selling the grapes in] the marketplace. If, however, he reduces [the produce on the vines with the intent of] selling [the produce] in the marketplace, he should not leave <i>pe'ah</i> for the produce that he took off.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">For the primary reason he harvested it was to diminish the pressure on his vines. Since he is not interested in the harvest <i>per se</i>, he is not obligated to leave <i>pe'ah</i>.</i> [Nevertheless,] if he reduces [the produce on the vines with the intent of] taking it home,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that he takes the produce home demonstrates that his harvest is a calculated act and hence requires <i>pe'ah</i>.</i> he should leave the amount of <i>pe'ah</i> appropriate for the entire field from [the grapes] he left to be trodden for the vat.

Chapter 4

What is meant by <i>leket</i>? Produce that fall from the sickle when one is reaping or falls from his hand when he gathers the stalks [of grain]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he was gathering several stalks of grain together in his hand in order to cut them with a sickle. In the process, some fell from his hand. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 4:10), the Rambam summarizes the principle as follows: "[Crops] encompassed by the hand or by the sickle that fall are <i>leket</i>."</i> and harvests. [The above applies] provided only one or two stalks fell. If, however, three fell at the same time, the three belong to the owner of the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For three is a significant quantity that the owner would not be willing to abandon willfully.</i> If grain fell from behind the sickle or behind one's hand,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., that fell when he moved the sickle or his hand back.</i> it is not <i>leket</i> even if only one stalk fell.
When he was harvesting by hand without a sickle, the stalks that fall from his hand are not <i>leket</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 4:5) derives this from exegesis of the phrase (Leviticus 23:22 : "You shall not gather the gleanings of your harvest." "Your harvest" implies crops cut with a sickle.</i> When, however, one pulls out crops that are usually pulled out by hand, those which fall from his hand are <i>leket</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This does not contradict the concept stated in the previous note. Since this is the usual way these crops are harvested, the laws of <i>leket</i> apply when produce falls from one's hands.</i> If he was harvesting [with a sickle] or pulling out crops that are usually pulled out and after he harvested an armful [of produce] or after he pulled out a handful, [the produce] fell from his hand because he was struck by a thorn, [the produce] belongs to the owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since it did not fall from his hand as a by-product of the harvesting process.</i>
[The following laws apply if a person] was harvesting and left a stalk of grain standing without harvesting it, although he harvested all the grain around it. If its tip could reach the standing grain at its side and it could be harvested with that grain, it belongs to the owner of the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifri</i> derives this law from the exegesis of the phrase (Deuteronomy 24:19 : "Do not return to take it." As long as the stalk of grain can be harvested together with the standing grain, one is not "going back" to harvest it. A question, however, arises: Why does the Rambam (and his source, <i>Pe'ah</i> 5:2) mention this law in the context of the laws of <i>leket</i> and not together with those governing <i>shichichah</i> (the subject of the verse cited)? This question is resolved in Halachah 4.</i> If not, it belongs to the poor.
[The following laws apply if] there were two stalks next to each other, the inner stalk could be harvested with [the remainder of] the standing grain<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">And thus meets the criteria mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> and the outer could be harvested together with the inner stalk, but not with the standing grain. The inner stalk is retrieved<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is considered as the owner's.</i> and it retrieves the outer stalk.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since it can be harvested together with the inner stalk, it is governed by the laws that apply to it.</i> For it is considered as falling from the sickle, even though it was not harvested yet.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the previous halachah and serves as an explanation why these stalks are considered as <i>leket</i> (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>Stalks that are among the straw belong to the owner of the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Because, generally, the laws of <i>leket</i> do not apply to grain that was not harvested.</i>
[The following laws apply when] the wind scattered sheaves [of grain] and the harvest belonging to the owner becomes mixed with the <i>leket</i>. We estimate how much <i>leket</i> the field would produce and that amount is given to the poor. [A greater amount is not required]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As in the following halachot, where the owner is penalized for mixing his harvest with the <i>leket</i>.</i> because this comes about due to forces beyond one's control. How much is this measure? Four <i>kabbin</i> for an area in which a <i>kor</i> of wheat would grow.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This area is 75000 sq. cubits. <i>Shiurei Torah</i> 3:31 states that according to the Rambam, a <i>kav</i> is equivalent to 1626 grams.</i>
What should the owner of a field do if <i>leket</i> fell to the ground, it was not collected by the poor and he made a grainheap of his harvest on this earth?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Thus mixing his harvest with the <i>leket</i>.</i> He should move his grain pile to another place, [but] all the stalks that are touching the ground belong to the poor. [The rationale is that] we do not know which of them was <i>leket</i> and whenever there is a doubt concerning [whether produce] is from the presents for the poor, [it is given] to the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz writes that, as stated in the following halachah, this measure is a penalty imposed upon the owner. Hence, even when there is no doubt involved, as exemplified there, we give the poor all the stalks that are touching the ground. Hence, the Rambam's words must be interpreted as meaning: Since we penalized the owner, the produce is taken from him in the case of a doubt.</i> [This is implied by the term (Leviticus 23:22 :] "Leave," i.e., leave from your produce for them.
Why don't we make an estimation and give the poor [the amount that would be left as <i>leket</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As in Halachah 5.</i> Because [the owner] transgressed and made his grainheap on <i>leket</i>, he was penalized, even if he did so inadvertently. Even if the <i>leket</i> was barley and he made a grainheap of wheat upon it,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">And thus there is no doubt which is <i>leket</i> and which is ordinary produce.</i> even if he called for the poor [to collect the <i>leket</i>] and they did not come, and even if others made the grainheap without his knowledge, all of the produce touching the ground belongs to the poor.
[The following laws apply when a person] must fertilize his field before the poor collect the <i>leket</i> in it. If his loss will be greater than the loss to the poor, he is permitted to fertilize it. If the loss to the poor will be greater than his loss, it is forbidden for him to fertilize. If he collects all the <i>leket</i> and places it on the fence until a poor person comes and collects it, that is an expression of the quality of piety.
When kernels of grain are found in ant holes, if the holes were located in the midst of the standing grain, [the kernels] belong to the owner of the field, for the poor people do not have a right to anything in the standing grain. If they were located in the place which was harvested,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 4:11), the Rambam speaks of the grain "behind the reapers."</i> they belong to the poor, because perhaps they were taken from the <i>leket</i>. Even if the kernel [in the hole] is black,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">And thus appears to have been there for a long time.</i> we do not say that it was from the previous year, because whenever there is a doubt concerning [whether produce] is <i>leket</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For it is possible that the black kernel is from the present year, but from inferior grain.</i> we consider it as <i>leket</i>.
When a stalk of <i>leket</i> becomes intermingled with the grain heap, the owner must separate two stalks. On the first, he says: "If this is <i>leket</i>, it belongs to the poor. If it is not <i>leket</i>, may the tithes for which I am obligated from this stalk<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">There is no obligation to separate tithes from <i>leket</i>. The stipulation is necessary because tithes must be separated while the produce is still in one's possession, before the stalk is given to the poor.</i> be fixed on the other stalk."<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">We have translated the Rambam's words directly, although there is an obvious difficulty with them. If we say, as implied by his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 5:2), that one of the stalks will be designated for the tithes, then since the identity of that stalk is not known and one of the stalks will be given to the poor, it is possible that the poor will be given the stalk that contains the tithes. Furthermore, <i>leket</i> cannot be used for tithes.<br>Therefore, the commentaries (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, <i>et al</i>) suggest that we are speaking about a third stalk which would also be used for the tithes of the entire field. The stipulations are made separately on the two stalks and then one is given to the poor and the other to the owner. And the third stalk is used for the tithes of the field.</i> He then goes back and makes this same stipulation on the second stalk. He then gives one of the stalks to the poor and the other one will be [part of] the tithes.
A person should not hire a worker<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a poor man who is entitled to collect <i>leket</i>.</i> with the intent that his son collect the <i>leket</i> after him.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this would be like a tip for the worker. In addition to his wages, he would receive the <i>leket</i> his son would collect. This is, however, considered as stealing from the poor, because the worker is likely to hire himself out for a lower wage in return for this consideration. As indicated by the continuation of the halachah, there is no difficulty with the worker's family collecting the <i>leket</i>. Since he - and/or they - are poor, they have that privilege. The difficulty is with stipulating it in his contract.</i> Sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and a person who purchased standing grain from a colleague to harvest, by contrast, may have their sons collect after them.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since they are not being paid a wage, but instead receive the produce and give a major share back to the owner, there is no difficulty in having the son collect the <i>leket</i> from the field, for they will not reduce their share for the license to have their son collect the <i>leket</i>. The other poor do not feel that the share-cropper is infringing upon their rights, because they expect that - were they to have the opportunity - their sons would be given the same privilege.</i> A worker may bring his wife and his children to collect <i>leket</i> after him.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As stated above, since the worker is poor, both his wife and his children are given this privilege.</i> [This applies] even if he hired him with the intent that he receive half of the harvest, one third, or one fourth as his wage.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tzaphnat Paneach</i> differentiates between this instance and that of the share-cropper mentioned in the previous clause, noting that here the worker's wife is mentioned and there she is not. He states that the wife of the sharecropper or the like is not entitled to collect the <i>leket</i>. Since he owns the produce, he is not entitled to collect a share. And since he is not entitled to collect a share, his wife may not do so either. His son may, however, because he is an independent person. The rationale is that the share-cropper is the owner of the harvest and he pays a share to the owner of the land. In this instance, by contrast, the harvest belongs to the owner and he pays a share to the worker. Hence, the worker is poor and his wife has the right to collect the <i>leket</i>.</i>
A person who does not allow the poor to collect the <i>leket</i>, allows one but does not allow another, or helps one of them, [giving him an advantage] over his colleagues is considered as stealing from the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For unlike <i>terumah</i> and other agricultural obligations, the owner has no right to control who will be the recipient of <i>leket</i>.</i>
It is forbidden for a person to have a lion or the like rest in his field so that the poor will fear and flee.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">And thus abandon the <i>leket</i>.</i> When there are those among the poor who are not entitled to collect <i>leket</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 13.</i> if the owner can rebuke them, he should. If not, he should allow them [to collect it as an expression of] the ways of peace.
If a person [desires to] declare [produce falling] as <i>leket</i> ownerless,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., instead of leaving it to be the property of the poor, he desires to declare it ownerless so that it can be acquired by the rich as well as the poor.</i> if the majority<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., once the majority has fallen, the status of the entire quantity is defined (Radbaz).</i> has already fallen, it is not ownerless. [The rationale is that] once the majority has left his hand, he no longer has authority over it.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">But instead, it belongs to the poor (see <i>Temurah</i> 25a).</i>
What is meant by <i>peret</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Individual grapes that fall that must be left for the poor, as stated in Leviticus 19:10.</i> One grape or two grapes that separate from the cluster in the midst of the harvest. If three grapes fall at the same time, they are not <i>peret</i>.
When a person was reaping [his grape harvest] and cut off a cluster, [that cluster] became entangled with its leaves and it fell to the ground and became divided into individual grapes, it is not <i>peret</i>. If, however, [the reaper] was harvesting and throwing the clusters to the earth, [more stringent rules apply]. Even if half the cluster is discovered [broken into individual grapes], it is <i>peret</i>. Similarly, [even] if an entire cluster was broken up into individual grapes, they are <i>peret</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This law follows the same logic which motivates Halachot 6-7 which states that an owner who makes a grainheap on the place where <i>leket</i> has fallen must give all the stalks touching the ground to the poor. In this instance as well, since his grapes become mixed with those which fell as <i>peret</i>, we penalize him preventing him from taking any of the individual grapes.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 6:4) mentions two opinions: one which states that this stringency applies only to half a cluster and one that it applies even to the entire cluster. The Rambam follows the latter view.</i> When a person places a basket below the vine at the time he is harvesting,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">So that all the individual grapes will fall into it.</i> he is stealing from the poor.
What is an <i>olelet</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">An underdeveloped grape cluster which should be left for the poor, as stated in Leviticus, <i>loc. cit.</i>.</i> This is a small cluster which is not thick like ordinary clusters and does not have a <i>kataf</i>, nor are its grapes <i>notfot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">These two Hebrew terms are defined in the following halachah.</i> one on top of the other, but rather scattered. If it has a <i>kataf</i>, but not a <i>nataf</i> or a <i>nataf</i>, but not a <i>kataf</i>, it belongs to the owner of the vineyard. If there is a doubt, it should be given to the poor.
What is <i>kataf</i>? Small clusters connected to the central stem<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term used by the Rambam literally means "backbone."</i> [of the larger cluster], one on top of the other. [What is] <i>nataf</i>? Grapes connected to the center stem and hanging down. [The above applies] provided all of the individual grapes in the <i>ollelot</i> can touch the palm of his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the small clusters are not large enough to prevent all the individual grapes from touching his palm.<br>The Ra'avad offers a different interpretation of this phrase which is taken from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 7:4). The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's interpretation.</i><br>Why is such [an underdeveloped cluster] called an <i>ollel</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Which means "infant" in Hebrew.</i> Because it is comparable to a developed cluster in the same way an infant is comparable to an adult.
The owner of the vineyard is not obligated to harvest the underdeveloped clusters and give them to the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As stated above with regard to <i>pe'ah</i> (Chapter 2, Halachah 15). Here too, the command for the mitzvah uses the term "leave," implying that the mitzvah is not to give the underdeveloped clusters to the poor, but to allow them to collect them.<br>The Radbaz writes that if a vine is elevated to a high trestle and it would be dangerous for the poor to climb up and collect the underdeveloped clusters, the owner should harvest them for the poor. Note the parallel in Chapter 2, Halachah 16.</i> Instead, [he should leave them for the poor] to harvest themselves. An individual grape is considered as an <i>ollelet</i>.
[The following laws apply when] there was a cluster on a branch of a vine and an underdeveloped cluster on an offshoot of the branch. If [the offshoot] can be harvested with the cluster, it belongs to the owner of the vineyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Thus this ruling parallels the ruling in Chapter 4, Halachah 3, with regard to <i>leket</i>.</i> If not, it belongs to the poor.
When a vineyard is comprised entirely of underdeveloped clusters, it belongs to the poor. [This is derived from Leviticus 19:10:] "Do not collect underdeveloped clusters in your vineyard," i.e., even if it comprises the entire vineyard. [The laws of] <i>peret</i> and <i>ollelot</i> apply only in a vineyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., and not to any other type of fruit.</i>
The poor do not have the right to take <i>peret</i> and <i>ollelot</i> until the owner of the vineyard begins harvesting his vineyard, as [Deuteronomy 24:21] states: "When you harvest your vineyard, do not collect underdeveloped clusters."<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the obligation to observe these mitzvot begins "When you harvest..." and not before.</i> How much must [the owner] harvest for [the poor] to receive this right? Three clusters that will produce a <i>revi'it</i> [of wine].
When a person consecrates his vineyard before he becomes aware of the underdeveloped clusters, the underdeveloped clusters do not belong to the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, they are included in his consecration.</i> If he has become aware of the underdeveloped clusters, the underdeveloped clusters belong to the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Once he becomes aware of the underdeveloped clusters, they become the property of the poor and the owner cannot consecrate them, because a person cannot consecrate property that does not belong to him (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Pe'ah</i> 7:8, based on the Jerusalem Talmud and <i>Arachin</i> 28a).<br><i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> asks: Since, as stated in the previous halachah, the poor are not entitled to the produce until the owner begins his harvest, seemingly, it remains the property of the owner and he has the right to consecrate it. He explains that although the poor do not have the right to collect it until the harvest begins, these clusters belong to them and not the owner and he does not have the right to consecrate them.</i> They must pay a fee for their [increase in value] while they grew<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for their increase in value from the time they were consecrated until they became ripe (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> to the Temple treasury.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Because the grapes from the clusters belonging to the poor are deriving benefit from land and vine consecrated to the Temple treasury.</i>
When one prunes a vine after he became aware of <i>ollelot</i>, he may prune according to his ordinary pattern. Just as he cuts off [fully-formed] clusters, he cuts off underdeveloped clusters.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., just as he shows no concern for the clusters that will ultimately be his, he may ignore those that will ultimately belong to the poor. For until the harvest, there is no prohibition against cutting them off. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Pe'ah</i> 7:5.</i>
When a gentile sells his vineyard to a Jew to harvest, the Jew is obligated to leave the underdeveloped clusters.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">For the obligation to leave <i>ollelot</i> takes effect only at the time of the harvest and the person performing the harvest is Jewish.<br>The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that the Rambam's source, the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Pe'ah</i>, the conclusion of ch. 3) also states the converse: that if a Jew sells his field to a gentile, the obligation to leave <i>ollelot</i> no longer applies and they question why the Rambam's omits this point.</i> When a Jew and a gentile are partners in a vineyard, there is an obligation [to leave] <i>ollelot</i> in the portion belonging to the Jew. That belonging to the gentile is exempt.
When the tithes [of a vineyard] were given to a Levite while they were still <i>tevel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Produce from which <i>terumah</i> has not been separated.</i> and <i>ollelot</i> were found in them, he should give them to a poor person.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">They belong to the poor and tithes need not be separated from them.</i> If they can be harvested with the cluster, he may use them as <i>terumat ma'aser</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The tenth which the Levites must separate from the tithes that they receive and give to the priests.</i> for other crops.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as stated in Halachah 20, they are the Levite's private property and he can do with them as he sees fit. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, but the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain the Rambam's position.</i>
[The following laws apply when a person] has five vines, harvests them, and [brings the grapes] into his home. If his intent is to eat them while they are grapes, he is not obligated [to leave] <i>peret</i>, <i>shichichah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad adds that he is also not obligated to leave <i>pe'ah</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that, as indicated by Chapter 2, Halachah 67, the Rambam would also accept this ruling.</i> and <i>[neta] revai'i</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Neta Revai'i</i> refers to the produce of the fourth year of a tree's growth which must be brought to Jerusalem and eaten in a state of ritual purity or exchanged for money that is brought to Jerusalem and used to purchase food that must be eaten in a state of ritual purity (see <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i>, chs. 9-10).<br>The owner is not considered as having harvested the grapes, but rather as having picked them for immediate use, e.g., as a snack. Hence he is freed from these obligations. <i>Rambam LeAm</i> accepts this explanation with regard to <i>peret</i> and <i>shichichah</i>, but not <i>neta revai'i</i>. With regard to the first two, the obligations are dependent on harvesting and he is not considered to have harvested his grapes, but <i>neta revai'i</i> is not connected with harvesting, but rather is an obligation incumbent on the crops themselves.</i> but is obligated [to leave] the <i>ollelot</i> [for the poor].<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>ollelot</i> belong to the poor and are not dependent on whether one harvests the grapes to use as wine or as fruit.</i> If he reaped them to make wine, he is obligated in all of the above unless he left a portion [unharvested].<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, he is not obligated for those he picked first, since he is not harvesting but taking the grapes for immediate use. The Ra'avad differs with this point and requires that the <i>pe'ah</i> for the entire crop be separated from the produce that remains and to leave <i>peret</i> and <i>shichichah</i>. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain the Rambam's position.</i>

Chapter 5

In none [of the following situations] is a [forgotten] sheaf [of grain] considered as <i>shichichah</i>. It was forgotten by workers and not forgotten by the owner of the field;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Note, however, the qualification in the following halachah.</i> it was forgotten by the owner of the field, but not the workers; or both these individuals forgot it, but there were others passing by<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., individuals who had no connection to the field.</i> who observed them at the time they forgot it. [To be <i>shichichah</i>] it must be forgotten by all people. Even a sheaf that was hidden away [purposely], if it is forgotten, it is <i>shichichah</i>.
When the owner of the field was in the city and he said: "I know that the workers forgot a sheaf in this-and-this place," [but afterwards, the owner]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This addition is made on the basis of the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. The Radbaz offers an alternate explanation.</i> forgot it, it is <i>shichichah</i>. If he was in the field and made such statements, but then forgot [the sheaf], it is not <i>shichichah</i>. [The rationale is that,] in a field, [only a sheaf] that was forgotten at the outset<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the owner forgot it before the workers did.</i> is <i>shichichah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">But if one was conscious of it at the outset, it is not <i>shichichah</i> even if it was forgotten afterwards. The rationale is that the owner retains possession of it, because it was located in his field with his knowledge. Hence, to release it from his possession, he would have to consciously absolve himself from ownership. Forgetting it is not sufficient.</i> In a city, by contrast, even if one remembered it and afterwards forgot it, it is <i>shichichah</i>, as [indicated by Deuteronomy 24:19]: "If you forget a sheaf in the field," [i.e., in the field,] but not in a city.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 11a derives this from the exegesis of the verse cited above.

If a person's sheaves flew into a field belonging to a colleague because of a strong wind and he forgot a sheaf there, it is not <i>shichichah</i>, for [Deuteronomy 24:19] states: "[If you reap] your harvest in <i>your</i> field."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this verse, which serves as the source for the command to leave <i>shichichah</i>, speaks only of "your field," and not a field belonging to a colleague.</i> If, however, the wind scattered the sheaves within his own field and he forgot them, it is <i>shichichah</i>.

What constitutes a place "where work is completed"? A place where one intends to collect all the sheaves and thresh them there or take them to the threshing floor. What constitutes a place "where work is not completed"? A place where sheaves are collected to bind them into larger sheaves to bring them to another place.

If [a tree] is distinguished in the mind of [the owner], it is as if it is well known and distinguished.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For he will remember it afterwards.</i> If an [olive tree] was located next to a palm tree, the palm causes it to be distinguished.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For it then has a specific location, like the tree next to the vat or next to the opening mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> If two trees are "flowing olives," each one causes the other to be distinguished.

When do the laws of <i>shichichah</i> apply with regard to [vines lifted on] a trellis?

When a person declares his vineyard ownerless and gets up early in the morning acquires it for himself and harvests it, he is bound by [the laws of] <i>peret, ollelot, shichichah</i>, and <i>peah</i>, for this can rightfully be called "your field" and "your vineyard."<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., these obligations apply only with regard to a field that one owns and not one that he acquires after the crops have already grown.

The commentaries note that the Rambam cites a different prooftext than Rashi (<i>Niddah</i> 51a) and other traditional sources.</i> It was his and now it is his. If, however, he acquired a field that had previously belonged to another person that was declared ownerless, he is exempt from all of these obligations.

When a person has [a quantity of] the tithe for the poor in his grainheap and he desires to give it to a poor person who is his relative or acquaintance, he should set aside half of it to give it to him and half to give to all the poor who pass by according to the measures mentioned above.
When does the concept that one must give a poor person enough to satisfy him apply? In the field. If, however, he has tithes in his home, he may divide it among all the poor people, giving each one even only an olive-sized portion,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">He must, however, give an olive-sized portion, because Deuteronomy, <i>loc. cit.</i>, speaks of "giv[ing]" and the term "giving" implies giving a significant amount. <i>Kritot</i> 6b states that anything less than an olive-sized portion is not significant.</i> for he is not commanded to give him an amount necessary to satisfy him except in a field, for there are no others there from whom to take, as [implied by] the verse: "And they shall eat in your gates and be satisfied."
If a man and a woman come to [a person possessing tithes] at home,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that certainly this law applies if the man and the woman approach the person apportioning his tithes in his fields.

When he accepted a field [with the proviso] that he receive a portion of the produce of the entire field, e.g., he was given a third or a fourth [of the harvest] as his wage. If, however, the owner of the field told him: "You will receive only a third of what you harvest," or "...a fourth of what you will harvest," [the harvester of the field] does not have a right to anything until he harvests it. Hence, at the time of the harvest, he is a poor man.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 5:5), the Rambam explains the difference between the two instances. In the first instance, the harvester has a right to the entire field even before he begins the harvest. Hence he is not considered as poor. In the second instance, since he does not own anything until the harvest is completed, he is considered as poor.</i> Therefore he is permitted [to collect] <i>leket, shichichah,</i> and <i>pe'ah</i>, but he is forbidden [to take] the tithe for the poor. [The rationale is that] the tithe for the poor is separated only after the harvest is completed and [at that time,] he has already acquired the portion he harvested.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is not necessarily that he is no longer poor, but that since he has a share in the harvest, he cannot take a portion for himself as stated in Halachah 10 (Radbaz).</i>
When a person sells his field - both the land and the produce<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, one owns the land and the other, the produce, they are both forbidden to acquire the presents for the poor.</i> - and becomes impoverished, he is permitted [to collect] <i>leket, shichichah, pe'ah</i>, and tithe for the poor from it.

Chapter 7

It is a positive commandment to give charity<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 195) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 479) include this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to the poor among the Jewish people,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Note, however, Halachah 7.</i> according to what is appropriate for the poor person<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his needs as defined by his social standing.</i> if this is within the financial capacity of the donor,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is not obligated to borrow to give charity to a colleague. Alternatively, he is not obligated to give more than one fifth of his own resources, as stated in Halachah 5 (Rav Yosef Corcus).</i> as [Deuteronomy 15:8] states: "You shall certainly open your hand to him." [Leviticus 25:35] states: "You shall support him, a stranger and a resident and they shall live with you," and [<i>ibid.</i>:36] states: "And your brother shall live with you."
Anyone who sees a poor person asking<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tzaphnat Paneach</i> states that the negative commandment is violated only when the poor person asks. If he does not, there is no prohibition.</i> and turns his eyes away from him and does not give him charity transgresses a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 232) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 478) includes this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Deuteronomy 15:7] states: "Do not harden your heart or close your hand against your brother, the poor person."
We are commanded to give a poor person according to what he lacks. If he lacks clothes, we should clothe him. If he lacks household utensils, we should purchase them for him. If he is unmarried, we should help him marry. And for an unmarried woman, we should find a husband for her.<br>Even if the personal habit of this poor person was to ride on a horse and to have a servant run before him<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">To announce his coming.</i> and then he became impoverished and lost his wealth, we should buy a horse for him to ride and a servant to run before him.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketubot</i> 67b relates that a person from a dignified family became impoverished and the great Sage Hillel would hire a servant to run before him and announce his coming. Once Hillel could not find such a servant and performed this service himself.</i> [This is implied by Deuteronomy 15:8 which] speaks [of providing him with] "enough to [fill the] lack that he feels."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Because of his previous lifestyle, this person feels a severe lack if he does not have these conveniences.</i> You are commanded to fill his lack, but you are not obligated to enrich him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Thus there are times when providing a certain person with what he feels are his needs will require a greater expense than providing another with what he views as luxuries.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 250:1) quotes the Rambam's ruling. The Rama states that this ruling applies to a collector of charity or to the community at large, but not to an individual person. An individual is not required to personally attempt to meet all of a colleague's needs. Instead, it is sufficient for him to inform the community of the problem. If, however, there are no communal resources, he is individually obligated to help the person if he has the capacity. See also Halachot 5 and 7 and notes.</i>
With regard to an orphan for whom people are seeking to find a wife for him to marry: First, we rent for him a house, provide for him a bed and all his household necessities and then we seek to find a wife for him to marry.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., first we provide him with those matters that are essential for him to maintain a household. Only afterwards do we assist him in marrying. See also <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 5:11 which states that a person should build a home and find a profession before marrying.</i>
When a poor person comes and asks for his needs to be met and the giver does not have the financial capacity, he should give him according to his financial capacity.<br>How much? The most desirable way of performing the mitzvah is to give one fifth of one's financial resources.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This also reflects an upper limit. As <i>Ketubot</i> 50a states: "Even a person who distributes money to charity with largess should not distribute more than a fifth." This concept is derived from Jacob's vow to tithe (Genesis 28:22 . There the verb which conveys the promise to tithe is repeated, allowing for the concept of giving two tithes. See also <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 8:13 which cites Leviticus 27:28 which speaks of a person designating a dedication offering "<i>from</i> all that is his." The Rambam continues:<br>[Implied is that he should not give] "all that is his," as our Sages explained. This is not piety, but foolishness, for he will lose all his money and become dependent on others. We should not show mercy to such a person. In a similar vein, our Sages said: "A man of foolish piety is among those who destroy the world." Instead, a person who distributes his money for mitzvot should not distribute more than a fifth, and he should conduct himself as our Prophets advised [cf. Psalms 112:5]: "He arranges his affairs with judgment," both with regard to matters involving Torah and worldly concerns.<br><i>Yayin Malchut</i> notes that in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1), the Rambam writes that as an act of piety, a person may give more than a fifth. Nevertheless, there is not necessarily a contradiction between the two. In his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam is speaking about giving to a needy person who asks for alms. In response to that acute need, one may give more that a fifth. Here the Rambam is speaking about giving to charity when there is no acute need. Hence a limit can be established. See also <i>Ketubot</i> 67b which states that these restrictions apply during a person's lifetime. He may leave a greater percentage of his resources to charity in his will.<br>In <i>Iggeret HaTeshuvah</i>, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi states that one may give more than a fifth of his resources to charity to atone for his sins, for just as one is not concerned with the amount one gives when it comes to healing a physical wound or blemish, so too, one should not be worried about cost when healing a spiritual blemish.</i> Giving one tenth is an ordinary measure.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifri</i> derives this from the fact that Deuteronomy 14:22, the verse that conveys the Biblical command to tithe repeats the verb, implying an obligation to tithe - not only one's produce - but all income.</i> Giving less [than that] reflects parsimony. A person should never refrain from giving less than a third of a shekel a year.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is slightly less than seven grams of silver.</i> A person who gives less than this has not fulfilled the mitzvah. Even a poor person who derives his livelihood from charity is obligated to give charity to another person.
When a poor person whose identity is unknown says: "I am hungry, provide me with food," we do not investigate whether he is a deceiver. Instead, we provide him with sustenance immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For hunger involves a risk to life. Clothing, by contrast, does not (<i>Bava Batra</i> 9a).</i> If he was unclothed and he said: "Cloth me," we investigate whether he is a deceiver. If we are familiar with him, we clothe him according to his honor<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">According to his social standing.</i> immediately and we do not investigate the matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For we are familiar with his character and do not think that he will prove to be a deceiver.</i>
We provide sustenance and clothing for the poor of the gentiles together with the poor of the Jewish people<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">One might interpret the Rambam's words as implying that only when a gentile comes together with a Jew should he be given charity, lest he feel that he is being subjected to discrimination. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 251:2, however, does not accept this interpretation and maintains that even if a gentile comes alone, he may be given charity.</i> as an expression of the ways of peace.<br>When a poor person<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This clause refers to a Jew.</i> begs from door to door, we do not give him a large gift.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For he is appealing to people at large for help. Hence, no one individual feels the onus to deal with his problem entirely.</i> Instead, we give him a small gift. It is forbidden to turn away a poor person who asks [for charity] empty-handed. Even giving him one fig [is sufficient], as [Psalms 74:21] states: "Let not the dejected turn away in shame."
When a poor person travels from place to place, we do not give him less than a loaf of bread that is sold for a <i>punidyon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Half a <i>me'ah</i>.

We assume that he will have with him provisions for at least one meal which he will use Sunday morning.</i> If we are familiar with him, we give him according to his honor.
When a poor person does not desire to take charity, we trick him and give it to him as a present or as a loan.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For in this way, he will not be embarrassed to take.</i> When a rich man starves himself, because he is miserly with his money, using it for neither food nor drink, we do not pay any attention to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not support him with charity.</i>
When a person does not want to give charity or desires to give less than what is appropriate for him, the court should compel him and give him stripes for rebellious conduct<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">A punishment instituted by the Sages in many instances including the failure to observe a positive Scriptural commandment.<br><i>Tosafot, Bava Batra</i> 8b, questions this ruling, noting that <i>Chulin</i> 110b states that a court is not obligated to administer punishment for any positive commandment for which a reward is given for its observance. And charity is one of the mitzvot for which we are promised a reward in this material world. The Radbaz explains that according to the Rambam, there is no difficulty, because according to the Rambam, the commandment to give charity is reinforced by a negative commandment, not to refrain from doing so. In such a situation, the principle cited from <i>Chulin</i> does not apply. The Radbaz also explains that we are more stringent in this instance, because the welfare of the poor is involved.</i> until he gives the amount it was estimated that he should give.

See also <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 12:15.</i> and expropriate the amount that is appropriate for him to give. We expropriate property for the sake of charity even on Fridays.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not excuse a person from giving based on the rationale that he is preoccupied with his Sabbath preparations.</i>
It is forbidden to demand and to collect charity from a soft-hearted person who gives more than is appropriate to charity<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Taanit</i> 24a relates that Rabbi Elazar of Birta would give all of his money to charity.

When a charity collector embarrasses such a person and asks him [for charity], [the charity collector] will be subjected to retribution in the future, as [implied by Jeremiah 30:20:] "I will visit My providence on those who pressure him."

A poor person who is one's relative receives priority over all others. The poor of one's household receive priority over the poor of one's city. And the poor of one's city receive priority over the poor of another city, as [implied by Deuteronomy 15:11]: "[You shall surely open your hand to] your brother,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">"Your brother" is mentioned first implying that a person's first responsibility is to his family.</i> the poor, and the destitute in your land."<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prooftext mentions "your land" to imply that one's first obligations is to give the poor that are in one's immediate proximity.<br>Although the poor of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> are given priority over the poor of other cities, they are not given priority of the poor of one's own city (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 251:6).</i>
When a person went on a business trip and the people of the city to which he traveled levy an assessment for charity upon him,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">It was customary in Talmudic times, for a community to request that a percentage of the profits from business dealings be given to charity.</i> he should give it to the poor of that city.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is only one person, he cannot argue that his failure to give charity will have a significant effect on the fortunes of the poor of his own city.</i> If there are many [such individuals]<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that we are speaking about an instance where the majority of the people in a city journey to do business in another city.

When a person says:<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 253:23) quotes this law with regard to a person's division of his estate on his deathbed.

Chapter 8

Charity is considered as a vow. Therefore one who says: "I pledge to give a <i>sela</i> to charity"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he accepts the obligation upon himself. This is referred to as a vow (<i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:2).</i> or "[I will give] this <i>sela</i> to charity,"<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Designating the coin for that purpose. This is referred to as a donation (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> he is obligated to give it [to charity] immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For one is obligated to fulfill his pledges at the earliest possible date.</i> If he delays, he transgresses the commandment against delaying [the observance of one's vow],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 23:22 commands: "Do not delay in paying it" and <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 14:13 considers the prohibition against delaying payment of one's vows as one of the 613 commandments.</i> for he has the capacity to make the gift immediately and [generally,] there are poor people at hand.<br>If there are no poor people at hand, he should set aside [the donation] and put it away until he finds poor people.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He does not, however, have to seek out poor people to give it to them (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 257:5).</i> If he made a stipulation that he is not obligated to make the donation until he finds poor people, he does not have to separate it [until the poor are at hand]. Similarly, if he made a stipulation at the time he made his vow to charity or pledged his donation that the trustees of the charitable fund could exchange it for gold, they are permitted to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Compare to Halachah 4.</i>
When a person extends a vow made to charity, he is obligated as is the case with regard to other vows.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:3-4.</i><br>What is implied? If he said: "This <i>sela</i> is like this one [given to charity], it is also charity. When a person sets aside a <i>sela</i> and says: "This is charity" and then takes another <i>sela</i> and says: "And this," the second is also charity even though he did not say so explicitly.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Nedarim</i> 7a leaves this matter unresolved, the Rambam and other authorities rule stringently.</i>
When a person takes a vow [to give charity], but does not remember how much he vowed to give, he should give until he says: "I did not intend [to give] this [much]."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we obligate him to give until he is certain that he gave an amount that surpassed his vow.</i>
[The following rules apply] both to a person who says: "This <i>sela</i> is charity" and one who says: "I pledge a <i>sela</i> for charity" and sets it aside. If he desires to exchange it with another [coin], he is permitted to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike a coin consecrated to the Temple treasury, there is no necessity for a formal process of exchange. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 259:1) mention a further leniency, stating that a person may lend out this money - either to himself or to others. See Halachah 5.</i> Once it reaches the hand of the treasurer of the charity, it is forbidden to be exchanged. If the treasurer of the charity desires to exchange the common currency for <i>dinarim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., taking petty change and exchanging it for larger coins.</i> they are not permitted to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Lest they be suspected of profiting on the exchange.</i> If there are no poor among whom to distribute the funds, they should have others exchange the coins,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">And thus that suspicion will not apply.</i> but they should not do so themselves.
If the poor would benefit from the delay of the money in the possession of the charity collector so that he could motivate others to give,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as long as they hold the money in their possession, they will continue trying to influence others to give. Once they give the money to the poor, we fear that they will cease their efforts.</i> that charity collector may borrow the money and pay [when the funds are required]. For charity does not resemble funds dedicated to the Temple treasury from which it is forbidden to benefit.
When a person donates a candelabra or a lamp to a synagogue, it is forbidden to exchange it.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to sell it and use the money for another charitable purpose.</i> If it is for a sacramental purpose, it is permitted to exchange it, even though the name of the donor is still associated with it, e.g., it is said: "This is so-and-so's candelabra" or "...so-and-so's lamp."<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that, for that same purpose, if the name of the donor is engraved upon it, it may not be sold for a non-sacramental purpose. This ruling is quoted by the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 259:3).</i> If the name of the donor is no longer associated with it, it may be exchanged<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">From the wording of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 259:3), the <i>Turei Zahav</i> infers that the decision to exchange the article must be made by the community. It is not sufficient for the trustee of the synagogue to make it alone.</i> even for matters that are not sacramental in nature.
When does the above apply? When the donor was Jewish. If, however, he was a gentile, it is forbidden to exchange it even for matters that are sacramental in nature as long as the name of the donor is still associated with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the donor's name is no longer associated with it, it may be sold (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 259:13).</i> [We fear that] the gentile might say: "I consecrated an article to the Jews' synagogue and they sold it for their own purposes."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This would lead to the desecration of God's name (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 259:6).</i>
When a gentile seeks to make a donation to the Temple treasury, initially, we do not accept it. If, however, it was taken from him, we do not return it to him. If it was a specific article, e.g., a beam or a stone, we return it to him so that there will not be a specific entity in the Temple associated with [a gentile], as [Ezra 4:3] states: "It is not for you,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">These words were originally addressed to the heads of the gentile nations who offered to help the Jews who returned to Zion rebuild the Temple. Nevertheless, they apply with regard to all gentiles in every age.</i> together with us to build a Temple for our God."<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues: "Instead, we ourselves will build it."</i> For a synagogue, by contrast, we may accept their [donations, even] initially, provided they say: "I am donating it according to the intent of the Jewish people." If he does not say so, it must be entombed, for perhaps his intent was to consecrate it unto God.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">And thus it would be forbidden to benefit from it.</i> We do not receive donations<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., specific entities like beams or stones.

It is forbidden for a Jew to receive charity from a gentile<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 10:10, we can assume that this is speaking about an idolater. If, however, a gentile accepts upon himself the observance of the Seven Universal Laws commanded to Noah and his descendants, we are permitted to accept charity from him.</i> in public.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The impression that the Jews cannot take care of their own and must rely on the gentiles for charity degrades the honor of God's name (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 254:1). If, however, the gentiles' charity is given in private, there is no difficulty in accepting it. Indeed, a person who accepts charity from the gentiles in public is not acceptable as a witness (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 11:5).</i> If he is unable to subsist on the charity given by the Jews and it is impossible to receive charity from the gentiles in private, it is permitted.<br>When a gentile king or official sends money to the Jews for charity, we do not return it to him so as [not to jeopardize] peaceful relations with the king.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For it is highly likely that the king would take offense were he to hear that his charity was spurned.</i> Instead, we take [the charity] from him and give it to the gentile poor in secret<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">We do not give it to the Jews, less this generate merit for the gentile king and allow his kingship to prosper (<i>Bava Batra</i> 10b).</i> so that the king will not hear.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For diverting the charity from its intended purpose is also likely to arouse the king's rage.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 254:2) quotes the Rambam's ruling. The Rama states that the king's wishes should be heeded.</i>
The redemption of captives receives priority over sustaining the poor and providing them with clothing. [Indeed,] there is no greater mitzvah than the redemption of captives.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For as the Rambam continues to explain, all of the different aspects of charitable gifts are included in the redemption of captives (<i>Bava Batra</i> 8b).</i> For a captive is among those who are hungry, thirsty, and unclothed and he is in mortal peril.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For at any time, his captors may take his life.</i> If someone pays no attention to his redemption, he violates the negative commandments: "Do not harden your heart or close your hand" (Deuteronomy 15:7 , "Do not stand by when the blood of your neighbor is in danger" (Leviticus 19:16 , and "He shall not oppress him with exhausting work in your presence" (<i>ibid.</i> 25:53). And he has negated the observance of the positive commandments: "You shall certainly open up your hand to him" (Deuteronomy 15:8 , "And your brother shall live with you" (<i>ibid.</i> 19:18), "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18 , "Save those who are taken for death" (Proverbs 24:11 , and many other decrees of this nature. There is no mitzvah as great as the redemption of captives.
When the inhabitants of a city collected money for building a synagogue and a purpose associated with a mitzvah arose, they may use the money for that purpose. If they purchased stones and beams, they should not sell them [and use the proceeds] for a purpose associated with a mitzvah other than the redemption of captives.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">An exception is made in this instance, because the captives' lives are at risk.</i> Even though they brought the stones [to the building site], cut the beams and shaped them to size, and prepared everything for building, it should all be sold, [but] only for the sake of redeeming captives. If they built [the synagogue] and completed it,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's wording, the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 252:21 infers that if the building is not complete, it may be sold.</i> it should not be sold. Instead, the funds necessary to redeem the captives should be raised from the community.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 252:1 states that if the community has no way of raising the funds through other means, it may sell the synagogue.</i>
We do not redeem captives for more than their worth<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are evaluated like servants sold at a slave market (Meiri, <i>Gittin</i> 45a).</i> for the benefit of the world at large, i.e., so that enemies will not pursue people to hold them captive.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin, loc. cit.</i> gives two reasons:<br>a) Were lawless men to know that they could receive exorbitant prices for the redemption of captives, they would be encouraged to kidnap them frequently.<br>b) this would be very taxing for the community.<br>The Rambam follows the latter view. Hence, even family members who would be willing to pay the extra expense are forbidden to do so (Radbaz). When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 252:4) states that if the captive is a Torah scholar, an exception can be made and he may be redeemed for more than his worth.</i> We do not assist captives in escaping, for the benefit of the world at large, i.e., so that enemies will not oppress captives seriously and be very strict when guarding them.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if captives were wont to be helped to escape, kidnappers would become very strict and harsh when guarding other captives in the future.</i>
When a person sold himself and his children [as servants] to gentiles or borrowed money from them and they held him captive or imprisoned him [because of his failure to pay] the loan, it is a mitzvah to redeem him the first or second time [he is held]. [If this happens] a third time, we do not redeem him.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For it appears that the father has no compunctions against selling himself or his children and thus the situation will merely repeat itself.</i> We do, however, redeem the sons after their father's passing.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Lest they become assimilated among the nations. During their fathers' lifetime, by contrast, we presume that he will educate them concerning their Jewish heritage even when they are held by the gentiles (Rashi, <i>Gittin</i> 47a).</i> If they sought to kill him, we redeem him from their hands even if he [has been held captive] several times.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For we do not place any financial concerns above Jewish life.</i>
When a servant is held captive, since he immersed himself [in the <i>mikveh</i>] and accepted the mitzvot,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:11, 14:9, which explain that these steps are necessary for a servant to attain the status of a servant of the Jewish people.</i> he should be redeemed like a Jew who has been taken captive. When a captive abandons his faith even with regard to only one mitzvah, e.g., he eats meat from animals that were not ritually slaughtered with the intent of angering God<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he transgresses because it is to his benefit to do so, he may be redeemed, but there is no obligation to redeem him [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 251:2)].</i> or the like, it is forbidden to redeem him.
A woman receives precedence over a man with regard to being given sustenance, clothing, and to be redeemed from captivity.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">There is another reason to give a woman precedence with regard to the redemption from captivity: We fear that the woman may be raped.</i> [The rationale is that] it is common for a man to beg, but not for a woman and this is extremely embarrassing for her. If they were both held in captivity and they were both solicited for a transgression,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is using a euphemism for sexual relations.</i> the man should be redeemed first, because this is not ordinary for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., sodomic rape is against a man's nature. Hence it is more shameful than ordinary rape.</i>
When a male and female orphan come seeking assistance in marriage, we assist the woman before the man, because the woman's shame is greater. She should not be given less than the weight of six and a quarter <i>dinarim</i> of pure silver.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketubot</i> 67b says the woman should be given 50 <i>dinarim</i>, but those are not pure silver. Instead, they were seven eights base metals and one eighth pure silver.</i> If the treasury of the charitable fund has the means, we give the money according to her honor.
If there were many poor people or many captives and one does not have the means to provide sustenance or clothing for all of them or to redeem all of them, a priest is given precedence over a Levite.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. we give respect to the holiness of the priest's lineage.</i> A Levite is given precedence over an Israelite. An Israelite is given precedence over a <i>challal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>challal</i> refers to the offspring of a priest who was born from intimate relations forbidden to a priest or is the descendant of the offspring of such relations. See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>, ch. 19. Such a person - and similarly, those that are mentioned afterwards - is considered to be of blemished lineage. The extent of the blemish determines the person's place on the ladder of precedence. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Horiot</i> 3:8) which mentions further details concerning this order of succession.</i> a <i>challal</i> over a <i>shituki</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>shituki</i> means "one who is silenced" and refers to a child who knows the identity of his mother, but does not definitely know the identity of his father.

Both a <i>shituki</i> and an <i>asufi</i> are <i>mamzerim</i> of questionable status, i.e., it is possible that they are <i>mamzerim</i> and it is possible that they are not. Hence, they are given precedence over a person who is definitely a <i>mamzer</i> [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>)].</i> an <i>asufi</i> over a <i>mamzer</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>mamzer</i> refers to a child who was born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship.

Joshua decreed that they be forbidden to marry among the Jewish people. David reinforced that decree, causing it to apply even at a time when the Sanctuary is no longer standing (<i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 12:22-23).</i> and a <i>netin</i> over a convert. [The rationale for the latter is that] a <i>netin</i> grew up with us in holiness.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as a Jew, and was educated in an environment of holiness 13 [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>)].</i> A convert is granted precedence over a freed servant, for [the latter] was originally among those who were "cursed."<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to servants, it is written (Genesis 9:25 : "Cursed is Canaan.

When does the above apply? When the two [captives] were equal in knowledge. If, however, a High Priest<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Who is given the highest degree of respect in terms of position [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>)].</i> was unlearned and a <i>mamzer</i> was a Torah scholar, the Torah scholar receives precedence.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:2 interprets Proverbs 3:15 which states that the Torah is "Dearer than pearls" (<i>mip'ninim</i>) as meaning that the Torah receives precedence over the High Priest who enters the inner most chamber (<i>lifnei ulifni'im</i>).</i> Whoever surpasses his colleague in knowledge receives precedence over his colleague.<br>If, however, one [of the poor or the captives] is one's teacher or father,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam mentions the teacher before the father, because that is the order of precedence.

Chapter 9

In every city where Jews live, they are obligated to appoint faithful,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, the conclusion of Halachah 8.</i> men of renown as trustees of a charitable fund. They should circulate among the people from Friday to Friday and take from each person what is appropriate for him to give and the assessment made upon him. They then allocate the money from Friday to Friday, giving each poor person sufficient food for seven days. This is called the <i>kupah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The term literally means "container" and refers to the charity box in which donations were placed and by extension, to the fund financed by those collections.</i>
Similarly, we appoint trustees who take bread, different types of food, fruit, or money from every courtyard from those who make a spontaneous donation and divide what was collected among the poor in the evening, giving each poor person sustenance for that day. This is called the <i>tamchui</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Keilim</i> 13:3), the Rambam defines this term as a pot with compartments.</i>
We have never seen nor heard of a Jewish community that does not have a <i>kupah</i> for charity. A <i>tamchui</i>, by contrast, exists in some communities, but not in others. The common practice at present is that the trustees of the <i>kupah</i> circulate [among the community and collect] every day and divide [the proceeds] every Friday.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">So that the poor will have their Sabbath needs provided for.</i>
On fast days, we distribute food to the poor. Whenever there is a fast day on which the people eat and went to bed without distributing charity to the poor, they are considered as murderers.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">On fast days, it was customary to distribute food to the poor after the evening service at the conclusion of the fast. Since the poor would look forward to this meal and rely on it to break their fast. If it was not provided to them, they would go to bed without food (Rashi, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 35a).</i> Concerning them, the Oral Tradition says [Isaiah 1:21]:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">We have translated the verse according to the meaning with which it is employed by the Rambam. In its literal context, it would be translated differently.</i> "Charity is held overnight and now [you are] murderers."<br>When does this apply? When they did not give them bread and fruit which is [usually] eaten together with bread, e.g., dates and grapes. If, however, they delayed the delivery of money or wheat, they are not considered as murderers.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Because regardless, this does not provide the poor with readily available food and they were not depending on it for their meal (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i>
[Money for] the <i>kupah</i> should be collected only by two people together,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Three individuals are not necessary for we are speaking about a specific sum levied upon each person and there is no aspect of judgment involved (<i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> 35a).</i> for no less than two communal trustees should ever be appointed over the financial interests of the community. It is permitted to entrust the money of the <i>kupah</i> to one person, but [the funds] should not be distributed by less than three trustees, because [the allocation] is comparable to a judgment concerning financial matters, since each person is given his needs for that week. [Donations for] the <i>tamchui</i> should be collected by three - because it does not involve a fixed amount<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since it does not involve a fixed amount, it is comparable to a judgment and hence, requires three individuals (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, as quoted by the Radbaz).</i> - and it is distributed by three.
[Donations for] the <i>tamchui</i> are collected every day. [Those for] the <i>kupah</i> are collected from Friday until Friday. [The gifts from] the <i>tamchui</i> are given [also]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This bracketed addition is based on the gloss of the Radbaz who emphasizes that the <i>kupah</i> was intended to provide the local poor people with their essential needs, while the <i>tamchui</i> was intended as a supplement for them from which others were also allowed to take. From other authorities, however, it appears that the intent is that only poor people from other places are allowed to benefit from the <i>tamchui</i>.</i> to poor people at large.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., including poor people from other places.</i> [Those from] the <i>kupah</i> are given only to the poor of that city.
The inhabitants of a city have permission to give [the donations given to] the <i>kupah</i> to the <i>tamchui</i> and [those given for] the <i>tamchui</i> to the <i>kupah</i>. Similarly, they may exchange [these donations] for any communal purpose that they desire even though a stipulation to that effect was not made when they were collected.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, a stipulation was made that the funds donated be used for a specific charitable purpose, they may be used only for that purpose.</i> If there is a great sage in that city dependent on whose judgment all collections are made<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 256:4) states that this same law applies with regard to a charity collector appointed by the community.</i> and he is the one who allocates the funds to the poor according to his assessment, he is permitted to use [these funds] for any communal purpose he sees fit.
Trustees of a charitable fund are not permitted to depart from each other in the marketplace<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In this way, no one will have the impression that the trustee misappropriated the money (Rashi, <i>Bava Batra</i> 9b).</i> [except for a brief time], e.g., one goes to the gate to collect and the other to a shop.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in a manner in which each remains in the other's sight (<i>Bava Batra, loc. cit.</i>).</i>
If a charity trustee finds money in the marketplace,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Which as the discoverer he is entitled to keep for himself.</i> he should not put it into his own pocket,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Lest people say that he is taking money from the charitable fund (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> but instead into the wallet of the charitable fund.

If a charity trustee is owed money by a colleague and [the latter] pays him in the marketplace, he should not put [this money] in his pocket, but instead into the wallet of the charitable fund.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Lest people say that he is taking money from the charitable fund (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> When he comes home, he should take it [for himself].<br>He should not count out the money of the charitable fund in pairs, but rather one coin at a time, lest suspicions be aroused,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., people might say that he is counting pairs and then taking one of each pair for himself (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> as [implied by Numbers 32:22]: "And you shall be guiltless in the eyes of God and Israel."<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Implied is that not only should one not transgress, but that there would not be the slightest suspicion of transgression.</i>
When the trustee of a charitable fund does not have poor people to whom to distribute the money, he may exchange the coins for <i>dinarim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Coins of greater worth.</i> Another person, however, [should carry out the transaction], not he himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Lest people think that he is profiting by the transaction.</i><br>When the trustee of a <i>tamchui</i> does not have poor people to whom to distribute [the food he collected], he should sell it to others,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">And use the proceeds for the <i>tamchui</i> at a later date.</i> but not to himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Lest people think that he is profiting by the transaction.</i><br>We do not enter into a reckoning with the trustee of a charitable fund concerning the charity he collected<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not ask them to make a precise reckoning of the income and expenses of the charitable fund.</i> or with the treasures of the Temple regarding funds consecrated to them, as stated [in II Kings 22:7]: "No reckoning shall be made with them for the money entrusted to them because they are acting in good faith."<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This verse describes the practice conducted by King Josiah with regard to the money collected from the people for the renovation of the Temple.

The Rama adds that, in the spirit of the verse from Numbers cited above, it is desirable for a trustee to give an account. Moreover, he continues, the above applies only with regard to those trustees who have an honorable reputation and who were appointed to their position by the community. If a trustee does not have such a reputation or he seized his position by force, he is required to make an accounting.</i>
When a person has lived in a city for 30 days, we compel him to give charity to the <i>kupah</i> together with the inhabitants of the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the <i>kupah</i> represents the most urgent needs of a community. Hence, as soon as a person has been there for a significant time, he is required to pay the levy for that fund. The longer he stays in the community, the more communal responsibility he is required to take.</i> If he dwelled there for three months, we compel him to contribute to the <i>tamchui</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that the standard version of <i>Bava Batra</i> 8b, the source for the Rambam's ruling, reverses the text and makes one responsible for the <i>tamchui</i> before the <i>kupah</i>. They explain, however, that there are versions of the text that support the Rambam's ruling. It is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 256:5).</i> If he dwelled there for six months, we compel him to contribute to the fund used to clothe the poor of the city. If he dwelled there for nine months, we compel him to contribute to the fund used for the burial of the poor of the city and the provision of all their burial needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) emphasizes that these guidelines apply when a person has not expressed his intentions to become part of the city he is visiting. If, however, a visitor decides to become a permanent resident in a city, he immediately becomes responsible for all charitable levies.</i>
When a person has enough food for two meals, it is forbidden for him to take from the <i>tamchui</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since he has enough food for the day, he should not take from the fund whose purpose is to provide people with their food for the day [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 8:7)].</i> When he has enough food for fourteen meals, he should not take from the <i>kupah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since he has enough food for the week, he should not take from the fund whose purpose is to provide people with their food for the week (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> If he has 200 <i>zuz</i>, even if he does not invest or do business with them - or 50 <i>zuz</i> that he invests<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For 50 <i>zuz</i> which one invests and uses to earn income is more desirable than 200 that do not provide one with income.</i> - he should not take <i>shichachah, peah</i>, or the tithe for the poor.

When a poor person is in need, but owns a courtyard and household utensils - even silver and golden utensils - we do not obligate him to sell his house and his personal possessions. Instead, he is permitted to accept [charity] and it is a mitzvah to give him.<br>When does the above apply? With regard to eating utensils, drinking utensils, clothing, bedding, and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., functional utensils, used in his day-to-day life. Since he has become used to valuable utensils, he will not feel comfortable using lesser ones (<i>Ketubot</i> 68a).</i> If, however, he owns a golden comb or pestle or the like, he should sell them and buy less valuable ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since these utensils are used for simple purposes, there is no difficulty in using less valuable ones.</i><br>When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The leniency of the first clause which allows the person to maintain possession of his property.</i> apply? Before he has descended to the level where he takes charity from people at large.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he is given charity by individuals, but not by the community at large [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 253:1)].</i> Once he collects charity [from the community], we obligate him to sell his utensils and purchase lesser ones and then accept charity.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is improper that a person of some means should receive communal funds and, in this way, reduce the amount given to poor people who have no resources whatsoever (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Pe'ah</i> 8:8).<br>After quoting the Rambam's ruling, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) states: "There are opinions that maintain that the above measures applied only in their era. In the present time, by contrast, a person may accept [charity] until he has sufficient principle [to invest] so that he and his family can sustain themselves from the profits. These are words of reason."</i>
When a man of means is in the midst of a journey from city to city, he used up all his money on the journey, and he does not have anything to eat, it is permitted for him to take <i>leket, shichachah, pe'ah</i>, and the tithe for the poor and he may benefit from charity. When he returns to his home,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">And has money at hand again.</i> he is not obligated to pay, because he was poor at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 5:4), the Rambam writes that it is pious behavior to repay the money one received from charity.</i> To what can this be compared? To a poor person who became wealthy who is not obligated to pay back [the charity he received while poor].
When a person possesses homes, fields, and vineyards<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a home that he does not dwell in since, as stated in Halachah 14, we do not obligate him to sell his home.</i> which were he to sell them in the winter, he would be forced to sell them cheaply,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For market conditions would dictate lower prices at that time, since the purchaser will not begin to benefit from the fields and vineyards until the spring (Rashi, <i>Bava Kama</i> 7a).</i> but were he to leave them until the summer, he would be able to sell them at their worth, we do not obligate him to sell them [in the winter]. Instead, we enable him to partake of the tithe of the poor [until he partakes of] half the worth of his property<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">We do not give him more than that amount, for a person will never lose more than half the value of his property by selling it at an unsuitable time (Radbaz).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 253:3) quotes the Rambam's ruling. The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama interpret the passage from <i>Bava Kama</i> differently. According to their perspective, we enable him to receive charity until he finds someone who is willing to purchase his property at half price.</i> [so that] he will not be pressed to sell outside the [appropriate] time to sell.
If people at large were purchasing property at high prices,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, property prices at large are depressed, we do not allow one to gain time by benefiting from charity (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 253:7).</i> but he could only find people to purchase from him cheaply, because he is pressed for funds and preoccupied,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since people at large are aware of his plight, they would only offer him low prices in an attempt to pressure him to sell.</i> we do not require him to sell [at a low price]. Instead, he is allowed to continue to partake of the tithe for the poor<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">And thus he will not be in immediate need of funds.</i> until he can sell his property at its worth and everyone will know that he is not under pressure to sell.
When funds were collected for a poor person to satisfy his lack and [the collection] exceeded his needs, the additional funds belong to him. Extra funds [donated for] the poor should be given to the poor. Extra funds [donated for the redemption of] captives should be used for that purpose.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to redeem other captives in the future.</i> Extra funds [donated for the redemption of] one individual captive should be given to that captive.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">To use for the rehabilitation of his personal situation.</i> Extra funds [donated for the burial of] the deceased should be used for that purpose.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to bury other deceased individuals in the future.</i> Extra funds [donated for the burial of] an individual deceased person should be given to his heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The intent is not that the deceased acquired the money and his heirs inherited it from him, for he never formally acquired it. Instead, since there was a certain measure of embarrassment involved for the deceased in having the money raised, he is willing to grant the financial benefit for that embarrassment to his heirs (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 48a).<br>After quoting these laws, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 253:6) states: "If the communal officers see that there is an immediate need and they wish to change [the objective to which charity is given], they have that authority."</i>
When a poor person gives a <i>p'rutah</i> to the <i>tamchui</i> or to the <i>kupah</i>, we accept it from him. If he does not give, we do not require him to give.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Even though, as stated in Chapter 7, Halachah 5, even a poor person who derives his livelihood from charity is obligated to give charity, that obligation is his own responsibility. The community does not compel him to give (Radbaz). Alternatively, that obligation applies only when he has enough for his livelihood. If he does not have enough, he is not required to give (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 253:11).</i> If he was given new clothes and he gave them back his worn clothes, we accept them from him. If he does not give them, we do not require him to.

Chapter 10

We are obligated to be careful with regard to the mitzvah of charity to a greater extent than all [other] positive commandments,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, <i>Bava Batra</i> 9a states that charity is equivalent to all the mitzvot.</i> because charity is an identifying mark for a righteous person, a descendant of Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, <i>Yevamot</i> 79a mentions deeds of kindness as one of the three distinguishing signs of the Jewish people.</i> our patriarch, as [Genesis 18:19] states: "I have known him, because he commands his children... to perform charity." The throne of Israel will not be established, nor will the true faith stand except through charity, as [Isaiah 54:14] states: "You shall be established through righteousness." And Israel will be redeemed solely through charity, as [<i>ibid.</i> 1:27] states: "Zion will be redeemed through judgment and those who return to her through charity."
A person will never become impoverished from giving charity. No harm nor damage will ever be caused because of charity,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">On the contrary, it leads to blessing, as Proverbs 28:27 states: "He who gives to the poor will not lack."</i> as [<i>ibid.</i> 32:17] states: "And the deed of charity is peace." Everyone who is merciful evokes mercy from others, as [Deuteronomy 13:18] states: "And He shall grant you mercy and shower mercy upon you and multiply you." Whenever a person is cruel and does not show mercy, his lineage is suspect,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beitzah</i> 32b states: "Whenever one does not show mercy to the created beings, it can be recognized that he is not from the seed of Abraham our patriarch."</i> for cruelty is found only among the gentiles, as [Jeremiah 50:42] states: "They are cruel and will not show mercy."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See also the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Avadim</i>.</i><br>The entire Jewish people and all those who attach themselves to them are as brothers, as [Deuteronomy 14:1] states: "You are children unto God your Lord." And if a brother will not show mercy to a brother, who will show mercy to them? To whom do the poor of Israel lift up their eyes? To the gentiles who hate them and pursue them? Behold their eyes are pointed to their brethren alone.
Anyone who turns his eyes away from [giving] charity is described as being "rebellious" like someone who worships false divinities is described as "rebellious, as [Deuteronomy 13:14] states with regard to the worship of false divinities: "Rebellious men went out." And with regard to a person who turns his eyes away from [giving] charity, [<i>ibid.</i> 15:9] states: "Be careful, lest a rebellious thought arise in your heart." Such a person is also called "wicked," as [Proverbs 12:10] states: "The mercies of the wicked are cruel." And he is called a sinner, as [Deuteronomy, <i>loc. cit.</i>,] states: "And he shall cry out against you to God and you will be deemed as sinning." The Holy One, blessed be He, is close to the outcry of the poor, as it is written:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">There is no verse that fits the wording the Rambam quotes. Commentaries have notes that Job 34:28 reads: "He hears the cry of the poor" and Psalms 22:25 states: "And when he cries out to Him, He will listen."</i> "You hear the outcry of the poor." Therefore one must be careful with regard to their outcry, for a covenant has been established with them, as [Exodus 22:26] states: "When he will cry out to Me, I will listen, for I am compassionate."
Whenever a person gives charity to a poor person with an unpleasant countenance and with his face buried in the earth, he loses and destroys his merit<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chagigah</i> 5a states that it is preferable for one not to give charity at all than for him to give in an undesirable manner."</i> even if he gives him 1000 gold pieces. Instead, he should give him with a pleasant countenance and with happiness, commiserating with him about his troubles, as [Job 30:25] states: "Did I not weep for those who face difficult times; did not my soul feel sorrow for the destitute?" And he should speak to him words of sympathy and comfort, as [<i>ibid.</i> 29:13] states: "I would bring joy to a widow's heart."
If a poor person asks one for a donation and he has nothing to give him, he should conciliate him with words.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 9b states: "A person who gives a <i>p'rutah</i> to a poor person is granted six blessings, while one who conciliates with him is granted eleven."<br>The simple meaning of this instruction is to share words of comfort with the poor person, for this can be worth more than money to him. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 249:4), however, interprets it as meaning that one should excuse himself saying that he desires to give, but does not have the means.</i> It is forbidden to scold a poor person or to raise one's voice against him while shouting, because his heart is broken and crushed, and [Psalms 51:19] states: "God will not scorn a broken and crushed heart." And [Isaiah 57:15 describes as Divine the attribute of] "reviv[ing] the spirit of the lowly and revitalize[ing] the heart of the crushed." Woe unto he who shames the poor, woe be he! Instead, one should be like a father to him, both in mercies and in words, as [Job 29:16] states: "I am a father to the destitute."
A person who compels others to give charity and motivates them to do so receives a greater reward than the person who actually gives, as [alluded to by Isaiah 32:17]: "And the deed<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ma'aseh</i> translated as "work" can also be interpreted as meaning "compel." In that context, the verse can be interpreted as praise for a person who compels a colleague to give charity.</i> of charity is peace." With regard to the collectors of charity and the like can be applied [the words of praise, Daniel 12:3]: "Those who bring merit to the many are like the stars."
There are eight levels in charity, each level surpassing the other. The highest level beyond which there is none is a person who supports a Jew who has fallen into poverty [by] giving him a present or a loan, entering into partnership with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 249:7 states that this is the most preferable way of helping a person.</i> or finding him work so that his hand will be fortified so that he will not have to ask others [for alms].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Before the person has fallen into poverty, his financial position is still viable. Hopefully, with a little bit of assistance, he can rectify his situation and return to prosperity. In that vein, the <i>Sifra (Behar,</i> sec. v) compares it to a person supporting a colleague who is stumbling. Before he falls, one person can hold him up. Once he falls, even five people cannot raise him. Moreover, if a person is given gifts in this way, his self-esteem is not impaired and he does not develop a negative self-image.</i> Concerning this [Leviticus 25:35] states: "You shall support him, the stranger, the resident, and he shall live among you." Implied is that you should support him before he falls and becomes needy.
A lower [level] than this is one who gives charity to the poor without knowing to whom he gave and without the poor person knowing from whom he received. For this is an observance of the mitzvah for its sake alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since neither the donor nor the recipient knows the other's identity, there can be no ulterior motive involved.</i> This [type of giving was] exemplified by the secret chamber that existed in the Temple. The righteous would make donations there in secret and poor people of distinguished lineage would derive their livelihood from it in secret.<br>A level close to this is giving to a charity fund.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance, as well, the person does not know to whom his donation is being given and the recipient does not know who made the donation.</i> A person should not give to a charity fund unless he knows that the person managing it is faithful, wise, and capable of administering it in a proper manner as Rebbe Chananya ben Tradyon was.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 17b gives an example of Rabbi Chananya's faithfulness. He was collecting both for the ordinary charity fund and for the special charity fund for Purim and the money from the two collections became mixed together. To make sure that the poor were not short-changed, he compensated for any possible discrepancy from his own funds.<br><i>Tosafot, Bava Batra</i> 10b, states that we do not expect every charity collector to be as righteous as Rabbi Chananya ben Tradyon, but we do expect that he approximate his faithfulness.</i>
A lower level than that is an instance when the giver knows to whom he is giving, but the poor person does not know from whom he received. An example of this were the great Sages who would go in secret and throw money into the doorways of the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketubot</i> 67b relates that Mar Ukva would throw a certain amount of money under a poor neighbor's doorstep every day. One day, the poor man desired to see who his benefactor was and when he saw the money, he ran out to the street. Mar Ukva saw him coming and fled, to avoid detection, he entered an oven which though still hot, no longer had fire. When asked to explain his behavior, he said: "It is preferable for a person to cast himself into an oven than to embarrass a colleague in public."</i> This is a worthy way of giving charity and it is a good quality [to express] if the trustees of the charitable fund are not conducting themselves appropriately. <sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In such an instance, it would not be desirable for a person to distribute his charity himself rather than give it to the charitable fund.</i>
A lower level than that is an instance when the poor person knows from whom he took, but the donor does not know to whom he gave. An example of this were the great Sages who would bundle coins in a sheet and hang them over their shoulders and the poor would come and take them so that they would not be embarrassed.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketubot, loc. cit.</i>, relates that Rabbi Abba would conduct himself in this manner.</i>
A lower level than that is giving [the poor person] in his hand before he asks.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In this way, at least the poor person is not humbled by having to ask for the alms.</i>
A lower level than that is giving him after he asks.
A lower level than this is giving him less than what is appropriate, but with a pleasant countenance.
A lower level than that is giving him with sadness.
Great sages would give a <i>p'rutah</i> to a poor person<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Giving to a charity box is also sufficient to fulfill this purpose.</i> before every prayer service<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">According to Kabbalah, charity should not be given before the evening service unless a poor person actually asks for a donation.</i> and then they would pray,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 10a relates that Rabbi Eliezer would conduct himself in this manner.</i> as [implied by Psalms 17:15]: "I will see Your countenance in righteousness."<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tzedek</i>, "righteousness," and <i>tzedakah</i>, "charity," share the same root.</i>
A person who gives money to his sons and daughters who are past the age of majority<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Strictly speaking, this refers to children above the age of six (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 12:14), for in the Talmudic period, children were able to fend for themselves from that age onward and the parents were no longer obligated to support them. (Today, there are many authorities who require parents to support their children until much more advanced ages.) <i>Ketubot</i> 50a applies the verse (Psalms 106:3 : "Happy is he... who performs charity at all times" to a person who supports children of this age.</i> and whom he is not obligated to support in order to teach the males Torah and to direct the females in a course of upright path so that they will not become objects of derision and similarly one who gives food to his father and his mother<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The mitzvah of honoring one's parents does not require a person to tap his own resources to support them. Instead, he must feed them and clothe them from their resources (<i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 6:3).

Our Sages commanded<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 1:5.

Whoever increases [the number of] servants in his possession adds sin and transgression to the world every day.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In that vein, <i>Avot</i> 2:7 states: "One who increases servants increases theft; one who increases maidservants increases lewdness."</i> [Conversely,] if the poor are members of one's household, at every hour he adds merits and mitzvot.
A person should always construct himself and bear hardship rather than appeal to people at large and make himself a burden on the community. Our Sages commanded, saying:<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 112a.</i> "Make your Sabbaths as weekdays,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., restrict your spending even in areas in which the Torah advises that men of means should be lavish. See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:7.</i> and do not appeal to people at large." Even a distinguished sage who becomes poor should involve himself in a profession - even a degrading one - rather than appeal to people at large. It is preferable for a person to skin the hide of animal carcasses,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">An unpleasant and demeaning task.</i> rather than tell people: "I am a great sage..." or "I am a priest, grant me sustenance." Our Sages commanded conducting oneself in such a manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In general, the Rambam appreciated the positive dimension of earning one's livelihood through one's own efforts and not relying on others. In particular, he felt that this was important for Torah scholars, because a) it is forbidden to derive material benefit from Torah study, and b) by doing so, he disgraces the Torah in the eyes of people at large. Thus he writes (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:10):<br>Anyone who comes to the conclusion that he should involve himself in Torah study without doing work and derive his livelihood from charity, desecrates [God's] name, dishonors the Torah, extinguishes the light of faith, brings evil upon himself, and forfeits the life of the world to come, for it is forbidden to derive benefit from the words of Torah in this world.<br>Our Sages declared: 'Whoever benefits from the words of Torah forfeits his life in the world.' Also, they commanded and declared: 'Do not make them a crown to magnify oneself, nor an axe to chop with.' Also, they commanded: "Love work and despise Rabbinic positions" and "All Torah that is not accompanied by work will eventually be nullified and will lead to sin." Ultimately, such a person will steal from others.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:7 and the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Avot</i> 4:7).</i><br>There were great sages who were woodchoppers,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that Hillel earned his livelihood in this manner. It must be noted that although <i>Yoma</i> 35b describes Hillel as having earned a meager livelihood through physical work, neither it, nor any other known source, explicitly states that Hillel would chop wood.</i> porters of beams,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 67b states that Rav Sheshet would haul beams. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), where he elaborates on the labor performed by the sages. He apparently had a slightly different version of the Talmud, for he refers to different sages than those mentioned in the standard published text.</i> water-carriers for gardens,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketubot</i> 105a mentions that Rav Huna was a water-carrier.</i> and iron-smelters and makers of charcoal,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 28b states that Rabbi Yehoshua would work in this capacity.</i> but they did not ask anything from the community, nor did they accept gifts that were given to them.
Any person who does not need to take [charity] and deceives the people and takes will not reach old age and die until he requires assistance from people at large. He is among those of whom it is said [Jeremiah 17:5]: "Cursed be a person who trusts in mortals."<br>[Conversely,] anyone who needs to take [charity] and cannot exist unless he takes, e.g., an elderly man, sick, or beset by afflictions, but is proud and does not take is considered as a murderer. He is liable for his soul and all that he has earned through his hardship<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the hardship he endured by not accepting charity.</i> is sin and guilt.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For he should have accepted the charity so that he could live his life in an ordinary manner. If it is a person's lot to receive his livelihood from charity, he should not show false pride and refrain from doing so.</i> But anyone who needs to take [charity], but causes himself affliction and temporarily constrains himself and lives a life of difficulty so that he will not overburden the community will not reach old age and die before he provides sustenance for others from his own means. Concerning such a person and those like him, it is stated [<i>ibid.</i>:7]: Blessed be a person who trusts in God."
