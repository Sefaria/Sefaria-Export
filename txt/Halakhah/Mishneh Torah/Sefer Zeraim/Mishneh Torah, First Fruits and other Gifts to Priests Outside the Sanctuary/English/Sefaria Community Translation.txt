Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4



A proselyte brings and reads, as it is said to Abraham, "A father of the many peoples I have made you..." This means that he was the father to the entire world that entered under the wings of the Shechina, and the promise was to Abraham first that his children would inherit the land. So too, priests and levites bring and read because they have open cities.
