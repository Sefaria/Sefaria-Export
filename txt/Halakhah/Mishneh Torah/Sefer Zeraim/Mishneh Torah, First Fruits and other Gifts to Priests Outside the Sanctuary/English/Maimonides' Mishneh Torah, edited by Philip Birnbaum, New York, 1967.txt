Mishneh Torah, First Fruits and other Gifts to Priests Outside the Sanctuary



Chapter 1



Chapter 2

It is a positive biblical command to bring first fruits to the sanctuary; they apply only in Eretz Yisrael in the time of the Temple, as it is written: "The choice first fruits of your soil you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God" (Exodus 23:19).— —
First fruits are brought only from the seven species which are spoken of in praise of the land, namely: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates. If one had brought products other than the seven species, they were not consecrated.

Chapter 3










It is a positive biblical command to confess in the sanctuary over the first fruits at the moment they are presented. One should begin by reciting: "I acknowledge this day before the Lord your God that I have come into the land which the Lord solemnly promised to our fathers… My father was a wandering Aramean…" He should continue to the end of the biblical section which concludes with the words "which thou, O Lord, hast given me" (Deuteronomy 26:3-10). This acknowledgment must be recited in the holy tongue only, as it is written: "You shall then recite as follows" (5), meaning: in this [Hebrew] tongue.
Originally, anyone who could recite the prescribed biblical passage recited it; and if anyone could not recite it, he was assisted in reciting it. But when those illiterates refrained from bringing their first fruits, that they might not be put to shame, it was ordained by the court that both those that knew and those that did not know should be made to repeat the words [after the priest].

Chapter 4
















How were the first fruits brought up to Jerusalem? The men of all the smaller towns that belonged to the <i>Maamad</i> [one of the twenty-four divisions in the outlying districts] gathered together in the town of the <i>Maamad</i> [leader], so as not to come up to Jerusalem as isolated individuals, as it is written: "In a multitude of people is the glory of a king" (Proverbs 14:28). Having arrived, they spent the night in the open street of the town and did not enter the homes for fear of contracting uncleanness therein. Early in the morning, the officer of the <i>Maamad</i> said: "Arise, and let us go up to Zion, to the Lord our God" (Jeremiah 31:5). In front of them went the ox, having its horns overlaid with gold and a wreath of olive-leaves on its head, to indicate that the first fruits were taken from the seven species of farm products. The flute was played in front of them until they reached near Jerusalem. As they walked all the way, they chanted: "I was glad when they said to me: Let us go up to the house of the Lord" (Psalm 122:1). They walked only two thirds of the day. Upon arriving at the outskirts of Jerusalem, they sent messengers to let the men of Jerusalem know. They bedecked their first fruits and adorned them, placing the fresh ones on top of the dry. The high officers and the treasurers of the Temple came out of Jerusalem to meet them. They used to come out according to the number of those who arrived: if many pilgrims arrived, they were greeted by many; and if few, by few. When all of them entered within the gates of Jerusalem, they began to chant: "Our feet stand at last within your gates, O Jerusalem" (2).
All the craftsmen in Jerusalem used to rise up before them and greet them, saying: "Brethren, men of such-and-such a place, you are welcome!" The flute was played in front of them as they marched inside Jerusalem until they reached the Temple Mount. Having arrived at the Temple Mount, each pilgrim would take his basket on his shoulder as they chanted: "Praise the Lord! Praise God in his sanctuary… Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord" (Psalm 150). They marched on the Temple Mount chanting until they reached as far as the Temple Court. When they reached the Temple Court, the Levites sang: "I extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast lifted me…" (30:2).

Chapter 11

By a biblical positive command, each Israelite must redeem his son, the firstborn of an Israelite mother, as it is written: "Every firstborn belongs to me" (Exodus 34:19); and it is written: "You shall have the firstborn of man redeemed" (Numbers 18:15).



The man who redeems his son should recite this blessing: "Blessed art thou … who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the redemption of the firstborn son." Then he should recite: "Blessed art thou … who hast granted us life and sustenance and permitted us to reach this festive occasion."— —
This religious duty is applicable everywhere and at all times. For what price does he redeem him? For five shekels, as it is written: "The redemption price for the child of one month is the equivalent of five shekels" (16).— —

If the <i>kohen</i> is willing to return the redemption price, he may do so. Yet, the infant's father must not give the <i>kohen</i> the redemption price with the intention that he should return it. If he acted in this manner, and the <i>kohen</i> returned the money, the firstborn son is not redeemed. He must resolve in his mind to present him with an absolute gift; and if the <i>kohen</i> is willing to return it thereafter, he may do so. So too, if he specified the condition that the <i>kohen</i> should return the gift that he had handed him, his son is redeemed.
Priests and Levites are exempt from redeeming their firstborn.— —







When is one required to redeem his son? When the firstborn has completed thirty days, as it is written: "The redemption price for the child of one month" (16). If the firstborn son died during the thirty days, even on the thirtieth day, or if the child became afflicted with a fatal organic disease, the father is not required to pay five shekels.— —


If a man's wife had never before given birth, and now she gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, without knowing which of the two emerged first, the <i>kohen</i> receives nothing in such a case. If she gave birth to two boys, the father should give the <i>kohen</i> five shekels, even though it is not known which of them is the firstborn. If, however, one of the twins died during the thirty days, he is exempt from paying the redemption price, in keeping with the rule that the claimant must produce evidence.— —





If the wives of two men gave birth to boy twins for the first time each, and the infants were mingled together, then each father should give five shekels. — —
