Mishneh Torah, First Fruits and other Gifts to Priests Outside the Sanctuary



Chapter 1

There are 24 presents that are given to the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam specifies and categorizes them in this chapter.</i> All of them are explicitly mentioned in the Torah. A covenant was established with Aaron over all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:19 speaks of 'an eternal covenant of salt.' It is called a covenant of salt, because just as salt never spoils, so too, this covenant will endure forever (Rashi).</i> Any priest who does not acknowledge them<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that <i>Menachot</i> 18b, the Rambam's apparent source, states: 'Any priest that does not acknowledge the priestly service does not receive a portion of the priesthood.' The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions why the Rambam changes the wording of his source.</i> does not have a portion in the priesthood and he is not given any of these presents.
Every [priest] who partakes of one of the presents [given to the priests] that is sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., like <i>terumah</i> or the first fruits which are referred to as 'holy.'</i> should recite a blessing: '[Blessed are You].. who sanctified us with the sanctity of Aaron and commanded us to partake of...' [mentioning the particular type of present he is eating].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">These presents also include elements of the sacrificial offerings. The Rambam speaks about the mitzvah to partake of these sacred foods in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 10:1-2. And see <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:22 which describes partaking of <i>terumah</i>.</i>
Eight of the presents may be eaten by the priests only in the Sanctuary, within the walls of the Temple Courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 4. The division of the presents into these categories is not found in a prior Rabbinic source, but instead, was made by the Rambam himself (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Five of them may be eaten only in Jerusalem within the walls of the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 5.</i> According to Scriptural Law, there are five presents that are acquired [by the priests] only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 6.</i> There are five presents that they acquire both in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and in the Diaspora.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 7.</i> And there is one present that that they acquire from the Temple's [property].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 8.</i>
What are the eight that may be eaten only in Temple? The meat of the sin offering - this includes both sin-offerings of fowl and sin-offerings of animals,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 13, however, the Rambam considers these two as separate presents. As the Radbaz clarifies, there is a difference in the procedure involved in these two offerings. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbonot</i> 1:1; 10:3.</i> the meat of a guilt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 9:1, 10:3.</i> whether a definite guilt-offering or a guilt-offering brought because of doubt,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 13, however, the Rambam considers these two as separate presents. As the Radbaz clarifies, there is a difference in the procedure involved in these two offerings. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbonot</i> 1:1; 10:3.</i> communal peace offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'asehHaKorbanot</i>1:4, 9:4.</i> [the portion of] the <i>omer</i> offering that remains,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the portion that remains after a handful is taken to be offered on the altar. See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 7: 12.</i> [the portion of] an Israelite's meal offering that remains,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the portion that remains after a handful is taken to be offered on the altar. An Israelite's offering is mentioned in contrast to that of a priest which is offered on the altar entirely. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 10:2-3, 12:9.</i> the two loaves [offered on Shavuot],<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 8:11.</i> the show bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i>4:9.</i> and the <i>log</i> of oil brought by a <i>metzora</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See<i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 4:3.</i> [All of] these may be eaten only in the Temple.
What are the five that are eaten only in Jerusalem? The breast and the leg of the peace offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 10:4-5.</i> the portion granted [the priests] from the thanksgiving offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i> 9:12.</i> the portion granted [the priests] from the ram brought by a nazirite,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i> 9:12.</i> the firstborn of a kosher animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 1:2.</i> and the first fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 3.</i> [all of] these may be eaten only in Jerusalem.
What are the five [that are given] in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>? <i>Terumah, terumat ma'aser</i>, and <i>challah</i> - these three are sanctified,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And must be eaten in a state of ritual purity.</i> the first shearings,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10, Halachah 1.</i> and an ancestral field [that was consecrated]<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Arachin VaCharamim</i> 4:1-2, 19.</i> - these are ordinary property. [The priests are granted] these according to Scriptural Law only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbinic Law, <i>terumah</i> and <i>challah</i> are also separated in the Diaspora.</i> <i>Terumot</i> and <i>challot</i> from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> may be eaten only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">On the contrary, if they are taken to the Diaspora, they become impure (see <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 2:17).</i>
What are the five that the priests acquire in all places? The presents [given when slaughtering animals],<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The foreleg, the jaw, and the maw; see Chapter 9, Halachah 1.</i> [the money given for] the redemption of a firstborn [son],<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 11.</i> [the lamb given for] the redemption of a firstborn [donkey],<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12.</i> [property] stolen from a convert [who died heirless],<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 8:5.</i> and dedication offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Arachin VaCharamim</i>6:4.</i> These five are ordinary property.
The present that they acquire from the Temple's property<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam puts this present in a category of its own, because unlike all of the above which were given by individuals, this present comes from the Temple's property (Radbaz). Once the hides are given to the priests, they are considered as ordinary property and may be used for mundane purposes.</i> is the hides from the burnt-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:19. <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 19:9.</i> This also applies to the hides from other sacrifices of the most holy order. They are all given to the priests.
The eight presents that may be eaten only in the Sanctuary are all sacrifices of the most holy order. They may be eaten only by male priests, as will be explained in the appropriate place.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 9:1, 10:3, 12:3.</i> Concerning them, [Leviticus 6:22] states: 'All males among the priesthood shall partake of it.
The five [presents that may be eaten only] in Jerusalem are all sacrifices of lesser sanctity.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 1:17 with regard to the sacrifices of lesser sanctity. Chapter 3, Halachah 1, equates the first fruits with those sacrifices.</i> [Both] males and females [of the priestly family] may partake of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 10:17.</i> Concerning them, [Numbers 18:11] states: 'To you, and your sons and your daughters with you have I given them as an eternal decree.' [Although a woman may partake of them,] they are granted only to the males of the priestly family. For they are given to the men of the watch [serving in the Temple].<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 4:3, the priestly family was divided into 24 watches. Each one would serve in the Temple for a week. During that week, its members had the rights to all the sacrifices offered during that time.</i><br>The fat and the blood of the firstborn [of kosher animals] was offered and only a male was allowed to offer it.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This sacrifice is not given to the priests of the weekly watch, but instead to the priest of the owner's choice [<i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 1:15; the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 4:9)]. That priest in turn offers it on the altar and may give its meat to whichever members of the priestly family, males and females, he desires to (see Radbaz).</i> Similarly, the hides of the sacrifices of the most sacred order, an ancestral field, dedication offerings, and the stolen property of a convert, are acquired only by the men of the priestly watch [of that week], as will be explained.<br>Similarly, the redemption of firstborn [sons is given] only to males of the priestly family, for concerning it, [Numbers 3:48] states: 'And you shall give the money to Aaron and his sons.' [Similarly, the redemption of] a firstborn donkey [is given] to males of the priestly family, for all the laws of the firstborn are parallel. [The redemption is given] to males and not females.
Thus you have learned that the presents given [directly] to females like males are five: <i>terumah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>HilchotTerumah</i> 12:22.</i> <i>terumat ma'aser, challah,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For the laws applying to <i>terumah</i> apply to both of these.</i> the presents given when slaughtering an animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The foreleg, the jaw, and the maw; see Chapter 9, Halachah 1.</i> and the first shearings.<br>What is the source that teaches that the first shearings may be given to a woman of the priestly family? 'The first of your grain, your wine, and your oil, and the first shearings of your flock shall you give to him' [Deuteronomy 18:4]. [The verse establishes an equivalence:] Just as [<i>terumah</i>,] the first of the grain, may be given to females as well as males, so too, the first shearings.
Our Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefta, Challah</i> 2:7.</i> reckoned these presents in another manner, stating: 24 presents for the priests were given to Aaron. They are 10 in the Temple, 4 in Jerusalem, and 10 in the outlying areas.
The ten in the Temple are: a) an animal brought as a sin-offering, b) a fowl brought as a sin-offering, c) a guilt-offering, d) a guilt-offering brought because of doubt, e) the communal peace-offerings, f) the <i>log</i> of oil brought by a nazirite, g) the two breads, h) the show bread, i) the remnants of the meal offering, and j) the remnants of the <i>omer</i> offering.
The four in Jerusalem are: a) the firstborn [kosher animal], b) the first fruits, c) the portion granted [the priests] from the thanksgiving offering and the portion granted [the priests] from the ram brought by a nazirite, and d) the hides of the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Although these hides are not eaten in Jerusalem, but instead, can be sold and the proceeds used for any purpose, the Rambam places them in this category, because the priests would not take them out of the holy city. Instead, as a token of respect for their holiness, they would sell them there and use the proceeds to partake of food that was eaten in that holy place (Radbaz, gloss to Halachah 5).</i>
The ten in the outlying areas are: a) <i>terumah,</i> b) <i>terumat ma'aser,</i> c) <i>challah</i>, d) the first shearings, e) the presents given when slaughtering an animal, f) the redemption of a firstborn [son], g) the redemption of a firstborn donkey, h) a field that was designated as a dedication offering, i) an ancestral field, and j) the stolen property of a convert.<br>According to this reckoning, all of the portions given the priests from sacrifices of lesser sanctity are considered as one present. This includes: the breast and the leg that is given [the priest] from every peace offering, together with the bread that is given with them if [the peace offering] was a thanksgiving offering<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">A thanksgiving offering is one type of peace offering.</i> and the foreleg given the priest from the nazirite's ram, with the bread given with it, and the breast and the leg.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from the nazirite's ram, the priest is given a foreleg, a hindleg, and the breast. And he is also given a portion of bread that is offered with that sacrifice.</i> Since they are all peace offerings, all of the portions given the priests are considered as one present.
AIl of the presents that are dependent on the sacrifices will be explained in their appropriate places in the laws of sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See the sources given above.</i> Similarly, [the laws pertaining to] the stolen property of a convert will be explained in <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 8:5.</i> We have already explained the laws governing an ancestral field and dedication offerings in <i>Hilchot Arachin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Arachin</i>, chs. 4-8.</i> and the laws of <i>terumah</i> and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i>. In the present halachot, I will explain the laws of the [priestly] presents that are not dependent on the sacrifices: the first fruits,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See chs. 2-4.</i> <i>challah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See chs. 5-8.</i> the presents given when slaughtering an animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See ch. 9.</i> the first shearings,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See ch. 10.</i> the redemption of a firstborn son,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See ch. 11.</i> the redemption of a firstborn donkey.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See ch. 12.</i>

Chapter 2

It is a positive commandment to bring the first fruits to the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 125) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 91) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> [The obligation of] the first fruits applies only while the Temple is standing, and only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, as [implied by Exodus 23:19]: 'Bring of the first ripened fruit of your land<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from the land given specifically to you, <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> to the house of God your Lord.'<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., only when the House of God, the Temple, is standing.</i> According to Rabbinic decree, one should bring first fruits even from the cities of Sichon and Og<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the lands on the eastern side of the Jordan that were captured from these kings by Moses as he led our people to the promised land. These territories were not part of the land flowing with milk and honey promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br>The Rambam's position here represents a reversal from his position in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, where he writes that according to Scriptural Law, the mitzvah of the first fruits applies in these lands. Similarly, in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:10), he states that the mitzvah applies in these lands according to Scriptural Law.</i> and from Syria.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lands to the north of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. These lands are not considered as part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> according to Scriptural Law. See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:9.</i> For a person who purchases land in Syria is like one who purchases in Jerusalem. We do not bring the first fruits from the lands of Ammon and Moab<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Lands to the southeast of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> which were not conquered by the Jews upon their initial conquest of the land.</i> and Babylon, even though they are liable for <i>terumah</i> and tithes according to Rabbinic decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:1.</i> If one brings the first fruits from the Diaspora, they are not considered as first fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">And instead are considered as ordinary produce. The rationale is that the first fruits must be ritually pure and all produce coming from the Diaspora is ritually impure by Rabbinic decree.</i>
The first fruits are brought only from the seven species which are mentioned when relating the praise of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 8:8.</i> They are: wheat, barley,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See the gloss of Rabbi Akiva Eiger which states that rye, oats, and spelt, although considered as subspecies of wheat and barley in other contexts, should not be brought as the first fruits.</i> grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates. If one brought fruit from other species, it is not sanctifted.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:3) derives this from the exegesis of Deuteronomy 26:2: 'And you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the land. 'Take of" implies an exclusion. Not all of the fruit may be brought as first fruits.</i>
We do not bring [first fruits] from the dates in the mountains, nor from the fruit from the valleys, not from oil-producing olives that are not of the highest quality, but rather from dates from the valleys and fruit from the mountains, for they are of the highest quality. If a person brought first fruits of inferior quality, e.g., dates from the mountains, figs that were perforated and had oil applied to them,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 2:5), these techniques are used to hurry the ripening of figs. Although they are effective, they reduce the quality of the figs.</i> dusty and smoked grapes,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., at times, fires were lit under grape vines to kill worms and insects in the vine. This, however, reduced the quality of the fruit.</i> they are not consecrated.
We may not bring liquids as the first fruits<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one may not bring juice from pomegranates, dates, and figs.</i> with the exception of [oil from] olives and [wine from] grapes, as [implied by Deuteronomy 26:2 which speaks of]: 'the fruit of the land,' i.e., [the fruit and] not a beverage. If one brought beverages, they are not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">From the conclusion of the tractate of <i>Challah</i>, it would appear that it is not acceptable to bring wine or oil either. Nevertheless, the Rambam does not accept that teaching, favoring instead <i>Terumah</i> 11:3 which deems them acceptable. See the explanation in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i>
People who are close to Jerusalem should bring fresh figs and grapes.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For it is preferable that fresh fruits should be brought.</i> People who are distant should bring dried figs and raisins.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For if they bring fresh fruit, it will spoil.</i>
The first fruits should not be brought before Shavuot, for that holiday is referred to as 'the harvest festival, the first fruits of your work.' If one brings [them at that time], we do not accept them from him. Instead, they should be left there<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the Temple courtyard. The Radbaz states that this applies only to fruit that will not spoil. Otherwise, the fruit brought prematurely is like all the other fruit mentioned in the previous halachot and its consecration is not effective.</i> until Shavuot, at which time, he should make the declaration concerning them. Similarly, the first fruits should not be brought after Chanukah.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">After Chanaukah, it is not appropriate to bring the first fruits, because they are to be brought at the time of the harvest and the harvest is concluded by Sukkot. Moreover, if one brings the first fruits between Sukkot and Chanukah, he cannot make the declaration concerning them (Chapter 4, Halachah 13).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's words for their implication is that the first fruit brought after Chanukah becomes consecrated. The Ra'avad maintains that since the fruit did not ripen until then, the first fruits are considered as of low quality and do not become consecrated. Nor, the Ra'avad maintains, can they be considered as being from the following year, as the Rambam states, because until the 15th of Shvat, they are considered as from the crops of the previous year. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam, maintaining that since the crops have generally been harvested, any produce that does grow is considered as belonging to the coming year. The Radbaz emphasizes that here too, we are speaking of produce that will not spoil. Otherwise, it is not consecrated.</i> For first fruits that ripen after Chanukah are considered as being of the coming year. They should be left until Shavuot.
The first fruits may not be brought from produce of the present harvest for produce of the previous harvest or from produce of the previous harvest for produce of the present harvest.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 73b states that there is an equation between the tithes and the first fruits. Hence, just as the tithes may not be brought from one harvest for another (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 5:11; <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 1:7), so too, the law applies with regard to the first fruits.</i><br>What is implied? One should not bring produce that budded before the 15th of Shvat<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first fruits brought from fruit. With regard to wheat and barley, the date when a change is made is Rosh HaShanah.</i> as first fruits for produce that budded after the 15th of Shvat. [This applies] both to produce that is planted and produce that grows on its own, as [implied by Numbers 18: 13]: 'The first fruits of everything in their land.'<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prooftext implies that the obligation applies to any and all situations where these species grow (see <i>Menachot</i> 84b and Radbaz).</i>
The obligation of the first fruits applies to the produce of partners, [implied by]: 'The first fruits of everything in their land.'<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The plural form of the verb "that they bring" used by the prooftext indicates that the obligation applies even when the produce is owned by two people jointly (<i>Chullin</i> 136a).</i>
When produce grows in a flower pot, even if it has a hole or it grows in a ship, one should not bring first fruits from them at all. [for the prooftext] speaks of 'their land.'<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Produce that grows in such a situation is considered as growing from the earth in certain contexts. Nevertheless, the prooftext indicates that the first fruits are an exception.</i> One should, however, bring from produce that grows on a roof or in a ruin.
[In all the following situations,] a person should not bring the first fruits from the produce that grows in one domain or the produce that grows in another domain. [These situations include] one who plants a tree in his field and extends<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">'Extending' refers to planting a bough from a tree or a vine in the ground, so that an extension can grow from it [the Rambam' s Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:1)].</i> it into his colleague's field<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Without his colleague's permission as obvious from the following halachah.</i> or into the public domain, or the trunk of the tree was in his field and he extended its end in his field but there was a public road or a private path interrupting between the trunk and the end which was extended. [This is derived from Exodus 23:19]: "the first fruits of your land.' [Implied is that] all the growth [of the tree] must be from your land.'<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">And even the fruit that grow from the trunk are nurtured to a certain extent from the end that was implanted.</i>
If his colleague gave him permission<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">There is, however, no way one can be granted permission to use the public domain in this manner.</i> [to implant the end] in his property even for a brief time, he may bring the first fruits. If the tree was close to his colleague's boundary or leaned into his colleague's field<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shechenim</i>10:8.</i> [and he planted there], even though he was obligated to distance [his planting], he may bring [the first fruits]<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even to the fruit which grew in his colleague's domain. Since his colleague gave him permission to grow the produce there, it can be considered as his land.</i> and recite the declaration, for Joshua gave the land [to our people] as an inheritance with that intent.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that when <i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i> 10:8 mentions the ten conditions on which basis Joshua gave the land to the people as an inheritance, this condition is not included among them. Among the resolutions given is that the conditions mentioned there apply also in the Diaspora, while this condition applies only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i>
Sharecroppers, tenant farmers,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The former give the owners a share of the crops; the latter rent the fields for money. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 6:13; the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:2).</i> men of force who compel the owners [to sell] their land and purchase it for a low price,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This was, unfortunately, a common practice in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> during the Roman era, when the gentiles and their Jewish comrades would threaten a person until he was forced to sell his land for far below its worth.</i> and robbers<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">One who takes land without paying at all.</i> may not bring first fruits, because [the prooftext] states: 'the first fruits of your land.'<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">And none of the above are rightful owners of the land.</i> [This applies] even when the owners despair [of recovering their land].<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">For land can never be stolen and always remains the property of its rightful owners (see <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 8:14).</i>
When a person purchases a tree in a field belonging to a friend, he may not bring [the first fruits], because he does not own land. [If he purchases] three [trees], he does own land. Even if he formally acquired only the trees, it is as if he owns land.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 24:1-2. The rationale is that since he purchased this amount of trees, he also receives the land necessary to tend to them. Although he is not the legal owner of the land and has only the right to use it, that right is sufficient for the land to be called his own.</i> If he purchased one tree and the land around it, he should bring [the first fruits].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Because he is the owner of both the land and the tree (Our bracketed additions are based on the gloss of the Radbaz. We are forced to accept this interpretation, since, as stated above, the first fruits must come from "your land."</i>
When a person purchases fruit that has been harvested and purchases the land [on which they grew],<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if he does not purchase the fruit and the land at the same time, as long as he owns both at the time appropriate to bring the first fruits, he should bring them (Radbaz).</i> he should bring the first fruits, because he possesses both land and the fruits.<br>When one sells a colleague fruit, but not the land, even when the fruit is still attached to the land, [neither the seller, nor the purchaser may bring the first fruits]. The seller may not bring them, because he does not own the fruits. The purchaser may not bring them, because he does not own the land. If the seller buys the fruit back from the purchaser, he may bring [the first fruits], because he [now] owns [both] the land and its produce.
When a person sells his property to a gentile and later purchases it back from him, he must bring the first fruits from it according to Scriptural Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i> 4:9); note the differences between his initial version and his final version. There is a debate among the commentaries if the obligation to bring the first fruits is Rabbinic in origin (as was the Rambam's initial view) or Scriptural in origin (as is his view here).</i> [The rationale is that] it is not absolved from the mitzvah because of the gentile's purchase,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad comments that this applies even though the produce reached maturity while in the possession of the gentile. The commentaries state that the Rambam would accept this ruling.</i> as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:10.</i>
[Although] one nullified an <i>asherah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">A tree that was worshiped. as was the practice of both the Canaanites and the Greeks.<br>When a gentile owns an entity that is worshiped, he can nullify its connection with idolatrous worship and from that time onward, it may be used for ordinary purposes. Nevertheless, it is not fit to be used for an offering on the Altar, because of its previous connection with idolatry. An entity owned by a Jew that was worshiped can never be nullified. See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8-11.</i> the first fruits should not be brought from its produce. For the first fruits are like the sacrifices of the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:6, if an animal was once associated with the worship of false deities, it may no longer be used as a sacrifice in the Temple.</i>
There is no set measure for the first fruits according to Scriptural Law. According to Rabbinic Law, one should give one sixtieth of the crop. If one desires to set aside his entire crop as first fruits, he may.
When a person separated his first fruits and afterwards added to them or adorned them, the addition is also considered as the first fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">And the stringencies applied to the first fruits, e.g., that they be eaten in a state of ritual purity, are also applied to them.</i><br>When does the above apply? When he brought [the first fruits] from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. If, however, he brought them from Transjordan or Syria, they are not as the first fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that, as stated in Halachah 1, the obligation to bring first fruits from these lands is Rabbinic in origin. Hence, it is not powerful enough to convey that status on the additions as well.</i> Even though they are not considered as the first fruits, they should only be eaten in a state of ritual purity.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">As the first fruits themselves.</i> No matter where it is from,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even from Transjordan and Syria (Radbaz).</i> the first fruits should only be adorned with fruit from the seven species [mentioned in the praise of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">One may, however, adorn figs with grapes and grapes with dates (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:10).</i>
How should one separate the first fruits? A person descends to his field, sees a fig tree, a cluster [of grapes], and/or a pomegranate tree that has budded, and ties them with a reed.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">As a sign, so that he will recognize them later. There is no obligation to use a reed for this purpose. Another sign is also acceptable. The Rambam, quoting the mishnah, was merely stating a common practice [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:1)] .</i> He should say: "These are the first fruits.' They become designated as first fruits even though they are attached to the ground after they have been given that title, even though they have not ripened entirely.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Although they must reach a complete stage of development by the time they are brought to the Temple, it is not necessary that they reach this stage at the time of their designation.</i><br>When they ripen and are reaped from the ground, it is not necessary to designate them again. If he did not designate them while attached or call them first fruits and then he reaped them, he should designate them after he reaps them.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Unless he designates them, the fact that they are set aside is not sufficient for them to be considered as first fruits.</i><br>If his entire harvest becomes impure, he should not designate the impure produce as first fruits. Instead, as an initial preference, he should set aside other produce as first fruits for the impure produce. It appears to me that if he does not have other produce, to separate [as first fruits], he should not set them aside to be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See parallels in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:9; <i>Hilchot Meilah</i> 4:7. <i>Terumah</i> and the second tithe, by contrast, should be set aside even if the produce is impure, for they will not be wasted.</i> Similarly, it appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The expression 'It appears to me' refers to a conclusion derived by the Rambam through deduction without an explicit prior Rabbinic source. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions whether that expression is appropriate in the present instance since this point is stated in <i>Yevamot</i> 73a,b. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> concludes that perhaps 'It appears to me' refers only to the rationale the Rambam states here, for that concept is not stated in <i>Yevamot, loc. cit.</i></i> that if the first fruits become impure, he should not use them as kindling for a furnace, because they are like objects consecrated for the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">And consecrated articles may not be destroyed. It is necessary for the Rambam to give this explanation, because the Torah refers to the first fruits as <i>terumah</i> and impure <i>terumah</i> may be kindled.</i>
When a person set aside his first fruits and they rotted away,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 3 which states that spoiled produce is unacceptable.</i> were taken by others, lost, stolen, or became impure,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For then, they are no longer fit to be offered.</i> he is obligated to set aside others in place of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">He does not, however, make the declaration for the first fruits when bringing these fruits, as stated in Chapter 4, Halachah 9.</i> as [Exodus 23:19] states: '...bring to the house of God your Lord.' This teaches that one is liable to replace them until he brings them to the Temple Mount.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Once he brings them to the Temple Courtyard, he is not liable to replace even if they become impure (Radbaz).</i>
If a person set aside his first fruits to bring them to Jerusalem himself, he should not send them with an agent<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this ruling can be explained as follows: When a person sends his first fruits to the Temple via an agent, the agent does not make the declaration (Chapter 4, Halachah 2). Since they were harvested in a manner that allows that declaration to be made, it is improper for them to be sent in a manner that prevents it from being made.</i> If, however, he initially harvested them with the intent of sending them [to the Temple] with an agent, it is permitted for him to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance, they were harvested with the intent that the declaration not be made.</i>

Chapter 3

The first fruits are given to the men of the priestly watch<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The priests were divided into 24 watches. Each one would serve in the Temple for a week at a time.</i> [on duty at that time]. They divide them among themselves like the Temple sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh Korbanot</i>10:15.</i> We have already explained that [the first fruits] are called <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Terumah</i>15:20, Chapter 2, Halachah 19 above, <i>et al</i>.</i> Therefore a non-priest who partakes of the first fruits anywhere<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., within Jerusalem or outside the city.</i> is liable for death at the hand of heaven,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment a non-priest incurs for partaking of <i>terumah</i> (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 6:6).</i> provided he partook of them after they entered the walls of Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to partake of the first fruits in all situations. One does not, however, become liable for this severe penalty unless they first entered the holy city. The rationale is that since a priest may not partake of them until they are brought to Jerusalem, the prohibition against a non-priest partaking of them does not apply until then.</i>
If a portion [of the first fruits] were inside Jerusalem and a portion were outside,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Aruch LeNer</i> states that there is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if this law applies when the produce is carried in a single container or only when it is carried in two containers.</i> [a non-priest] is liable for death for the portion that is inside and it is considered as consecrated property in all contexts. The portion that is outside is considered as ordinary property in all contexts.
When a priest partakes of the first fruits outside of Jerusalem after they have entered inside [the city's] walls, he is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law, as [Deuteronomy 12:17] states: 'You may not eat within your gates...<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in cities outside of Jerusalem.</i> the <i>terumah</i> of your hand.' [The latter term] refers to the first fruits,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 149) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 449) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as we explained in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:20.</i><br>Similarly, if a priest partakes of them in Jerusalem before they are placed in the Temple courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, as indicated by the following halachah, the person bringing the first fruits need not make the declaration for them to be permitted.</i> he is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law, as if he partook of them outside of Jerusalem,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this is included in the same negative commandment.</i> because [the first fruits] must be placed down in the Temple Courtyard as [<i>ibid.</i> 26:10] states: 'And you shall place them before the altar of God your Lord.'
After the person bringing [the first fruits] places them down in the Temple Courtyard, they are permitted to the priest even though the former has not recited the declaration over them. When the first fruits were taken out of their place<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Jerusalem, the place where they may be eaten.</i> and then returned, they are permitted to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Sacrificial meat, by contrast, would be disqualified if this happened.</i>
[The laws applying to] partaking of the first fruits are identical [to those applying] to partaking of <i>terumah</i> in all of their details. In addition, [the following stringencies apply with regard] to first fruits. They are forbidden to one in the acute state of <i>onein</i> mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachah.</i> They must be brought to [Jerusalem]. And a priest who is ritually pure who partook of the first fruits that were impure receives lashes like an Israelite who is ritually pure who partook of the second tithe that became impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:1.</i> [These concepts] do not apply with regard to <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Although a priest is not allowed to partake of impure <i>terumah</i>, such a transgression is not punishable by lashes. It is only a prohibition that results from a positive commandment (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 7:3).</i>
What is the source which teaches that the first fruits are forbidden to an <i>onein</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Onein / Aninut</i> refers to the state of severe mourning experienced on the day of the death of one's relative. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:6.</i> With regard to these fruits, [Deuteronomy 26:11] states: 'And you shall rejoice in all the good.'<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">From this phrase, it is derived (Halachah 13) that it is necessary to bring peace offerings together with the first fruits. However, the two teachings are not exclusive.</i> Implied is that they have to be eaten in a state of happiness and not in a state of acute mourning. One who partakes of [these fruits] in a state of acute mourning is liable for stripes for rebellious conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Since the prohibition is not stated as a negative commandment in the Torah, one is not liable for lashes as prescribed by Scriptural Law. The Radbaz and others question this ruling, because, as <i>Yevamot</i> 73b teaches, an association is established between the first fruits and the second tithe. Hence just as one is liable for lashes for partaking of the second tithe in a state of acute mourning, so too, one should be liable for partaking of the first fruits.</i>
The first fruits must [be brought in] a container, as [<i>ibid.</i>:2] states: 'And you shall place them in a container.' The most preferable way of performing the mitzvah is to bring each type of fruit in a separate container. If one brings them [all] in one container, he has fulfilled his obligation. [Even in such an instance,] he should not bring them mixed together. Instead, he should bring the barley below,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This order is prescribed by the <i>Tosefta, Bikkurim</i> 2:8. The commentaries explain that the rationale for this order is that the produce that is most perishable is placed on top and that which is preserved best on bottom.</i> wheat on top of it, olives on top of it, dates on top of them, pomegranates on top of them, and figs on the top of the container. There should be a substance, e.g., palm leaves, wild grass, or leaves, or the like, that intervenes between each type of produce. One should surround the figs with clusters of grapes from the outside.
When a person brings the first fruits in a metal container, the priest takes them and returns the container to its owner. If he brings them in a reed or grass basket or the like, both the first fruits and the basket should be given to the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bikkurim</i> 3:8 relates that the rich would bring their first fruits in gold and silver containers, while the poor would bring them in wicker baskets. The rich would thus be allowed to keep their containers, while the poor would have to give them to the priests.<br>The rationale is that the metal containers are significant and thus cannot be considered to be ancillary to the fruits. Hence they must be returned to their owners. The wicker baskets, by contrast, are not significant and thus are considered to be ancillary to the fruits. Therefore they may be kept by the priests. In this regard, <i>Bava Kama</i> 913 states, 'Poverty pursues the poor,' i.e., because they were too poor to afford expensive containers, they were required to forfeit even their simple baskets.</i> If the first fruits become impure, the baskets should not be given to the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since the first fruits themselves are not given to the priests (see Chapter 4, Halachah 10), they do not acquire the containers either.</i>
When they would bring the first fruits, they would also bring turtle doves and doves in their hands. Similarly, they would hang turtle doves and doves from the sides of the baskets<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">They were not placed on the baskets themselves, lest they soil the fruit [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:5)].</i> in order to adorn the first fruits. Those that were with the baskets would be offered as burnt offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For fowl that were given as a free-will offering were sacrificed only as burnt offerings.</i> and those they would bring by hand would be given to the priests [as presents].<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad offers a different interpretation of the above mishnah, explaining that only the first fruits were given to the priests, the fowl would be offered as burnt offerings. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's interpretation. Nevertheless, Rashi (<i>Menachot</i> 58a) and Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura follow the Ra'avad's understanding.</i>
It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 132) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 606) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to make a declaration in the Temple concerning the first fruits when they are brought. One should begin and say [Deuteronomy 26:3-10]: 'I am making a statement to God your Lord that I have come to the land... An Aramean [sought] to destroy my ancestor...' until he completes the entire passage, concluding: '...You gave me, O God.' [This declaration] may only be made in the Holy Tongue, as it states: 'And you shall respond and say.'<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 32a understand this phrase as indicating that the passage should be recited exactly as it is written in the Torah.</i>
At first, those who knew how to read would read [the passage themselves] and those who did not know how to read would read after one who read for them. [As a result,] those who did not know how to read would refrain from bringing [the first fruits] so that they would not be embarrassed.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the fact that they did not know the Holy Tongue would be an embarrassment for them. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:7), the Rambam explains that this practice was instituted in the early age of the Second Temple era when many of those who returned to Zion did not know the Holy Tongue, as indicated by Nechemiah 13:24.</i> [Hence] the court ordained that the passage would be read for one who knows how to read like it is read for one who does not know.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains that there is a support for this in the Biblical verse cited above: 'And you shall respond and say.' <i>Anita</i>, translated as 'respond,' has the connotation of repeating what someone else says.</i>
A person who brings the first fruits is permitted to give them to his servant or his relative [to carry] throughout the journey until he reaches the Temple Mount.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 21, a person should not send his first fruits to Jerusalem via an agent and if he does so, he may not make the declaration (Chapter 4, Halachah 8). Nevertheless, if he himself is bringing them, he may lighten his burden by having another person carry them. All of this applies before he reaches the Temple Mount At that point, he must carry them himself.</i> When he reaches the Temple Mount, even if he is a king of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:4) cites as an example, the conduct of King Aggripas.</i> he must place the basket on his own shoulder<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam states that the Torah explicitly requires the person to bring the first fruits to the priest by hand.</i> and proceed until he reaches the Temple Courtyard. He should read [the declaration,] 'I am making a statement to God your Lord today...,' while the basket is still on his shoulder. He then removes the basket from his shoulder. While he holds it by its edge, the priest puts his hand below it and raises it [up and down and to all four directions].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This practice, referred to as <i>tenufah</i>, is required when bringing the peace offerings and other sacrifices.</i> He then reads: An Aramean [sought] to destroy my ancestor and he descended to Egypt...' until he completes the entire passage.' He then places the first fruits at the side of the altar, at the southwest comer, on the south side of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The side which is before the entrance to the Sanctuary, for the first fruits must be Elaced down 'before God' (Radbaz).</i> He then prostrates himself<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As required by Deuteronomy 26:10.</i> and departs.<br>What is the source which teaches that the first fruits must be raised [up and down and to all four directions]? [The above prooftext states:] 'And the priest shall take the basket from your hand,' including [an obligation to] raise the first fruits [up and down and to all four directions]. Just as [the first fruits] must be raised [up and down and to all four directions], so to they require that a peace offering be brought with them and song [accompany their offering], for with regard to them, [<i>ibid.</i>:11] states: 'And you shall rejoice in all the good.' [Now,] with regard to the festivals, [<i>ibid.</i> states: 'And you shall rejoice on your festivals.' [An association is drawn between the two:] Just as the happiness of the festivals is marked by peace offerings, so too, peace offerings [are required] here. [Nevertheless,] these offerings are not absolute requirements.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">After the fact, the first fruits are acceptable even if the sacrifices were not brought. The rationale is that the offering is not explicitly mentioned in the Biblical passage (Radbaz to Halachah 14). This concept also applies with regard to the song that should accompany them.</i>
When is a song pronounced over them? When they reach the Temple courtyard. The Levites would begin proclaiming:<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 17.</i> 'I will exalt You God, for You have drawn me up...' (Psalms 30:2 .<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This psalm relates to the theme of thanksgiving, and was also recited over the thanksgiving offering (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 15b).</i>
[When bringing] the first fruits, it is necessary that one remain [in Jerusalem] overnight.<br>What is implied? When a person brought his first fruits to the Temple, made the declaration, and offered his peace offerings, he should not depart from Jerusalem that day to return home.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> clarify that even if the person does not bring a sacrifice, he is still required to stay in Jerusalem overnight because of the first fruits.</i> Instead, he should stay in Jerusalem overnight and return to his city on the following day, as [Deuteronomy 16:7] states: 'And you shall turn back in the morning and return to your tent.' [That verse<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Which speaks about the pilgrimage festivals, not bringing first fruits.</i> teaches a general principle:] All occasions when you turn from the Temple when you visit it should only be in the morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question why, since, this is a general theme, the Rambam mentions it only here and not in other places.</i><br>Thus the first fruits require seven factors: a) that they be brought to [Jerusalem], b) [in a] container, c) that the declaration be recited, d) that they be accompanied by a peace offering, e) and song, f) that they be raised [up and down and to all four directions], and g) that the person stay overnight [in Jerusalem].

Chapter 4

Whenever anyone brings the first fruits, it is necessary that a [peace] offering be brought, song [be recited], they be raised [up and down and to all four directions] and the person remain in Jerusalem overnight.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the concluding halachot of the previous chapter.</i> The declaration, however, is not a universal requirement. There are some who are obligated to bring the first fruits, but who do not recite the declaration over them.
The following must bring [the first fruits], but may not recite the declaration: a woman, a <i>tumtum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A person whose genital area is covered with a mass of flesh and whose gender is impossible to detect.</i> and an <i>androgynous</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A person with male and female sexual characteristics.</i> - for there is a doubt whether they are considered as a female;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to an <i>androgynus</i>, the doubt concerns the individual's halachic status. With regard to the <i>tumtum</i>, the doubt concerns the actual facts: Which gender is covered by the mass of flesh?</i> none of these can say "[the land] which You gave me,"<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:5), the Rambam explains that <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was given as an ancestral heritage only to males who are free men. Thus this disqualifies all of those mentioned in this clause and also the servant mentioned in the following clause.</i> and similarly, a guardian, a servant, and an agent, because they cannot say "which You gave me."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For the first fruits they are bringing are not from their own land. They are acting on behalf of others.</i>
A convert, by contrast, may bring the first fruits and make the declaration, for [Genesis 17:5] states with regard to Abraham: "I have made you a father to a multitude of nations." Implied is that he is the father of all those who enter under the shelter of the Divine presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For he taught all mankind faith [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>:4)].</i> The oath that his descendants would inherit the land was given to Abraham first.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., all future converts are considered as Abraham's seed and thus have a share in the land "that God swore to [give] to your ancestors." Indeed, based on Ezekiel 47:22, <i>Kapot Temarim</i> states that in the Messianic era, converts will be given a share of the Holy Land.</i> Similarly, the priest and the Levites bring [first fruits] and make a declaration, because they have cities in which to dwell.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As related in Numbers, ch. 35, in addition to the six cities of refuge, the Levites were given 42 cities that were scattered throughout the entire land of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.

Even if he is not obligated to do so, what would be wrong with reciting these verses? In resolution, it explains that a) it appears that he is lying (because he is praising God for giving him land which in fact may not be his); or b) by bringing them as first fruits, he will prevent the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes from being separated from them.</i> [The rationale is that] there is a doubt whether he has a right to the land [on which the trees stand] or not.<br>What should he do?

If one set aside his first fruits and then sold his field, he should bring them, but not make the declaration, because he cannot say: "[the land] which You gave me,"<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Praising God for giving him the land.</i> since it no longer belongs to him. The purchaser is not required to separate other first fruits, because the seller has already separated them.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">And first fruits should be brought only once for each species.

When a person sells [the right to harvest] the produce of his field, the purchaser should bring [the first fruits], but not make the declaration. [The rationale is that] the acquisition of the produce is not equivalent to the acquisition of [the land] itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">And thus he cannot rightfully praise God for giving him the land.</i> When, however, one brings first fruits from the property of his wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This refers even to property which the husband receives as <i>nichsei milog</i> (see <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 16:1-2), i.e., the property itself belongs to the woman, but he is entitled to derive benefit from it.</i> he makes the declaration even though he does not own the actual land, as [implied by Deuteronomy 26:11]: "which God, your Lord, has given you and your household."<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">"Your household" can be interpreted as referring to one's wife.

In his mind, it is sold (Radbaz). The Rambam's source is <i>Gittin</i> 48a. Rashi interprets the passage differently.</i> If, however, he sold it again in the second Jubilee, [the purchaser] should bring [the first fruits], but should not make the declaration.

When a person set aside his first fruits and became mortally ill,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This reflects the Rambam's version of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:5). The version in the standard published text is slightly different (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> the one who is fit to inherit his [estate] should bring the first fruits without making the declaration.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">While the owner of the produce is alive, the person fit to inherit the estate is considered as an agent, and hence may not make the declaration. Even though he was not explicitly appointed, we assume that this is the owner's desire. According to the Rambam's conception, if the owner is ill, but is not in mortal danger, another person cannot serve as his agent unless he is appointed as such.</i> When a person set aside his first fruits and sent them with an agent, but the agent died in the midst of the journey, even if the owner brought them, he should not make the delaration. [The rationale is that the phrase (Deuteronomy 26:2 :] "And you shall take... and you shall bring" does not apply unless the taking and the bringing are as one.
When a person set aside his first fruits, but they were lost<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In any manner, as indicated by Chapter 2, Halachah 20.</i> before they reached the Temple Mount and therefore he separated others instead of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For he is required to replace them (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> he should bring the second fruits, but should not make the declaration. [The rationale is that] he cannot say [that he is bringing] "the first fruits of the land," for those that he is bringing are not the first fruits. One is not liable for an additional fifth [for partaking of] the produce separated second, as [he would had he partaken of] the first fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, the first fruits are considered as <i>terumah</i>.

When a person brings his first fruits and they become impure in the Temple Courtyard, he should spill out the basket there.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:8). The Ra'avad maintains that the produce should be left in the Temple Courtyard until it rots. From Chapter 2, Halachah 19, some have inferred that according to the Rambam, the impure produce should be burnt. <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> maintains that this approach is far more appropriate than leaving it to rot in the Temple Courtyard.</i> He does not make the delaration.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For the declaration is made as a statement of thanksgiving after the first fruits are successfully offered and that is not possible in the present situation.</i>
If a person brought his first fruits from one species and made the declaration and afterwards brings first fruits from another species, he should not make the declaration for them. [This is derived from the phrase (Deuteronomy 26:3 :] "I am making a statement today." [Implied is that] he makes one statement and not two.
If a person separated his first fruits and then the spring [that served as his field's water supply]<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed additions are based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6).</i> dried up or the tree [from which they were reaped] was cut down, he should bring them, but should not make the declaration. [The rationale is that] he is like someone who no longer possesses the land, because it has been ruined.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In its present state, the land is not able to produce fruit. Hence, it is as if he no longer possesses it (<i>ibid.</i>; according to Rav Kappach's text).</i>
When a person brings his first fruits between Sukkot and Chanukah<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">After Chanukah, he may not bring them at all.</i>- even if he set them aside before Sukkot - he should bring them without making the declaration, [as implied by Deuteronomy 26:11]: "You shall rejoice in all the good." [Implied is that] the declaration should be made only in a time of happiness, [i.e.,] between Shavuot and the end of Sukkot.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This is the harvest season when a person feels happy with the bounty God has granted him.</i> All individuals other than these<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., those mentioned from Halachah 5 and onward.</i> must bring their first fruits and make the declaration.

If he is allowed to purchase a non-kosher animal with these objects, seemingly, it is obvious that he should be able to use them to purchase a Torah scroll.

The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> explains that in contrast to other types of property, a Torah scroll may never be sold. Hence, if he uses the money from these objects to purchases it, he will never be able to derive physical benefit from these substances.</i>
The first fruits and the <i>terumot</i> are forbidden to be eaten by non-priests. [Generally,] when the first fruits are mixed with ordinary produce, they are permitted if there is 101 times the original amount as is the law with regard to <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asuurot</i> 15:3; <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 15:20-21.</i> Nevertheless, if they become mixed with the same species<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, they become mixed with a substance of another species, the presence of the first fruits can be nullified.

How are the first fruits brought to Jerusalem? All of [the inhabitants of] the towns in a regional area<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 6:1 for more particulars concerning the Hebrew term.</i> gather in the central town of the regional area, so that they will not ascend to Jerusalem as individuals, for [Proverbs 14:28] teaches: "The glory of the King is among the multitude of people."<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Thus coming as a group is a greater act of Divine glorification.</i><br>They come and sleep in the city's thoroughfare, but they do not enter the homes lest they contract impurity because of being under the same shelter as a corpse.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the first fruits must be brought in a state of ritual purity, and if a person bringing them enters a home, he may unknowingly contract ritual impurity, because he was under the same shelter as a corpse.</i> In the morning, the leader calls out: "Arise and let us ascend to Zion, to God our Lord."<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

[The size of the welcoming party] was proportionate to the number of people who come. If many people come, many go out to greet them; if few, few. When they have all entered the gates of Jerusalem, they begin declaring: "Our legs were standing in your gates, O Jerusalem" (<i>ibid.</i>).
All of the artisans in Jerusalem would stand in honor of them<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 33a notes that this is a great mark of respect for those who bring the first fruits.

They proceed through Jerusalem while the flute is sounded until they reach the Temple Mount.

Chapter 5

It is a positive commandment to separate a portion that is raised up<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase translates the Hebrew <i>terumah</i>, for that term is also applied to <i>challah</i> in certain contexts. For that reason several of the laws that apply to <i>terumah</i> also apply to <i>challah</i>.</i> from the dough [and given] to a priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 133) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 385) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. The Rambam considers separating the dough and giving it to the priests as two parts of the same mitzvah. The Ramban, by contrast, considers them as separate mitzvot.</i> as [Numbers 15:20] states: "Raise up the first of your dough, the <i>challah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The heading of this set of halachot is "The Laws of the First Fruits and the Other Presents [Given] to Priests in the Outlying Areas." In the first four chapters, the Rambam discussed the first fruits. Now he proceeds to explain the other presents. He begins with <i>challah</i> because it also involves grain and is also called <i>terumah</i>. See Radbaz.</i> as an offering...." According to Scriptural Law, this first portion does not have a minimum measure. Instead, even if one set aside a portion the size of a barley corn, he has absolved the entire dough. When a person designates his entire dough as <i>challah</i>, his deeds are of no consequence unless he leaves a portion of it [for himself].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">By calling it "the first," the Torah is implying that there is a second, i.e., that something is left over [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 1:9), based on the Jerusalem Talmud]. See also <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 3:5 and note the contrast to Chapter 2, Halachah 17.</i>
According to Rabbinic Law, one should separate one twenty-fourth of the dough, so that there will be a [significant] present for the priest. [This is derived from Deuteronomy 14:4 which] states: "Give him," i.e., give him something that is fit to be called a gift.<br>A baker who makes a dough to be sold in the market place should separate one forty-eighth. [The rationale is that] since his dough is larger,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 2:7) gives another reason for the difference in measures. Ideally, the requirement would only be one forty-eighth. Nevertheless, generally, the one separating <i>challah</i> from the dough is a woman and women are by nature tightfisted. If they are told to give one twenty-fourth, they will ultimately give a forty-eighth. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 322:2 gives another reason for reducing the measure required of a baker. He is preparing the dough for profit and our Sages did not desire to cause him a loss.</i> this measure contains [enough] to be a [significant] present.
Even when a private person makes dough for [the wedding] celebration of his son, he should separate one twenty-fourth even though it is large, so as not to make a distinction in [the requirements of] a dough made by a private person.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages desired that their laws be uniform out of fear that once distinctions were made, individuals would ultimately give less than the desired amount.</i> [Conversely,] when a baker makes a small dough, [he must separate only] one forty-eighth, so as not to make a distinction in [the requirements of] a dough made by a baker.
If a dough became impure unknowingly or because of forces beyond one's control, one need not separate more than one forty-eighth.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Challah</i> which is impure may not be eaten by a priest and may be used only as fuel. An ordinary person may, however, partake of a loaf made from impure dough. Hence, rather than waste the dough, it is preferable to give a smaller portion as <i>challah</i>.</i> If he purposefully made it impure, he must separate a twenty-fourth, so that the sinner will not benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the person separating the dough would benefit from it becoming impure, because he will have to give a smaller portion to the priest.</i><br>Impure <i>challah</i> is permitted to be used by a priest as kindling fuel like impure <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 11:1. At present, since all dough is impure, theoretically, this is the measure which should be given (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 322:3). In practice, however, at present, even impure <i>challah</i> is not given to a priest.</i>
According to Scriptural law, we are only obligated to separate <i>challah</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, as [Numbers 15:19] states: "When you partake of the bread of the land...," and only when the entire Jewish people are located there, as [<i>ibid.</i>:18] states: "When you enter," i.e., when you all enter and not only when a portion of you enter. For this reason, in the present era - and even in the era of Ezra<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Who led the return to Zion after the Babylonian exile.</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> - [the observance of] <i>challah</i> is only a Rabbinic decree, as we explained with regard to <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:5, 26. Even the Ra'avad, who differs with the Rambam with regard to <i>terumah</i>, finds this position acceptable with regard to <i>challah</i>. See also <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 20:3.</i>
When the produce of the Diaspora is brought to <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>, <i>challah</i> must be separated from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Provided the dough is made in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The converse applies with regard to the following clause. The dough must be made in the Diaspora (Radbaz).</i> When produce from <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>, are brought to the Diaspora, they are exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad maintains that <i>challah</i> must be separated from such dough by Rabbinic decree. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that this is obvious from the following halachah.</i> [This is derived from <i>ibid.</i>:] "to which I will bring you." [Implied is that in that land,] you are liable, whether for the produce of the land itself or for that of other lands.
<i>Challah</i> should also be separated in the Diaspora by Rabbinic decree so that the Jewish people will not forget the laws of <i>challah. Challah</i> from the Diaspora should not be brought to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, just as <i>terumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 2:17. Since the Diaspora is ritually impure by Rabbinic decree, any dough brought from there to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> would be consigned to destruction. However, it should not be burnt immediately, because we do not know that it definitely contracted ritual impurity in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and it is forbidden to burn <i>challah</i> unnecessarily. Nor may it be returned to the Diaspora, lest people think it is permitted to take <i>challah</i> from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to the Diaspora [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 4:10)].</i> and first fruits<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> from there should not be brought [to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>]. If one should bring [such <i>challah</i>], it should be left to the day before Pesach and burned<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since the dough is <i>chametz</i>, "leavened," it must be destroyed before the onset of the Pesach holiday.</i> like <i>terumah</i>.
There are three different sets of laws that apply to <i>challah</i> in three different lands. In the entire area that was settled by those who returned from Babylonia until Kziv,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:8.</i> one <i>challah</i> should be separated according to the appropriate measure<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 2.</i> and the priests may partake of it. In the remaining portions of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> that were settled by the Jews who came out of Egypt, but not by those who returned from Babylonia - i.e., from Kziv until Amanah<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:7.</i> - two <i>challot</i> should be separated. One should be burnt and one should be eaten.<br>Why do we separate two <i>challot</i> there? Because the first <i>challah</i> is impure, because this land was not sanctified in the time of Ezra and the first sanctification was nullified after the Jews were exiled.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Thus in a strict halachic sense, this land has the status of the Diaspora.</i> [Nevertheless,] since [the land] is from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, a <i>challah</i> - one forty-eighth [of the dough] is separated and is burnt. A second <i>challah</i> is also separated and given to a priest to eat, so that people will not say that pure <i>terumah</i> should be burnt. For the first <i>challah</i> was burnt even though it did not contract impurity in a manner that was known to all.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since this land was once <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, not everyone knows that it is impure like the Diaspora.</i> This second <i>challah</i> does not have a minimum measure.

[Since] both of these are Rabbinic institutions, it is preferable to make the one that is eaten larger.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">So that food is not wasted.</i> Accordingly, there is no minimum measure for the one that is burnt.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the leniency here applies only after the priests have immersed in a <i>mikveh</i>.

<i>Challah</i> is called <i>terumah</i>.

Chapter 6

One who purchases bread from a baker is obligated [to separate] <i>challah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries raise a question concerning this ruling, because seemingly, the baker should separate <i>challah</i> himself. Moreover, because of the severity of the prohibition of <i>challah</i>, the common people were not considered suspect to refrain from making this separation.<br>The Radbaz explains that we are speaking about an instance where the baker told the purchaser to separate <i>challah</i>, alternatively, an instance where the baker is suspect not to separate <i>challah</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the responsibility for the baker to separate <i>challah</i> applies only when the <i>challah</i> is ritually pure. Since it will be eaten by the priest, it is appropriate that the baker separate it. When, by contrast, it is impure and must be burnt, it should be separated by the purchaser.</i> He may separate a portion from bread freshly taken from the oven for bread that has cooled or from bread that has cooled for bread freshly taken from the oven. [This applies] even with regard to many trays of bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Difusim</i>, translated as "trays," literally means "molds." In the Talmudic era, bread was baked in various molds so that the loaves would be shaped differently. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 1:3), the Rambam explains that there was an opinion which forbade separating <i>challah</i> from one tray for another lest the flour used to bake the different breads was from different years.</i>
The obligation [to separate] <i>challah</i> applies only to [dough from] the five species of grain: wheat barley, rye, oats, and spelt,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., whether the dough is made from each of the species individually or a combination of any of the five, as stated in Halachah 15.</i> as [implied by Numbers 15:19]: "When you partake of the bread of the land." The term "bread" refers only to a loaf made from these five species.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 1:1) derives this concept because there is an association between <i>challah</i> and <i>matzah. Matzah</i> may only be made from these five species, for they are the only species that can become leaven. Hence, it is these five to which the mitzvah of <i>challah</i> applies. See Halachah 11 which discusses the laws that apply when a dough is made using one of these grains and other species.</i> If, however, one makes bread from rice, millet, or other legumes, there is no obligation of <i>challah</i> at all.
Although there is no obligation to separate <i>terumah</i> from <i>leket, shichachah, pe'ah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">These mitzvot refer to grain left for the poor.</i> grain which is ownerless,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When the grain was left by its owner, it was ownerless and hence, there were no agricultural obligations incumbent upon it.

Nevertheless, since a dough made from such grain will become leaven, there is an obligation to separate <i>challah</i> [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:4)].</i> there is an obligation to separate <i>challah</i> from these. Similarly, there is an obligation to separate <i>challah</i> [from dough made from grain in the following circumstances]: the tithes were separated from the grain early while it was still stalks<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Before it was threshed; see <i>Hilchot Terumah</i>3:13, <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 3:19.</i> and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> was separated from it, even though the portion of the great <i>terumah</i> is still included in it,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For as stated in <i>Hilchot Terumah, op. cit.</i>, there is no obligation to separate <i>terumah</i> from such grain. And since there is no obligation to separate <i>terumah</i>, one might think that one is also exempt from the obligation to separate <i>challah</i></i> [grain that was from] the second tithe or consecrated property that was redeemed, the extra [portions of barley harvested for] the <i>omer</i> offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 7:11-12, three <i>se'ah</i> of barley would be harvested for the <i>omer</i> offering. That barley was then made into flour, sifted and refined until only an <i>isaron</i> (a far smaller measure) was selected for the <i>omer</i> offering. The remainder of the barley was redeemed and could be used for mundane purposes.</i> the two loaves [prepared to be offered on Shavuot], and [the loaves prepared for] the showbread<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the extra flour which had been set aside for the two loaves or the showbread, like the remainder of the barley mentioned in the previous note, it could be redeemed and then used for mundane purposes.</i> which were redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In all these instances, since the dough was prepared after it was redeemed, it is considered as bread belonging to an ordinary person. Hence, the obligation to tithe it applies (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
When a dough was made from grain from the second tithe in Jerusalem<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Although produce of the second tithe is "the property of the Most High," in Jerusalem, it is permitted to be eaten by ordinary people.

If, however, the obligation to separate <i>challah</i> is Scriptural in origin, it would take precedence.</i>
The loaves for the thanksgiving offering<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Together with the thanksgiving offering, 40 loaves (10 each of four types) were offered.</i> and the wafers for the nazirite offering<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Together with the ram, a nazirite offered 30 loaves (10 each of three types).

There is an obligation to separate <i>challah</i> from a dough made for partners<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if the dough is not large enough that each of the partners will receive a portion the size of an olive (Radbaz). Even though they intend to separate the bread after it is baked, as long as they do not intend to separate the dough, they are obligated to separate <i>challah</i> (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 326:1).</i> and a dough made for many people.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">We are speaking about a situation where a person bakes bread in order to give it to many people.

When a person makes dough using grain that is <i>tevel</i> - whether the <i>challah</i> is separated before <i>terumah</i> or the <i>terumah</i> separated before <i>challah</i> - what he did is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even though he should have separated the <i>terumah</i> before the dough was made, after the fact, his separation is effective</i> If he separated the <i>challah</i> first, he should not partake of it until he separates <i>terumah</i> and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for it.

The difference of opinion between them centers on the interpretation of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 3:5).

There is an obligation to separate <i>challah</i> in all [the following instances]:<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">All of the instances mentioned in the first clause of the halachah are not bread in the simple sense.

[And <i>challah</i> must be separated when] dough was baked whether in an oven or [in a pit] in the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since ultimately the dough was baked, the fact that the flour was boiled first is not significant (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 329:8).</i> whether in a frying pan or a deep pan, whether first one attached the dough to the frying pan or the deep pan and then heated them with fire from below until the loaf was baked or one heated them first and then attached the dough.<br>If, however, one made a dough to dry it in the sun alone or to cook it in a pot, it is exempt from <i>challah</i>, for [dough cooked] in the sun is not bread whether it was kneaded with water or other liquids.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, dough boiled in water is not considered as bread, but as cooked food.</i> Similarly, roasted grain that was kneaded whether with water or honey and which is eaten without being baked is exempt, for the obligation of <i>challah</i> applies only to a dough that will ultimately be baked as bread for human consumption.
When a dough was first kneaded to make a dough to be cooked in the sun and then the person completed making it for a loaf of bread, or he began making it to bake bread and completed it to cook it in the sun and similarly, when roasted flour was kneaded to bake a loaf of bread, there is an obligation to separate <i>challah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As long as there was an intent to use the dough for bread at one stage in its preparation, <i>challah</i> must be separated.</i>

Hence we use that as the size of the required measure of dough (<i>Eruvin</i> 83b).</i> whether from one of the five species or from all five together, for they are all combined to reach the minimum measure.<br>What is the measure of an <i>omer</i>?

A fingerbreadth refers to the width of a thumb.<br>Thus an <i>omer</i> is a measure that is ten fingerbreadths by ten fingerbreadths by a height of approximately 3 and one ninth fingerbreadths. Similarly, a cube with each side six and seven ninths fingerbreadths produces a measure of an <i>omer</i>.<br>How much does this measure contain? The volume of 43 and 1/5 eggs.

Moreover, the Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 326:3) rules that if the women consent to having their flour mixed in a larger dough, an obligation to separate <i>challah</i> is created.<br>The Ra'avad maintains that if one woman makes dough to use as yeast, the law mentioned with regard to a baker in the previous halachah applies to her and she is required to separate <i>challah.</i> Here the leniency is granted because several women are involved.

[The following laws apply when] there are two doughs that when combined comprise the measure that obligates the separation of <i>challah</i>, but neither comprises that measure alone should they touch each other and become attached to each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz emphasizes that touching each other is not sufficient; the two doughs must become attached. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 325:1).</i> If they belong to two individuals,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Who are not partners (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 326:1).</i> they are exempt from <i>challah</i> even though they are of the same type of grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachah which distinguishes between doughs made from one type and those made from two.

[Different rules apply if] the two belonged to one person. If they were from one type [of grain], they are combined and <i>challah</i> is obligated to be separated from them. If they are from two types, they are not combined. [The rationale is that] we assume that one person does not object [to the combination of his doughs].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since they both belong to him and are of the same type of grain, why would he object to their combination?<br>This, however, applies only when the two doughs are types that would normally be mixed together.

What is meant by the statement that if they belonged to one person and were from the same type [of grain] they are combined?

And oats can be combined with barley and spelt, but not with rye or wheat.</i>
A dough from grain from one year should not be combined with a dough from grain from the previous year even though they are of the same species. [This is a decree,] lest people say that <i>terumah</i> may be separated from new grain for old grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 10:18.</i> A person should not separate [the <i>challah</i>] from the middle of the two.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., taking a portion of both of the two doughs. This advice was given by Rabbi Yishmael (<i>Challah</i> 4:4).</i> Instead, he should bring another dough - either from this year or the previous - and combine it with them to complete the required measure.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., placing the doughs of new grain on either side of the dough of old grain or the doughs of old grain on either side of the dough from new grain. Since the person will see that he is adding an extra dough, he will not err and think that one may separate <i>terumah</i> from new grain for old grain [<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 324:8); see Halachah 6]. The Radbaz offers a different explanation.</i><br>When does the above apply? When one dough touches another. If, however, one mixes flour from the species of grain and makes a single dough from one of them, the five are combined to comprise the measure of dough required for <i>challah</i>, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 6, Halachah 15.</i>
When there is a dough that is less than the required measure on one side and another dough less than the required measure on the other side,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The two doughs on the sides are of the same type of grain and together, they comprise the required measure.</i> and a dough that is exempt from <i>challah</i> in the middle - e.g., a dough of rice, a dough of <i>terumah [flour]</i> or from <i>terumah [flour]</i> that was mixed with ordinary flour, or a dough from a gentile<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6, Halachot 2-4, 9-10, which mention the exemption of these doughs.</i> - [the doughs] are not combined even though they touch each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the two external doughs touch the middle dough.

When, by contrast, there is a dough from which <i>challah</i> was separated between them, [the two outer doughs] can be combined, because originally, there was an obligation to separate <i>challah</i> from the dough in the center.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In all the instances mentioned in this halachah, the governing principle is that even if the dough in the center cannot be combined with those on the side (as explained in Halachot 1-4), since it is fit to require the separation of <i>challah</i>, it does not prevent the doughs on the side from being combined.</i> Similarly, if a dough that was consecrated was in the center, they are combined, [because that dough] is fit to be redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is speaking about a dough that was not consecrated until after it was made.

Similarly, if there was a dough of another type of grain, a dough belonging to another person, or a dough from a different year between them, the doughs on the sides are combined [to comprise an obligation to separate] <i>challah</i>.
There were two doughs, each one of them less than the minimum measure for <i>challah</i>. One separated <i>challah</i> from each of them. Afterwards, they touched each other and [the combined doughs] comprise the [required] measure.

Two gentiles<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to two Jews or a Jew and a gentile, as explained in the following halachot.</i> made a dough comprising the required measure [for <i>challah</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since they were gentiles (see Chapter 6, Halachah 8) at the time the obligation to separate <i>challah</i> could have taken effect, the mitzvah of <i>challah</i> is not relevant to them at all .

Afterwards, they converted<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, they divided the dough after they converted, there is no obligation to separate <i>challah</i> even if they added to the dough. For in such an instance, they would be comparable to the two Jews mentioned in the following halachah (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>).</i> and after the conversion, each one added to his portion until it comprised the [required] measure. There is an obligation [to separate] <i>challah</i>. [The rationale is that] there was no time that it was of the size obligating [<i>challah</i>] while they were gentiles, because each was to receive less than the required measure.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Hence we do not say - as is said with regard to the following halachah - since the dough was exempt at the time when it could have been obligated, it cannot become obligated again.</i>
If, however, two Jews made [a dough] in the above manner and then, they divided it and each one of them added to his portion<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 326:8 emphasizes that for this law to apply the addition must be less than the size that obligates the separation of <i>challah</i>.</i> until it comprised the required measure, it is exempt.

He admits that it appears to have a source in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 3:4), but argues that logically, it is hard to distinguish this from a situation where a person made a dough smaller than the required size and then attached it to a dough of the required size (see Chapter 6, Halachah 16). Hence, he rules that both Jews should separate <i>challah</i> from the dough after they increased its size.<br>The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> support the Rambam's ruling, differentiating between the two instances by explaining that when a dough is smaller than the required size, it has never reached a state where the obligation to separate <i>challah</i> relates to it. In contrast, in the instance described here, the dough was of the size that obligates the separation of <i>challah</i> and it was exempted. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 326:4) quotes the Rambam's view.</i>
[Different rules apply when], by contrast, the dough was owned by a gentile and a Jew in partnership and they divided it.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that this is speaking about a situation where the two had not originally intended to divide their dough and then decided to divide it. Had they originally intended to divide it, it would be necessary to separate <i>challah</i> from the portion belonging to the convert as well.</i> If, afterwards, the gentile converted and then added to his portion and the Jew added to his portion until each one of them completed the measure that requires the separation of <i>challah</i>, there is an obligation to separate <i>challah</i> from the dough of the Jew,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the situation mentioned in the previous halachah, the dough was not originally intended to be divided. Hence, since the gentile has a portion in it, while it is whole, it is not considered as if the mitzvah of <i>challah</i> relates to it. Thus the Jew's portion of the dough was never of the size that requires the separation of <i>challah</i> and when he increases its size, an obligation is created (Radbaz).</i> but the dough of the gentile<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the convert.</i> is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since originally, the gentile's involvement in the dough caused his portion to be exempted, when he adds to it, it is not liable, based on the principle explained above. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that there is an obligation to separate <i>challah</i> from both doughs. For just as the mitzvah of <i>challah</i> is not considered as relating to the Jew's dough, it also does not relate to the gentile's dough. Hence, when he adds to it after his conversion, the obligation takes effect. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> favor the Rambam's understanding and it is quoted as halachah by <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 330:6).</i>
[The following laws apply when a person] takes yeast from a dough from which <i>challah</i> was not separated and places it in a dough from which <i>challah</i> was separated.

[In this manner,] he is separating [<i>challah</i>] from [dough] that is in the same place.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">As is required (Chapter 5, Halachah 14).

See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 15:6. Hence, he is not considered to be separating <i>challah</i> from dough that is obligated for that which is exempt (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 324:20).</i>
A dough from which <i>challah</i> has not been separated is like ordinary produce and not like <i>challah</i> with regard to the laws of ritual purity. As will be explained in the appropriate place,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTuma'ah</i> 11:2, 15.</i> impurity of the second degree does not bring about impurity of the third degree with regard to ordinary produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">It does, however, have such an effect with regard to <i>terumah</i> and <i>challah</i>.</i><br>It is permitted to cause ordinary produce to contract ritual impurity in <i>Eretz Yisrael.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>See Hilchot Tuma'at Ochalin 16:9.

To clarify this, the Rambam began this halachah: "A dough from which <i>challah</i> has not been separated is like ordinary produce and... impurity of the second degree does not bring about impurity of the third degree with regard to ordinary produce" (Radbaz).</i> from the dough in the same place.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Ordinarily to separate <i>challah</i> for two doughs in the same place, it is not necessary for them to touch.

A person may make a pure dough and refrain from separating <i>challah</i> from it, setting it - or a portion of it - aside to continuously separate <i>challot</i> from other doughs with it until the dough set aside becomes <i>challah</i> in its entirety,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the person would consider an appropriate portion of the dough set aside as <i>challah</i> for a given dough and would continue doing this for future doughs until the entire dough that was set aside became <i>challah</i> [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 4:6)].</i> provided [the dough set aside] does not become spoiled to the point that it is no longer fit for human consumption.

This applies even if the one who gave it is a Torah scholar who knows that flour cannot be separated as <i>challah</i>. Although one could assume that he was giving the flour to the priest as a gift, it must be returned lest the priest think that it was <i>challah</i> and not separate <i>challah</i> from the dough he makes from it (<i>Kiddushin</i> 46b; <i>Turei Zahav</i> 327:1).</i> and there is an obligation [to separate] <i>challah</i> from a dough [made from] the remainder [of the flour].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since the first separation is of no consequence.</i> If the flour set aside [mistakenly] as <i>challah</i> is an <i>omer</i> in measure<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it was of the measure from which we are required to separate <i>challah</i>.</i> and a dough was made from it, one must separate <i>challah</i> from it as [is necessary with regard to doughs made] from any ordinary flour.
When should <i>challah</i> be set aside? When one adds water and mixes the flour with the water, he should set aside [a portion as] <i>challah</i> from the first portion that is kneaded, as [indicated by Numbers 15:20:] "From the first of your dough."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, stating that it is undesirable to separate <i>challah</i> in this manner, for as indicated by Halachah 4, the obligation to separate <i>challah</i> has not taken effect yet. Based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pesachim</i> 3:3), the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that the statements in this halachah are a safeguard against the dough becoming ritually impure. From the time the water is mixed with the flour, it is permitted to separate the <i>challah</i> and one may do so if he is worried that the dough will become ritually impure. It is, however, preferable to wait until the dough is thoroughly mixed as stated in Halachah 4. Certainly, this applies in the present era when there is no need to take safeguards against ritual impurity [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 327:3)]</i><br>[The above applies] provided a measure of flour equal to an <i>omer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it was of the measure from which we are required to separate <i>challah</i>.</i> that has not become mixed with water does not remain in the kneading trough.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For then the dough made from that flour would have a separate obligation. When, by contrast, there is less than that measure, it is considered as ancillary to the initial dough.</i> If he stipulates: "This is <i>challah</i> for the dough, for the yeast, and for the flour that remains. When it all becomes one dough, the portion set aside will become sanctified as <i>challah</i>," it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if an <i>omer</i> of flour remains. Since he can easily mix the dough, he can make a stipulation that will take effect when he actually mixes it together. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 327:2) states that it is desirable to teach women who separate <i>challah</i> to make this stipulation.</i>
If the person left the dough [intact] until it was all kneaded and mixed together and separated [the <i>challah</i>] afterwards, [the delay] is of no consequence. If he does not separate <i>challah</i> while the mixture is a dough, but bakes the entire dough, he should separate [<i>challah</i>] from the loaf, as we explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 6, Halachah 16.</i>
When does the obligation [to separate] <i>challah</i> from dough take effect? When the wheat [flour] was rolled into a ball and [all of] the flour becomes mixed with it or when the barley [flour] was made into a single mass and formed one block. One may snack from the dough until the wheat [flour] was rolled into a ball or the barley [flour] was made into a single mass.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">After the obligation to separate <i>challah</i> takes effect, however, it is forbidden to snack from the dough. It is considered as <i>tevel</i> and one is liable as stated in the following halachah.</i> The laws pertaining to wheat [flour] pertain to spelt [flour] and those pertaining to barley [flour] pertain to oat and rye [flour].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For spelt flour has characteristics similar to wheat flour, and rye and oats to barley.</i>
Once the wheat [flour] was rolled into a ball or the barley [flour] was made into a single mass, one who partakes of it before <i>challah</i> was separated is liable for death [at the hand of heaven], because it is <i>tevel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 10:19; <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 1:5; 9:2.</i> Therefore, if there is a Scriptural obligation [to separate] <i>challah</i> from the dough, a person who partakes of it is liable for lashes, as is anyone who partakes of <i>tevel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:1.

When a dough from ordinary flour becomes mixed with flour that is <i>terumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">And thus <i>challah</i> need not be separated from it.</i> before [all the flour] was rolled into a ball, it is exempt [from the obligation of <i>challah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 4.

Similarly, if a gentile gave [flour] to a Jew to make a dough for him and then gave him [the dough] as a present.

[The following laws apply when] a convert joins the Jewish faith.

If there is a doubt [concerning the matter], there is an obligation, [because eating bread from which <i>challah</i> was not separated] is a transgression punishable by death [at the hand of heaven].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam adds this explanation (based on <i>Chullin</i> 134a), because generally, we would follow the principle: "When one desires to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is on him" (see Chapter 9, Halachah 13). Nevertheless, in this instance, because of the severity of the transgression, <i>challah</i> should be separated. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 330:3 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 330:8 note that in the present age, when there is a question whether of not <i>challah</i> has been separated, one is exempt, for at present the observance of the mitzvah of <i>challah</i> is Rabbinic in origin. On this basis, the <i>Sifei Cohen</i> questions why this law is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 330:5),</i> If a non-priest [unknowingly] partook of this <i>challah</i> that was separated due to such a doubt or the like, he is not liable to add a fifth [when making restitution].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since there is a doubt concerning the matter, the person must make restitution for the <i>challah</i>, because whenever there is a question with regard to Scriptural Law, we rule stringency and require him to make restitution so that he can gain atonement.

When a question arises concerning the ritual purity of a dough before it was rolled together as a ball,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And thus, the obligation to separate <i>challah</i> has not been established.

[The rationale is that with regard to] any circumstance where impurity would be imparted to ordinary produce were one certain that it transpired, our Sages decreed that if there is a doubt that it transpired, a dough upon which the obligation to separate <i>challah</i> already fell should not intentionally be made impure, for that obligation has already taken effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">We are forbidden to cause <i>challah</i> mandated by Scriptural Law to contract ritual impurity (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 12:1). In this instance, since the <i>challah</i> has not been separated, that prohibition would not be violated. Nevertheless, since the obligation to separate <i>challah</i> has been established, it is preferable to be stringent.</i> Instead, the <i>challah</i> [separated] is a tentative state; it is not eaten,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Lest it be impure.

As an initial preference, a person should not prepare his dough in a state of ritual impurity.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to dough prepared in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> when the obligation to separate <i>challah</i> was of Scriptural origin.

A loaf to serve as <i>challah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a loaf to be set aside and used as <i>challah</i> for loaves to be baked in the future.</i> should not be prepared in a state of ritual purity for a common person.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Lest over time he cause it to become impure.

The wife of a <i>chaver</i> may sift and strain [flour] together with the wife of a common person.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Although the common person's wife is presumed to be ritually impure, nevertheless, since the flour is dry, it is not susceptible to ritual impurity.

This leniency is allowed only as an expression of "the ways of piece" (<i>Sh'vi'it, loc. cit.</i>).</i> Once water has been mixed with the dough, however, she should not help her, because [the wife of the common person] makes her dough while ritually impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., needless to say, the wife of the <i>chaver</i> should not let the wife of the common person help her, for her dough would become ritually impure.

[The rationale is that] one should not reinforce the hands of transgressors.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">And preparing dough in a state of ritual impurity was considered a transgression in the Talmudic era when the laws of ritual impurity were observed.</i> One may, however, transport bread with him to a bakery.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For then the baking process has already been completed.</i>

Chapter 9

It is a positive commandment for anyone<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., other than a priest or Levite (see Halachah 8).</i> who slaughters a kosher domesticated animal to give a priest the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 143) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 506) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. <i>Chulin</i> 134b states that the priests merited these gifts in recognition of the heroism of Pinchas in stopping the Jews' lewd behavior with the Midianite women.</i> as [Deuteronomy 18:50] states: "This is the judgment [due] the priests...." These are universally known as "presents."<br>This mitzvah is practiced at all times, whether at the time the Temple is standing or not, whether in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> or in the Diaspora,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is a matter of debate among the commentaries. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 61:21) quote the Rambam's view, but also mention the opinion of Rashi and Rabbenu Meir of Rutenberg who maintain that this mitzvah is not practiced in the Diaspora. They conclude that this latter view is observed. The <i>Sefer HaChinuch, loc. cit.</i>, writes that in the abstract, he agrees that the law should be observed in the present era as well, but "we do not have the power to compel the butchers to observe it." See also the Responsa of the <i>Chatam Sofer</i>, sec. 301, where he writes that he would observe this mitzvah.</i> with regard to ordinary animals but not consecrated ones.
There is an obligation to separate the above-mentioned presents from all consecrated animals that had a permanent blemish<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These blemishes are listed in <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i>, ch. 7, <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeach</i>, ch. 2.</i> before they were consecrated and were redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since they are permanently blemished at the time of their consecration, it is obvious that they will ultimately be redeemed and used for ordinary purposes, not as a sacrifice. Hence it is never considered that their actual bodies became consecrated. Once they are redeemed, they are like any ordinary property. Hence the obligation to separate the presents falls upon them (Radbaz).</i> If, by contrast, they had a temporary blemish<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Such blemishes are listed in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeach</i> 2:7.</i> before their consecration or they were consecrated when they were unblemished, but afterwards, they became blemished,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Even permanently.</i> and they were redeemed, they are exempt from these presents.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In such a situation, the consecration of the animal encompasses its actual body. The rationale is that in the first instance mentioned in this clause, the blemish is not permanent. Hence, it does not block the consecration. And in the second instance, the blemish comes after the consecration already took effect. And since the consecration affected the actual bodies of the animals, it continues to have an effect even after the animals have been redeemed. They are considered as <i>pesulei hamukdashim</i> and are exempt from this obligation (Radbaz, based on <i>Bechorot</i> 15a).</i>
If there is an unresolved doubt whether an animal is a firstborn,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A sheep that had not given birth before gave birth to two offspring, a male - which would be separated as a firstborn - and a female which would not - and it is not known which of them was born first.

In the instance described above, the Israelite who is the owner of the animal may retain possession of it, for we follow the principle: "When one desires to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is on him." Thus since a priest cannot prove that the animal was a firstborn, it remains the property of the owner. Nevertheless, he must give the presents to a priest based on the rationale presented by the Rambam.</i> [The rationale is:] If it is a firstborn, it must be given to a priest in its entirety.

[The rationale is that] it is considered as an animal which a priest acquired and then gave to its owners, because of its blemish.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in exchange for giving the priest the weaker animal, the priest forfeits his claim on the other animal.

Accordingly, the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 61) questions the Rambam's ruling for it appears to contradict his own statements in the continuation of this halachah. Rav Yosef Caro (in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and his <i>Beit Yosef</i> to the <i>Tur</i>) explains that the Rambam understands the term <i>ko'i</i> as referring to an independent species that we do not know whether to classify as a domesticated animal or as a wild beast. He maintains that the proper version of <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> is "any animal whose classification as a domesticated animal or as a beast is doubtful is a <i>ko'i</i>" and he maintains that <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 14:4 serves as proof of this interpretation.</i> even though its status is undetermined.<br>When a male deer mates with a goat and it gives birth, there is an obligation [to give] half the presents [to a priest].

See <i>Bechorot</i> 12b.</i><br>Priests and Levites are exempt from the presents, as [the above prooftext] states: "from the people." It is questionable whether the Levites are considered as part of "the people" or not. Therefore [the presents] are not taken from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">As above, when one desires to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is on him. And it is impossible for a priest to prove that the Levite is obligated.<br>From <i>Chulin</i> 131a, it is obvious that a Levite does not have the right to receive presents (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 61:12).</i> If, however, a priest took them, he need not return them.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For now they are in the possession of the priest. He may therefore retain them, for the Levite cannot prove that he is exempt.<br>The Rambam's view is cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 61:23). The Rama maintains that since the law is that a priest is not entitled to take it, if he takes it by force, he is required to return it. This difference of opinion reflects a divergence on an issue of a greater scope. See <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 5:3, where the Rambam rules that when there is a question concerning whether an animal is a firstborn or not, a priest is not permitted to take possession of it. If he takes possession of it, however, it is not expropriated from him. In that instance as well, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 315:1) follows the Rambam's approach and the Rama differs.</i>
When does the above<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That the priests are exempt from giving presents.</i> apply? When one slaughters for his own sake. [Different laws apply to] a priest who is a butcher, who slaughters [animals] and sells them in the marketplace. We grant him two or three weeks.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">During which he is allowed to keep the presents for himself.</i> Afterwards, we expropriate the presents from him and grant them to other priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since he sells the meat, he is acting on behalf of others and they are not absolved from the obligation of giving the presents. See the gloss of Rav Yosef Korcus who debates whether this is a Scriptural Law or a Rabbinic decree.</i><br>If he established a butcher shop to sell meat, we do not wait at all. Instead, we expropriate the presents from him immediately. If he refrains from giving them, we place him under a ban of ostracism<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, ch. 6.</i> until he gives them.
A person who slaughters an animal for the sake of a priest or a gentile is exempt from [the obligation to give presents].<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">We are speaking about a situation where the animal belongs entirely to the priest or the gentile. It is the ownership of the animal, not the identity of the slaughterer which is significant. Since neither the priest nor the gentile would be required to give these presents, a slaughterer who acts on their behalf is also exempt.</i><br>A person who enters into a partnership with a priest [in the ownership of an animal] must mark his portion, so that he will leave the presents in the portion of the priest. If he does not mark his portion, he is obligated [to give] these presents, because the fact that the priest is his partner is not a matter of public knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, if he does not give a priest the presents, people will suspect him of withholding them.</i> Accordingly, if the priest was standing with him in the butcher store and dealing and negotiating with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">And thus it is evident that they are partners.</i> he is not required to mark [his portion].<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 61) differs with the Rambam, explaining <i>Chulin</i> 133a,b (the Rambam's source) differently. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro elaborates in support of the Rambam's interpretation (even though at the outset, he states that the interpretation of the <i>Tur</i> appears more appropriate to the simple meaning of the passage. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 61:25), he follows the <i>Tur's</i> interpretation.</i><br>When a person enters a partnership with a gentile [in the ownership of an animal], he need not mark his portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">And we nevertheless assume that the presents were in the gentile's portion.</i> [The rationale is that] as a rule, a gentile will speak excessively and inform everyone that he is [the Jew's] partner, even if [the Jew] is not present at the time of the sale.
[If, when negotiating a partnership agreement<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (in his commentary to <i>Chulin</i> 132a, the source for the Rambam's ruling) and similarly, the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 61:29) interpret this as referring to a sale and not a partnership agreement.</i> regarding the ownership of an animal,] a priest stipulates to [his partner, an Israelite,] that they are partners with the exception of the presents, the presents belong to the priest. Since the priest stipulated "with the exception of...," he left himself the portion of [the animal containing] the presents. Hence, they are his.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Even if they were not marked [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 10:3)].</i><br>If, however, the priest told the Israelite: "...on the condition that the presents are mine," the presents belong to the Israelite and he may give them to any priest he desires. Even though [the priest] stipulated that they were his, [the animal] is not exempt from [the obligation to give] the presents.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz explains that the rationale is that his stipulation runs contrary to the Torah - for the Torah requires that the presents be given - and whenever a person makes a stipulation that runs contrary to Torah law, the stipulation is nullified. Hence, it is as if the stipulation was never made and the priest's partner must separate the presents as stated in the previous halachah.</i> For by saying "on the condition that...," he did not leave himself [the ownership of] the presents. Since he did not leave himself a share in their ownership, he did not acquire them through this stipulation.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note an apparent contradiction between the Rambam's ruling here and his ruling in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 6:19 where he states:<br>When a priest sells a field to an Israelite and tells him: "[I am selling it] on the condition that the tithes from it belong to me forever," they belong to him. [The rationale is that] saying "on the condition that" is tantamount to setting aside for himself [the portion of the field] where the tithes [grow].<br>Although there are explicit Talmudic sources for both rulings, their logic appears contradictory. Among the resolutions offered is that here, the Rambam is speaking about the ownership of an animal, while in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i>, he is speaking about landed property and the principles of ownership are different in these two instances.</i>
If a priest was a partner in [the ownership of] the head, he is exempt from [giving] the jaw. If he is a partner in the front leg, he is exempt from the fore leg. If he is a partner in the digestive organs, he is exempt from the maw.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The new concept taught by this halachah is that one can be exempt from part, but not all, of the presents.</i><br>If the priest told [the Israelite]: "The entire animal is mine, but the head is yours," he is obligated to give the jaw, for the portion that must be given belongs to the Israelite.
[The following laws apply when] a gentile converts and he is in the process of having an animal slaughtered. If it was slaughtered before he converted, he is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Because at that time, he was not obligated, as stated in Halachah 10.</i> If [it was slaughtered] after he converted, he is obligated. If there is a doubt concerning the matter, [we follow the principle]: When one desires to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is on him.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, the convert may retain possession of the presents. As mentioned in the notes to Chapter 8, Halachah 9, when a similar situation arises concerning <i>challah</i>, the Rambam rules that the convert is liable to separate the dough. Nevertheless, a distinction between the two can be made because of the severity of that prohibition.</i>
It is permitted to partake [of the meat] of an animal from which the presents were not separated. [The situation] is not analogous to <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In which instance, it is forbidden to partake of the produce until the <i>terumah</i> and the tithes are separated.</i> [The rationale is that] the presents due to be given the priests are separate and distinct.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the produce where the <i>terumah</i> and tithes must be separated from the produce as a whole.</i> It is forbidden for an Israelite to partake of the presents themselves without the permission of a priest. If he transgresses and partakes of them, damages them, or sells them, he is not liable to make financial restitution.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he has no legal obligation to make financial restitution. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro questions whether the person has a moral and spiritual obligation to make restitution and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 61:15), he rules that he does.</i> [The rationale is that] this is money that has no known plaintiff.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">There is no one priest who can claim that the presents are his and they must be returned to him, for until they are given, the owner has the right to give them to any priest he desires.</i> A person who purchases them - even though he is forbidden to do so - is permitted to partake of them, because when the presents to the priests are stolen, the theft effect a change in ownership.
If one tells a butcher: "Sell me the digestive organs of a cow," and there were presents<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the maw.</i> among them, [the purchaser] should give them to a priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For they belong to him.</i> but [the seller] need not decrease the price [accordingly].<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was obvious that the maw was among the organs he purchased, the purchaser should have realized that it was not included in the price. Instead, he was paying him for the remainder of the meat (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> If [the purchaser] bought [the organs] by weight, he should give them to the priest and deduct their value from the butcher's [due].<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since the maw did not belong to the butcher - for it must be given to the priest - he had no right to sell it (<i>ibid.</i>). See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 10:4) which states that it is forbidden to buy the presents, because by doing so, one would be aiding theft.</i>
When a person sends meat to a friend and there were presents<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., some of the organs that have to be given the priest.</i> in [the parcel], the recipient need not be concerned that [the sender] transgressed and stole them.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For we do not suspect that a person sinned. Instead, the recipient assumes that the sender purchased the presents from a priest; alternatively, there were no priests in the area and he followed the advice given in the following clause.</i><br>In a place where there are no priests,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">And thus there is no one to give the presents to.</i> one should determine their financial value and partake of them, [so as not to cause] a priest a loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For if he sets them aside, they will spoil. There is no difficulty in doing so, for the presents are not consecrated at all.</i> He should then give the money to any priest he desires.
If a person wants to give the presents to only one priest, he may do so. If he wants to divide them [and give them to several], he should not give half the maw or half the foreleg to one [priest]. Instead, he should give the foreleg to one, the maw to another, and the jaw to two others. [This is inferred from Deuteronomy 18:4]: "And you shall give it to him," i.e., give him a portion that is a significant present.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See the notes of Rav Kapach to the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 10:4). There he writes that the original version of the Rambam's Commentary did not contain this law, but the later version did.</i> If [he is giving presents] from an ox, he may divide them into portions,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">For even a portion of the organs of an ox are of a significant size.</i> provided each portion is a significant present.
What is meant by the foreleg? The right foreleg,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 61:1 states that this is derived from the fact that the prooftext speaks of "the foreleg," i.e., the important one. An animal's foreleg is comprised of three bones. According to the Rambam, the lower two are given to the priest. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 10:4).</i> The portion from the upper-joint until the ankle joint; two limbs, one connected with the other. The jaw refers to the jaw bones until the large ring of the protrusion of the gullet with the tongue between the bones.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 134b states that one should take the jaw until the place where the animal is slaughtered. See the accompanying diagrams.</i> All of this is given to the priest.
[When giving the jaw and the foreleg to the priest,] we do not pour boiling water on the hide [to remove the hair], nor do we skin it. Instead, we give it to [the priest] with its skin and wool. [We give a priest] the maw with the fat upon it<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">This fat is forbidden to be eaten (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 7:6).</i> and the fat within it. The priests have already accepted the custom of leaving the fat of the maw for the owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 134b explains that this is an act of generosity on the part of the priests. Since the presents are their personal property without any sanctity at all, they can do with them as they see fit. From the wording of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 61:4), however, it appears that this custom is not universally accepted.</i>
A women of the priestly family may partake of the presents even if she is married to an Israelite, because they are not consecrated. Moreover, her husband may partake of the presents for her sake.<br>A <i>challalah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 19:1 it describes a <i>challalah</i> as a woman born from relations forbidden to the priesthood or a woman who is forbidden to the priesthood who engaged in relations with a priest.</i> by contrast, may not partake of the presents, because <i>challalim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>challal</i> refers to the offspring of relations forbidden to a priest.</i> are not in the category of priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, just as the presents may not be given to a <i>challal</i>, they may not be given to a <i>challalah</i>.<br>The concept that <i>challalim</i> are not priests applies in many contexts. See <i>Hilchot Nesiat Kapayim</i> 15:5, <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 19:5, <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 6:7, <i>et al</i>.</i> If a priest desires to sell the presents, to give them as gifts, even to a gentile, or to feed them to the dogs, he may, for they are not consecrated at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 61:5 states that a priest should not give or sell them to gentiles or feed them to dogs unless they are no longer fit for human consumption.</i>
[The following rules apply when there is] a priest whose friends [continually] give him presents. If he desires to transfer ownership of them to a friend who is an Israelite,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's source (<i>Chulin</i> 133a) mentions that the recipient of these presents must be a Torah scholar. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 61:14) also mention that point. Apparently, the Rambam thinks that it is not an absolute necessity.</i> he may, even though they did not enter [the priest's] domain. Thus [the priest's] friends may slaughter [their animals] and give the presents to the Israelite who acquired them. [This applies] provided the Israelite is in difficult straits and does not have the means to buy meat and the priest who transfers the meat to him is his friend. If, however, the priest is the Israelite's attendant or his hired worker or employee, he may not transfer ownership [of the presents] until they enter his domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Once they are given to him, however, there are no restrictions on what he may do with them.</i> [This is a safeguard,] lest he compel him to do so.
A priest should not grab the presents, nor should he even request them verbally. Instead, if he is given them<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Turei Zahav</i> 61:12 states that this is derived from the word "and you shall give" in the prooftext.

Chapter 10

It is a positive commandment to give a priest the first shearings [of an animal],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 144) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 508) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Deuteronomy 18:4] states: 'Give him the first shearings of your flock.' Levites are considered like Israelites with regard to this mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as opposed to the presents described in the previous chapter, the Levites are required to separate these shearings.</i> There is no minimum measure for these shearings according to Scriptural law. According to Rabbinical Law, one should not give less than a sixtieth. It applies only in <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">But not in the Diaspora. Thus it resembles <i>terumah</i> - for both are called "first" and hence share similarilities in many laws - and not the presents of meat. Although the <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Chulin</i> 11:1) states that this mitzvah also applies in the Diaspora, according to the Rambam, the halachah does not follow that view.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 333:1) follows the Rambam's view.

What is implied?

Moreover, even if the animal is consecrated only for the sake of the Temple treasury, in which instance, it will ultimately be redeemed for personal use, since while it is consecrated, it is not "your sheep,' as the Rambam continues to explain, there is no obligation to give its first shearings.</i> and then sheared them. Is he obligated to redeem them and give [the first shearings] to the priests? Or if one consecrated an animal with the exception of its shearings, is he obligated in the first shearings? It is written [<i>ibid.</i>]: "your sheep,' [i.e., the obligation applies only to "your sheep.'
There is an obligation [to give a priest] the first shearing of any consecrated animals<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if the animal was consecrated only for the sake of the Temple treasury, as above, these laws apply. The rationale is that a blemished kosher animal that is consecrated to the Temple treasury is redeemed with the intent to be used as a sacrifice.</i> that possessed a permanent blemish before they were consecrated and were [then] redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was blemished at the time it was consecrated, the animal was never fit to be offered on the altar.

Hence, even after it was redeemed, it is not considered as an ordinary animal and it is exempt from the first shearings. See the parallel in Chapter 9, Halachah 2.</i>
The only animals whose first shearings we are obligated [to give a priest] are sheep, both male and female, for their wool is fit [to make] garments. If their wool was stiff and not fit for [making] garments, they are exempt from the first shearings, for this present is given to the priest for the sole purpose of providing him with garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Yosef Corcus explains that the Rambam (based on one of the opinions in <i>Chulin</i> 137a) is referring to the priestly garments which are made from wool and linen. For, otherwise, goats' wool is also fit to make ordinary garments. This explanation is also quoted by <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 333:2. The intent is not, however, that the first shearings should be used only for priestly garments, for as the Rambam states in the following halachah, the first shearings were given to the priests for their personal garments.</i>
Since the Holy One, blessed be He, granted [a priest] the <i>terumot</i> which provide him with bread and wine<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, the <i>terumot</i> also include oil and other fruits.</i> and He granted him the presents of meat<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Described in Chapter 9.</i> and the sacrificial meat of the Temple for meat,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the portions of the sin offerings, guilt offerings, and peace offerings which are granted to the priests.</i> He provided them with the first shearings for their garments and [restitution for property] stolen from a [childless] convert,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i>, Chapter 8.</i> devotion offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Arachin VaCharamim</i>, Chapter 6.</i> ancestral fields [that were consecrated and not redeemed],<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Which becomes the property of the priests; see <i>Hilchot Arachin VaCharamim</i>4:19.</i> and the redemption of the firstborn,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapters 11 and 12.</i> for their expenses and for their other needs. [These are granted to the priests,] because they are not granted an ancestral portion of the land, nor a share in the spoils of war.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shemitah VeYovel</i>, Chapter 13, with regard to both these points.</i>
If [a sheep's] wool was [naturally] red, black, or brown, there is an obligation [to give the priest] the first shearings. If, however, the wool was shorn and dyed, before it was given [to a priest], he is exempt from the first shearings.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">He is considered to have acquired the wool because he made a significant change in its nature. This ruling applies after the fact. As an initial preference, it is forbidden to make such a change [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 11:3; Rav Kappach's edition)].</i> If one bleached it before he gave it [to the priests], he is obligated to set [the wool] aside after he bleaches it.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For this is not considered as a significant change.</i> When a person pulls out the wool of ewes by hand instead of shearing it, he is obligated in the first shearings.

A dead sheep is not considered a sheep and cutting its wool is not considered as shearing.</i>
When a person sets aside the first shearings and they are lost, he is responsible to make restitution until he gives them to the priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz questions why the first shearings are different than all the other presents given to the priests where such a law is not found. He explains that the other presents involve grain and meat and a granary or a slaughter house are not located at a great distance from the residential area of a city. Hence, it is not very difficult for a priest to go and collect them. Sheep, by contrast, may not be allowed to pasture near residential areas. Hence, since it is far more difficult for a priest to collect them, the Torah made the owners responsible for the shearings.</i><br>When a person says: 'Let all of my shearings be considered as the first shearings,' his words are of consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 136b notes that in this respect, although they are also called "the first," the first shearings are different from <i>terumah</i> and <i>challah</i>. With regard to these separations, if one designates his entire crop as <i>terumah</i> or his entire dough as <i>challah</i>, his statements are of no consequence. The Radbaz explains that the term <i>terumah</i> - and <i>challah</i> is also called <i>terumah</i> - implies elevating one portion of a group from another portion. Hence, there must always be something left behind. The term 'the first shearings' does not have such a connotation.<br>Rav Yosef Corcus notes that <i>Chulin</i> 136b associates this ruling with the Rabbi Ila'ai's opinion that the first shearing applies in the Diaspora as well as in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Thus there is an apparent contradiction between the Rambam's ruling here and his ruling in Halachah 1 that the mitzvah of the first shearing applies only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Rav Yosef explains that the Rambam's ruling in Halachah 1 is based on custom and not on the acceptance of the opinions that differ with Rabbi Ila'ai.</i>
A person who purchases the shearings of a gentile's sheep after the gentile has shorn them is exempt from the first shearings.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This point is obvious. The Rambam (and his source, <i>Chulin</i> 138a) mention it only because of the contrast to the following laws. Rashi, however, interprets that passage differently. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 333:7) follows the Rambam's understanding, while the <i>Tur</i> and the Rama follow Rashi's view.</i> When he purchases [the gentile's] sheep for their shearing,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he never becomes the real owner of the sheep; he acquires them only for the right to shear their wool.</i> he is obligated even though the wool grew in the gentile's domain and the sheep are returned to the gentile after the shearing. Since the shearer is Jewish and the shearings belong to him, he is obligated. For the obligation takes effect only at the time of shearing.
[The following laws apply when] a person purchases the shearings of a fellow Jew. If the seller left a portion of his sheep to shear,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">And that portion contains the minimum measure mentioned in Halachah 13.</i> the seller is obligated to separate from [the shearing of] the remainder [the appropriate amount] for the entire [flock. This applies] even if the seller has not begun to shear [his sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since the seller has not begun shearing the sheep at all, it would seem reasonable to say that each person should give the first shearings from his portion. Nevertheless, the ruling is not so.</i> The rationale is that we operate under] the assumption that a person will not sell the presents to be given the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">And thus they remain in his portion. Selling these presents is prohibited and we assume that the person would not desire to transgress.</i> If [the seller] did not leave any [sheep to shear], the purchaser is obligated to separate [the first shearings].<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 138a explains that the seller tells the purchaser: 'I did not sell you the first shearings. The money I took from you is for the remainder of the wool that is not the priest's portion. I merely gave you the opportunity to give the presents to the priest of your choice."</i>
[A different rule applies it] there are two types of shearings, e.g., white wool and brown wool, or wool from males and wool from females, and one sold one and retained possession of the other. Both [the purchaser and the seller] should give the first shearings, [the purchaser] on what he purchased and the seller on what he retained.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Even though one may separate the first shearings from one type of wool for another type as evident from Halachah 15, in this instance, since the two types are owned by two separate people, each should separate the first shearings from his own wool.</i>
When a convert converts and he possesses sheep that are being shorn and it is not known whether they were shorn before he converted or after he converted, he is exempt. [The rationale is when] one desires to expropriate property from a colleague,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the priest desires to expropriate the first shearings from the owner. See the parallel in Chapter 9, Halachah 13. The Radbaz explains that this ruling follows the principle: When there is a doubt concerning a prohibition, we rule stringently. When there is a doubt concerning financial matters, we rule leniently.</i> the burden of proof is upon him.
How many sheep must there be for [a flock] to be obligated for the first shearings? No less than five,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 11:1 derives this from a non-literal interpretation of II Samuel 25:18.</i> provided their shearings is not less than the weight of 60 <i>sela</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>sela</i> is approximately 20 grams in contemporary measure.<br><i>Chulin</i> 11:2 states that this measure is required, for only then will the gift to the priest be significant, for it will be possible to make a small garment from it.</i> and the shearings of each one will not be less than the weight of 12 <i>sela</i>. If the shearings of one of them is less than the weight of twelve <i>sela,</i> [the flock] is exempt from the first shearing, even if [the wool of] the five of them weighs 60 <i>selaim</i> or more.
Partners are obligated in [the mitzvah of] the first shearings, provided each one's share is equal to the minimum measure [mentioned above]. It: however, there are only five sheep belonging to two partners, they are exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Rambam follows the opinion (<i>Chulin</i> 135a) that the partnership is not recognized as a single entity. Hence, it is necessary for the share of each of the partners to comprise at least the minimum amount. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes the parallel to Chapter 6, Halachah 20.</i>
The mitzvah is to set aside the first shearing at the outset.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The Radbaz states that this is implied by the very term 'the first of.'</i> If, however, one set it aside in the middle or at the end, he fulfilled his obligation.<br>When a person owns five sheep, but [did not shear them together, i.e.,] he had one shorn alone and sold its wool, and then had another shorn alone and sold its wool, and then a third, etc., all of these are combined [to obligate him in the mitzvah of] the first shearing,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Because at the time he sheared the first sheep, he possessed a flock of the minimum size. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 333: 12) states that this applies even if he sold some of his sheep after shearing them.</i> even if this takes place over the course of several years. He may separate from the new shearings for the old shearings and from [the shearings of] one type of sheep for another.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">One should not, however, separate the shearings of inferior sheep for those of superior sheep [Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 333:12)].</i> If, however, he had one sheep, he sheared it and set aside its shearings, purchased a second sheep and set aside its shearings, [and continued doing so until he sheared five sheep], their shearings are not combined.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Because at the time he sheared the first sheep, he did not have a flock of the minimum size.</i>
When a person has several shearings from the first shearings that he desired to divide among the priests, he should not give any priest less than the weight of five <i>selaim</i> of white wool, enough to make a small garment.<br>The intent is not that he should whiten it and give it to them. Instead, he should give each of them [at least enough] unrefined wool to produce five <i>selaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Five <i>selaim</i> is 100 grams in contemporary measure. This measure of wool was sufficient to fashion a sash (<i>avneit</i>) for a priest (<i>Chulin</i> 138a).</i> or more of wool after it has been whitened. [This is derived from Deuteronomy 18:14:] 'Give it to him,' i.e., give him a significant present.
The first shearings are ordinary property in every regard. Therefore, I maintain that they may be given to a woman of the priestly family even if she is married to an Israelite like the presents of meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 20.</i> It appears to me that they are governed by the same laws.

Chapter 11

It is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 80) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 392) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. This obligation was established in commemoration of the slaying of the Egyptian firstborn before the Exodus.</i> for every Jewish man<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the obligation is incumbent on the baby's father, not his mother, as stated in the following halachah.</i> to redeem his son who is the firstborn of his Jewish mother, as [Exodus 34:19] states: "All first issues of the womb are mine" and [Numbers 18:15] states: "And you shall surely redeem a firstborn man."
A woman is not obligated to redeem her son,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>P'nei Meivin, Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 226, infers from the wording "a woman is not obligated," that she may do so if she desires. <i>Eidut LiYisrael</i> states that this is the common custom if the child does not have a father.</i> for one who is obligated to redeem himself is obligated to redeem his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording implies that the obligation is incumbent on the son. Nevertheless, as a newborn, the son cannot fulfill it and so, the obligation becomes his father's. See the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (mitzvah 392), the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 305:11, <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XI, p. 44ff., and others who debate whether the mitzvah is primarily the father's or the son's. This difference is not merely theoretical. Among the practical question that result is: If the father did not redeem the son until the son was thirteen, who has the fundamental responsibility to observe the mitzvah, the father or the son?</i> If the father transgressed and did not redeem his son, when he comes of age,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">13, at which age he is obligated to observe the mitzvot. See <i>Minchat Chinuch, loc. cit.</i>, who discusses a situation where the son redeemed himself beforehand.</i> he is obligated to redeem himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 305:15) states that a silver plaque should be placed around the child's neck as a reminder that he has not been redeemed. See also Halachah 11. The <i>Sifei Cohen</i> 305:20 states that this is not practical. In many instances, the silver plaque will become lost before the child comes of age and he will not be aware of the responsibility incumbent upon him. Instead, it is preferable that the redemption be performed by the Jewish court. <i>Eidut LiYisrael</i> also mentions that if the child's grandfather is alive, there are opinions that he should perform the redemption.</i>
If it is necessary to redeem both the person himself and his son, he should redeem himself first and then his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For the mitzvah incumbent on his own person takes precedence (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a,b).</i> If he only has enough [money] for one redemption, he should redeem himself.
If [a father] had to redeem his son and the time arrived for him to make a festive pilgrimage [to Jerusalem] and he does not have the resources for both, he should redeem his son and then make the pilgrimage. [This is alluded to in Exodus 34:20:] which states: "You shall redeem all your firstborn sons" and afterwards [continues]: "Do not behold My countenance<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., make a pilgrimage to the Temple to behold the Divine presence.</i> empty-handed."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he could possibly redeem his son afterwards, and he will not be able to make this pilgrimage again, the redemption of his son takes precedence.</i>
A person who redeems his son should recite the blessing: "[Blessed are You...] who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the redemption of a son."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the Rambam's rulings in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:11 where he writes that a person who performs a mitzvah involving his own person should praise God who "commanded us to...." If the mitzvah involves others, by contrast, the blessing should conclude "commanded us concerning...." The commentaries, however, note that in <i>ibid.</i>:12 and in <i>Hilchot Milah</i> 3:1, the Rambam writes that one who circumcises his own son should recite the blessing concluding "to circumcise...," for the mitzvah is incumbent on his own person. Seemingly, this should also apply with regard to the redemption of a son.<br>It is possible to resolve the question as follows: The mitzvah of redeeming the son is primarily the child's. Hence, the father uses the form "concerning...." The mitzvah of circumcision, by contrast, is primarily the father's. Hence he uses the form "to...."</i> Afterwards, he recites the blessing <i>Shehechiyanu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This blessing is recited as an expression of thanks whenever one performs a mitzvah infrequently (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 12:9). Even though one recited this blessing at the child's circumcision, it should be recited again at his redemption, for the two are separate mitzvot to be performed at separate times (Radbaz). Similarly, as an expression of thanks, it is customary to mark the redemption with a celebratory feast. This feast is considered a <i>seudat mitzvah</i>, a feast associated with a mitzvah.</i> and then gives<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For the blessing should precede the observance of the mitzvah.</i> [the money for] the redemption to the priest. If [a son] redeems himself, he should recite the blessing: "[Blessed... who commanded us] to redeem the firstborn"<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For he is certainly performing a mitzvah involving himself. The Rambam's ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 305:10). The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama rule that even in such a situation, the conclusion of the blessing should be "...concerning the redemption of the firstborn."</i> and he should recite the blessing <i>Shehechiyanu</i>.
This mitzvah is practiced in every place and at all times.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., its observance is not limited to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, nor to the time when the Temple is standing.</i> For how much should the son be redeemed? Five <i>selaim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shiurei Torah</i> defines this as 101 or 96 grams of pure silver.</i> as [Numbers 18:16] states: "And those to be redeemed: from one month you shall redeem [according to the valuation of five silver <i>shekalim</i>]." [The redemption may be paid] in silver<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">We have translated <i>kessef</i> as "silver" and not "money" to allude to the concepts stated below.</i> or in articles worth silver, i.e., movable property that is of financial worth like the <i>shekalim</i> are. Therefore one may not redeem [a firstborn] with landed property or with servants. Nor may promissory notes [be used], because they are not of inherent worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This includes not only promissory notes given by a particular individual, but also the fiat currencies of the present day, for such currency does not have any inherent value. In practice, silver coins are almost always used for the redemption of the firstborn.</i> If one redeemed a firstborn with these, he is not redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">And he must be redeemed again.</i>
When a father writes to a priest that he is obligated to give him five <i>selaim</i>, the obligation takes effect,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 11:15, when a person undertakes a financial obligation, even though according to law he was not liable, he is bound by his commitment.</i> but the son is not redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if he actually pays him the five <i>selaim</i>, for that money is being paid to satisfy the obligation he voluntarily undertook and not to discharge the obligation the Torah placed upon him (<i>Bechorot</i> 49b).<br>The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 305:2 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 305:3 explain that according to Scriptural Law, the commitment is effective in redeeming the son. Nevertheless, our Sages ruled that it is unacceptable lest a person attempt to redeem his son with promissory notes from other people.</i> If he gives him a utensil that is not worth five <i>selaim</i> in the market, but the priest accepts it as if he was given five <i>selaim</i>, the son is redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro debates this ruling at length and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 305:5), he rules that the utensil must be worth five <i>selaim</i> to a person in a given situation. If, however, there is no way that it would be considered as worth five <i>selaim</i>, the son is not redeemed. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 305:5 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 305:5, however, maintain that the Rambam's words should be understood simply.</i> If he divides the five <i>selaim</i> among ten priests,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Giving each a half-<i>sela</i>.</i> whether at once or one after the other, he fulfils his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Pitchei Teshuvah</i> 305:10 states that it is not desirable to redeem one's son in this manner. As an initial preference, one should give all five <i>selaim</i> to one priest, at one time.</i>
If the priest desires to return [what was given for] the redemption to [the father], he may. He should not, however, give it to him with the intent that he return it. If he did so, and [the priest] returned it, his son is not redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since the father expected the present to be returned, it is as if he never really intended to give it to the priest (<i>Bechorot, loc. cit.</i>, Radbaz). This applies only when the priest actually returns what he was given, for if he does not return it, we assume that after the fact, the father consents that the priest retain possession and as a result, the son is redeemed.</i> [Instead,] he must give it to him with the resolution that he is giving him a present without any reservations. Afterwards, if the priest desires to return it, he may return it.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 305:8) states that the priest should not frequently return what is given to him for the redemption. It should only be done occasionally, when the father is poor.</i> Similarly, if he gives it to him as a present with the stipulation that it be returned, his son is redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A present given with the intent that it be returned is considered as a valid present (<i>Kiddushin</i> 6b). Thus the father's gift was within the limits of law. Hence, it is acceptable. In the first instance, by contrast, since the present was not given wholeheartedly, it is as if it was never given. Nevertheless, receiving the redemption as a present with the stipulation that it be returned is frowned upon by our Rabbis. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> describes a priest who does so as having "transgressed."</i>
The priests and the Levites are exempt from the redemption of their firstborn, as evident from a logical deduction: If they served as the redemption of the Israelites firstborn in the desert,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 3:45 which commands "Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the children of Israel."</i> certainly, they themselves are exempt.
An Israelite who is born to a woman of the priestly or Levite family<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the father is an Israelite and thus the son is an Israelite.</i> is exempt, for this matter is not dependent on the father, but rather on the mother, as [indicated by the phrase]:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have noted that there is no exact verse in the Torah that corresponds to the Rambam's wording. Similar phrases are found in Exodus 13:2 and Numbers 3:12.</i> "the first issue of the womb in Israel."
When a woman of the Levite family was impregnated by a gentile, her son is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The identity of the father does not change the status of the mother or the child and it is just as if the child was from a Jewish father.

There are authorities who maintain that, in the present age, the Jewish court should redeem such children, for it is possible that when the child comes of age, he will not be aware of the mitzvah and will fail to observe it.</i> for his mother was disqualified from the priestly family because of relations with the gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Such relations - even if she is raped - caused her to be deemed a <i>zonah</i> and she is disqualified from the priestly family.

When a priest fathers a son who is a <i>challal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The children born from relations between a priest and a woman forbidden because of the unique prohibitions incumbent upon the priests, as explained in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 19:3-6.</i> and the father dies within 30 days [of the son's birth], the son is obligated to redeem himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the son is the first issue of his mother's womb.</i> because the father did not acquire the redemption.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., were the father to have lived until the son was 30 days old, there would have been an obligation to redeem the child.

If a maidservant was freed - or a gentile woman converted - while she was pregnant and then she gave birth,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For the first time, as obvious from the following halachah.</i> since he was born in holiness,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as a Jew.</i> [the child] is obligated [to redeem himself] even though he was not conceived in holiness, as [indicated by] the phrase:<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the father is an Israelite and thus the son is an Israelite.</i> "the first issue of the womb in Israel."

When a fetus in a woman's womb was cut up and removed limb by limb, a son born afterwards is not considered to be "the first issue of her womb."<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it was removed from the womb piece by piece, the mother is considered impure as if she gave birth (<i>Ibid.</i>:6) and the subsequent child is not considered as a firstborn.</i> When the head of a fetus that was carried for eight months emerged alive<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's wording, the commentaries have inferred that if the baby emerges dead, a boy born next is considered as the mother's firstborn. The rationale is that a baby born in the eighth month is considered as if it would never be a viable birth. This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 305:23).</i> and then was withdrawn back to the womb where it died - or the head of a stillborn fetus that was carried for nine moths emerged and then was withdrawn - and afterwards the [twin] brother [of the fetus] emerged as [a viable] birth, the viable birth is not considered the first issue of the womb, for [all subsequent births] became exempt with the [emergence of] the head of the first [fetus].

The Rambam's ruling follows the position of Shmuel, even though Rav differs and rules that the son is not redeemed. Although ordinarily, in such differences of opinion, the halachah follows Rav with regard to questions involving Torah prohibitions, in this instance, the Talmud explicitly states that the halachah follows Shmuel. There is, however, a question regarding the proper version of the Talmudic text and the Rambam's ruling does not follow the standard published version (Radbaz). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 305:13) quotes the Rambam's ruling, while the Rama rules that if the money no longer exists, the redemption is not effective.</i>
If there is a doubt whether a son is obligated to be redeemed or not, he is exempt. [The rationale is that when] one desires to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is on him.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">As explained above, the priest is considered as if he desires to expropriate property - the five <i>selaim</i> of the redemption - from the father.

There are commentaries who maintain that if the priest would seize the five <i>selaim</i>, he would be entitled to retain possession of them, because the father would now have to prove that he is not obligated and that is likewise impossible. They support this conclusion with the Rambam's ruling in <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 5:3 that if there is an animal whose status is unclear and there is a doubt whether it is a firstborn, should a priest seize possession of it, we do not expropriate it from his property. Others, however, differentiate between the two instances, explaining that in <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i>, the priest has seized a specific entity concerning which an unresolved doubt exists. In this halachah, by contrast, although there is a question whether the father is under obligation to the priest, the money that the priest seizes definitely belongs to the father. Hence, it must be returned (<i>Machaneh Ephrayim, Hilchot Zechiyah</i>, sec. 8; see also Radbaz to Halachah 21).</i> If a father dies within 30 days [of his son's birth], we operate under the assumption that the son was not redeemed unless he brings proof from his father that he redeemed him<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In the manner described at the conclusion of the previous halachah.

[Apparently, the issue was one that the Rambam debated back and forth, because his earlier version of that text does not mention an exemption.] The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 305:265) quotes the Rambam's ruling here.

When a man has two wives who have not given birth yet and they give birth to a male and a female or two males and a female [and it is not known which mother gave birth to which child and which is the order of the children's births], he should give five <i>selaim</i> to a priest.

The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 305) rules that in such a situation, the sons are exempt. See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 305:24.</i>
[The following laws apply when] there are two wives of two men and one gave birth previously and one did not [and they gave birth and the infants became mixed together].

[In the above situation, if the women] gave birth to two males and a female, the man whose wife had not given birth previously should give five <i>selaim</i>. The rationale is that his exemption implies a compounded doubt. For if his wife gave birth to a male only, he is obligated.

The Ra'avad objects to this being considered as a separate mitzvah. In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, the Rambam explains that he considers the two as separate mitzvot, because <i>Bechorot</i> 13a refers to them as such and draws a parallel between these mitzvot and the mitzvot of <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i> which are accepted as separate mitzvot.<br><i>Bechorot</i> 10b explains the rationale for this mitzvah, since the owner caused a priest a loss (by not redeeming the firstling donkey), the Torah decreed that he suffer financial loss. In his <i>Moreh Nevuchim, loc. cit.</i>, the Rambam explains that this mitzvah is a safeguard to insure that the mitzvah to redeem the firstling donkeys is observed.</i> as [Exodus 13:13] states: "The first issue of a donkey you shall redeem with a <i>seh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term <i>seh</i> can refer either to a sheep or a goat, as stated in Halachah 8.</i> If you do not redeem it, you shall decapitate it."<br>These two mitzvot apply in all places and at all times.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., its observance is not limited to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, nor to the time when the Temple is standing.</i> The mitzvah of redemption takes precedence over the mitzvah of beheading [the donkey].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the initial preference is to redeem the animal rather than behead it.</i>
The <i>seh</i> with which it is redeemed is given to the priest, as [Numbers 18:15] states: "All first issues of the womb... and the firstborn of an impure animal you shall redeem."<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The verse establishes an association between the redemption of a firstborn son and the redemption of a firstling donkey. Just as the money for the firstborn is given the priest, so to, the <i>seh</i> for the firstling donkey is given him (Radbaz). Nevertheless, as evident from Halachot 5-6, the association is not complete in all of its particulars.</i>
The "impure animal" mentioned in the verse refers only to donkeys.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam clarifies this because from a simple reading of the verse, one might infer that all the firstborn of impure animals must be redeemed. Although all firstborn humans must be redeemed and all firstborn kosher animals must be sacrificed and/or given to a priest, among non-kosher animals, it is only among donkeys that the firstborn is designated as unique and requiring redemption. In his <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i>, Vol. III, ch. 39, the Rambam explains that this mitzvah is also connected with the commemoration of the exodus when God slew the Egyptian firstborn. It is associated with donkeys and not other beasts, because donkeys are a necessity in an agricultural society. Rashi (Exodus 13:13  focused on different dimensions of this concept, stating that donkeys are used as an analogy for the Egyptians, and b) the donkeys assisted the Jews in their redemption, for they carried the wealth of Egypt upon them.</i>
It is forbidden to benefit from the first issue of a donkey until it is redeemed. If it is sold before it is redeemed, the money received for it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, asking: "Why can he not give the money he received for the donkey to the priest? Why is it forbidden?" After all, it is permitted to redeem the donkey for its value (Halachah 11).<br>The Radbaz explains that if the person would desire to pay the donkey's worth to the priest he could. Here, however, he sold the donkey and once, it was sold the money he received is forbidden. <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 321:8) quotes the Rambam's ruling. The Rama states that if the seller notifies the buyer that it is the first issue of a donkey, stipulates that the buyer will redeem it with a <i>seh</i>, and states that he is selling him the difference between the value of the <i>seh</i> and the value of the donkey, the sale is permitted</i> If it died before it was redeemed or it was decapitated, it should be buried, because it is forbidden to benefit from it even after its decapitation, since it was not redeemed. Therefore if he did not redeem it, but instead gave the first issue of the donkey itself to the priest, it is forbidden for the priest to benefit from it until he redeems it with a <i>seh</i> and takes the <i>seh</i> for himself<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the priest sets aside a <i>seh</i> and redeems the donkey with it. He then takes the <i>seh</i> as his own.</i> or he decapitates it and buries it.<br>The priests are suspect regarding this matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For they say: "Why should I redeem it when I am entitled to keep the <i>seh</i> with which I redeem it?" (<i>Sifei Cohen</i> 321:6).</i> Hence, it is forbidden for an Israelite to give the first issue of a donkey to a priest unless the priest redeems it in his presence.
When a person set aside [a <i>seh</i>] for the redemption of a donkey and it died before he gave it to the priest, he is not liable to replace it.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As soon as the <i>seh</i> was set aside, the holiness of the donkey is transferred to it. Hence, when the <i>seh</i> dies, it is considered that the priest's property died and the owner is not under any further obligation (Rashi, <i>Bechorot</i> 9a).</i> Instead, he should give the corpse to the priest to benefit from.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>seh</i> already became the priest's property [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 1:4)].</i> If the first issue of the donkey dies after it was redeemed, he should give the <i>seh</i> to the priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Again since the redemption is already a <i>fait accompli</i>, the priest deserves the <i>seh</i> regardless of what happens to the donkey.</i> It is permitted to benefit from [the donkey's corpse,] because it has been redeemed.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that in this clause, the Rambam is speaking about an instance where the gentile is not a partner in the entire animal. He owns only a portion of the particular limb or organ in question. Hence, it is necessary to clarify that even in such an instance, he is exempt.</i> - e.g., its forefoot or its hindfoot, even its ear, any limb or organ that if cut off would cause the animal to be disqualified as blemished - it is exempt from [the obligations of] a firstborn. If, however, the portion belonging to the gentile would be cut off, the animal would not be considered as blemished for the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if such a blemish were to exist in a kosher animal.

A person would give a colleague a donkey (or other animal) to raise. As payment for raising it, he is given a half share in the donkey's offspring.

[Implied is that] it must entirely belong to an Israelite.
When a convert converts and it is not known whether his donkey gave birth before he converted<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In which case he would be exempt from redeeming its firstborn.</i> or afterwards,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In which case he would be obligated.</i> he is obligated to decapitate it<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 321:18) does not mention the option of decapitation, implying that even in this instance, redemption is the preferable option.</i> or redeem it.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This instance is different from that involving the presents of meat given to the priests (Chapter 9, Halachah 13). The rationale is that in this instance, the owner is forbidden to benefit from the firstling donkey unless he redeems it. Hence, he must redeem it rather than risk that transgression. Moreover, as the Rambam proceeds to explain, he does not suffer any loss through this redemption.</i> If he redeems it with a <i>seh</i>, the <i>seh</i> belongs to the convert, [because we follow the principle]: When a person desires to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">A priest who is claiming that he is entitled to the <i>seh</i> for the redemption would have to prove that the conversion took place before the donkey was born. The owner is allowed to keep the <i>seh</i>, for there is no holiness associated with it. The question is only one of monetary law and is governed by the principle stated by the Rambam.</i>
When a gentile separates a firstling donkey, he should be informed that he is not obligated [to redeem it].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">We inform him, lest he think that the Jews are lax in the observance of sanctified aticles (<i>Sifei Cohen</i> 321:13).</i> It is permitted for him to use its shearings and to work with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">For the mitzvah only applies to the Jewish people.</i>
When a cow gives birth to an offspring resembling a donkey or a donkey gives birth to an offspring resembling a horse, it is exempt. [This is derived as follows. Twice<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 13:13, 34:20.</i> the Torah states:] "The first issue of a donkey you shall redeem with a <i>seh</i> and the first issue of a donkey...." By mentioning "the first issue of a donkey" twice, [the Torah] indicates that both the mother and the offspring must [resemble] donkeys. If such an offspring has some of the identifying marks of a donkey, there is an obligation to redeem it.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 315:6) is more lenient, stating that there is a doubt whether it must be redeemed.</i>
When a donkey had not given birth before and it gives birth to two males, [the owner] should give a lamb to a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he does not know which one is the firstborn, one of them obviously is. Hence, an obligation exists.</i> If it gives birth to a male and a female [and it is not known which was born first], a lamb should be set aside to remove its holiness so that it will be permitted to benefit from it, for perhaps the male was born first.<br>The lamb that is set aside belongs to the owner and not to the priest. [We follow the principle]: When a person desires to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">A priest who is claiming that he is entitled to the <i>seh</i> for the redemption would have to prove that the male donkey was born first.</i>
When two donkeys that have not given birth yet give birth to two males, [the owner] should give two lambs to a priest. [If they give birth to] a male and a female or two males and a female, he should give one lamb to the priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For it is only certain that one of the males was the firstborn. The female could have been born before the second one. See Chapter 11, Halachah 22. Although there is a possibility that the second donkey gave birth to a male first, there is no probability that it did so. Hence the Rambam does not require that a lamb be separated for it. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 321:14) maintain that since there is a possibility that the second male is also a firstborn, the owner should separate a lamb to remove the possibility of any holiness being attached to the donkey, but he may keep the lamb as his own.</i>
[If these donkeys] gave birth to two females and a male or [even] two males and two females, the priest does not receive anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Because there is no probability that the donkeys gave birth to a male first. In each instance, it is possible that the donkey gave birth to a female before the male.</i> Moreover, [the owner] need not [even] set aside a lamb that he can keep for himself. [The rationale is that] there are many doubts involved: Maybe one gave birth to a male and the other gave birth to two females. Or perhaps one gave birth to a female and the other to a male and then a female or a female and afterwards a male. Similarly, there are many doubts when two males and two females were born.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and other commentaries question the Rambam's logic and ruling, because this is not the usual instance of a <i>sefek-sefeka</i>. When the situation is analyzed, the only real question is: Was the male born after a female or not? Hence since there is a doubt it would seem appropriate for a lamb to be separated (and kept by the owner) to remove the possibility of the donkey being holy. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 321:14) follows the Rambam's view, while the <i>Tur</i> and the Rama require that a lamb be set aside. As <i>Sifei Cohen</i> 321:11 writes, since the owner will not suffer a loss by separating a lamb, why shouldn't he?</i><br>If there were two donkeys - one had given birth previously and one had not - and they gave birth to two males and they became intermingled, [the owner] should give one lamb to the priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">For one of the males is definitely a firstborn.</i> If they gave birth to a male and a female, he should separate a lamb for himself and he need not give it to the priest, because its status is doubtful.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">For perhaps the donkey that gave birth previously gave birth to the male.</i> [Hence, we follow the principle]: When a person desires to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is upon him.
Similarly, when a person purchases a donkey from a gentile and it gives birth to a male, but it is not known whether it gave birth previously or not, he should redeem it with a <i>seh</i> - which he may keep - because its status is doubtful.
When a person possesses ten lambs - each of them having been separated because of a first issue of a donkey of a doubtful status - they are considered as ordinary property in every context.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that originally, there was a claim against them is not significant.

When an Israelite possesses at home ten donkeys whose status as firstlings is definite which he inherited from his maternal grandfather who was a priest who in turn inherited them from his maternal grandfather who was an Israelite, he should separate ten <i>se'in</i> for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">For since, they originally belonged to an Israelite, there is an obligation to redeem them.</i> They, however, [may be kept] as his own<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">His grandfather, the priest, would not have to give the lambs he set aside to redeem them to another priest, because he himself is entitled to them.
