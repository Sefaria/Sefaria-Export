Mishneh Torah, Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations



Chapter 1

In the days of Enosh, the sons of man erred exceedingly, the advice of the wise man of that generation was nullified, and even Enosh himself was among the victims of that folly. Their mistake was this: Seeing, said they, that God created these stars and planets to rule the world, that He placed them high above to share honors with them, for they are ministers who render service in his presence, it is proper that they be praised and glorified and honored, this is the will of God, to exalt and honor him whom He exalted and honored, even as a king desires to honor those who stand in his presence, for such is the honor of the king. As soon as this matter was rooted in their heart, they commenced to erect temples in honor of the stars, to offer sacrifices to them, to praise and glorify them in words, and bow down to them in order to reach the will of God by this evil idea. This was the groundwork for the worship of stars. Thus was the statement of its adherents who knew the principles thereof; not that they asserted that there was no God save a particular star. This is as Jeremiah says: "Who would not fear Thee, O King of the nations? For it befitted Thee; Forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royalty, there is none like unto Thee. But they are altogether brutish and foolish; the vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock" (Jer. 10.7–8). As if saying: All know that Thou art Alone; but their mistake and foolishness is in supposing that this vanity is Thy will.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides bases his contention on Gen. 4.26. G.</i>
In the long process of time, there arose among the sons of man false prophets, who asserted that God commanded them saying: "Worship yon star, or all of the stars, and offer sacrifices to it, and compound for it thus and such, and erect a temple for it, and hew its image so that all of the people, women and children and the rest of the populace included, bow down to it". He, moreover, describes for them a form which he invented and tells them that this was the image of yon star which was pointed out to him in his prophecy. In this manner they commenced to draw images in temples, beneath trees, upon mountain-tops and elevated places, where they congregated to bow down to them and sermonize to the people, saying: "This image has it in its power to do good and evil, and it is proper to worship it, and be in awe of it." Their priests, moreover, say unto them: "By this worship you will increase and succeed; do thus and such, but not that and this". Then still other frauds rose up to assert that the star itself, or the planet, or the angel spoke to them and instructed saying: "Worship me thus and such", and thereat made known to them the way to worship them, instructing them, "Do so but do not do so". In this manner this thing spread throughout the world, and the worship of images with varied ceremonies, to sacrifice to them and to bow down to them was inaugurated. After the lapse of a long time the Glorified and Awful Name was forgotten to be mentioned by the mouth of all substance and blotted out from their consciousness, so that they gave Him no recognition, as a consequence whereof all the people of the earth as well as women and little children knew not save the image of wood and stone, the stony temple wherein they were brought up from their infancy to bow down to it, to worship it and to swear by its name. As for their wise man, for example, their priests and their like, they supposed that there was no God save the stars and planets for whose sake, and in whose likeness, those images were made; but the Rock of Ages not a man was there to recognize Him or know Him, save some individuals in the whole world, for example, Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Shem, and Eber. And, on this path the world continued its course of circuity until the birth of the firmest pillar of the world, Abraham our father.
As soon as this giant was weaned he commenced to busy his mind, in his infancy he commenced to think by day and by night, and would encounter this enigma: How is it possible that this planet should continuously be in motion and have no leader—and who, indeed, causes it to revolve, it being impossible that it should revolve itself? Moreover, he neither had a teacher nor one to impart aught to him, for he was sunk in Ur of the Chaldeans among the foolish worshipers of stars, and his father, and his mother, like all the people, worshiped stars, and he, although following them in their worship, busies his heart and reflects until he attains the path of truth, and, by his correct thinking, he understood when he finally saw the line of righteousness. He knew that there is One God; He leads the planet; He created everything; and in all that is there is no god save He. He knew that the whole world was in error, and that the thing which caused them to err was, that their worshiping the stars and the images brought about the loss of the truth from their consciousness. And, when Abraham was forty years old he recognized his Creator. After he came to this comprehension and knowledge he started to confute the sons of Ur of the Chaldeans, and to organize disputations with them, cautioning them, saying: "This is not the true path that you are following", and he destroyed the images, and commenced preaching to the people warning them that it is not right to worship any save the God of the universe, and unto Him alone it is right to bow down, to offer sacrifices, and compound offerings, so that the creatures of the future shall recognize Him. Moreover, it is right to destroy and break in pieces all of the images, so that the whole population of the future be not led to an error like unto these who imagine that there is no God save these images. When he had them subdued by his well supported contentions, the king tried to put him to death, but he was saved by a miracle, and went hence to Haran. There he stood up anew and called out in a great voice to the whole world, to let them know that there is One God for the whole universe, and unto Him it is proper to render service. And thus he went onward with his proclamations from city to city, and from government to government, until he attained the land of Canaan amidst his outcry, even as it is said: "And called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God" (Gen. 21.33). When the people who congregated about him asked him concerning his preachments, he replied by imparting knowledge to each and every one according to his mentality, to the end that he was able to turn him to the path of truth, until there congregated about him thousands, even tens of thousands, and they became the people of Abraham's household, in whose heart he implanted this great cause, concerning which he compiled books, and which he imparted to his son Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim, 32a. C.</i> Isaac, from his seat of learning, gave instructions and admonitions. And Isaac, in turn, imparted it to Jacob and appointed him head master, who, at his seat of learning, gave instructions and supported all who flocked to him. And Jacob our father instructed all his sons, but separated Levi and appointed him head master, and established him in a seat of learning where to instruct in the path of the Name and in the observance of the charges of Abraham. He, moreover, commanded his sons not to interrupt the succession of the sons of Levi to the presidency of the school so that the learning be not forgotten. So did the movement advance intensely among the sons of Jacob and their followers that the world saw a God-knowing nation called into existence, until Israel spent a long time in Egypt, when they turned to be instructed in their practice and to worship the stars as they did, save only the tribe of Levi, which remained faithful to their ancestorial charge; for the tribe of Levi at no time worshiped stars. Verily, in but a short space of time, the root which Abraham had planted would have been uprooted, and the sons of Jacob would have turned to the universal error and wandering; save because of the Lord's love for us, and because He observes the oath of covenant with Abraham our father, He appointed Moses our Master lord of all prophets, and made him His messenger. After Moses our Master was endowed with prophecy and the Lord chose Israel as an inheritance, He crowned them with commandments, and made known to them the way to serve Him, and what will be the judgment rendered against idolatry and all its erring devotees.<sup>3</sup>

Chapter 2

The primary warning concerning worship of stars is, not to reverence any among all creatures, no angel, no planet, no star, none of the four elements nor any of their offspring, though the worshiper be conscious that the Lord is God and, he be worshiping a given being as at the inception of the worship of Enosh and the people of his generation, behold him, he worships idolatry. It is respecting this very subject that the warning in the Torah was given, saying: "And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which, the Lord thy God hath alloted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven" (Deut. 4.19.), that is to say, lest thou spread out in thy mind's vision, beholding that these are guiding the universe, and that God portioned them out to all the world to live in perpetuity and not wane as the course of the universe is, and then say that to such it is right to bow down and to worship; even on this very subject He commanded and said: "Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived" (Ibid. 11.16.), that is to say, do not fall in error by the thought of your heart to worship these, to make of them a mediator between yourselves and the Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sukkah, 45b; Sanhedrin, 63a. G.</i>
The idolaters compiled many books of worship, defining its principle manner of service, its works and its laws; but the Holy One, blessed be He! charged us not to read those books at all, not to think of idolatry generally nor of aught of its details. Moreover, to look at it is forbidden, as it is said: "Turn ye not unto idols" (Lev. 19.4.); and of thinking on this subject it is said: "And that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their god"? (Ibid.), which is a warning that thou shalt not inquire concerning its manner of practice, though thou art not worshiping it, for this very inquiry causes a turning after it and to imitate their practice, as it is further said: "Even so will I do likewise" (Ibid.).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat, 149a; Sifra, Lev. 19; Sanhedrin, 100b. C. G.</i>
All of these prohibitive commandments are concentrated on one subject, namely: Not to turn after idolatry, and whosoever does turn after it by doing aught resembling its practice is guilty of an offense punishable by lashes. And, yet, not turning after idolatry alone in one's thoughts is forbidden, for even concerning all thought which causes man to delete a principle of the fundamentals of the Torah are we charged not to offer it to our heart, not to concentrate our mind thereon and reason it out and be drawn after the swerving fancies of the heart. Preceding all, behold, the short-coming of man's intelligence, more particularly that not all minds can attain the purity of truth. Now, if every man be drawn away after his heart's fancies, he will be discovered demolishing the world to fit in the shortsightedness of his intelligence. For example: some of the time he will search after idolatry, and some of the time he will meditate about the Unity of the Creator, perhaps He is, and perhaps He is not, what of above and what of below, what of the beginning and what of the end; some of the time he will meditate concerning prophecy, perhaps there is, and perhaps there is not, and some of the time about the Torah, perhaps it is from heaven and perhaps it is not. Whereas, he knows not the standard of thinking wherewith to discover the knowledge of pure truth, as a consequence whereof he goes without to atheism. Even on, this subject there is a warning in the Torah, for it says therein: "And that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray" (Num. 15. 39.), as if saying: "Let not any of you be drawn after his short-sighted intelligence and imagine that his fancy attains the truth". Thus did the wise men say: "After your own heart", is a warning against atheism; and "After your own eyes", is a warning against prostitution (Berakot, 13a). But the violation of this prohibitive commandment, although it causes man's disability to share in the World to Come, is not punishable by lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hagigah, 11a; Abodah Zarah, 17a. C. G.</i>
The precept concerning idolatry balances all other commandments, for it is said: "And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses" (Num. 15.22), which was traditionally instructed that the Verse speaks of idolatry. Herefrom you deduct that whosoever admits idolatry denies the whole Torah, all of the prophets, and all in that which the prophets were instructed since Adam even till the end of time, as it is said: "From the day that the Lord gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations" (Ibid. 15.23). But whosoever denies idolatry admits the whole Torah, all of the prophets, and all in that which the prophets were instructed since Adam even till the end of time. Thus it is the outstanding commandment of them all.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Horayot, 8b; Sifre, Num. 15; Nedarim, 25a. C. G.</i>
An Israelite who worshiped idolatry, behold him, he is in everything to be judged as an idolater, and not as an Israelite who violates a prohibitive commandment punishable by stoning. A convert to idolatry, behold him, he is rebellious against the whole scope of the Torah. Likewise are infidels of among Israel not to be judged in aught as Israelites, nor should they ever be received as penitents, for it is said: "None that go unto her return, neither do they attain unto the paths of life" (Prov. 2.19). The infidels are they that absorb themselves in the swerving fancies of their heart about the brutish matters hereinabove spoken of, as a consequence whereof they transgress by stepping upon the vitals of the Torah with spite, soul-sickening and high-handedness, and proclaim that therein lies no iniquity. It is forbidden to converse with them, and to answer any argument concerning them, as it is said: "And come not nigh the door of her house" (Ibid. 5.8). As a rule the thought of an infidel drifts toward idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin, 4b; Abodah Zarah, 17a; Sanhedrin, 38; Ibid. 100b. C. G.</i>
Whosoever admits idolatry as truth, although he be not a worshiper thereof, behold him, he is shaming and blaspheming the Glorified and Awful Name. The idolater's corpse is, therefore hung, even as that of the blasphemer's, and both offenses are punishable by stoning. It is even for this reason that I included the law of the blasphemer in the treatise concerning idolatry, for both of them deny the source of everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Keritot, 3b; Sanhedrin, 45b.</i>
And, these are the laws concerning the blasphemer: The guilt punishable by stoning is not pronounced against a blasphemer unless he actually pronounces the Particular Name of four letters, Aleph, Dallat, Nun, Yod, and blaspheme Him in a Name of the Names which are forbidden to erase, even as it is said: "And he that blasphemed the name of the Lord" (Lev. 24. 16). By naming the Particular Name he is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning, but by naming all other Attributes he is guilty of an offense punishable by stripes. There is some authority who asserts that he is not guilty save on pronouncing the Name Yod, Hei, Vov, Hei. But I maintain that he is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning in pronouncing either of the Particular Names.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 55b–56a; Sifre, Lev. 24. C. G.</i>
Whence do we derive a prohibitive commandment against the blasphemer? It is said: "Thou shalt not revile God" (Ex. 22.27). Each and every day, during a trial for blasphemy, the witnesses are examined and they give testimony not repeating the Name pronounced and words used by the defendant, but an alias, such as "Let Jesse smite Jesse", indicative that four letters were pronounced and that the words were abusive. When the enquette is concluded, the public is ordered out of court, and the elder of the witnesses is examined, saying: "Now, repeat what you have heard in identical language"; he repeats, while the judges remain standing on their feet, and when they hear the actual blasphemy repeated, they rent their garments which they never mend. Their second witness merely states: "Even I heard identically as he repeated". If there were many witnesses it is necessary for each and every one of them to repeat identically as had heard it from the blasphemer.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 66a; Ibid. 56a; Mekilta, Ex. 22. C. G.</i>
A blasphemer who repented his statement the moment he made it, can not put it up as a defense, but having blasphemed in the presence of witnesses the punishment of stoning is inflicted upon him. He who blasphemed the Name by pretending that he reviles idolatry, jealous people may challenge him and be put to them by them; but if jealous people did not put him to death and he was brought to justice before a tribunal, he is not stoned, for such sentence is pronounced only when he blasphemed by a name of the Particular Names.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim, 86b; Sanhedrin, 8a; Ibid. 81b; Baba Batra, 129b; Shebu’ot, 36a. C. G.</i>
Whosoever hears the Name being blasphemed is obliged to rend his garments; even when an alias is used in blaspheming, if the reviler be an Israelite, he is obliged to rend his garments. He who hears the blasphemy direct or he who hears it from a witness, both, are obliged to rend their garments. But he who hears it from an idolater is not obliged to rend his garments. As for Eliakim and Shebnah<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Second Kings, 18. 13-19.9; Isa. 36.1-37.37. G.</i>, they rent not their garment save because Rab-shakeh was a converted Israelite. All the judges and witnesses in a blasphemy case, successively put their hand upon the head of the blasphemer, each one saying to him: "Thy blood be upon thy head, thou alone hast brought it upon thyself". Of all upon whom a tribunal pronounces the sentence of death there is none upon whose head the hands of the judges and witnesses are put, save upon the blasphemer, even as it is said: "And let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head" (Lev. 24.14).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 60a; Sifra, Lev. 24. C.</i>

Chapter 3

Whosoever worships idolatry, of his own free will, wantonly, is guilty of an offense punishable by excision; but if the worship took place in the presence of witnesses, and he was duly warned, he is sentenced to be stoned. If the worship was committed in ignorance, he should bring a standard sin-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Keritot, 1; Sanhedrin, 60b—61a.C.</i>
The idolaters fixed many kinds of service for each and every image and form, and the service of one is unlike the service of the other; for example, Peor, whose mode of worship it is for one to have himself exposed before it, or Mercury, which is worshiped by having stones thrown at it or from it, and many more like services were inaugurated to images. Therefore, if one reverses the service by exposing himself to Mercury or by throwing stones at Peor, he is not guilty, for he must worship it after the manner of its service, as it is said: "How used these nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise" (Deut. 12.30). The subject being such, and because thereof, a tribunal, judging cases of idolatry should know the modes of its worship, seeing that no punishment of stoning is pronounced on idolaters unless they know that the mode of worship is identical with the testimony presented at the trial.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C.</i>
The prohibitive commandment concerning such worship is deducted from what Holy Writ says: "Nor serve them" (Ex. 20.5; Deut. 5.9). Whereat are these words directed? At all other manner of worship, save bowing down, slaughtering sacrifice, burning incense, and compounding drink offering; for whosoever employs any of these kinds of worship to revive any form of idolatry, is guilty, although it be not the particular manner of its worship. For example? If one offered a drink offering to Peor, or slaughtered a sacrifice to Mercury, he is guilty, as it is said: "He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed" (Ex. 22.19.). Inasmuch as slaughtering sacrifices was included in worship generally, why was it singled out and separated from other modes of service? To teach you, even as slaughtering sacrifices is a particular manner of service dedicated to the Name, and whosoever offers sacrifices to another god is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning, whether its mode of worship was to slaughter sacrifices for it or whether it was not, even so every service which is dedicated to the Name, if he employed it in his service to another god, whether its manner of worship be so or not, is guilty. Even because thereof it is, moreover, said: "For thou shalt bow down to no other god" (Ex. 34.14), to prescribe guilt for bowing down to idolatry even if its mode of service be not so. So is also the law pertaining to offering incense and drink-offering, forsooth, stone-casting and pouring drink offering is one and the same thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C.</i>
One who smears feces over it, or who compounded urine as a drink-offering for it, is guilty; if he slaughtered a locust as a sacrifice to it, he is not guilty, unless its manner of service be so. Likewise, if he slaughtered a crippled animal as a sacrifice to it, he is not guilty, unless its manner of service be so. An idol which is worshiped by a rod, if he broke the rod by striking at it, he is guilty, and if it be the first service offered to such idol it becomes forbidden property; if he cast the rod at it, he is guilty, but it does not become forbidden property, for casting the rod is unlike sprinkling of blood because the rod remains whole as it was whereas blood is spread in drops. He who proclaims one of all kinds of idolatry as his god, is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning; even if he lift up a brick and said to it: "Thou art my god", or to all like in such expression. is guilty, although he repent and the moment he was through proclaiming he said: "No, this is not my god", his repentence is null and he is stoned.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 60b; Baba Batra, 129b; Nedarim, 87a. C.G.</i>
He who worships idolatry in its usual mood of worship, even in a manner to disgrace it, is guilty. For example? One who exposes himself to Peor in order to show his contempt for it, or casts a stone upon Mercury so as to shame it, is guilty, because such act is its real mode of worship. If he commits an act of this kind in error, he should bring a sin-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 60b; Ibid, 64a C.</i>
One who worships idolatry out of love, for instance, he coveted a given image because it was made superbly beautiful, or he worshiped it out of fear lest it perpetrates harm against him, as its devotees imagine that it can do good and evil, if he accepted it as a god he is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning; but if he worshiped it after its mode or worship, or with one of the four kinds of worship<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The admonition is, “Nor serve them”. This is a general rule for all kind of practices which may be included under the term “Serve”. A prohibitive covering a general rule (Laav She’biclolot) carries no punishment of lashes. C.G.</i> either because of love for art or because of superstitious fear, he is guiltless. He embraces an idol, or kisses it, or who prostrates himself before it, who washes it, anoints it, puts shoes on it, or does any other like service of honor violates a prohibitive commandment, for it says: "Nor serve them" (Ex. 23.24.), and, of course, such attention is included in service. Nevertheless, no lashes is inflicted upon him for doing any of these, seeing that none of them are mentioned in detail.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bowing down, slaughtering sacrifices, compounding drink offerings, and sprinkling of blood. G.</i> If, however, one of these attentions was a mode of service and he did it in order to worship it, he is guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 63a. C.</i>
One who had a splinter stuck in his foot and he happens to be before an idol, should not bow down to take out, as it will appear that is bowing down to it. If his coin be scattered before it, he should not bow down to collect it, as it will appear that he is bowing down to it, but he may sit down and then collect it.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah, 12b. C.</i>
Water-fountain figures, placed before an idol, in drinking water therefrom one should be careful not to touch his mouth to their mouth, as it will appear that he kisses an idol.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. G.</i>
One who has an idol made for himself, even though he made it not by his own hand and did not worship it, is striped; because it is said: "Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of likeness" (Ex. 20.4; Deut. 5.8). Even so, if one makes by his own hand an idol for others is striped, though he made it for an idolater; because it is said: "Nor make to yourselves molten gods" (Lev. 19.4). Therefore, he who makes an idol for himself, by his own hand, is lashed twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah, 43b. G.</i>
It is forbidden to make images for beauty's sake, even it be not for idolatry; for, it is said: "Ye shall not make with Me" (Ex. 20.23), as if saying; images of either silver or gold, though they be no more than works of artistic beauty, ye shall not make, so that the erring will not err and imagine they are dedicated to idolatry. But the admonition against it is not applicable to any save to form the image of man. Therefore, the image of man should not be formed in wood, nor in lime, nor in stone, provided, however, that the image be protruding, as for instance, the figure or the laver in a palace; but if the image was homaloid, or a delineated form, such as the forms upon boards and tablets, or the forms woven in a rug, behold, such is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh ha-Shanah, 24b; Abodah Zarah, 43b. C.</i>
A ring whereon the image of a man is engraved as a seal, if the image be protruding, he is forbidden to keep it in his hand, but is permitted to have the idolator make an impression on wax therewith; if the image be inwardly engraved he is permitted to keep it in his hand, but forbidden to have the idolator make an impression on wax therewith, because the inwardly engraved image will appear protruding from the wax seal. It is likewise forbidden to sketch the image of the sun, of the moon, of the stars, of the planets, and of angels; for, it is said: "Ye shall not make with me", that is to say: ye shall not make images like unto My ministers, who minister before Me Above, not even upon a tablet. Images of cattle and other living creatures, save man, and images of trees and plants and the like, one may sketch, even though the image be protruding.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.; Mekilta, Ex. 20. C.G.</i>

Chapter 4

The seducers of a city in Israel, behold them, they are stoned, although they themselves did not worship idolatry but seduced the citizens of their city to worship it; but the seduced people of the city are beheaded by the sword, provided they worshiped idolatry, or made it their god. Whencefrom is the prohibitive precept against a seducer deducted? It is said: "Neither let it be heard out of thy mouth" (Ex. 23.13.)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 50a; Ibid. 76a; Ibid. 63b; Ibid. 111b. C. G.</i>
No city is pronounced a seduced city unless its seducers be her own citizens, of the same tribe even as it is said: "From the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city" (Deut. 13.14.), numbering two or more than two even as it is said: "Certain base fellows are gone out" (Ibid.), having seduced up to a majority of the citizens, the majority being more than one hundred even to the majority of the tribe, but if an actual majority of the tribe was seduced they are judged as individuals, for it is said: "the inhabitants of their city" (Ibid.) which means neither a village nor a large city, and every place of less than one hundred citizens is a village and of a majority of a tribe is a large city. Likewise, if women or small children seduced it, or it was seduced by an individual person, or only a minority of its citizens was seduced, or they themselves brought about the seduction, or its seducers were outsiders, the law of a seduced city is not applied to it, but they are judged as individuals who worshiped idolatry, and whosoever did transgress is stoned, and their property is inherited by their lawful successors as the law is concerning all upon whom the tribunal pronounces a sentence of death.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 111a-b; Ibid. 15b; Ibid. 112a. C.</i>
A seduced city is not judged by any save by a tribunal of Seventy-One; for, it is said: "Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who have done this evil thing, unto thy gates" (Deut. 17.5.), herefrom we deduct that individual worshipers of idolatry are sentenced to death by the tribunal of each and every gate, but many are not sentenced to death by any save by the Great Tribunal.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 17a-b.C.</i>
None of the cities of escape is adjudged a seduced city, as it is said: "Within any of thy gates" (Deut. 17.2); nor is Jerusalem adjudged a seduced city as it was not divided among the tribes. A buffer city must not be adjudged a seduced city, lest the idolaters enter through it and destroy Eretz Ysrael. A single tribunal should not adjudge three cities, one alongside the other, seduced cities, but if they be far apart it may be done.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, Deut. 17; Sanhedrin, 2a; Ibid. 16a-b; Baba Kamma, 72a C.G.</i>
No city is adjudged a seduced city unless its seducers employed plural language in seducing it, saying to them: "Let us go and we will worship", or: "Let us go and we will offer sacrifices", or: "Let us go and we will burn incense", or: "Let us go and we will compound a drink-offering", or: "Let us go and we will bow down", or: "Let us go and we will accept it as a god", and they heard it, and worshiped it in its proper mode of worship, or in either of the four particular kinds of worship<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Sacrifice, incense, drink-offering and bowing down.

A city charged with seduction, but the evidence showed that not all of the conditions were substantiated either against its inhabitants or against its seducers, how is it to be treated? A warning is given to each and every one of them, and evidence is taken against each and every one of them individually, and any one of them who did worship idolatry is stoned as an individual who worships idolatry, and their property is inherited by their lawful successors.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 67b; Ibid. 111b. C.</i>
How is the legal procedure against a seduced city instituted? When the information shows that it really deserves to have a pronouncement of a seduced city made against it, the Great Tribunal appoints a commission who investigate and take evidence until they are convinced by clear testimony that the whole, or a majority of the city was really seduced and turned to the worship of idolatry; thereafter two abecedarians are commissioned to warn them and to bring them back to the fold; if they turn and repent, it is well, but if they hold on to their evil, the tribunal instructs all Israel to wage war against them, and they lay siege and array battle with them until the city is broken open, whenafter courts are established and they are put on trial. Each one against whom two witnesses testified that he worshiped idolatry after he received a warning, is separated. If all those who did worship constitute but a minority of the citizens, they are stoned and the rest of the citizens escape punishment. If it be found that a majority worshiped idolatry, they are all taken before the Great Tribunal, where their trial is finished, and all those who are found guilty of having worshiped idolatry are put to death by the sword. If the whole population of the city worshiped idolatry, all of them, women and children included, are put to death by the edge of the sword. Whether the entire city was seduced, or whether only a majority thereof, its seducers are stoned, and its entire booty is gathered in its main street. If it has no such street, it is mandatory to construct such street. If its street was without its boundary-line, a wall should be constructed beyond it, so as to incorporate it within its boundary-line, even as it is said: "Into the midst of the broad place thereof" (Deut. 13.17). Then, everything that liveth should be put to death, and all of its spoil, together with the property of the whole district should be burned in fire. And it is mandatory to burn it; for, it is said: "And shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof" (Ibid.)<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides supports the Sifre (Deut. 13.) and Rabbi Eliezar (Sanhedrin, 44a) against Rabbi Akiba, in deciding that children of the wicked are destroyed. Any one studying these chapters will see that the purpose of the law was to serve a warning, and both the Sifre and Rabbi Eliezar had the support of history, (Num. 16) Korah and Jabesh-Gilead (I. Samuel, 11.1) to their contention. Knowing what punishment there is in store for them and their children, the possibility of a city becoming a seduced city was very remote, and the fact that almost fourteen centuries of national life in Palestine did not produce a single instance where the necessity of making this law operative is in itself evidence that the prescribed severity, as interpreted by Maimonides had a great deal to do with it. C.G.</i>
The substance of the righteous therein, who are the rest of the population of the city which was not seduced together with a majority thereof, is burned among its general spoil, because they continued to dwell there their property is forfeited. And, whosoever enjoys aught of the spoil thereof, is lashed, even as it is said: "And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand" (Ibid, 13.18.).<sup>11</sup>
If the witness against a seduced city were impeached, whosoever held possession of any of its property enjoys right of ownership thereto, seeing that there was no testimony to destroy it. But wherefore does one acquire the right of property therein? Because after the testimony was given and sentenced pronounced each and every inhabitant yielded his right to his property and rendered it ownerless. A seduced city is never rebuilt, and whosoever rebuilds it is lashed; for, it is said: "It shall not be built again" (Deut. 13.17.); but in its place it is permitted to lay out gardens and plant vineyards, as the Verse says, "it shall not be built again", which means not to rebuild it as a settlement of people as it was heretofore.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Keritot, 24b; Sanhedrin, 112a.

Property belonging to another district which had been stored in a seduced city, although the inhabitants of the latter assumed responsibility for its loss, is not burned, but returned back to its owners, as it clearly states "the spoil of it", and not the spoil of its neighboring town. Property of the evildoers who were seduced which were stored away in another district, if it can be gathered that day together with its own property, it shall be burned among its spoil, if not, the distance being too far to gather it on the selfsame day, it is not destroyed, but given to their heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 112b.

An animal of a seduced city which was slaughtered is forbidden, and nought thereof must be enjoyed, even when one slaughters an ox which had been adjudged to be stoned.

Fruit on the trees therein is permitted; for, it is said: "shalt gather" and "shalt burn" (Deut. 13.17.), such should be destroyed as require only gathering and burning, whereas fruit on the trees require gleaning, gathering and burning. This is also applicable to hair on one's head. Needless to say that the trees themselves are permitted, and are, of course, the property of the heirs. The devoted things therein are dealt with as follows: the devoted animals of the altar should be destroyed; "The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination" (Prov. 21. 27.); the devoted things for the repair of the Temple should be redeemed, and thereafter burned, for it says, "Spoil of it" (Deut. 13.17.) but not spoil of heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 112b.

The firstborn and the tithes of animals therein, if they be unblemished they are as devoted things of the altar, and they shall be put to death; the blemished are included in its cattle and must be destroyed as spoil. The heaveoffering therein, if the priest already had taken possession thereof it shall be left to rot away because it is his property, but if it be as yet in the hand of the Israelite, it shall be given to a priest of another territory, because it is property of heaven and the devotion thereon is a bodily devotion.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 111b.

Whosoever carries out an execution against a seduced city is like one who sacrifices a burnt-offering, even as it is said: "Every whit, unto the Lord thy God" (Deut. 13.17). Moreover, he removes the fierceness of God's anger from among Israel, even as it is said: "That the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger" (Ibid. 13.18), and brings upon them blessing and mercy, even as it is said: "And show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee" (Ibid.).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.

Chapter 5

He who entices a single person in Israel, whether man or woman, is stoned, although neither the enticer nor enticed worshiped idolatry, for he taught him to worship; and regardless of whether the seducer was a layman or whether he was a prophet, whether the enticed was an individual, man or woman, or whether there were several individuals, his punishment is death by stoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 66a; Ibid. 89a; Ibid. 61a. C.</i>
One who entices a majority of the people of a city, is not called enticer but seducer. If such one who seduced a majority of the city be a prophet, his punishment is death by stoning, but the seduced are not judged as are the people of a seduced city, unless a minimum of two will commit the seduction. Regardless of whether a prophet said: "The idol charged me to serve it", or whether he said: "The Holy One, blessed be He! charged me to worship idolatry", behold him, he is a seductive prophet, and if a majority of the city be seduced by him, he shall be stoned. The enticer, whether he entices by employing plural or singular language, is stoned. For instance? One who says to his friend: "Come, I will worship, Come, I will go and officiate at the worshiping; let us both go and worship by performing a certain service by which that particular branch of idolatry is worshiped; stand by, I will sacrifice; follow me, I will go and sacrifice; let us both go and sacrifice; stand by I will burn incense; follow me, I will go and burn incense, let us both go and burn incense; stand by I will compound a drink-offering; follow me, I will go and compound a drink-offering; let us go and compound a drink-offering; behold, I will bow down; follow me, I will go and bow down; let us go and bow down", behold him, he is an enticer. If he enticed two, both of them are witnesses against him, who bring him before the tribunal and testify that such was his statement to them, and he is stoned.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 67a. C.</i>
There is no legal requirement to give the enticer a warning. If an enticer speaks to one, that one should say to him; "I have friends who desire it", and in this way maneuver to have him entice two, so that they may testify against him, and have the sentence of death imposed upon him. If the enticer refuses to entice two at a time, it is mandatory to spy on him. Against none of those who might be envolved in crimes punishable by death is spying permitted, save against this one. How is the spying conducted against him? The enticee brings two witnesses, whom he hides in a dark place, so that they can see the enticer and hear his words, but he can not see them, and he says to the enticer: "Now, tell me what you already told me privately before"; if the seducer repeats it, the seducee replies to him, saying: "How can we abandon our God in heaven, and go and worship wood and stone?" If the seducer did repent, or remained silent, he is guiltless; but if he replies to him, saying: "Such is our duty, and so it is becoming for us do", the two witnesses who stand from afar bring him before a tribunal and the pretence of stoning is pronounced against him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C.</i>
It is mandatory that the hand of the seducee shall slay him, even as it is said: "Thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death" (Deut. 13.10). The seducee shall not be-friend the seducer, as it is said: "Thou shalt not consent unto him". Moreover, think not because it is said of thine enemy, "Thou shalt surely release it with him" (Ex. 23.5.) thou shalt also aid this one, remember to learn another saying: "Nor hearken unto him" (Deut. 13.10.); think not because it is said: "Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor" (Lev. 19.16.), thou shalt also not stand idly by the blood of this one, remember to learn another saying: "Neither shall thine eye pity him" (Deut. 13. 9.). The seducee is forbidden to state aught in his favor, as it is said: "Neither shalt thou spare" (Ibid.). If he knew aught about his guilt, he is not permitted to be silent about it, as it is said: "Neither shalt thou conceal him" (Ibid.). Whence do we deduct the prohibitive against a layman who is an enticer? From what it is said: "And all Israel shall hear, and fear" (Ibid. 13.12.)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre Deut. 13; Sanhedrin, 63b. C.</i>
One who entices others to worship him, saying to them: "Worship me", if they did worship him, he is stoned; but if they did not worship him, although they received his request attentively and said, Yes: he is not stoned. But if he enticed them to worship another man, or other kinds of idolatry, if they received his request attentively and said: "Yes, we will go and worship", though no actual worship took place, both the enticer and the enticee are stoned, even as it is said: "Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him" (Ibid. 13.10); thus if he did hearken and consent, he is guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 61b.

How is a prophet, prophesying in the name of idolatry, proved to be such? It is he who says: "That idol, or that star told me that it is mandatory to do thus and such, or not to do it," though he chanced to aim properly at the law, to contaminate that which is unclean and to purify that which is clean, if he received a warning before two witnesses, he is put to death by strangulation, even as it is said: "Or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die" (Deut. 18.20). The prohibitive against the practice of such a prophet is derived from what it is said: "And make no mention of the name of other gods" (Ex. 23. 13).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 89a. C.</i>
It is forbidden to enter into a disputation with one who prophesies in the name of idolatry, and he is not asked to bring a token or perform a miracle. If he does so of his own account, no attention should be paid to him and no afterthought given to it; and whosoever meditates about his tokens, lest they be true, violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: "Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet" (Deut. 13.4). So is the punishment of the false prophet by strangulation, though he be prophesying in the name of God and neither added to or diminished from the Torah, even as it is said: "But the prophet, that shall speak a word presumptuously in My name… that same prophet shall die" (Deut. 18.20)<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.

Whether one prophesies that which he heard not by vision of prophecy, or whether he overheard his fellow-prophet's words and says that they were spoken to him, and he is posing as a prophet therewith, is a false prophet, and his death is by strangulation.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C.</i>
He who witholds himself from pronouncing a sentence of death against a false prophet, because of the latter's qualities, seeing that he follows the ways of prophecy, violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: "Thou shalt not be afraid of him" (Deut. 18.22); likewise is the one witholding himself from testifying against him, or who is afraid of him and dreads his words, included among those who violate the commandment of, "Thou shalt not be afraid of him.

He who vows by the name of idolatry, or swears by it, is lashed, even as it is said: "And make no mention of other gods" (Ex. 23.13), whether the oath be for himself or for the idolatry. It is forbidden to give an oath to idolater by that which he fears. Even to mention the name of the different kinds of idolatry is forbidden, though it be not in the manner of an oath, for it is said: "Make no mention" (Ibid.).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 63a.

One man should not say to another: "Wait for me alongside that idol, or like expression.

Chapter 6

He who practices enchantry or spiritualism of his own free will, wantonly, is guilty of a sin punishable by excision; if there be witnesses, and he received due warning, he is stoned. If he erred, he should offer a standard sin-offering. How is enchantry practiced? One stands and burns a kind of incense known to such practicioners, holding in his hand a myrtle-branch which he waves, the while uttering in a murmur words known to such practicioners, so that the supplicant thinks that he hears one conversing with him and answering his questions in words that appear to be coming from beneath the earth uttered in a very low voice, which is scarcely audible to the ear but rather perceptible to the mind. Or, one who holds a skull of a deceased person, and burns incense to it, and divines by it, so that it becomes evident as if an extremely low ventriloquous voice makes reply. All such are practices of enchantry, and whosoever practices one such, is stoned.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 65a–b. C.</i>
How is spiritualism practiced? One puts a bone of a bird known to such practicioners in his mouth, burns incense and performs other manipulations until he falls into a fit resembling epilepsy, when he speaks out of his mouth happenings of the future. All such are forms of idolatry. Whencefrom is the warning against such practices derived? From what it is said: "Turn ye not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits" (Lev. 19.31)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra, Lev. 19. C.</i>
He who gives of his children to Molech of his own free will, wantonly, is guilty of an offense punishable by excision. If he erred, he should offer a standard sin-offering. But if he did not in the presence of witnesses, and was given due warning, his punishment is stoning; for, it is said: "Whosoever… that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death" (Lev. 20.2). Whencefrom is the warning against him derived? From what it is said: "And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech" (Ibid. 18.21); and it is further said: "There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire" (Deut. 18.10). How was the practice thereof? One builds a big fire, and takes a part of his children and turns them over to the fire-worshiping priests; those priests, after a child had been turned over to them by the father to pass him through the fire by the father's consent, return the child back to the father, and it is the father of the child who passes his child through the fire by the consent of the priests, and the passing through thereof is by walking the victim from one side to the other in the midst of the flame. The practice was not to burn children to Molech outright after the manner of those who burned their sons and daughters to another kind of idolatry,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Sepharvaim. See Second Kings, 17.31. G.</i> but only by passing through the flame was the service of this idol which is called Molech. Therefore, he who performs such service to another idol, save Molech, is not guilty of worshiping Molech.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Keritot, 2a; Sanhedrin, 64a–b C. See Cairo and other commentaries. G.</i>
He is not guilty of either excision or stoning, unless he handed over his child to Molech, and led him through the flame walking on his feet. If he handed him over and led him not through, or if he led him through and did not hand him over before, or if he handed him over but led him over not after the manner of leading, he is not guilty, Neither is he guilty unless he hands over only part of his children and leaves behind the rest; for, it is said: "Because he hath given <i>of</i> his seed unto Molech—<i>of his seed</i>, but not <i>all of his seed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C. No punishment on earth can atone for giving all seed to Molech. God alone can punish him. G.</i>
Whether the seed be lawful or illicit, whether his own sons and daughters or their children and grandchildren, even all that come forth out of his loins, because they are his seed, he is guilty; but if he led through his brothers, or his sisters, or his parents, or he permitted himself to be let through, he is not guilty. If he led through one of his children who was asleep, or blind, he is not guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C.</i>
The pillar forbidden by the Torah, is a building where everybody assembles, even to serve God therein is forbidden, for in such manner was idolatry worshiped; for, it is said: "Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar" (Deut. 16.22). And, whosoever sets up a pillar is lashed. The same applies to a figured stone spoken of in the Torah, although one bows down to it for the sake of God, he is lashed; for, it is said: "Neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it" (Lev. 26.1), because such was the practice of idolaters, to deposit a stone before it, upon which to bow down to it; therefore, shall it not be so in the worship of God. But he is not lashed, unless he spread his hands and feet upon the stone, so that he be bodily lying on it, for such is the kind of bowing down spoken of in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, Deut. 16; Megillah, 22a–b. C.</i>
Whereat are these words directed? At other places, but in the Temple it is permitted to bow down on the stones, even as it is said: "In your land" (Deut. 26.1)—in your land you shall not bow down upon the stones, but you do bow down upon the cut stones of the Temple. Because of this, it became the custom throughout Israel to spread matts, or straw, or stubble on the stone-laid flooring of the synagogues so as to separate their countenance, when they bow down, from the stone. If there could be found no substance to form a separation between himself and the stone, he should either go to another place and bow down, or bow sidewise, with his face turned away, so as not to connect his countenance with the stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C.</i>
Whosoever bows down to God upon the cut stones, without, however, spreading his hands and feet thereon, is not striped, but is lashed as a rebel; whereas idolatry, whether he bows down with spreading hands and feet or whether without spreading hands and feet, as long as he touches his countenance on the ground he is stoned.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.

He who plants a tree near the altar, or anywhere in the entire Court, whether a bare tree or a fruit tree, although he did it to adorn the Temple and beautify it, even such as he shall be striped; for, it is said: "Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of the Lord thy God" (Deut. 16.21), because this is the custom of idolaters; they plant trees beside the altar of the idol so as to attract the people to congregate there.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre Deut. 16; Tamid, 28b.

It is forbidden to make wooden entrance-passages in the Temple, such as are made in courtyards, the wood being built in and not planted, and the removal from the forbidden appearing to be overmuch, notwithstanding, because it is said: "Any kind of tree"(Ibid.).

Chapter 7

It is a mandatory commandment to destroy idolatry, and everything used in its service, and everything that is made for its sake, even as it is said: "Ye shall surely destroy all the places" (Deut. 12.2), and it is, moreover, said: "But thus shall ye deal with them" (Ibid. 7.5). Within the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael it is mandatory to pursue it, until we destroy it from the whole of our land; but outside of Eretz Yisrael we are not commanded to pursue it, save that any place which we may conquer we should destroy idolatry therefrom, even as it is said: "And ye shall destroy their name out of that place" (Ibid. 12.3)—in Eretz Yisrael thou art commanded to pursue them, but thou art not commanded to pursue them without Eretz Yisrael.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 89a; Makkot, 22b. G.</i>
Idolatry, its articles of service, that which is offered to it, and all that is made for its sake, nought thereof should be enjoyed, even as it is said: "And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house" (Ibid. 7.26); and whosoever enjoys aught of one of these is striped twice; once, because it is said: "Thou shalt not bring" (Ibid.) and once more because it is said: "And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand" (Ibid. 13.18).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.

It is forbidden to derive any profit of a cattle which was wholly sacrificed to idolatry, even its manure, bones, horns, hoofs and hide, of all and any no enjoyment shall be derived. Therefore, if there be a mark in the hide by which it is known that such hide is of a sacrifice to idolatry, for instance, they used to make a round cut opposite the heart in order to get the heart out, it is evident that all hides which are so cut are forbidden property to enjoy aught thereof, and so are all the like of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah, 34a; Ibid. 29b. C.</i>
Wherein is the difference between an idol that belongs to an idolator and an idol that belongs to an Israelite? The idol of an idolater is forbidden property to enjoy aught thereof the moment it becomes an idol; it is said: "The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire" (Ibid. 7.25), the moment they became graven images it became a god to the idolater; but that of the Israelite does not become forbidden property until it is worshiped, as it is said: "And setteth up in secret" (Ibid. 27.15), until matters of secrecy will be done to it, which are its form of worship. But everything used in the service of idolatry, whether it belong to an idolator or to an Israelite, does not become forbidden property until they will be used during services to idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 51–52a. C.</i>
One who makes idols for others, though he is striped, may enjoy his wages, even if he made it for an idolater, which becomes forbidden property before worshiping it, because it does not become forbidden until it is completed, and the moment he gives the last stroke which finishes it his interest therein is not even a penny's worth. One who purchased antiques from an idolater and found idols therein, if he paid for it but took no delivery, he may return them to the idolater; likewise if he took delivery but did not pay for it, although delivery in dealing with an idolater consummates the deal, for here is an apparent purchase by mistake. If he gave money and took delivery, he must cast them in the dead sea. And so shall it be when an idolater and a proselyte fall heirs to the property of their idolatrous father; the proselyte may say to the idolater: "You take the idols and I will take coin; you take compounded wine and I will take fruit". But after the forbidden articles came under control of the proselyte he is forbidden to make such exchange.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 19a; Ibid. 71b. C.</i>
Figures made by an idolater for beauty's sake are permissive property, but figures made for idolatry are forbidden property. How can it be indentified? All figures found in the rural districts are forbidden property, because they are presumed to have been made for idolatry; and those that are found in urban districts, if they were placed at the gate of a city and there was alongside the figure an emblem of a rod, or bird, or globe, or sword, or wreath and ring the presumption is that it was dedicated to idolatry and is forbidden property, if none of these be there the presumption thereof is that it was for beauty's sake only and is permissive property.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin, 17a; Abodah Zarah, 40–41a. C. G.</i>
Cast-away images of idolatry found on the streets, or among cast-off articles, are permissive property, needless to mention broken images; but if one finds a cast-away hand of a star or planet, or its foot or one of its limbs it is forbidden property, because he has certain knowledge that such member is from an idolatrous figure which is worshiped and, therefore, remains in its forbidden status until he find out that idolatrous worshipers made it impotent.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C.</i>
One who finds vestments with engravings of the sun and the moon and dragons thereon, if they be of silver, or gold, or tapestry, or if such were engraved upon nose-bands or rings they are forbidden property; but on all other kind of vestments it is permissive property as the presumption is that it is for beauty's sake. Likewise are all other images which are found on all kinds of vestments under the presumption of being there for beauty's sake, and it is permissive property.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 42a.

Idolatry, everything used in its service, and everything that is made for its sake, even a particle thereof renders everything it is mingled with and its identity lost therein forbidden property. For example? An idol which was mixed up with figures of beauty, even one in many thousands, all of it must be cast in the Dead Sea. Likewise if a cup of idolatry was mixed up with many other cups, or a piece of idolatrous meat in many pieces of other meat must be cast in the Dead Sea. Likewise if a heart-cut hide was mixed up with many other hides, all become forbidden property. If one did transgress and sold idolatry, or an article used in its service, or that which is made for its sake, even the proceeds thereof is forbidden property and a particle thereof renders all other things wherewith it is mixed up forbidden property, for it is as idolatry itself, even as it is said: "Nor take it unto thee, lest thou be desolate as itself" (Deut. 7.25)<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The English translation of the Hebrew word “Harem”, both in the King James version and the 1917 edition of the Jewish Publication Society is wrong; Harem means a snare, as well as desolate, devout, isolated etc., but it never can mean “be esnared” or “be snared”.

The ashes of an idol or Asherah which was burned is forbidden property. A glowing ember of a burning idol is forbidden property, but the flame is permissive because it has no substance. Doubtful idolatry is forbidden property; a doubt contingent upon another doubt is permissive. For example? An idolatrous cup that fell in a receptacle full of cups all are forbidden property, because idolatry and the things made for its service, even a particle thereof disqualify all. If one cup from all with which the idolatrous cups was mixed up became separated and fell among two other cups all are permissive property. If a ring belonging to idolatry became mixed up with many other rings, and then two of the lot fell overboard into the ocean, all the remaining are permissive property, for it can be said that the ring belonging to idolatry was one of the two which fell overboard. If it became mixed up with a hundred other rings, which were subsequently separated into two groups, forty in one place and sixty in another place, and the group of forty fell among a lot of other rings, all are permissive property, for it can be said that the forbidden ring is in the major group of sixty.

An Asherah, whether it was an object of worship itself, or whether there was an idol beneath it, the shadow of the full height of its stem is forbidden ground to sit under; but it is permitted to sit beneath the shadow of its branches and leaves.

Birds in a nest which are no longer in need of their mother are permissive property; but birds and eggs which need their mother are forbidden property, seeing that the Asherah is the basis of their existence.

It is permitted to plant vegetables beneath its shadow, whether it be in summer when the shadow is essential to it or in the rainy season, because the shadow of the Asherah, which is forbidden premises and the ground which does not become forbidden property, both cause such vegetables to sprout, and, it is a rule that whenever a forbidden thing and a permissive thing contribute jointly to a cause it is permissive everywhere. Therefore, if a field was fertilized with fertilizer which belonged to idolatry, it is permitted to be seeded; or if a cow was fattened with lentiles which belonged to idolatry it may be eaten, and so like thereto.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 49b.

Meat, or wine, or fruit which one prepared to be offered to idolatry, do not become forbidden property, although he had already delivered it to the house of idolatry, not until he should offer it to the presence thereof. When he did offer it to the presence thereof, it becomes a thing made for the sacrifice thereto, and even though he take it out again, it is forbidden property forever.

One who finds a garment or a vessel, or coin upon the head of an idol, if he finds it deposited in a shameful manner it is permissive property, but if he finds it deposited in an honorable manner it is forbidden property. For example? He found a bag hung about its neck, a folded garment lying upon its head, or a vessel leaning upon its head, that is permitted property, because it is there in a shameful manner; and so it is with all like thereto. If he found aught the like of which is used as sacrifice on the altar of the Temple, it is forbidden property. Whereat are these words directed? At things found without the place of its worship, but if he found it within, whether it be in an honorable manner or whether it be in a shameful manner, whether it be a thing fit for the altar or whether it be a thing unfit—all that which is found within is forbidden property, even water and salt.

Chapter 8

All that which can not be seized by the hand of man, and man made it not, although it is being worshiped, is permissive property. Therefore, idolaters who worship mountains, hills, trees originally planted for fruit-production, public springs, or cattle, all such are permissive property, and the fruit worshiped at the place of its growth, and such cattle may be eaten; needless to say that a cattle designated to idolatry may be eaten, regardless of whether it was designated to be worshiped or sacrificed, for such is permissive property. Whenceonward is it said that a cattle does not become forbidden property? Prior to any act done to it in the name of idolatry; but after the least act was done to it, it becomes forbidden thereby. For example? If he severed one of its carotides in the name of idolatry. If he made barter therewith to use the proceeds thereof for idolatry, he made it forbidden property, and so is also the proceeds out of that barter, because it becomes the capital of idolatry. Whereat are these words directed? At his own cattle; but if he slaughtered his neighbor's cattle to idolatry, or exchanged it, it does not become forbidden property, because no man can make forbidden property out of something which is not his. One who bows down to ownerless land, does not make it forbidden property; if he dug therein wells, pits, or caves to the worship of idolatry, it does become forbidden property.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah, 45b; Ibid. 54a; Ibid. 40–41a; Ibid. 59a.

Water carried out of a stream by a wave, if one bows down to it, he does not make it forbidden property; if he take out the water by his hand and bows down to it, he does make it forbidden property. Stones of a mountain which became loosened and one worshiped them at their original place, are permissive property, as there was no seizure of man's hand on them.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 46b.

If an Israelite placed a brick erect to bow down to it but did not bow down to it, and then came an idolater and did bow down to it, he made it forbidden property, as placing it erect is an overt act. Likewise if he place an egg erect and an idolator came and bowed down to it, he made it forbidden property. If he cut a pumpkin, or its like, and bowed down to it, he made it forbidden property. If he bowed down to one half of a pumpkin and the other half is connected thereto even that half is forbidden property, because of the peradventure, lest this half serves as a base for the half which is the object of worship. A tree which was originally planted to be worshiped, is forbidden property; of such is the Asherah mentioned in the Torah. If a planted tree was cut down and dedicated to the name of idolatry, though he propagated its trunk by grafting and crossing and it budded and branches grew upon it, he merely cuts off the branches, which are forbidden property, but the rest of the tree is permissive property. Likewise is a tree worshiped by an individual, although its trunk did not become forbidden property, all branches, leaves, boughs and fruit which it brings forth as long as it is worshiped are forbidden property. A tree, the fruit of which was guarded by idolaters, saying that they are preparing to make thereof strong drink for a given house of idolatry, and they do make strong drink thereof and drink it on their holiday, is forbidden property, because it is plain that it is an Asherah, for they therefore treat its fruit in such manner, as that is the method of the Asherah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin, 128b; Abodah Zarah, 48a; Ibid. 47a–b.

A tree, beneath which an idol is erected, as long as it is beneath it, it is forbidden property; if it be removed from beneath it it becomes permissive property, because it is not the tree itself which is worshiped. A house which was originally built by idolaters for the sake of worshiping it, and similarly if a built house is worshiped, it is forbidden property. If a built house was plastered and decorated anew and dedicated to the name of idolatry, all that which was added to it for its renovation may be removed, and the material thereof is forbidden property because it was made for the purpose of worship, but the rest of the house is permissive property. If one brings an idol into a house, as long as it is there, the house is forbidden property; if he removed it the house becomes permissive property. Likewise is a stone, originally hewn to worship it, forbidden property. If the stone was hewn, and thereafter it was tattooed and painted for worship, even if the tattooing and decorating were done on the body of the stone itself, the renovation may be removed, and that is forbidden property as it was made for the sake of worship, but the rest of the stone is permissive property.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid 48a; Ibid. 77a–b.

A stone whereupon an idol was placed, as long as it remains upon it, it is forbidden property; if the stone was removed from thereunder, it becomes permitted property. If a house near a house of idolatry fell in, its owner, is forbidden to reconstruct it. What can he do to save his property? He moves on his own line and builds his house, and the space between he either fills in with thistles or makes a lavatory thereon, so as not to yield space to a house of idolatry. If the wall was of joint ownership the law of half and half should be applicable thereto, his half is permitted property and that of the idolatry is forbidden property, including everything, even its stones, wood, sand and all accessories thereof is forbidden property.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.

An idol, the owner whereof was an idolater, which was nullified by him before it came into possession of an Israelite, even such is permitted property; for, it is said: "The graven images of <i>their gods</i> shall ye burn with fire" (Ibid.); such shall be done when they reach our hands as they follow the custom of <i>godliness</i> toward them; but if they were nullified by them they are permitted property.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 52a C.</i>
An idol, the owner whereof is an Israelite, can never be nullified, even when an idolator had a partnership therein will his nullification be of no aid, but it remains forbidden property forever, and must be hidden. Likewise an idol, the owner whereof was an idolator, which came into the hand of an Israelite, after which the idolater nullified it, his nullification is of no aid but it remains forbidden property forever. An Israelite can not nullify idols, even with the consent of an idolater. An infant, or insane idolater can not nullify idols. An idolater, who nullified an idol, whether it was his own or the property of another idolater, under duress, though it be an Israelite who forced him thereto, the nullification stands, provided, however, that the idolater who nullified be himself a worshiper of idols, for the nullification of him who does not worship idols himself is no nullification. One who nullifies an idol its paraphernalia, too, is nullified; but if he nullifies its paraphernalia, they are permitted property but the idol itself is forbidden property as theretofore until he will nullify it. That which was designated as offering to idolatry can never be nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 53a; Ibid. 52b; Ibid. 43a; Ibid. 64b; Ibid. 50a. C.</i>
How does the idolater nullify it? If he cut off the tip of its nose, the tip of its ear, the first joint of its finger, or if he squeezed in its face though he diminished it not, or if he sold it to a goldsmith who is an Israelite, such are acts of nullification. But if he pawned it, or sold it to an idolater, or to an Israelite who is not a goldsmith, or if debris fell upon it and he did not clean it, or if robbers stole it and he made no effort to recover it; if he expectorated before it, or micturated before it; dragged it, or cast feces at it, such are not acts of nullification.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 53a.

An idol whose worshipers abandoned it at a time of peace is permitted property, for it is evident that they nullified it; but in war time it is forbidden property, because they did not abandon it save on account of the war. An idol which was broken of itself, its fragments are forbidden property until it will be nullified. Therefore, whosoever finds fragments of idols must know that they are forbidden property, lest the idolator did not nullify it. If the fragments consisted of joints and a non-artisan can restore them, each and every joint needs nullification, but if he can not replace, as soon as one of its joints was nullified all fragments were nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.

An altar of idolatry which was damaged, continues to be forbidden property until most of it will be demolished by the hand of an idolator; if a pedestal was damaged it becomes permitted property.

As soon as they were used as material in a building, or plastered roads with them, or other like utilization, they become permitted property. How is an Asherah nullified? If he lops off a leaf or casts away a twig, or takes cane or rod therefrom, or if he pruned it when it had no need for it, such do nullify it. If he pruned it for its own sake, it remains forbidden property but its prunning is permitted property.

Three days before an idolaters' holiday it is forbidden to either buy from or sell to them any article which is endurable; to either loan from or lend to them; to receive payment from or make payment to them on loans which were either secured by note or pledge; but a verbal loan may be collected from them, because it is as if he saves it from their clutches. It is permitted to sell them perishable goods, such as vegetables and cooked food, till their holiday. Whereat are these words spoken of? In Eretz Yisrael, but in other lands it is not forbidden to do all these save on their holiday itself.

Likewise the funeral day on the demise of one of them they make a holiday, on that particular day, with those particular people it is forbidden to deal. After every demise when vestures are burned and incense offered it is indicative that there is idolatrous worship connected therewith. No holiday is forbidden time save in so far its worshipers are concerned.

It is forbidden to make a covenant of peace with the seven Canaanite nations, such peace as would permit them to continue the worship of idolatry, even as it is said: "Thou shalt not make any covenant with them" (Deut. 7.2). They shall either repent themselves of their worship, or be slain. It is moreover, forbidden to have mercy upon them, as it is said: "Nor show mercy unto them" (Ibid.). Therefore, if one saw one of them lost or drowning, he should not bring him up; if he sees him dying, he should not save him; but to destroy wantonly or to push him into a pit, or the like is forbidden, as long as he wages no war. That is saying concerning the Seven Canaanite nations; but as for informers and infidels of those times the war was to destroy them by one's own hand and to lower them to the nethermost pit of destruction because they persecuted Israel, and turned the people from following God.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 26a.

In Syria it is permitted to lease to them fields too. Wherefore has a field been considered the major? Because therein are found two reasons: (a) the idolater removes the obligation of tithes therefrom, and (b) the Israelite shows mercy in giving land to an idolater.

It is forbidden to sell them fruit on the trees, or grain on the stalk; but he may sell it after it be harvested, or sell to one on condition that he harvest it, and when he does harvest it the purchase is binding.

It is, moreover, forbidden to give them a present outright, but it is permitted to give a present outright to an alien sojourner, even as it is said: "Unto the stranger that is in thy gates canst thou give it, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien" (Deut.121.) — to an alien by selling it to him, and not by presenting it to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 19a–20b.

The poor of among the idolaters are supported alike with the poor of Israel as a peaceful measure.

G.</i>. It is also proper to greet them, even on their holiday, as a measure of peace, Never should the greetings be repeated twice, or call in the house of an idolater on his holiday to extend greetings to him.

All of these liberal treatments are not ordained save when Israelites are sojourning among idolaters or when the idolaters have overpowered Israel in his own land; but if the government of his land be in his own hand, it is forbidden to permit idolaters to settle therein, for even if one of them merely desires to sojourn or pass from place to place with merchandise he must not pass through Eretz Yisrael before he obligates himself to live up to the seven Noaitic commandments,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Existence of God, 2 idolatry, 3 murder, 4 incest, 5 flesh of a live animal, 6 robbery, 7 right of property.

If an idolater obligated himself to observe the Seven Noaitic commandments he is a sojourning alien.

Chapter 11

It is forbidden to follow the customs of the idolaters, or to imitate them neither in dress nor in hair-trimming and like customs, for it is said: "And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I cast out before you" (Lev. 20.23), and it is also said: "And in their customs shall ye not walk" (Ibid. 18.3), and it is, moreover, said: Then take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them" (Deut. 12.30)—all of which pertain to one subject admonishing them not to be like unto them. Forsooth an Israelite shall be separated from them, and be recognized by his clothes and in his conduct as he is different than they are in education and tendencies. For even so it is said: "And have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine" (Lev. 20.26). An Israelite shall not wear a garment of a design particularly adopted by idolaters, nor raise hair-locks as their hair-locks; not shave the sides and leave the hair in the middle, such as is called a queue, nor shave the hair opposite his face, from ear to ear, and leave the locks at the back of his head as they do. He shall not build public places of the same design and architecture as are the palaces built for idolatry in order to attract a crowd as they do.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra, Lev. 20; Abodah Zarah, 29a; Baba Kamma, 83a; Sotah, 49b; Tosefta, Shabbat Ch. 6.

It is forbidden to practice enchantment as the idolaters do, even as it is said: "Nor shall ye use enchantment" (Ibid. 19.26). How is enchantment practiced? For instance, those who say: "Seeing that the bread fell out of my mouth", or, "my cane fell out of my hand I shall not go to-day to that place, for if I do go, my desire will not be fulfilled; seeing that a fox passed by my right hand I shall not leave my door step to-day, for if I do leave a false person will encounter me". Likewise those who hear the chirping of a bird say: "It will be so, but not so; it is good to do that thing and bad to do the other thing". So are those who say: "Kill this rooster, he crowed during the evening; kill that hen, she crows like a rooster". So, too, is one who sets certain signs for himself to regulate his actions, saying: "If such thing will come to pass I shall do that thing, but if it will not come to pass I shall not do it", even as Eliezer, Abrahams servant did. And so are all like practices of such things forbidden. And whosoever commits an act as a result of any one of such practices, is lashed.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 65b–67b; Shabbat, 67a; Sifra, Lev. 20; Tosefta, Shabbat, Ch. 1.

Who is practitioner of divination? He who occupies himself with purposeless actions so as to divert his thoughts from all relevancy, thereby preparing himself to prognosticate, and, then, foretells, saying: "That thing will come to pass," or, "it will not come to pass", or he will say: "It is proper to do so, but beware from doing otherwise." There are some soothsayers who use sand or stones as a medium, and there others who spread themselves out on the ground and fall in convulsions and cry out; there are some who look into an iron mirror or goblet and imagine things and say them, and there are others who carry a cane in hand upon which to lean, wherewith a process of knocking is continued as a diversion until the mind is ready, then the speaking starts. Upon such the prophet proclaims, saying: "My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them" (Hosea, 4. 12).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 65b; Sifre, Deut. 18.

It is forbidden to practice divination or ask counsel of a soothsayer; only the consultant of a soothsayer is punished after the manner of a rebel, but the soothsayer himself, if he committed an overt act of any of its practices or their like, is striped, in accordance with what it is said: "There shall not be found among you one who useth divination" (Deut. 18.10).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.

It is forbidden to be an observer of times, though no act be committed, save to make known the lies to such fools who believe them to be true speech of the wise. Moreover, he who does aught because of the signs of astrology, and times to do his work or go on his mission on the very time, set by the heaven-gazers, even he is striped, for it is said: "Nor observe times" (Lev. 126).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Here a distinction must be made between an observer of times and an enchanter.

Who is a charmer? He who utters words which are not of the vernacular of the people, and which have no significance but supposes in his credulous mind that those words are of help, until others are led to say; "If he pronounces thus and such against a serpent or against a scorpion it will not harm; and if he says such and thus against fire it will do no damage". Among them there is such who, while talking holds in his hand a key, or a rock; such and other similar artifice the whole of it is forbidden. As for the charmer himself, either if he held aught in his hand, or if he committed any act along with his utterance, even if he merely pointed with his finger, is striped, as it is said: "There shall not be found among thee.… Or a charmer (Deut. 18.10–11). But if he merely uttered his prattle, and moved neither hand nor head, holding nothing in his hand; and so the individual, over whom he delivered himself of those noises, who sits before him and appears to derive joy of the performance, should be punished as a rebel because he became a party to the silliness of the charmer. All such chatter and ridiculously obscene nomenclature are harmless but without the least good about them.
For one who was bitten by a scorpion or snake it is permitted to charm cunningly upon the injured spot, even on the Sabbath, so as to compose the mind of the patient and strengthen his heart, although the thing is of no help yet because the patient is in a dangerous condition it is permitted for his sake to prevent his mind from being disconcerted.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 101a.

Who is a necromancer? He who starves himself and then proceeds to lodge on the cemetery so as to bring the dead up in his dream and make known to him what he would ask him for. And there are others who clothe themselves with certain garments, utter certain words, and burn certain incense, and sleep alone so that a certain deceased person come to converse with him in his dream. As a general rule in this matter: Whosoever commits an overt act in order to have the dead come and give him information is striped, for it is said: "There shall not be found among you…. or a necromancer" (Deut. 18.10–11).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 65b; Sifre, Deut. 18.

All of these things are false and spurious, and it was with such that the ancient idolaters misled the peoples of many lands so that they be following them. And it is unbecoming to Israel who are exceedingly wise to be attracted by these absurdities, nor to even imagine that they are of any consequence, even as it is said: "For there is no enchantment with Jacob, neither is there any divination with Israel" (Num. 23.23); and it is again said: "For these nations that thou art to dispossess, hearken unto soothsayers and unto diviners, but as for thee the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do" (Deut. 18.14). Whosoever believes in these matters, and their like, and suppose that there is wisdom and truth in in them, save that the Torah disallowed them, such are none other save from among the foolish and ignorant and are to be included among women and children whose mind is not sound. But wise and sound-minded people know that all these matters which the Torah disallowed are not matters of wisdom but formless nonsense followed by senseless people for the sake of which they abandoned every path of truth. Even because thereof the Torah, in admonishing against all these vanities, commanded, saying: "Perfect shalt thou be with the Lord thy God" (Ibid. 18.13).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat, 67.

Chapter 12

It is forbidden to round the corners of the head, as the idolaters used to do, even as it is said: "Ye shall not round the corners of your head" (Lev. 19.27). Guilt is attached to the rounding of each corner; therefore, if one shaves the corners of both sides of his head even at one time, and after only one warning, is striped twice. Regardless of whether one shaves the corners and leaves the hair of the whole head, or whether he shaves the hair of the entire head at one time, he is striped, seeing that he shaved the corners. That is saying concerning the male barber, but the male who is shaved is not striped unless he aided the barber. One who rounds the corners of an infant is striped.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Nazir, 57b–58a; Makkot, 20b. C.</i>
A woman barber who shaved the corners of the head of a man, or had her own corners rounded is not guilty, for it is said: "Ye shall not round the corners of your head, neither shalt thou destroy the corners of thy beard" (Ibid.)—whosoever is concerned with regard to destroying the beard is also concerned with rounding of the corners, but a woman not being concerned with regard to destroying, having no beard, is, therefore, not concerned with regard to rounding the corners. Wherefor, servants because they have a beard, are forbidden to round.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin, 35b. C.</i>
Both men and woman are obliged to observe all of the prohibitive commandments in the Torah, save destroying a beard, rounding the corners of the head, and a priest's contamination for the dead which refer only to men; and, pertaining to mandatory commandments, every such commandment the performance of which takes place only at stated times, and not continuously women are exempted, save the sanctification of the Sabbath day with words of prayer, eating of Mazzah on the first (two) night(s) of Passover, the eating of the Paschal lamb, its slaughter, to be present when all Israel assemble once in seven years, and rejoicing on the festivals wherein women's participation is obligatory.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin, 29a; Ibid. 31a; Berakot, 20b; Pesahim, 87a.

For this lock, which must be left at the corners of the head, the scholars designated no particular size, but we did hear from our elders that one should not leave less than forty (four) hairs.

It was the custom of the idolatrous priests to destroy their beards, because of this the Torah disallowed to destroy the beard. There are five corners (locks) in the beard: (1) upper cheek, (2) lower cheek on the right side; (3) upper and (4) lower cheeks on the left side, and (5) the stem of the beard. For destroying each and every one of the corners, the punishment is lashes; thus if he destroyed all of them at one time he is lashed five times. No guilt is carried with respect thereto unless he destroyed it with a razor, even as it is said: "Neither shalt thou destroy the corners of thy beard. Therefore if one should mar his beard with a pair of scissors he is not guilty. The one who is shaved is not guilty unless he assisted in the work. A woman is permitted to destroy her beard, if she has a growth of hair on her chin. If she shaved the beard of a man, she is not guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.

The removal of hair from other parts of the body, as from beneath the arms and organic region, is not forbidden by the Torah but by edicta of the Scribes, and the one who mars it is punished after the manner of a rebel.

The etched-in writing against which it is spoken of in the Torah is, not to make an incision in one's flesh and fill in the incision with paint, or ink, or any other dyes which enface.

And, from the moment one will enface with any kind of dye which enfaces, after making an incision in any place of the body, whether it be done by man or by woman, he or she, is striped. If one wrote but did not enface with dye, or if he did enface with dye but did not write in the incision, he is not guilty; for he must do both, write by incision and etch-in with dye, even as it is said: "And any etched-in writing shall you not fix on yourselves" (Lev. 19. 28). This is to say against the one who does the writing, but he who upon whose flesh the etched-in writing was done is not guilty save if he assisted in a manner to constitute it an overt act; but if he contributed nothing to the work itself he is not striped.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Makkot, 21b; Sifre, Lev.

Cut-making and incision on one's flesh over the dead are identical idolatrous practices, for the idolaters, even as they made incisions on their flesh over the dead because of their sorrow so did they wound themselves in their frenzy for their dieties, as it said: "And cut themselves after their custom with knives and spears" (I. Kings, 18.28). Even this was forbidden by the Torah, for it is said: "Ye shall not cut yourselves" (Deut. 14.1), with this distinction, however, if it be over the dead there is no difference whether he made the incision by hand or by instrument he is striped, but if it be for idolatry, with an instrument he is guilty and is striped, but by hand he is not guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 21a.

Included in this prohibitive commandment is also a warning that there shall not be two tribunals in one city, one following one set of customs and the other following another set of customs, for such practice causes great divisions, even as it is said: "Ye shall not cut (divide) yourselves" (Ibid.), ye shall not multiply divisions.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamot, 13b.
