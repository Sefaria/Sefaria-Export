Mishneh Torah, Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations



Chapter 1

During the times of Enosh,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">the grandson of Adam. See Genesis 4:26, 5:6-11. Enosh lived from the year 235 after creation to the year 1140 (3525 to 2620 B.C.E.).</i> mankind made a great mistake, and the wise men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Interestingly, the Rambam does not attribute the rise of paganism to simple commoners, but to the "wise" of the generation.</i> Enosh himself was one of those who erred.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our text of <i>Shabbat</i> 118b mentions that "the generation of Enosh" were idol worshipers. However, certain versions of that text omit the words "generation of." (See <i>She'iltot D'Rabbi Achai Gaon, Bereshit</i>.)</i><br>Their mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 3, for a description of the stars and the spheres, and their place within the Rambam's conception of the cosmos.</i> with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., mediums of Divine influence</i> Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi finds an allusion to the worship of false gods in Enosh's times in Genesis 4:26: which he renders, "It was then that they called profanely upon the name of God."</i> [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i>, ibid., and in several places in the Guide for the Perplexed, the Rambam explains that the stars and the spheres are on a higher plane than the creations of our world. Though they influence our world, they are also God's creations and have no free will of their own. Thus, they are no more than an axe in the hands of a wood-chopper, and should not worshiped or served.</i><br>After conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to the stars<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Rambam's comments on astrology in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7), which are quoted in the commentary on Chapter 11, Halachah 16.</i> and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by doing so, they would<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">according to their false conception - It is questionable if such worship is forbidden to gentiles or not. Based on Deuteronomy 4:19, certain authorities maintain that the gentiles may worship other gods, provided they have the awareness that God is the ultimate power (שיתוף).<br>The Rambam, however, does not mention this perspective in these halachot, nor in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i>, Chapter 9, where he discusses the prohibition against the worship of false gods as it affects gentiles. [In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 2), however, he states "Israel is commanded regarding the unification of God"; from which it could be inferred that gentiles need not believe in this concept and can combine their worship of God with other powers.] All authorities agree that such worship is forbidden for Jews.</i> - according to their false conception - be fulfilling the will of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It is unclear from the Rambam's statements here whether, originally, they would worship the stars without any self-interest - merely with the intent of honoring those whom God honors - or whether their service was self-oriented - i.e., they worshiped the stars because they considered them as mediums of Divine influence and hoped to derive benefit from of their service. In the following halachah and in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7), the Rambam mentions the second view. It is, however, unclear if this was the original intent of the star-worshipers or whether this was a later development.</i><br>This was the essence of the worship of false gods,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> and this was the rationale of those who worshiped them.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">at the outset.</i> They would not say that there is no other god except for this star.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">as the pagans mentioned in Halachah 2 later did. The first generations of star worshipers were aware of God's existence and conceived of the stars as no more than intermediaries between ourselves and Him.</i><br>This message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See also the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. I, Chapter 36) where the Rambam explains a similar idea using the same Biblical proof-text.</i> (10:7-8): "Who will not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it is fitting. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. They have one foolish and senseless [notion. They conceive of their] empty teachings as wood;"<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., as an entity of substance</i> i.e., all know that You alone are God. Their foolish error consists of conceiving of this emptiness<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">the worship of the stars<br><b>as Your will. -</b> This and the following two halachot are somewhat problematic. The Rambam conceived of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as a book of law. He included philosophical and historical points only when they are halachot, directives for our behavior. In this light, this entire chapter seems unnecessary.<br>This difficulty can be resolved based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3, which states that it is forbidden to entertain thoughts of idol worship. Hence, in order to know which thoughts are forbidden, the Rambam feels it necessary to describe the entire thought process which led people to worship idols (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 20).<br>The phenomenon described by the Rambam does not belong entirely to the past. Although, at present, bowing down to the "stars and spheres" is not very common - although it has been renewed by some cultists - the theoretical premise that motivated the ancients to serve the stars is still followed by many. Is it all that uncommon to find people who compromise their service of God in expectation of receiving benefits by following what they perceive as the natural order?</i> as Your will.
After many years passed, there arose people<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">false prophets - Note <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 9:5, which states that anyone who states that God told him in a prophetic vision to worship idols should automatically be considered a false prophet.<br>See also the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. II, Chapter 36) where the Rambam describes how people can be overcome by their powers of imagination to the extent that they - as do others who see them in such a trance - think of themselves as prophets, although, in fact, they received no Divine influence.</i> - false prophets - who told [their nations] that God had commanded them to say:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, this represents a second stage in the spread of idol worship. At first - as explained in Halachah 1 - star worship was not institutionalized, but was practiced by individuals because of their mistaken conceptions.<br>The second phase involved the development of religious institutions and set modes of worship. The leaders, however, still recognized God and attributed the instructions to worship the stars to Him. In the third stage - as the latter portion of this halachah states - people would worship the stars and idols without any awareness of God.</i> Serve this star<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">or all the stars - sacrifice to it, offer libations to it, build a temple for it and make an image of it so that all people - including the women, the children, and the common people - could bow to it. - See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7) and his statements in Chapter 11, Halachah 16, where he explains that idol worship was instituted by the leaders of the nations to unite the people of a particular land, give them a sense of national identity, and establish a hierarchy of leaders.</i> - or all the stars - sacrifice to it, offer libations to it, build a temple for it and make an image of it so that all people - including the women, the children, and the common people - could bow to it.<br>He would inform them of a form that he had conceived, and tell them that this is the image of the particular star, claiming that this was revealed to him in a prophetic vision.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">With these statements, the Rambam explains how people began to worship statues and idols. Since the star was far away and could not be perceived as more than a twinkling dot in the sky, the people wanted a more tangible image which they could relate to. The "prophets" obliged and devised forms for statues to serve as talismans to bring down influence from these stars.</i> In this manner, the people began to make images in temples, under trees, and on the tops of mountains and hills.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Note Deuteronomy 12:2, which commands the Jews to destroy "all the places where the nations... would worship their gods, on the high mountains, on the hills, or under any luxuriant tree." Note the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 45, where the Rambam mentions the gentile practice of building temples on hills and mountaintops.</i><br>People would gather together and bow down to them<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">the images</i> and the [false prophets] would say: This image is the source of benefit or harm. It is appropriate to serve it and fear it. Their priests would tell them: This service will enable you to multiply and be successful. Do this and this, or do not do this or this.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">At this stage, their service was clearly self-oriented. They wanted to derive benefit or prevent harm to themselves through this service.</i><br>Subsequently, other deceivers arose and declared that a specific star, sphere, or angel<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 2, for a description of the angels.</i> had spoken to them and commanded them: Serve me in this manner. He would then relate a mode of service [telling them:] Do this, do not do this.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This represented a further descent. Rather than prophesy in the name of God, these imposters would speak in the names of the idols themselves. (See also Chapter 5, Halachot 6-7.)</i><br>Thus, these practices spread throughout the world. People would serve images with strange practices<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">one more distorted than the other - Note Chapter 3, Halachah 2, which describes the service of Ba'al Pe'or. The people would defecate before the idol as an act of worship.</i> - one more distorted than the other - offer sacrifices to them, and bow down to them. As the years passed, [God's] glorious and awesome name was forgotten by the entire population. [It was no longer part of] their speech or thought, and they no longer knew Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear at which point in the history of the world this change took place. The period between Enosh's birth and Abraham's lasted slightly more than one thousand years, with the flood taking place approximately 750 years after Enosh's birth.</i> Thus, all the common people, the women, and the children would know<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 1:1), where he also differentiates between the people who believe in the spiritual service intended to draw down spiritual energy from these celestial bodies and practice it, and the common people who worship the idols blindly, on faith.</i> only the image of wood or stone and the temples of stone to which they were trained from their childhood to bow down and serve, and in whose name they swore.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., they conceived of the images as gods. Such worship represented more than a mere conceptual error. Six of the seven mitzvot commanded to Noach and his descendants were also given to Adam, the first man. Among them was the prohibition against serving other gods (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1). Thus, by worshiping these images, they were breaking an explicit Divine commandment.</i><br>The wise men among them would<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">not worship the images as gods in their own right, but they would</i> think that there is no God other than the stars and spheres for whose sake, and in resemblance of which, they had made these images. The Eternal Rock<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">the true God</i> was not recognized or known by anyone in the world, with the exception of a [few] individuals:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages speak critically of these individuals, who were themselves righteous, but did nothing to influence the people around them.<br><b>for example -</b> See also the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. II, Chapter 39, where the Rambam cites these individuals as prophets.<br><b>Chanoch -</b> Note Genesis 5:22: "And Chanoch walked with God."<br><b>Metushelach -</b> Though his righteousness is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah, it is mentioned by our Sages in a number of places - e.g., <i>Yalkut Shimeoni, Bereshit</i> 42, which states: "Metushelach was a completely righteous man."<br><b>Noach -</b> See Genesis 6:9: "And Noach was a righteous man, perfect in his generation."<br><b>Shem -</b> Noach's second son.<br><b>and Ever. -</b> Shem and Ever are frequently mentioned by our Rabbis as righteous sages. See <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 63:6, which explains that when Rivkah went "to seek out God" (Genesis 25:22 , she went to the house of study of Shem and Ever.<br><b>The world continued in this fashion until the pillar of the world - the Patriarch Abraham - was born. -</b> Abraham was born in the year 1948 (1812 B.C.E.).</i> for example, Chanoch, Metushelach, Noach, Shem, and Ever. The world continued in this fashion until the pillar of the world - the Patriarch Abraham - was born.
After this mighty man<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In several places - e.g., <i>Bava Batra</i> 15a and <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 11a - our Sages referred to Abraham with this expression.</i> was weaned,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 32a states: "Abraham was three when he recognized his Creator." Although the Rambam states that it was not until Abraham was forty that he gained true awareness of God, his process of search began at age three.</i> he began to explore and think. Though he was a child, he began to think [incessantly] throughout the day and night, wondering: How is it possible for the sphere to continue to revolve without having anyone controlling it?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Midrash HaGadol</i> (<i>Parashat Lech Lecha</i>), which explains that Abraham questioned: Why should we bow down to idols, gods that we ourselves make? We should bow to the earth, for it produces crops that sustain us.<br>Therefore, he began to worship the earth. Then he saw that the earth needs rain, and began to worship the sky. Later, he saw that the most brilliant creation in the sky was the sun, and began to worship it. Afterwards, when the sun set and the moon rose, he began to worship the moon. When the sun rose the next morning, he did not know what to do. He did not see which was stronger: the sun or the moon. So Abraham continued in a quandary, questioning who was the true God.</i> Who is causing it to revolve? Surely, it does not cause itself to revolve.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Interestingly, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:5, the Rambam uses the same concept as a proof for the existence of God.<br>He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. -<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 61:1 elaborates on the lack of instruction that was available to Abraham.<br>Note the Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who question why Noach, Shem, and Ever (all of whom were alive at this time) did not try to nullify the worship of idols and why they did not instruct Abraham. They offer two explanations. The first is that they were afraid and hid from the idolaters. (See <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 118. Note, however, teachings which state that these righteous men also protested the worship of false gods, <i>Tanna Devei Eliyahu Rabba</i>, Chapters 20 and 25.)<br>Alternatively, Shem and Ever lived in the land of Canaan, while Abraham lived in Babylon. The question remains, however, why did Abraham not seek out these righteous men (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).</i><br>He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. Rather, he was mired in Ur Kasdim among the foolish idolaters. His father, mother, and all the people [around him] were idol worshipers,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, our Sages relate that his father had a shop where idols were sold.</i> and he would worship with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:8, which states that Abraham was always worried that God would not absolve him from his sin of worshiping idols.</i> [However,] his heart was exploring and [gaining] understanding.<br>Ultimately, he appreciated the way of truth<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">an awareness of God</i> and understood the path of righteousness<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">an ethical approach to behavior, which reflected his spiritual awareness</i> through his accurate comprehension. He realized that there was one God who controlled the sphere, that He created everything, and that there is no other God among all the other entities.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">These are the fundamental principles of the Jewish faith, as explained in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:1-6.</i> He knew that the entire world was making a mistake. What caused them to err was their service of the stars and images, which made them lose awareness of the truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Their worship of idols dulled their sensitivity to spirituality to the point where they lost all awareness of God.</i><br>Abraham was forty years old when he became aware of his Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 64:4, which mentions two opinions regarding when Abraham became aware of God: one when he was three and one when he was forty eight. It is possible that the Rambam's text of the Midrash read "forty" instead of "forty eight."<br>As explained above, the opinions are not necessarily contradictory. Abraham's process of inquiry could have begun at age three, while at forty he gained greater understanding, and at forty eight, he achieved an even higher level of awareness.<br><i>Avot</i> 5:21 states: "At forty, one achieves understanding." By associating Abraham's apreciation of the Creator with this age, the Rambam implies that this awareness can come as a product of our own thought and meditation.</i> When he recognized and knew Him,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:1 explains Abraham's process of thought with a parable. A person saw a brightly lit palace. He wondered: Could this palace exist without an owner? Immediately, the owner revealed himself to him. Similarly, Abraham wondered: Is it possible for the world to exist without one who controls? Immediately, God revealed himself to him.</i> he began to formulate replies to the inhabitants of Ur Kasdim and debate with them, telling them that they were not following a proper path.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">by serving the stars and idols.</i><br>He broke their idols and began to teach the people that it is fitting to serve only the God of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages relate that after breaking his father's idols, he put a stick in the hands of the largest idol. When his father asked him why he destroyed the idols, he replied that he didn't do it; the idol holding the stick did.<br>His father curtly dismissed his reply: "That idol is only metal. It cannot do anything," he roared at his son.<br>"If so, why do you worship it?" Abraham replied.</i> To Him [alone] is it fitting to bow down, sacrifice, and offer libations, so that the people of future [generations] would recognize Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's words imply that the value of offering sacrifices at this time (before the Torah commanded that they be offered) was not as the acts of service of God, but in the educational effect they had on the people and the awareness of God they inspired.</i> [Conversely,] it is fitting to destroy and break all the images, lest all the people err concerning them, like those people who thought that there are no other gods besides these [images].<br>When he overcame them through the strength of his arguments, the king<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Nimrod (<i>Pesachim</i> 118a)<br><b>desired to kill him -</b> by tossing him into a burning furnace.<br><b>He was [saved through] a miracle -</b> Interestingly, when the Rambam lists the ten trials that Abraham endured in his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 5:3, he does not mention this episode at all.<br><b>and left for Charan. -</b> See Genesis 11:31. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam mentions Abraham's exile from his native land as the first of his ten trials.<br><b>[There,] -</b> he did not encounter any of the formal opposition he had faced in Babylonia and<br><b>he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country -</b> On the phrase, Genesis 12:5, "the people they had gathered in Charan," <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:21 comments, "These are the converts they made. Abraham would convert the men and Sarah would convert the women."<br><b>until he came to the land of Canaan -</b> See Genesis, Chapter 12, which describes Abraham's journeys within the land of Canaan.<br><b>proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: "And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God." -</b> <i>Sotah</i> 10a states: "Do not read 'And he called.' Read 'And he had others call' - i.e., Abraham motivated others to become aware of God and call out to Him.<br><b>When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the men of the house of Abraham. -</b> The Rabbis question the fate of all these people. We do not find any mention of the perpetuation of their faith in God. Perhaps the cultural influences of the surrounding environment were too powerful. If the children of Israel themselves turned to idol worship after two generations in Egypt, could any more be expected from these individuals?<br><b>He planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed texts about it -</b> Most commentaries point to <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 14b, which relates that Abraham composed a four-hundred-chapter text against the worship of false gods. <i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> notes that here, the Rambam is not referring to the negation of idol worship, but to the propagation of the faith in one God. Therefore, he suggests that the reference is to the Kabbalistic tradition (<i>Zohar</i>, Vol. II, 275b) that <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> was composed by Abraham. (See also <i>Kiryat Melech</i>.)<br><b>and taught it to Isaac, his son. -</b> Note Genesis 18:19: "I have known him that he will command his children and household after him, and they will keep the way of God...."<br><b>Isaac also taught others and turned [their hearts to God]. He also taught Jacob -</b> Jacob also studied under Shem and Ever (See Rashi, Genesis 25:27, <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 25:16).<br><b>and appointed him as a teacher -</b> i.e., he and not Esau would convey the spiritual heritage of Abraham.<br><b>[Jacob] taught others and turned [the hearts] of all those who gathered around him [to God]. He also taught all of his children. -</b> In contrast to Abraham and Isaac, all of Jacob's children were righteous. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:4.)<br><b>He selected Levi and appointed him as the leader. -</b> The Torah itself does not mention Jacob's selection of Levi as a leader. A number of sources in the oral tradition (<i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Chapter 39; <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 15:27), however, reveal this concept.<br><b>He established him [as the head of] the academy -</b> The <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> (<i>Vayigash</i>) interprets Genesis 46:28: "And Jacob sent Judah before him," to mean that he charged him with founding a yeshiva. Similarly, <i>Yoma</i> 28b states that this Talmudic academy continued throughout the Egyptian exile.<br><b>to teach them the way of God -</b> Note <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 1:7, which explains that the expression, "the way of God," refers to ethics, emulating the qualities of spirit which God has revealed.<br><b>and observe the mitzvot of Abraham. -</b> In this context, note the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1. After relating the seven universal laws given to Noach and his descendants, the Rambam states:<br>In addition to these, Abraham was commanded regarding circumcision. He instituted the morning prayer. Isaac separated tithes and added another prayer service towards evening. Jacob added the prohibition against eating the <i>gid hanasheh</i>, the "displaced nerve," and instituted the evening prayers.<br><b>[Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from the descendants of Levi -</b> Thus, the mantle of leadership passed to Kehat and then to Amram, Moses' father.<br><b>so that the teachings would not be forgotten. This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation within the world which knew God. -</b> This describes the initial period of the Jews' stay in Egypt, when they prospered both spiritually and materially.<br><b>When the Jews extended their stay in Egypt -</b> The entire period of the Egyptian exile lasted 210 years. As long as Jacob's sons were living, the Jews preserved the heritage of their fathers and were treated with honor by the Egyptians.<br>The last of Jacob's sons to die was Levi. After his death, the spiritual level of the Jews descended. Levi lived 127 years. He was 44 when he entered Egypt. Thus, this spiritual descent occurred 83 years after the Jews entered Egypt.<br><b>however, they learned from the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did -</b> When the Jews adopted Egyptian values - as a reflection of their spiritual state - they were enslaved by the Egyptians.<br><b>with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods. -</b> The tribe of Levi was also the only tribe which perpetuated the mitzvah of circumcision (<i>Sifre, Berachah</i>). As a result of their spiritual fortitude, the tribe of Levi was never enslaved.<br><b>Within a short time, the fundamental principle that Abraham had planted would have been uprooted and the descendants of Jacob would have returned to the errors of the world and their crookedness. -</b> Our Sages relate that, in the Egyptian exile, the Jews had descended to the forty-ninth degree of impurity. Had they descended another level, it would have been impossible for us ever to be redeemed.<br><b>Because of God's love for us, and to uphold the oath He made to Abraham, our patriarch -</b> This is a reference to Deuteronomy 7:7-8: "It is not because of your greatness over all the other nations that God desired you and chose you..., but it was because of God's love for you and because He kept the oath He swore to your fathers."<br><b>He brought forth Moses, our teacher -</b> Rav David Arameah notes that the word עשה, rendered as "brought forth," literally means "made." He explains that from Moses' birth, God granted him the potential to develop unique spiritual awareness. Although the Rambam also accepts this concept (see the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. II, Chapter 32), it is more likely that he chose this expression as a reference to I Samuel 12:6 (Rav Kapach).<br><b>the master of all prophets -</b> See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 7:6, where the Rambam elaborates on the advantages Moses had over all the other prophets. Indeed, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to Chapter 10 of <i>Sanhedrin</i>), he includes belief in the supremacy of Moses' prophecy as the seventh of his Thirteen Principles of Faith.<br><b>and sent him [to redeem the Jews] -</b> after 117 years of idol worship and slavery.<br><b>After Moses, our teacher, prophesied, and God chose Israel as His inheritance, He crowned them with mitzvot and informed them of the path to serve Him -</b> by<br><b>[teaching them] -</b> the Torah which reveals<br><b>the judgement prescribed for idol-worship and all those who stray after it -</b> as will be explained in the subsequent chapters. The Rambam's elaboration on the negative experience of our people in Egypt and the giving of the Torah has the following implication. Although man can appreciate the futile nature of idol worship and the greatness of God with his own intellect, because man is fallable, it is necessary to have these principles institutionalized in an objective, unchanging religious code (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 20).</i> desired to kill him. He was [saved through] a miracle and left for Charan. [There,] he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world and it is proper to serve Him. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country, until he came to the land of Canaan - proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: "And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God."<br>When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the men of the house of Abraham.<br>He planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed texts about it, and taught it to Isaac, his son. Isaac also taught others and turned [their hearts to God]. He also taught Jacob and appointed him as a teacher.<br>[Jacob] taught others and turned [the hearts] of all those who gathered around him [to God]. He also taught all of his children. He selected Levi and appointed him as the leader. He established him [as the head of] the academy to teach them the way of God and observe the mitzvot of Abraham.<br>[Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from the descendants of Levi, so that the teachings would not be forgotten. This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation within the world which knew God.<br>When the Jews extended their stay in Egypt, however, they learned from the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did, with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods.<br>Within a short time, the fundamental principle that Abraham had planted would have been uprooted, and the descendants of Jacob would have returned to the errors of the world and their crookedness. Because of God's love for us, and to uphold the oath He made to Abraham, our patriarch, He brought forth Moses, our teacher, the master of all prophets, and sent him [to redeem the Jews]. After Moses, our teacher, prophesied, and God chose Israel as His inheritance, He crowned them with mitzvot and informed them of the path to serve Him, [teaching them] the judgement prescribed for idol worshiper and all those who stray after it.

The essence of the commandment [forbidding] the worship of false gods is not to serve any of the creations,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam counts the prohibition against worshiping false gods as the first of the 365 negative commandments.

The worshipers of false gods have composed many texts concerning their service, [describing] what is the essence of their service, what practices are involved, and what are its statutes.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have also included studying other books by pagans and nonbelievers in this prohibition.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, has commanded us not to read those books at all,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avot</i> 2:17), which states that one may study "the ideas of the gentiles in order to reply to them." Indeed, from the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapters 29 and 30, it appears that the Rambam himself undertook such study. (The Rabbis have, nevertheless, suggested that such study be limited only to certain individuals who have received permission from a rabbinic authority to concern themselves with these issues.)<br>Note also Chapter 3, Halachah 2, and <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 2:1, which state that judges must be somewhat familiar with the rites of the pagans in order to judge cases dealing with such questions.

On the most obvious level, it is a figurative expression, not to be interpreted literally. On a deeper level, it can be seen as a reference to his statements in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:4 that a person should always "see himself and the entire world as equally balanced between merit and sin. If he commits one sin, he tips his balance and that of the entire world to guilt and brings on destruction."<br>Today, we can appreciate the Rambam's words in a very literal sense.

He explains that this also applies to the oral law. He reiterates this concept in his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i><br>Since he may not know the guidelines with which to evaluate [ideas that will lead him] to the truth in its fullness, he may come to heresy.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements should be interpreted, not as a restriction of one's thinking processes, but rather a call to structure our thoughts according to the guidelines provided for us by the Torah.<br>In this context, it is worthy to refer to <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13:<br>I maintain that it is not proper for a person to stroll in the <i>Pardes</i> (study Torah's mystic secrets) unless he has filled his belly with bread and meat. "Bread and meat" refer to the knowledge of what is permitted and what is forbidden, and similar matters concerning other mitzvot. Even though the Sages referred to these as "a small matter" - since our Sages said: "'A great matter,' this is <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah</i>. 'A small matter,' this is the debates of Abbaye and Ravva" - nevertheless, it is fitting for them to be given precedence, because they settle a person's mind.<br>Thus, the Rambam teaches that a person should not embark on the study of deep spiritual questions until he has gained the intellectual maturity which comes from Torah study. Even after a person gains such maturity, there is no need for him to concern himself with the study of idol worship because there is no value which he can derive from such study.<br><b>The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: "Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality" -</b> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 47) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 387) counts this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br><b>i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth. -</b> Instead, he should follow a structured pattern for intellectual growth and development prescribed by a Torah master.<br><b>Our Sages -</b> <i>Sifre, Sh'lach</i>. (See also <i>Berachot</i> 12b.)<br><b>[interpreted this warning]: "After your hearts," this refers to heresy -</b> For a more precise definition of the term <i>minut</i>, see Halachah 5 and the commentary.<br><b>"after your eyes," this refers to immorality. -</b> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains:<br>Their intent in mentioning "immorality" was the pursuit of pleasure and physical desire, [to the extent that] one's mind is constantly preoccupied with such thoughts.<br><b>This prohibition - though [severe,] causing a person to be prevented [from attaining a portion] in the world to come -</b> In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam includes among the categories of those who have no portion in the world to come: "nonbelievers, heretics, those who deny the Torah,... those who cause the many to sin, and those who depart from the ways of the community." Following the whims of one's heart can lead to the transgression of these prohibitions.<br><b>is not punishable by lashes -</b> because it does not involve a deed.<br>There is some difficulty with the Rambam's statements. The transgression of both of the prohibitions mentioned in this halachah involves thought and can also involve deed. Just as the commentaries suggested several deeds which violate the first prohibition, similar acts could be performed which violate the latter prohibition. The Rambam, however, appears to imply that there is no way that the latter prohibition could be transgressed in a manner warranting punishment.</i> The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: "Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality" - i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth.<br>Our Sages [interpreted this warning]: "After your hearts," this refers to heresy; "after your eyes," this refers to immorality. This prohibition - though [severe,] causing a person to be prevented [from attaining a portion] in the world to come - is not punishable by lashes.
The commandment [forbidding] the worship of false gods is equivalent to all the mitzvot, as [implied by Numbers 15:22]: "Lest you err and not perform all the mitzvot...." The oral tradition teaches that the verse refers to the worship of false gods. Thus, we learn that anyone who acknowledges a false god denies the entire Torah in its totality, all the works of the prophets, and everything that has been commanded to the prophets from Adam, [the first man,] until eternity, as [Numbers 15:23] continues: "...from the day God issued His commandments and afterwards, for your future generations."<br>[Conversely,] anyone who denies the worship of false gods acknowledges the entire Torah in its totality, all the works of the prophets, and everything that has been commanded to the prophets from Adam, [the first man,] until eternity. [This acknowledgement] is fundamental to all of the mitzvot.
A Jew who serves false gods is considered like a gentile in all regards and is not comparable to a Jew who violated another transgression punishable by being stoned to death. An apostate who worships false gods is considered to be an apostate with regard to the entire Torah.<br>Similarly, Jewish <i>minnim</i> are not considered to be Jews with regard to any matter. Their repentance should never be accepted, as [implied by Proverbs 2:19]: "None that go to her repent, nor will they regain the paths of life."<br>The <i>minnim</i> are those who stray after the thoughts of their hearts, concerning themselves with the foolish matters mentioned above, until they ultimately transgress against the body of Torah [law] arrogantly, with scorn, with the intent of provoking God's anger, and yet say that there is no sin involved.<br>It is forbidden to talk to them or to reply to them at all, as [Proverbs 5:8] states: "Do not come close to her door." [It can be assumed that] a <i>min's</i> thoughts are concerned with false gods.
Whoever accepts a false god as true, even when he does not actually worship it, disgraces and blasphemes [God's] glorious and awesome name. This applies both to one who worships false gods and to one who curses God's name [as is obvious from Numbers 15:30]: "If a person commits [an act of idolatry] highhandedly, whether he be a native born [Jew] or a convert, he is blaspheming God."<br>Therefore, a person who worships false gods is to be hanged, just as one who blasphemes against God is hanged. Both are executed by being stoned to death. Therefore, I have included the laws applying to a blasphemer in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>. Both deny the fundamental principle [of Jewish faith].
These are the laws which govern a blasphemer: A blasphemer is not liable to be stoned to death until he states God's unique name, which possesses four letters: א-ד-נ-י, and curses that name with one of the names of God which are forbidden to be erased, as [Leviticus 24:16] states: "One who blasphemes God's name...."<br>One is obligated to be stoned to death for blaspheming God's unique name. [Should he blaspheme] the other names for God, he [transgresses] a prohibition.<br>There are those who state that one is liable [for execution] only when one blasphemes the name י-ה-ו-ה. I, however, maintain that one should be stoned to death in both instances.
Which verse serves as the warning prohibiting blasphemy? [Exodus 22:27]: "Do not curse God."<br>[The procedure for the trial of a blasphemer is as follows:] Each day [when] the witnesses are questioned, [they use] other terms for God's name, [stating,] "May Yosse strike Yosse." At the conclusion of the judgment, all bystanders are removed [from the courtroom]. The judges question the witness of greatest stature and tell him, "Tell us what you heard explicitly." He relates [the curse]. The judges stand upright and rend their garments. They may not mend them [afterwards].<br>The second witness states: "I also heard as he did." If there are many witnesses, they must all say, "I heard the same."
[The fact that] a blasphemer retracts his statements in the midst of speaking is of no consequence. Rather, once he utters blasphemy in the presence of witnesses, he is [liable for execution by] stoning.<br>Should a person curse God's name with the name of a false god, the zealous may strike him and slay him. If the zealous do not slay him and he is brought to court, he is not [condemned to] be stoned. [That punishment is administered] only when one curses God's name with another one of His unique names.
Whoever hears the blasphemy of God's name is obligated to rend his garments. Even [when one hears] the blasphemy of other terms used to describe God, one is obligated to rend his garments.<br>The above applies when one hears [the blasphemy] from a fellow Jew. [In that instance,] both one who hears the actual blasphemy and one who hears it from the witnesses is obligated to rend his garments. In contrast, one who hears a gentile [blaspheme God's name] is not obligated to rend his garments. Elyakim and Shevna rent their garments [as described in Isaiah 36:22] only because Ravshakeh was an apostate Jew.<br>[Before his execution,] all the witnesses and the judges place their hands on the head of the blasphemer and tell him: "You are responsible for your death. You brought it upon yourself." Only a blasphemer - and none of the other offenders executed by the court - has [the judges and witnesses] place their hands upon his head, as [Leviticus 24:14] states: "And all those who hear shall place their hands on his head."

The gentiles established various different services for each particular idol and image. These services do not [necessarily] resemble each other. For example, Pe'or<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers, Chapter 25, which describes the Jews' worship of this image.

One might think that a person would be held liable for serving one of these gods in the manner used to serve the other, since they are both served in an unbecoming manner. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 61a teaches us that, nevertheless, one is not liable.</i> Similarly, other services were instituted for other idols.<br>One who defecates before Marculis or throws a stone at Pe'or is free of liability until he serves it according to the accepted modes of service, as [implied by Deuteronomy 12:30]: "[Lest one inquire about their gods, saying,] 'How did these nations serve their gods?

Even one who lifted up a brick and said, "You are my god," or the like, is liable.

Anyone who serves a false god through its accepted mode of service - even if he does so in a derisive manner<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., both the act he performs and his intent in performing it is to abuse the false deity</i> - is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">for a sacrifice, as will be explained.

Hence, he is not punished by the court for his deed, nor is he obligated for <i>karet</i> by God. Since he, nevertheless, did perform an act of worship to these gods, he must bring a sacrifice for atonement.<br>The above represents the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> interpretation of this halachah. Many other authorities (see <i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> 64a) disagree, and maintain that even in such circumstances, one could be held liable for capital punishment. For example, two witnesses who knew the law were present and warned the person against repudiating the idol in this fashion. He ignored their warning and performed the derisive act of worship. Although his intent was not to serve the deity, since he performed an act of worship despite the warning he was given, he is liable for execution.<br>Rav Kapach brings support for the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> view from the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:6. There, the Rambam discusses a similar situation and states that a person who performs such service "is liable for a sin offering." In the original texts of that commentary, the Rambam stated that the person "is liable." The addition of the words "for a sin offering" appear to indicate that he is liable only for an offering, but not for punishment by the court. Note also <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:4, where the Rambam states that a person who unknowingly worships a false god is not liable for his deeds.</i>
[The following rules apply when] a person serves a false deity out of love<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., he desires an image because its service is very attractive - The commentaries note that the Rambam interprets "out of love" differently from "out of fear." "Out of love" refers to a love for the image and its service, while "out of fear" means fear of what the deity can do to the person.<br>Rav Kapach explains the Rambam's position, justifying the need for such a difference in interpretation. Most idolaters do not worship their images out of a genuine conviction that they are the true god, but rather for the benefit they feel this service will bring them. Therefore, were a person to serve an idol with this intent in mind, the Rambam would hold him liable. In contrast, were he to serve out of fear, he is not considered to be acting on his own volition, and hence is not held responsible.</i> - i.e., he desires an image because its service is very attractive - or when one serves it out of his fear of it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., he fears that it will harm him - as the [idol] worshipers fear [their deities as sources of] benefit and harm: - See Chapter 1, Halachot 1-2.</i> - i.e., he fears that it will harm him - as the [idol] worshipers fear [their deities as sources of] benefit and harm: If he accepts it as a god,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">and serves it as an act of worship</i> he is liable to be stoned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">as stated in Halachah 1.</i> If he serves it out of love or fear<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">without accepting it as a god - even though he served it</i> through its accepted mode of service<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">as mentioned in Halachah 2</i> or through one of the four services [mentioned above],<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">in Halachah 3,</i> he is not held liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">since he did not accept the deity as a god.<br>Although the Rambam's opinion is questioned by many other authorities, it is based on an established tradition of Talmudic interpretation. This halachah is based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 61b. That passage is also quoted in <i>Shabbat</i> 72b. Rabbenu Chanan'el, one of the foremost commentators in the generations between the Geonim and the Rambam, interprets the latter passage using the same concepts _ and almost the same phraseology _ as employed by the Rambam here.<br>The Ra'avad and others challenge the Rambam's interpretation and explain that "out of love" and "out of fear" mean: motivated by the love or fear of the person who tries to influence one to worship the false deity. The Rambam cannot accept this interpretation, because in <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 5:4, he states that a person who is forced to serve false gods is not held liable for his deeds (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The fact that a person is not held liable for such service does not at all minimize the seriousness of the prohibition involved. In no way is one allowed to serve false gods for such reasons. Even with regard to the Ra'avad's interpretation "out of fear" - i.e., out of fear of a person - the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 150:3) prohibits performing any act that might be interpreted as idol worship - e.g., bowing to a ruler who is wearing an image.</i><br>One who embraces a false deity, kisses it, sweeps before it, mops before it, washes it, anoints it, dresses it, places shoes upon it, or performs any similar act of deference violates a negative commandment, as [implied by Exodus 20:5]: "Do not serve them."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This commandment is described in Halachot 2 and 3.</i> Such acts are also "service." The offender is, nevertheless, not<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">executed, as is one who worships a false deity, nor is he</i> liable for lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that punishment is not given because this prohibition is a לאו שבכללות - i.e., it includes many different forbidden acts. Lashes are not given for the violation of such a prohibition, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3.<br>To explain: The prohibition, "Do not serve them," is twofold in nature. It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.<br>Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes. Since, in essence, this prohibition is not associated with lashes, even the many transgressions of a lesser nature which are also included within this prohibition are also not punishable in this manner (Rav Kapach).</i><br>If one of the above services<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">kissing, and the like</i> was the accepted mode of worship [of a particular deity] and a person performed this service as an act of worship,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">and not merely as an expression of emotion. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the addition of the words "as an act of worship," noting that in Halachah 5, the Rambam holds one liable for performing the service with which Pe'or or Marculis was worshiped, even though one's intent was to repudiate the idols. Thus, it appears that once a person performs a service which is the accepted mode of worship, his intent is no longer significant.<br>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> resolves this difficulty, explaining that the extent of liability is different. In the previous halachah, the offender was liable for a sin offering alone, while here,</i> he is liable [for execution].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">as stated in Halachah 2.</i>
If a splinter becomes stuck in a person's foot before an idol, he should not bend down to remove it, because it appears that he is bowing down to the idol.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 12a states that if the person turns his back or side to the idol, his bowing would not be considered to be an act of deference, and no prohibition is involved.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Even if no other people are present, this and the following prohibitions apply.

He resolves that difficulty, explaining that in Halachah 5, the person intended to throw the stone at the idol. Since that act constitutes worship of this deity, he is held liable. In contrast, in our halachah the person did not bow down to the idol at all. The only reason the bowing is prohibited is that a mistaken impression might be created.</i> Instead, he should sit down, and then pick it up.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> (ibid.) mentions a third prohibition, that a person should not bow down to drink from a spring that flows in front of an idol. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that Rav Yitzchak Alfasi also omits this law, and explains that it was not contained in their text of the Talmud. (This is somewhat unlikely, since it is found in Rabbenu Chanan'el's text of <i>Avodah Zarah</i>.)<br>The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1389) states that this law is included in the law mentioned in the following halachah.

He explains that since the craftsman fashions the idol on behalf of the person who commissioned him, he is considered to be the latter's agent. Therefore, the one who commissioned him is held responsible for his deed.<br>The commentaries question this explanation, noting that - with the exception of a few specific instances - the Torah never holds a person who commissions another individual to commit a sin liable, since the person who actually committed the sin is responsible for his actions. Also, the Rambam's phraseology here implies that one is held liable regardless whether the craftsman is a Jew or gentile, and a gentile is never given the halachic status of an agent.<br>The following are among the resolutions offered to this difficulty:a) A hired worker's actions - whether positive or negative - are always attributed to his employer (<i>Machaneh Efrayim, Hilchot Shutafim</i> 8).b) The verse prohibiting this act reveals that this is one of the few exceptions to the general rule mentioned above, and in this case, the person who commissioned the agent is held liable (<i>Darchei HaMelech</i>).c) Commenting on <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 13:2, the <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> explains that if it is possible to violate a particular prohibition by committing a deed, one is punished by lashes even when one violates it without committing a deed. The same concept can be applied here (<i>S'deh Chemed</i>).d) The deed for which one is punished is not the command to make the idol, but rather its purchase or acquisition (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>, Alfandari).</i> as [Exodus 20:5] states: "Do not make for yourself an idol or any representation."<br>Similarly,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The grammatical structure of this verse allows it to be interpreted, "Do not have an idol... made for you." <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 2) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 27) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> a person who actually fashions a false god for others, even for<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">gentile</i> idolaters,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">even when he merely acts as a craftsman and does not worship or believe in the idol himself.</i> is [punished by] lashing, as [Leviticus 19:4] states: "Do not make molten gods for yourselves."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 3) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 214) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> Accordingly, a person who actually fashions a false god for himself<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">violates both of the above prohibitions.

The Sages of the Talmud often established "fences around the Torah" - i.e., safeguards to prevent the violation of Torah law. (See <i>Avot</i> 1:1.) There is a question whether the Torah itself instituted prohibitions for such a purpose - i.e., are there mitzvot that are instituted without a self-contained goal of their own, but merely to prevent the violation of other prohibitions? (See <i>Lekach Tov</i> 8.)<br>From the Rambam's statements here (see also <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 7:8), it appears that he accepts such a premise.

The Hebrew words translated as "Do not make with Me..." can also be rendered, "Do not make Me..." - i.e., do not make images in the human form, the form in which God has revealed himself (<i>Siftei Cohen, Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:21).</i> Therefore, it is forbidden to make human images with wood, cement, or stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">or any other material.

Were these images forbidden, it would be unlikely that Moshe would have told the tribe to depict them. Even if the decree was instituted in the later generations, it is not probable that the Rabbis would forbid images that had previously been used for a Torah purpose.<br>The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:3) quotes the Rambam's opinion. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 141:13 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 141:8, however, note that the Rambam's statements which were quoted above (and the Ramah's statements) refer to a question whether one is allowed to keep images of the sun or moon that he finds. Here, the question is whether one is allowed to make such images oneself. From the discussion of the question in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43b, where the Sages question how Rabban Gamliel possessed forms of the moon, it would appear that there is a prohibition against making images of the sun and the moon themselves.<br>This interpretation, however, is also somewhat problematic, because the Rambam writes that there is no prohibition against making images of animals, and some of the constellations of the Zodiac are represented and referred to as animals. For example, one of the Zodiac constellations is a fish and <i>Gittin</i> 36a describes Rav as making a drawing of a fish. Another is a lion, which is one of the most popular images found in Jewish art.</i> or the angels,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3-5, the angels have no body or form. Hence, here, he is obviously referring to a form which a man has conceived of as appropriate for a particular angel. Alternatively, it could refer to the metaphoric imagery used by the prophets.</i> as [implied by Exodus, ibid.]: "Do not make with Me [gods of silver...]"<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam (quoting <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.) mentions the above Biblical proof-text in connection with this prohibition. It would appear, however, from the fact that making such images is not punishable by lashes, that the prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature. The reference to the verse must be understood as an <i>asmachta</i> (use of the Biblical verse as a support for a Rabbinic decree).</i> - i.e., do not make images of<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">those who are "with Me" - i.e.,</i> My servants, those who serve before Me<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the celestial beings and the angels. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 1, and <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3.)</i> on high. This [prohibition]<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">is more severe than the prohibition against making human images, and</i> applies even [to pictures] on tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam's statements in his Commentary on the Mishnah, the difference between the prohibition against making these images and those of humans can be explained as follows: The prohibition against making human statues is Biblical in origin and is defined by the Torah itself. In contrast, the prohibition of making images of the celestial beings was a safeguard instituted by the Rabbis against Greek and Roman culture. It, therefore, applies to all images, whether pictures or statues, because both could influence people to stray from the Torah's ways.<br>According to the simple interpretation of the terms "sun" and "moon," the difference can be explained as follows: The sun and the moon, as we perceive them, appear against the background of the sky. Therefore, for a representation of them to be forbidden, it also need not protrude (<i>Tosafot, 14Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).</i><br>The images of animals and other living beings<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">with the exception of men - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 42b also mentions a prohibition against making the image of a <i>d'rakon</i> which Rashi and others interpret as an animal similar to a serpent.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam describes this image as a fishlike man with fins and many scales, probably referring to the Greek god Neptune.</i> - with the exception of men - and similarly, the images of trees, grasses, and the like may be fashioned. This<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">leniency</i> applies even to images which protrude.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">From these two halachot, particularly according to the Rambam's understanding as reflected in his Commentary on the Mishnah, we see that there is no conflict between Torah law and aesthetics. There are only two restrictions: realistic human statues (and according to some authorities, these must be complete, full-bodied statues) and depictions of pagan gods. Even according to the other opinions which forbid depictions of the sun, the moon, and the like, there is no prohibition against abstract portrayals of these entities. No other restrictions apply at all.<br>There is definitely a divergence between the approach to life that spawned much of the art forms of Western culture and a Torah lifestyle. Perhaps for that reason, many religious Jews have traditionally shunned participation in and patronage of the arts. In the present generation, however, a number of our Torah leaders have urged religious artists to dedicate themselves to expressing Torah ideas and values in a variety of art forms, explaining that:a) Through these media, it is possible to reach many Jews who might never enter a synagogue or Torah center;b) Everything in the world was created to be used by the Jews for a Torah purpose (Rashi, Genesis 1:1 . This also applies to art. Using these art forms for Torah purposes expresses the true intent for their creation and endows them with a depth of meaning and inspiration - and in its deepest sense, a new wellspring of creativity.<br>According to Kabbalah, God's presence is more manifest in the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferet</i> ("Beauty") than in any other <i>sefirah</i>. Thus, the challenge confronting a Torah artist today is to use beauty as a medium to express Godly truth.</i>

Chapter 4

Those who lead [the inhabitants of] a Jewish city astray are executed by stoning, even though they themselves did not worship a false deity, but [merely] proselytized to the inhabitants of their city until they worshiped it.<br>The inhabitants of the city that has been led astray (עיר הנדחת) are executed by decapitation if they worshiped a false deity or accepted it as a god.<br>What is the source that serves as a warning against proselytizing on behalf of a false deity? "Let not [the name of another deity] be heard through your mouth."
A city is not condemned as an עיר הנדחת until two or more individuals attempt to lead its inhabitants astray, as [Deuteronomy 13:14] states: "Unfaithful people have emerged...." The people who lead them astray must be from that tribe and from that city, as [the verse continues]: "from your midst."<br>Those led astray must be the majority [of the city's inhabitants]. They must number from [at least] 100 to the majority of the tribe. If, however, the majority of the tribe is led astray, they are judged as individuals, as implied by [the phrase in the following verse]: "the inhabitants of the city;" neither a small village nor a large metropolis. If there are fewer than 100, it is considered a small village. If the majority of the tribe is involved, it is considered to be a large metropolis.<br>Similarly, the laws applying to an עיר הנדחת are not enforced if:<br>the people who led them astray were women or minors,<br>they were led astray by a single individual,<br>a minority of the city were led astray,<br>they turned to idols on their own initiative, or<br>if those who led them astray came from outside the city.<br>Instead, [the violators] are considered to be individuals who worshiped false deities. All those who worshiped are executed by stoning, and their estate is given to their heirs like all others executed by a court.
The laws of an עיר הנדחת are enforced only by a court of 71 judges, as [implied by Deuteronomy 17:5]: "And you shall take the man or woman who did that wicked thing to your gates." [This can be interpreted to mean:] Individuals are executed by the courts which are found at the gates [of every city]. A multitude are only executed by the supreme court.
None of the cities of refuge can ever be condemned as an עיר הנדחת, as [implied by Deuteronomy 13:13]: "one of your cities." [Similarly,] Jerusalem can never be condemned as an עיר הנדחת, because it was not divided among the tribes.<br>A border city is never condemned as an עיר הנדחת, so that gentiles will not enter and destroy <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. One court should not condemn three cities located next to each other as an עיר הנדחת. If [the cities] are separated from each other, they may condemn them.
[A city] is not condemned as an עיר הנדחת unless those who proselytize [the inhabitants] address them in the plural, telling them, "Let us go and worship," "Let us go and sacrifice," "Let us go and bring a burnt offering," "Let us go and offer a libation," "Let us go and bow down," or "Let us go and accept [the deity] as a god."<br>[The inhabitants] must listen and then worship [the deity] with its accepted mode of worship, or through one of the four modes of worship [mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 3], or accept it as a god.<br>What happens if all these conditions are not fulfilled with regard to a city or those who proselytize [its inhabitants]? Warnings are given to each person who worships false gods, and testimony [is delivered against them]. They are executed by stoning as individuals who worshiped false gods, and their estate is given to their heirs.
What is the judgment rendered against an עיר הנדחת when all the criteria for that judgment have been met?<br>The supreme Sanhedrin sends [emissaries] who investigate and probe until they have established clear proof that the entire city - or the majority of its inhabitants - have turned to the worship of false gods.<br>Afterwards, they send two Torah sages to warn them and to motivate them to repentance. If they repent, it is good. If they continue their wicked ways, the court commands the entire Jewish people to take up arms against them. They lay siege to the city and wage war against it until the city falls.<br>When the city falls, very many courts are set up, and [the inhabitants] are judged. All those people against whom two witnesses testify that they worshiped a false deity after receiving a warning are separated. If those who worshiped [the false deity] constitute only a minority [of the city's inhabitants], they are stoned to death, but the rest of the city is saved. If they constitute a majority, they are brought to the supreme Sanhedrin and their judgment is concluded there. All those who worshiped [the false deity] are executed by decapitation.<br>If the entire city was led astray, all of the inhabitants including the women and the children are slain by the sword. If a majority of the inhabitants were led astray, the transgressors' wives and children are slain by the sword. Whether the entire city or only a majority of its inhabitants were led astray, those who proselytized [on behalf of the false deity] are stoned to death.<br>All the property within it is collected within its main street. If it does not have a main street, a main street is made for it. If its main street is located outside its confines, its wall is extended until its [main street] is included within its confines, as [implied by Deuteronomy 13:17]: "[Gather all its goods] in the midst of its main street."<br>All live animals that are contained within are slain. All its property and the city [as a whole] are burned with fire. Burning them fulfills a positive commandment, as [the verse continues]: "Burn the city and all its goods entirely."
The property of the righteous men - i.e., the remainder of the city's inhabitants who were not led astray with the majority - that is located within the city should be burned together with all its property. Since they resided there, their fortunes are destroyed.<br>Whoever derives even the slightest benefit from [the city's property] receives a single measure of lashes, as [Deuteronomy 13:18] states: "Let nothing that has been condemned remain in your possession."
[The following rules apply when] the witnesses who testified against an עיר הנדחת were disqualified as <i>zomemim</i>: Whoever takes possession of any property is considered to have acquired it and may derive benefit from it, since the [incriminating testimony - and thus, the judgment based upon it -] has been nullified.<br>Why do they acquire it? Because each of the city's inhabitants gave up ownership of his property after the judgment was rendered.<br>[An עיר הנדחת] may never be rebuilt, and a person who rebuilds it is [liable for] lashes, as [Deuteronomy 13:17] states: "...never to be rebuilt." It is permitted to use it for gardens and orchards. "Never to be rebuilt" implies only that it should not be rebuilt as a city, as it was previously.
[The following laws apply to] a caravan which journeys from one place to another, passes through an עיר הנדחת, and is led astray with it: If they had remained [in the city] thirty days, they are executed by decapitation and their property is condemned. If they were there for a lesser period, they are executed by stoning, but their property is given to their heirs.
Property belonging to people of other cities which is kept within [an עיר הנדחת] is not burned, but rather is returned to its owners. [This applies] even when [the inhabitants of the עיר הנדחת] accepted responsibility for it, as implied by [Deuteronomy 13:17]: "its goods" - i.e., its goods, and not those belonging to others.<br>[The following rules apply to] property belonging to the wicked - i.e., those who were swayed [to idol worship] - which was kept in other cities. If [that property] was gathered together with the property of the עיר הנדחת, they are burned together. If not, it is not destroyed, but rather is given to the heirs.
If an animal which partially belongs to [an inhabitant of] an עיר הנדחת and partially belongs to [a person living in] another city is found within [the עיר הנדחת], it is forbidden. [In contrast,] a loaf of bread which is owned by such [partners] is permitted, because it can be divided.
It is forbidden to benefit from an animal which belongs to [an inhabitant of] an עיר הנדחת and which was slaughtered, just as it is forbidden to derive benefit from an ox which was condemned to be stoned and was slaughtered.<br>We are permitted to benefit from the hair of both men and women of [the condemned city]. A wig, however, is considered part of "its goods," and is therefore forbidden.
Produce which is connected [to its source of nurture] is permitted, as [implied by Deuteronomy 13:17]: "Gather [all its goods...] Burn..." - i.e., this includes only those articles which must merely be gathered and burned, and thus excludes produce which is still connected [to its source of nurture], and would have to be severed and gathered in order to be burned.<br>The same principle applies to [the inhabitants'] hair. Needless to say, the trees themselves are permitted and are bequeathed to the heirs.<br>[The following rules apply to] the consecrated property within it: Those animals which were consecrated to be sacrificed on the altar themselves must die, since "the sacrifices of the wicked are an abomination" [Proverbs 21:27]. Property which is consecrated for the purposes of the Temple must be redeemed, and afterwards is burned, [as implied by the word] "its goods" - its goods and not those which are consecrated.
[The following rules apply to] firstborn animals and the animal tithes that are found within [the עיר הנדחת]: Those that are unblemished are considered to be animals consecrated to be sacrificed on the altar and must die. Those that are blemished are considered to be "its animals," and are slain [with them].<br>[The following rules apply to] <i>terumah</i> which is contained within the city: If it has already been given to a priest, it should be allowed to rot, because it is considered his private property. If it is still in the possession of an Israelite, it should be given to a priest in another city, because it is considered to be "the property of heaven," and its consecrated nature extends to its actual substance.
The second tithe, money used to redeem the second tithe, and sacred writings in it must be entombed.
Anyone who administers the judgment of an עיר הנדחת is considered as if he offered a burnt offering consumed entirely by fire, as [Deuteronomy 13:17] states: "...entirely for the sake of God, your Lord." Furthermore, such action diverts [Divine] wrath from the Jews, as [the following verse continues]: "so that God's fierce anger will be allayed," and it brings them blessing and mercy [as the verse] states: "And He will grant you mercy. He will deal mercifully with you and will make you flourish."

Chapter 5

A person who proselytizes [a <i>mesit</i>] to any single Jew [a <i>musat</i>] - whether man or woman - on behalf of false deities should be stoned to death. [This applies] even if neither the <i>mesit</i> or the <i>musat</i> actually worshiped the false deity.<br>As long as he instructed him to worship [the false deity], he should be executed by stoning, regardless of whether the <i>mesit</i> was a prophet or an ordinary person, or whether the <i>musat</i> was a single individual - man or woman - or whether several people were proselytized.
A person who proselytizes the majority of the inhabitants of a city is called a <i>madiach</i> rather than a <i>mesit</i>. If the person who leads the majority of a city astray is a prophet, he is executed by stoning, and the people who were led astray are judged as individuals, and are not considered to be inhabitants of an עיר הנדחת. [For the latter laws to be applied,] two people must proselytize them.<br>If a person says: "A false deity told me: 'Serve me,'" or "The Holy One, blessed be He, told me: 'Serve a false deity'" - he is considered a prophet who leads others astray. If the majority of the city's inhabitants are swayed by his words, he should be stoned to death.<br>A <i>mesit</i> should be stoned to death whether he proselytizes in plural terms or in singular. What is implied? He is considered a <i>mesit</i> if he tells a colleague, "I will worship a false deity. [Follow me.] I will go and worship..." or "Let us go and worship following the particular rite with which that deity is served," "I will slaughter. [Follow me.] I will go and slaughter..." or "Let us go and slaughter," "I will bring a burnt offering. [Follow me.] I will go and bring a burnt offering..." or "Let us go and bring a burnt offering," "I will offer a libation. [Follow me.] I will go and offer a libation..." or "Let us go and offer a libation," or "I will bow down. [Follow me.] I will go and bow down..." or "Let us go and bow down."<br>When a person proselytizes two individuals, they may serve as witnesses against him. They should summon him to court and testify against him, relating what he told them, and the <i>mesit</i> is stoned.
A <i>mesit</i> does not need a warning.<br>If one proselytizes a single individual, the latter should tell him, "I have friends who would also be interested in this," and thus he should lure him into proselytizing before two people, so that the <i>mesit</i> can be executed.<br>If the <i>mesit</i> refuses to proselytize before two people, it is a mitzvah to set a trap for him. A trap is never set for a person who violates any of the Torah's other prohibitions. This is the only exception.<br>How is the trap set for him? The <i>musat</i> should bring two people and place them in a dark place where they can see the <i>mesit</i> and hear what he is saying without his seeing them. He tells the <i>mesit</i>: "Repeat what you told me privately."<br>[When] he does so, the <i>musat</i> should reply: "How can we forsake our God in heaven and serve wood and stone?" If [the <i>mesit</i>] retracts or remains silent, he is not held liable. If he tells him, "This is our obligation and this is beneficial to us," those who stand far off have him summoned to court and stoned.
It is a mitzvah for the <i>musat</i> to kill [the <i>mesit</i>], as [Deuteronomy 13:10] states: "Your hand must be the first against him to kill him."<br>It is forbidden for the <i>musat</i> to love the <i>mesit</i>, as [the previous verse states]: "Do not be attracted to him." Since [Exodus 23:5] states with regard to an enemy: "You must surely help him," [the question arises:] Perhaps you should help a <i>mesit</i>? The Torah [Deuteronomy, ibid.] teaches, "Do not... listen to him."<br>Since [Leviticus 19:16] teaches: "Do not stand idly over your brother's blood," [the question arises:] Perhaps you should not stand idly over a <i>mesit's</i> blood? The Torah teaches, [Deuteronomy, ibid.] "Do not let your eyes pity him."<br>The <i>musat</i> is forbidden to advance any arguments on his behalf, as [the verse continues,] "Do not show him any compassion." If he knows incriminating evidence, he is not permitted to remain silent, as [the verse continues,] "Do not try to cover up for him."<br>What is the verse which serves as a warning against a common person proselytizing as a <i>mesit</i>? "And all Israel will hear and they will become afraid [and they will not continue to do such evil things]" (Deuteronomy 13:12 .
[The following rules apply to] a person who proselytizes others by telling them to worship him: Should he tell them: "Worship me," and they worship him, he should be stoned. If they did not worship him, even though they accepted and agreed to his statements, he is not liable for stoning.<br>In contrast, if he proselytizes by telling them to worship another man or another false deity, [different rules apply:] If they accept his statements and say, "We will go and worship," even if they have not actually worshiped, both of them - the <i>mesit</i> and the <i>musat</i> - should be stoned. [Deuteronomy 13:9] states: "Do not be attracted to him or listen to him." Thus, if one was attracted and listened, one is held liable.
What is meant by [the expression], a prophet who prophesies in the name of false gods? A person who says: "This false deity or this star told me that we are commanded to do such and such or to refrain from doing so." [This applies] even when he stated the law accurately, labeling the impure as impure and the pure as pure.<br>If a warning was given to him [beforehand], he is executed by strangulation, as [Deuteronomy 18:20] states: "And one who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die." The warning against this [transgression] is included in the statement, [Exodus 23:13:] "And you shall not mention the name of other gods."
It is forbidden to enter into a discussion or a debate with one who prophesies in the name of a false deity. We may not ask him to perform a sign or wonder, and if he does so on his own accord, we should pay no attention to it nor think about it. Whoever contemplates about the wonders [he performed, thinking], "Perhaps they are true," violates a negative commandment, as [Deuteronomy 13:4] states: "Do not listen to the words of that prophet."<br>Similarly, a false prophet should be executed by strangulation. [He is to be executed] although he speaks in the name of God and neither adds to nor diminishes [the mitzvot], as [Deuteronomy 18:20] states: "However, the prophet who dares to speak a matter in My name which I did not command - that prophet shall die."
[The category of] a false prophet includes:<br>a) one who "prophesies" regarding something that was never heard through prophetic vision;<br>b) one who "prophesies" about a subject which he heard from another prophet, saying that this prophecy was given to him.<br>[Both of these individuals] are to be executed by strangulation.
Anyone who refrains from executing a false prophet because of the latter's [spiritual] level, [as expressed by] his adherence to the paths of prophecy, violates a negative commandment, as [Deuteronomy 18:22] states: "Do not fear him." Similarly, included within [the scope of the prohibition:] "Do not fear him" are one who withholds incriminating testimony against [a false prophet] and one who is afraid or in awe of his words.<br>A false prophet may be tried only by the [supreme] court of 71 judges.
A person who makes a vow or takes an oath in the name of a false deity is [liable for] lashes, as [Exodus 23:13] states: "And you shall not mention the name of other gods."<br>[This applies] both to one who takes such an oath for his own reasons and to one who takes such an oath because of a gentile. It is forbidden to have a gentile take an oath on his deity. It is even forbidden to mention the name of a gentile deity without any connection to an oath, as [implied by the expression], "You shall not mention."
A person should not tell a colleague: "Wait for me near a particular false deity," or the like.<br>It is permitted to mention the name of any false deity that is mentioned in the Bible - e.g., Peor, Ba'al, Nevo, Gad, and the like. It is forbidden to cause others to take oaths or vows in the name of false deities. [In regard to all these prohibitions,] the only [transgressor] liable for lashes is one who [himself] makes a vow or an oath in the name [of a false deity].

Chapter 6

Anyone who willingly, as a conscious act of defiance, performs the deeds associated with an <i>ov</i> or a <i>yid'oni</i> is liable for <i>karet</i>. If witnesses were present and warned him, he should be stoned to death. If he performed these actions inadvertently, he must bring a fixed sin offering.<br>What do the deeds associated with an <i>ov</i> involve? A person stands up and offers an incense offering of known content. He holds a wand of myrtle in his hand and waves it while whispering a known incantation in a hushed tone. [This continues] until the person making the inquiry hears a voice, as if another person is speaking to him and replying to his questions. It appears as if the words are coming from below the earth in a very low tone, to the extent that it cannot be perceived by the ear, but only sensed by thought.<br>Similarly, among the deeds associated with an <i>ov</i> is taking the skull of a corpse, offering incense, and chanting incantations until one hears a voice in a very low tone emanating from his armpits and replying [to his questions]. Anyone who performs one of these acts should be stoned to death.
What do the deeds associated with a <i>yid'oni</i> involve? A person places a bone from a bird whose name is <i>yidua</i> in his mouth, offers incense, and performs other deeds until he falls into a trance, [losing self-control] like an epileptic, and relates events which will occur in the future.<br>All of these are types of idol worship. What is the source for the warning against them? [Leviticus 19:31]: "Do not turn to the <i>ovot</i> or the <i>yid'onim</i>."
Anyone who willingly, as a conscious act of defiance, gives of his progeny to <i>Molech</i> is liable for <i>karet</i>. If he did so inadvertently, he must bring a fixed sin offering. If witnesses were present and warned him, he should be stoned to death, as [Leviticus 20:2] states: "Whoever gives of his progeny to <i>Molech</i> will surely die. The people will stone him."<br>Which verse serves as a warning for this [prohibition]? "Do not give of your progeny to <i>Molech</i>" [Leviticus 18:21]. Also, further on [Deuteronomy 18:10] states: "There shall not be found among you one who passes his son or daughter through fire."<br>What was done? A person would kindle a great fire and then take some of his progeny and give them to the priests who serve the fire. After the child was given to them, the priests return the son to his father to pass him through the fire at his will. The father of the child is the one who passes his child through the fire with the priests' permission. He passes him through the fire from one side to the other [while carrying him, the father walking on] his feet in the midst of the flames.<br>Thus, [the father] does not cremate his son to <i>Molech</i>, as sons and daughters are cremated in the worship of other deities. Rather, this form of worship called <i>Molech</i> involved merely passing [the child through the fire]. Therefore, if one performed this service to a deity other than <i>Molech</i>, one is not liable.
One is not liable for <i>karet</i> or stoning until one gives over his son to <i>Molech</i>, passing him through the fire as he carries him. If he gives him over, but does not pass him through the flames, or passes him through the flames without giving him over, or gives him over and passes him through the flames, but does not carry him, he is not held liable.<br>He is not held liable until he gives over some of his progeny and leaves some of his progeny, as [implied by Leviticus 20:3]: "For he gave of his progeny to <i>Molech</i>" - i.e., some [of his progeny] and not his entire [progeny].
[The prohibition against giving one's progeny to <i>Molech</i> includes:] both progeny of legitimate pedigree and illegitimate pedigree, sons and daughters, children and grandchildren. One is liable for giving over any of one's descendants, because they are all included in the term "progeny."<br>In contrast, if one passed one's brothers, sisters, or ancestors [through the fire] or if one caused oneself to be passed through the fires, one is not held liable. A person who passes one of his progeny [through the fire] while he is sleeping or blind is not liable.
A monument which the Torah has forbidden is a structure around which people gather. [This prohibition applies] even [when it was constructed] for the service of God, because this is a pagan practice, as [Deuteronomy 16:22] states: "Do not erect a monument which God hates." Whoever erects a monument is [liable for] lashes.<br>Similarly, [a person who bows down on] the kneeling stone mentioned in the Torah receives lashes - even if he prostrates oneself upon it to God - as [Leviticus 26:1] states: "Do not place a kneeling stone in your land to prostrate yourself upon it." The pagans would customarily place a stone before a false deity so that they could prostrate themselves upon it. Therefore, this practice is not followed in the worship of God.<br>A person is not [liable for] lashes until he spreads out his hands and feet on the stone, thus prostrating himself on it entirely. This is what the Torah means by bowing.
Where does the [prohibition mentioned above] apply? Every place outside the Temple. In the Temple, however, it is permitted to bow down to God on stone.<br>This concept is derived as follows: [Leviticus, ibid.] states: "Do not place... in your land." "In your land," it is forbidden to prostrate oneself on stones. You may, however, prostrate yourself on hewn stones in the Temple.<br>For this reason, it is a universally accepted custom among the Jewish people to place mats, straw, or hay in synagogues that are paved with stones, to separate between their faces and the stones. If it is impossible to find anything to separate between them and the stones, the person should go to another place to prostrate himself, or lie on his side, so that he will not press his face to the stone.
A person who prostrates himself to God upon paved stones without spreading out his hands and feet is not [liable for] lashes. He is, however, punished by "blows for rebelliousness." In contrast, one who prostrates himself to a false deity should be stoned to death, whether or not he spreads out his hands and feet. As soon as he buries his face in the ground [he is liable].
A person who plants a tree near the altar or anywhere in the Temple courtyard - regardless of whether it is a fruit-bearing tree or not - is [liable for] lashes, as [Deuteronomy 16:21] states: "Do not plant an <i>asherah</i> or any other tree near the altar of God, your Lord." [This prohibition applies] even when he did so to beautify the Temple and make it more attractive.<br>[The reason for this prohibition is] that this was a pagan practice. They would plant trees near their altars so that people would gather there.
It is forbidden to construct a porch made of wood in the Temple as one would do in one's courtyard. Even though [the wood would be affixed] within the structure and not planted within the ground. This is an extra restriction, as [implied by the words:] "any other tree" [in the verse cited above]. Instead, all the porches and structures which protruded from the walls within the sanctuary were of stone and not of wood.

Statues of false deities<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Statues of false deities - Our text follows the published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The words "of false deities" and several of the other points in this halachah appear to be printer's additions, which are not found in the authoritative manuscripts and run contrary to the explanation of these concepts in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:2). Note also the apparent contradiction mentioned in our commentary on Halachah 5.<br>Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:2 does not mention "idols," but "statues."</i> which are found discarded in the marketplace or in a scrap metal heap are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 41a-b explains this law as follows. The Mishnah uses the expression "statues" - i.e., a statue which we do not know that it has been worshiped. Shmuel, one of the Talmudic sages, adds, however, that the leniency also applies to idols which we know were worshiped.<br>His decision is based on the principle (Chapter 8, Halachah 8) that if the gentiles who worship an idol no longer consider it a god, the prohibition against benefiting from it is nullified. In this instance, the fact that these statues were found discarded is the clearest proof that their worshipers forsook them.<br>Afterwards, the Talmud quotes a difference of opinion between Rabbi Yochanan and Resh Lakish, concerning idols which are broken accidentally. In the context of the explanation of that difference of opinion, the Talmud mentions the explanation of the Mishnah in question by Rabbi Yochanan (whom the halachah follows, see Chapter 8, Halachah 11). He explains that the pieces of the statues (not idols) are permitted because we are not sure that they were ever worshiped. Even if they have been worshiped, it is possible that they were nullified.<br>Thus, according to the Talmud, the interpretation of these laws is as follows: If one finds an idol that was obviously purposefully broken (Shmuel's law), it is permitted to benefit from it. If, however, the idol was not destroyed with an obvious destructive intent, it is forbidden to benefit from it, as Rabbi Yochanan states.</i> Needless to say, this applies to pieces of statues.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that they were broken would appear to indicate that their worshipers nullified them.<br>In contrast, should one find a hand, a foot, or another limb from the form of one of the constellations or celestial signs - The phrase, "from the form of one of the constellations or celestial signs," is a printer's addition, which runs contrary to the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.

Indeed, in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 16:10, when discussing the prohibitions of a דבר חשוב (a forbidden substance whose importance prevents it from ever being nullified in a mixture), the Rambam himself appears to follow this view, stating:<br>If one pomegranate from a mixture [containing a forbidden pomegranate] falls together with two other pomegranates... and from these three, one pomegranate falls together with other pomegranates, the latter [mixture] is permitted.<br>Indeed, on the basis of the statements in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) deviates from the Rambam's opinion and requires three mixtures.<br>This approach, however, is not followed by all commentaries. Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) explain that even with regard to a דבר חשוב, only two mixtures are necessary. These views are quoted as halachah by the <i>Turei Zahav</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> in their glosses on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:8).<br>Among the suggestions made by the commentaries to resolve the difference between the Rambam's statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> are the following:a) Most people are careful regarding the prohibition against benefiting from any object connected with idol worship. Therefore, there is no need to reinforce the prohibition. In contrast, the prohibition against benefiting from a דבר חשוב is far less known. Hence, the Rabbis added severe safeguards to make sure that it be observed (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).b) Here, the Rambam is speaking about a prohibition against benefiting from a forbidden object (איסור הנאה). In contrast, <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> is concerned with partaking of forbidden foods, where the prohibition is more severe (<i>Siftei Cohen</i>, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:52).<br>Even the authorities who permit the second mixture to be used do not allow a single individual to partake of the entire mixture at one time. In such an instance, there would be only a single doubt whether he used the forbidden object or not.<br>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, 74b) mentioned another example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:<br><b>Should a ring [used to adorn] an idol become mixed together with one hundred other rings, and -</b> they would thus all be forbidden according to the above principles. However, if<br><b>then two of them fall -</b> accidentally. If one intentionally throws one into the sea, the leniency does not apply (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:7).<br><b>into the Mediterranean Sea -</b> and are thus lost.

(Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> comments that here, the Dead Sea is intended.)<br><b>it is permissible to use all of them. -</b> i.e., all the rings that remain. The prohibition does not continue to apply, because<br><b>We presume that the [forbidden] ring was among the two -</b> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that when stating a similar law in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:2, the Rambam required only a single barrel of wine to be lost. The difference between these two laws can be resolved by taking into account the nature of the prohibited substances: Rings are small, and the loss of a single ring does not make a substantial difference to the entire group. In contrast, barrels of wine are large, and the loss of even one will attract attention.<br>[which fell]. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) limits this leniency, stating that it is forbidden to use a single ring alone, nor may one person benefit from the entire group of rings at once.<br>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) mentioned a third example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:<br><b>Should [a forbidden ring] become mixed together with a hundred others and -</b> they would thus be forbidden according to the above principles.

Even if it had been included within that forty, perhaps the ring one chooses from the second mixture is not the forbidden one.<br>In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) does not accept the Rambam's view, and forbids the second mixture.

The Talmud explains that even though the shade of an <i>asherah</i> is forbidden, צל הצל, literally, "the shade of its shade," is permitted. The Jerusalem Talmud interprets 18לצ לצה as shade produced by the parts of the tree which would not touch the trunk if they fell.<br>[Rashi offers a different interpretation of <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.

Chicks which do not need their mother and nest in [an <i>asherah</i>] are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Even though these chicks are permitted, <i>Me'ilah</i> 14a does not allow one to climb up the tree and take them in a normal manner.

There, the Rambam specifically writes that when taking the nest - as stated in the final clause of this halachah - it permissible to climb up the tree in the normal manner. Therefore, it appears that one should knock down the chicks to see if they are capable of flying on their own or not. This explanation also clarifies why the Rambam does not mention in this halachah the need to knock down the chicks. By stating that only those which do not need their mother are permitted, he implies that one must determine whether or not the chicks need their mother (Rav Kapach).</i> In contrast, the chicks and eggs which need their mother are forbidden for the <i>asherah</i> is considered as if it is a base for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 42b explains that this is a Rabbinic decree imposed lest the people desire to benefit from the <i>asherah</i> itself.

It is forbidden to benefit from wood which one takes from it.

The coals and the heat produced by the initial fire, however, are not forbidden and one may bake with them. He does not make such statements here, because, as stated in Halachah 10, even the coals and ashes of an <i>asherah</i> are forbidden.<br>[Curiously, when mentioning these laws in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (142:4), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, substituting forbidden wood for <i>orlah</i>, without distinguishing between the different prohibitions. Accordingly the commentaries on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 145:5, <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 145:10) object to his decision.]</i> Afterwards, he should<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">remove the forbidden wood and</i> kindle it with other, permitted, wood and then bake within.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:9), the Rambam explains that the above decision applies whether the oven is new or old.<br>The Mishnah states that if such wood is used in a new oven, the oven may never be used again. In Talmudic times, the ovens were made of clay and the clay would not harden sufficiently until the oven was kindled once. Thus, since kindling the oven for the first time prepared it to be used on all subsequent occasions, some Rabbis forbade its use when this first kindling was made with a forbidden substance. This opinion is, nevertheless, not accepted as halachah. The Rambam's view is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i>, ibid.

How must one destroy a false deity<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The placement of this halachah appears problematic. On the surface, it would have been more appropriate to relate it after Chapter 7, Halachah 1, which mentions the commandment to destroy idol worship, or after the following halachah, which completes the description of the types of articles that are forbidden because of their association with idol worship.<br>Perhaps, since the prohibition against benefiting from the coating of an idol is considered to be a mitzvah in its own right, the Rambam concludes his discussion of the mitzvah to destroy prohibited articles before entering that subject (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).</i> and the other entities which are forbidden on its account<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., its accessories and offerings? - See Chapter 7, Halachot 2 and 9.</i> - e.g., its accessories and offerings?

This objection is not accepted, since the fertilizer is not the only factor causing the crops to grow (see the commentary on Chapter 7, Halachah 14, which describes the concept of 18הז םרוגáהזו), and it was not intentionally used for this purpose (<i>Tosafot, Avodah Zarah</i> 43a).</i> or burn them and deposit the ashes in the Dead Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See the commentary on Chapter 7, Halachah 5, which explains why the Dead Sea is mentioned.<br>The <i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i> cites <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 11:3, which states:<br>How must chametz be destroyed? It may be burned, crumbled and tossed to the wind, or thrown to the sea.<br>On this basis, he explains that there are three options to destroy a false deity: grinding and tossing it to the wind, burning (where the article must be destroyed), and throwing it into the Dead Sea. Since the Dead Sea is a barren place, which is not frequented by ships, the article need not be destroyed. Even if it is left whole, we assume that no benefit will come from it to man.<br>This interpretation is not accepted by all authorities. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) maintains that even an idol tossed into the Dead Sea must be destroyed first.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:15) mentions letting an idol sink "in the sea" (not "the Dead Sea"), without requiring that it be destroyed first. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (145:13) and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> (145:11), however, require an idol to be destroyed before it is deposited in any sea other than the Dead Sea.</i>

It therefore seeks to derive one of these laws from a different source. The Rambam, however, quotes the same phrase as the proof-text for both laws.<br><i>K'nesset HaGedolah</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explain - using this as an example for a principle that applies throughout the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> - that the Rambam's goal was to present the laws in the manner which it could be most easily appreciated by a reader, even if in doing so he did not follow all the principles of Biblical exegesis accepted by the Talmud.</i> [This command applies] only if they are treated as gods when they enter our possession.

Afterwards, he met a gentile adult and asked him to nullify it. He refused. Rabbi Elazar struck him and he nullified it.We learn from this three things: a) a gentile can nullify an idol whether it belongs to him or to his colleague; b) a gentile who is knowledgeable about idol worship can nullify it, while one who is not knowledgeable cannot nullify it; c) a gentile's nullification of idol worship is effective even if he is compelled to do so.<br>Neither a minor nor a fool is considered "knowledgeable about idol worship." hence, their nullification is not acceptable.<br>When a gentile is forced to nullify a false deity - whether it belongs to him or to other gentiles - even when he is forced to do so by Jews, the nullification is of consequence.<br>The gentile who nullifies idol worship must himself be an idolater. - It does not, however, matter whether the idolater worships the particular idol he nullifies or not.

(See also the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:3.)</i><br>When a false deity becomes broken in the course of nature, it is forbidden to benefit from its broken pieces until they have been nullified. Accordingly, when a person finds broken pieces of an idol, [he must regard them] as forbidden, lest the gentiles have not nullified them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 41b explains that although the possibility exists that the idol was nullified, we must still regard it as forbidden. Since it is recognized as an idol, the prohibition against using it becomes an established fact, which cannot be changed until we are certain that it has been nullified as an object of worship. (Note also our commentary on Chapter 7, Halachah 7.)</i><br>[The following principles apply to an idol] which comes in pieces: If it could be reassembled by an ordinary person,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">the fact that it is broken is not of consequence. Indeed, the laws which govern it are more stringent than if it remained whole.</i> each piece must be nullified individually.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">for each is considered to be a separate entity.</i> If [an ordinary person] could not reassemble it, once one has nullified one of its limbs, all of them are nullified.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since the idol is broken and cannot be reassembled by an ordinary person, it is treated more leniently, and if one part of it is nullified, the entire idol becomes permitted. In contrast to the Ra'avad and some other authorities, the Rambam does require that at least this minimal nullification be carried out. The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:11) follows the Rambam's view.</i>
Though an altar for idol worship has been damaged, it is still forbidden to benefit from it until the majority of it has been destroyed by gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 9, the nullification of false deities must be performed by gentiles.</i> A platform which has been damaged is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 53b relates that since a platform consists of only a single stone, if it is damaged another one will be brought to replace it.<br>Halachah 5 states that once an idol is removed from a stone, one is permitted to benefit from it. Thus, we are forced to say that this law is speaking about an instance where the stone is presently being used as a platform. It can be interpreted as applying when the damage happens as a matter of course. The Rambam is teaching us that even though the stone is being used as a platform at present, since it will soon be replaced, it is permitted. Alternatively, it is speaking about a stone which was originally hewn out to be used as a platform. In such an instance, the damage must be purposely caused by a gentile with the intention of nullifying the platform.</i><br>What is considered a platform, and what, an altar? A platform consists of a single stone; an altar, of many stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than differentiate between them because of the functions they serve, explaining that a platform is used to place idols upon, and an altar, to bring sacrifices, the Rambam (based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>,) considers size the determinant.</i><br>How are the stones of Marculis nullified?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned, a shrine to Marculis consists of three stones placed one on top of the other.</i> When one constructs a building from them or uses them to pave the roads or the like, it is permitted to benefit from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 50a relates that even Rabbi Menachem b'Rabbi Simai, who was called the son of the holy because he would not look at the image of a coin, lest it carry the form of an idol, would walk on such roads.</i><br>How is an <i>asherah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A tree which is worshiped or one which offers shade for an idol</i> nullified?

Chapter 9

It is forbidden to purchase or sell any durable entity to an idolater within three days of one of their holidays. [Similarly, within this period, it is forbidden] to borrow from them, to lend to them, to accept payment from them or to repay them for a loan that is supported by a promissory note or collateral. It is, however, permitted to collect a loan which is supported by a verbal commitment alone, because one is saving one's property from being lost to them.<br>It is permitted to sell them an entity which will not endure - e.g., vegetables, or a cooked dish - until the day of their festival.<br>When does the above apply? In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. In other lands, however, it is forbidden [to engage in such activities] only on the day of their festival itself.<br>If one transgressed and did business with them during these three days, one may derive benefit from the results of these transactions. When, however, one does business with them on the day of their festival itself, it is forbidden to benefit from the results of these transactions.
It is forbidden to send a present to a gentile on one of his holidays, unless one knows that he does not acknowledge or worship idols. Similarly, if a gentile sends a present to a Jew on one of [the gentile's] holidays, the Jew should not accept it. If, however, there is the possibility of ill-feeling arising, he should take it from him. Nevertheless, he should not derive any benefit from it until he finds out that the gentile does not acknowledge or worship idols.
If the idolaters' festival lasts several days - whether three, four, or ten - all the days [of the festival] are considered as a single day. [Carrying out transactions] on any of these days, or on the three days preceding them, is forbidden.
The Canaanites are idol worshipers, and Sunday is their festival. Accordingly, in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is forbidden to conduct transactions with them on Thursday and Friday each and every week, and, needless to say, on Sunday itself, when transactions with them are forbidden everywhere.
The day on which the idolaters gather together to crown a king and offer sacrifice and praise to their false deities is considered to be one of their holidays, since it is comparable to their other holidays. In contrast, on a day which is celebrated by an individual idolater as a festival on which he gives thanks and praise to the star he [worships] - for example, his birthday, the day on which he shaves his beard or hair, the day on which he returns from a sea-voyage, the day on which he leaves prison, the day on which he makes a [wedding] feast for his son, and the like - it is forbidden [to do business] on that particular day only with that individual man.<br>Similarly, when [it is customary] that the day on which one of them dies is marked with festivities, it is forbidden [to do business] with those individuals on that day. Whenever [a person's] death is marked by the burning of his utensils and the offering of incense, we can assume that idol worship is [involved in the ritual].<br>The [above] prohibition applies only to those who worship [the false deity]. In contrast, it is permitted to do business with those who join in the celebrations by eating, drinking, and observing it as a matter of custom or in deference to the king.
Articles which are distinguished by their use [in the worship] of one of the false deities in a particular locale may never be sold to the worshipers of that deity in that locale. Articles which are not characterized by such uniqueness may be sold to them without enquiring [about the purpose for which they will be used].<br>If, however, an idolater specifically states that he is purchasing the article for the sake of idol worship, it is forbidden to sell it to him unless one blemishes it in a manner which disqualifies it for use as an offering to the idol. An animal lacking a limb is not offered as a sacrifice to an idol.
It is permitted to sell articles which are distinguished [by their use in the worship of a false deity] that are mixed together with articles that are not used for such purposes - e.g., pure frankincense with black frankincense - without enquiring [about the purpose for which they will be used]. We do not suspect that [the purchaser] will separate the pure frankincense to use for idol worship. The same applies in other similar situations.
Just as it is forbidden to sell idolaters articles that assist them in idol worship, it is forbidden to sell them articles that can cause harm to many people - for example, bears, lions, weapons, fetters, and chains. [Similarly,] it is forbidden to sharpen their weapons.<br>Everything that is forbidden to be sold to idolaters is also forbidden to be sold to a Jew who is suspect that he will sell to idolaters. Similarly, it is forbidden to sell dangerous objects to a Jewish thief.
When the Jews dwell among the idolaters and have established a covenant with them, it is permissible to sell weapons to the servants of the king and his to his soldiers, because they use them to wage war against the enemies of the country and to protect it. Thus, they also protect us, for we dwell among them.<br>It is permitted to walk around a city in which an idol is located. It is, however, forbidden to enter [the city]. If the idol is located outside the city, it is permitted to walk within it.
A person who is journeying from one place to another may not pass through a city in which a false deity is located.<br>When does this apply? When this is the only way to his destination. If, however, there is an alternate route to his destination and, by chance, he took [the route which passed through this city], it is permissible.
It is forbidden to build - [even] together with an idolater - a dome under which an idol is placed. If one transgressed and built such a structure, however, one's wage is permitted. <i>A priori</i>, one may construct the palace or the courtyard where that dome is located.
[The following laws apply] when an idol is located within a city and there some shops which are adorned and some which are not: It is forbidden to benefit from those which are adorned or [to use] anything they contain, since we can assume that they were adorned for the sake of idol worship. It is permitted to benefit from those which are not adorned.<br>It is forbidden to do business with a store owned by a false deity, because one offers benefit to the false deity.
When a person sells his house to an idol, it is forbidden to benefit from the proceeds of the sale. Rather, they must be taken to the Dead Sea. If, however, an idolater steals a Jew's house against his will and places an idol within, it is permitted [to accept whatever] money [he offers]. [The Jew] may compose [a bill of sale] and formalize it in accordance with the civil law procedures.
Flutes belonging to idolaters should not be used in a funeral dirge.<br>One may attend a pagan commercial fair and purchase livestock, gentile servants and maidservants before they convert, houses, fields, and vineyards. One may compose a bill of sale and formalize it in accordance with the civil law procedures, since by doing so one saves [one's property] from them.<br>When does the above apply? When one buys from a private individual who does not have to pay a tax [to the false deity]. If, however, one buys from a merchant, it is forbidden, for a merchant must pay a tax which must be given to the false deity. Hence, [by making such a purchase], one is giving benefit to a false deity.<br>[The following laws apply] if one transgressed and purchased [merchandise] from a merchant: If one purchased livestock, one should cut off the animal's hooves from below the anklebone. If one purchased garments or other objects, one should let them rot. If one purchased money or metal utensils, one should bring them to the Dead Sea. If one purchased a servant, one may not help him up [from a pit], nor should one push him into one.
When an idolater makes a [wedding] party for his son or daughter, it is forbidden to benefit from the feast. It is even forbidden for a Jew to eat and drink his own food there, since it is being consumed at a celebration of idolaters.<br>When is it forbidden to eat such an idolater's food? From when he began to prepare for the wedding feast, the entire duration of the wedding feast, and for thirty days afterwards. [Furthermore,] if he makes another celebration because of the wedding even after thirty days have passed, it is forbidden [to participate] until twelve months [have passed].<br>This stringency was imposed because of idol worship, as [implied by Exodus 34:15-16]: "And he shall call to you and you shall eat from his slaughter, and you shall choose from his daughters for your sons. His daughters will stray after their gods, and they will lead your sons astray after these gods."
A Jewish woman should not nurse the child of an idolater, since, by doing so, she raises a son who will be an idolater. She should not serve as a midwife for an idolatrous woman [without charge]. She may, however, do so for a fee, lest strife arise.<br>An idolatrous woman may serve as a midwife for a Jewess and nurse her child. [This must be done] in premises belonging to a Jew, lest the idolatrous woman kill the child.
It is forbidden to trade with [gentiles] on their way to reproachful places of idol worship, but it is permitted to trade with them when they return. This applies when they do not journey in a caravan. If, however, they are traveling in a caravan, they may change their mind and return.<br>If a Jew journeys to a reproachful place of idol worship, one may trade with him on his way, since he may change his mind. On his way back, it is forbidden. [It is forbidden to trade with] an apostate Jew on his way there and on his way back.
When a Jew attends a fair of idol worshipers it is forbidden to trade with him when he returns. Perhaps he sold an idol to them, and it is forbidden to benefit from the proceeds of the sale of idol worship possessed by a Jew.<br>It is, however, permitted to benefit from [the proceeds of the sale of an idol] possessed by an idolater. Therefore, it is permitted to trade with an idolater coming from such a fair, but not with a Jew. It is forbidden to trade with an apostate Jew on his way to and on his way from such a fair.

Chapter 10

We may not draw up a covenant with idolaters which will establish peace between them [and us] and yet allow them to worship idols, as [Deuteronomy 7:2] states: "Do not establish a covenant with them." Rather, they must renounce their [idol] worship or be slain. It is forbidden to have mercy upon them, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] states: "Do not be gracious to them."<br>Accordingly, if we see an idolater being swept away or drowning in the river, we should not help him. If we see that his life is in danger, we should not save him. It is, however, forbidden to cause one of them to sink or push him into a pit or the like, since he is not waging war against us.<br>To whom do the above apply? To gentiles. It is a mitzvah, however, to eradicate Jewish traitors, <i>minnim</i>, and <i>apikorsim</i>, and to cause them to descend to the pit of destruction, since they cause difficulty to the Jews and sway the people away from God.
From the above, we can infer that it is forbidden to offer medical treatment to an idolater even when offered a wage. If, however, one is afraid of the consequences or fears that ill feeling will be aroused, one may treat them for a wage, but to treat them free is forbidden.<br>[With regard to] a <i>ger toshav</i>, since we are commanded to secure his well-being, he may be given medical treatment at no cost.
It is forbidden to sell them homes and fields in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. In Syria, one may sell them homes, but not fields.<br>One may rent them homes in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, provided that a neighborhood [of idolaters] is not established. Fewer than three [homes] does not constitute a neighborhood. It is, however, forbidden to rent them fields. In Syria, one may rent them fields.<br>Why did [the Rabbis issue] more stringent laws regarding fields? Because two difficulties are involved: One removes the obligation of tithes [from these fields], and one gives them a resting place in our land.<br>It is permitted to sell them houses and fields in the Diaspora, because it is not our land.
Even when it is permitted to rent [homes to idolaters], it is not permitted to rent to them for use as a dwelling, because they will bring idols into them, as [Deuteronomy 7:26] states: "Do not bring an abomination into your home." It is, however, permitted to rent them homes to use as storehouses.<br>It is forbidden to sell them fruit, grain, or other produce while it is attached to the earth. One may sell [these products] after they have been harvested or [before they have been harvested], on the condition that they will be harvested, and he must harvest them.<br>Why is it forbidden to sell them [land or anything attached to the land]? Because [Deuteronomy 7:2] states: "Do not be gracious with them." [This phrase can also be interpreted:] "Do not give them a resting place in the land." As long as they do not have a resting place in the land, their stay will be a temporary one.<br>[This prohibition also] forbids speaking about [idolaters] in a praiseworthy manner. It is even forbidden to say, "Look how beautiful that idolater's body is." How much more so is it forbidden to praise their deeds or to hold their words dear, as [the phrase states]: "Do not be gracious with them." [This phrase can also be interpreted:] "Do not look at them graciously," for doing so will cause you to draw close to them and learn from their wicked behavior.<br>[Also implicit in the above phrase is that] it is forbidden to give them a present. A present may, however, be given to a <i>ger toshav</i>, [as implied by Deuteronomy 14:21:] "You may give it to the stranger in your gates so that he may eat it; or sell it to a gentile," [i.e., to an idolater]; it should be sold, not given.
We should provide for poor idolaters together with poor Jews for the sake of peace. One should not rebuke idolaters [from taking] <i>leket</i>, <i>shich'chah</i>, and <i>pe'ah</i>, for the sake of peace. One may inquire about their well-being - even on their festivals - for the sake of peace.<br>One may never repeat good wishes to them. Also, one should not enter the house of a gentile on one of his festivals to wish him well. If one encounters him in the marketplace, one may greet him meekly with a serious countenance.
All the above matters apply only in an era when Israel is in exile among the idolaters or in an era when the idolaters are in power. When, however, Israel is in power over them, it is forbidden for us to allow an idolater among us.<br>Even a temporary resident or a merchant who travels from place to place should not be allowed to pass through our land until he accepts the seven universal laws commanded to Noah and his descendants, as [Exodus 23:33] states: "They shall not dwell in your land" - i.e., even temporarily.<br>A person who accepts these seven mitzvot is a <i>ger toshav</i>. A <i>ger toshav</i> may be accepted only in the era when the [laws of the] Jubilee Year are observed. In an era when the [laws of the] Jubilee Year are not observed, however, we may accept only full converts [to Judaism].

Chapter 11

We may not follow the statutes of the idolaters or resemble them in their [style] of dress, coiffure, or the like, as [Leviticus 20:23] states: "Do not follow the statutes of the nation [that I am driving out before you]," as [Leviticus 18:3] states: "Do not follow their statutes," and as [Deuteronomy 12:30] states: "Be careful, lest you inquire after them."<br>[All these verses] share a single theme: they warn us not to try to resemble [the gentiles]. Instead, the Jews should be separate from them and distinct in their dress and in their deeds, as they are in their ideals and character traits. In this context, [Leviticus 20:26] states: "I have separated you from the nations [to be Mine]."<br>[Thus,] one may not wear a garment which is unique to them or grow the tresses of our hair as they do. We may not shave our heads from the sides and leave hair in the center as they do. This is called a <i>blorit</i>. We may not shave the hair on the front of our faces from ear to ear and leave a growth at the back of our heads as they do. We may not build Temples in order that many people may enter as they do. Whoever performs one of the above or a deed of this nature is [liable for] lashes.
When a Jew is cutting an idolater's hair, he must stop when he approaches within three fingerbreadths of his <i>blorit</i> on all sides.
A Jew who has an important position in a gentile kingdom and must sit before their kings, and would be embarrassed if he did not resemble them, is granted permission to wear clothes which resemble theirs and shave the hair on his face as they do.
It is forbidden to practice soothsaying as idolaters do, as [Leviticus 19:26] states: "Do not act as a soothsayer."<br>What is meant by a soothsayer? For example, those who say: Since my piece of bread fell out of my mouth, or my staff fell from my hand, I will not travel to this place today, since if I were to go I would not be able to accomplish my desires.<br>Since a fox passed on my right side, I will not go out of my door today, since if I were to go out I would meet a deceiver.<br>Similarly, [this category includes] those who hear the chirping of a bird and say: This will happen or this will not happen; it is beneficial to do this or it is detrimental to do this. [Also, it includes] those who say: Slaughter this rooster that crowed like a raven; slaughter this hen that crowed like a rooster.<br>Similarly, a person who sets up omens for himself; e.g., if this and this happens, I will do this. If it will not happen, I will not do it, as Eliezer, the servant of Abraham did, and the things of the like - all this is forbidden. Anyone who does one of these things because of such omens is [liable for] lashes.
[A different ruling applies when] a person says, "This dwelling which I built will be a good omen for me"; "This woman whom I married or this animal that I purchased was blessed. From the time I purchased it onward, I have become rich."<br>The same applies to a person who rejoices and exclaims, "This is a good omen" when he asks a child, "Which verse are you studying?" and the child reads him a verse of blessing. This and the like are permitted, since the person did not perform an act or hold himself back from performing an act [because of the omen]. All he did was consider something that had already happened as a sign.
What is meant by a diviner? This refers to a person who performs certain deeds to cause him to fall into a trance and have his mind cleared of all thoughts until he can predict the future, saying, "This will happen" or "This will not happen;" or saying, "it is proper to do such and such. Be careful to do so."<br>There are some diviners who use sand or stones [to obtain their answers]. Others prostrate themselves on the ground, make strange motions and scream. Others look at a metal or crystal mirror, fantasize, and speak. Still others carry a staff and lean on it and tap with it until they fall into a trance and speak. This is what the prophet [Hoshea  4:12  meant by] saying, "My people will inquire of their rods. Their staffs will tell them."
It is forbidden to divine or to inquire of a diviner. A person who inquires of a diviner is given "stripes for rebelliousness." In contrast, the diviner himself is [punished by] lashes if he performs one of the above or other similar acts, as [Deuteronomy 18:10] states: "There shall not be found among you one who passes..., one who practices divination."
Who is a fortuneteller? A person who tries to predict auspicious times, using astrology and saying, "This day will be a good day," "This day will be a bad day," "It is appropriate to perform a particular task on a certain day"; or "This year" or "This month will not be opportune for this particular matter."
It is forbidden to tell fortunes. [This applies] even though one does not perform a deed, but merely relates the falsehoods which the fools consider to be words of truth and wisdom. Anyone who performs a deed because of an astrological calculation or arranges his work or his journeys to fit a time that was suggested by the astrologers is [liable for] lashes, as [Leviticus 19:26] states: "Do not tell fortunes."<br>Also included in the scope of this prohibition is one who performs magic tricks and deludes those who observe him into thinking that he performs wonders although he is not doing so. He is [liable for] lashes.
Who is a person who casts spells? A person who chants incantations that have no meaning in people's speech or any connotation and imagines in his foolish perception that his words have an effect. Such people will say: If you cast a particular spell on a snake or a scorpion, they will do no harm. If you cast a particular spell on a person, he will never be harmed. Some of them will hold a key or a rock in their hands while they are talking, or perform other similar deeds. All of these are forbidden.<br>A person who casts spells is [punished by lashes] if he holds anything in his hand or performs an act while speaking, even if he merely gestures with his finger, as [Deuteronomy 18:10-11] states: "There shall not be found among you... one who casts spells." If, however, the person merely spoke without moving his finger or his head and without holding anything in his hand, and similarly, a person who has a spell cast upon him through the utterance of such incantations, thinking that this will help him, he is given "stripes for rebelliousness" because he participated in the foolish activities of a spell-caster.<br>All these deplorable incantations and strange names will not do harm, nor will they bring any benefit.
When a person has been bitten by a scorpion or a snake, it is permitted to recite incantations over the bite. [This is permitted] - even on the Sabbath - in order to settle his mind and strengthen his feelings. Even though [the incantations] are of no avail, since the victim's life is in danger, permission was granted lest he become overly disturbed.
A person who whispers an incantation over a wound and then recites a verse from the Torah, who recites a verse over a child so that he will not become scared, or who places a Torah scroll or <i>tefillin</i> over a baby so that it will sleep, is considered to be a soothsayer or one who cast spells. Furthermore, such people are included among those who deny the Torah, because they relate to the words of Torah as if they are cures for the body, when, in fact, they are cures for the soul, as [Proverbs 3:22] states: "And they shall be life for your soul."<br>It is, however, permitted for a healthy person to read verses [from the Bible] or chapters from Psalms so that the merit of reading them will protect him and save him from difficulties and injury.
Who is one who seeks [information] from the dead? A person who starves himself and goes to sleep in a cemetery so that a deceased person will come to him in a dream and reply to his questions. There are others who wear special clothes, recite incantations, burn a particular type of incense, and sleep alone so that a deceased person will come to them and speak to them in a dream. To summarize: Anyone who performs a deed in order that a deceased person should come to him and give him information is [liable for] lashes, as [Deuteronomy 18:10] states: "There shall not be found among you one who passes..., one who seeks [information] from the dead."
It is forbidden to inquire of a person who practices [divination with an] <i>ov</i> or a <i>yid'oni</i>, as [Deuteronomy 18:10-11] states: "There shall not be found among you one who passes..., one who seeks [information] from an <i>ov</i> or a <i>yid'oni</i>."<br>Thus, a person who practices [divination with an] <i>ov</i> or a <i>yid'oni</i> himself is stoned to death, and a person who inquires of them violates a negative commandment and receives stripes for rebelliousness. One who plans his deeds and acts according to their instructions is [liable for] lashes.
A sorcerer must be condemned to execution by stoning. This applies when he commits a deed of sorcery. If, however, he merely deludes those who observe him into thinking that he is performing an act although he actually does not, he is given stripes for rebelliousness.<br>[The reason is] that the prohibition against sorcery is stated in the prohibition [Deuteronomy 18:10-11]: "There shall not be found among you one who... [practices sorcery]." It is, however, a prohibition which is punishable by execution by the court, as [Exodus 22:17] states: "Do not allow a witch to live." [Therefore,] lashes are not administered for its violation.
All the above matters are falsehood and lies with which the original idolaters deceived the gentile nations in order to lead them after them. It is not fitting for the Jews who are wise sages to be drawn into such emptiness, nor to consider that they have any value as [implied by Numbers 23:23]: "No black magic can be found among Jacob, or occult arts within Israel." Similarly, [Deuteronomy 18:14] states: "These nations which you are driving out listen to astrologers and diviners. This is not [what God... has granted] you."<br>Whoever believes in [occult arts] of this nature and, in his heart, thinks that they are true and words of wisdom, but are forbidden by the Torah, is foolish and feebleminded. He is considered like women and children who have underdeveloped intellects.<br>The masters of wisdom and those of perfect knowledge know with clear proof that all these crafts which the Torah forbade are not reflections of wisdom, but rather, emptiness and vanity which attracted the feebleminded and caused them to abandon all the paths of truth. For these reasons, when the Torah warned against all these empty matters, it advised [Deuteronomy 18:13]: "Be of perfect faith with God, your Lord."

This commandment also includes [a prohibition]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 45), the Rambam explains that the interpretation which follows is an allegory, and the simple meaning of the verse is to prohibit gashing oneself in grief. Nevertheless, it is significant that the Rambam includes this "allegory" in a text which is, as he states in his introduction, "halachot, halachot." Thus, he emphasizes how important unity is to the Jewish people.<br>There is an important halachic dimension to the Rambam's explanation in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. One of the principles of Torah law is that punishment is never administered for the violation of a לאו שבכללות ("a prohibition which includes within it several different injunctions;" see <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3). If this allegorical interpretation of the mitzvah were considered to be included in the simple meaning of the mitzvah, this principle would also apply regarding this mitzvah, and lashes might not be administered when one gashed oneself in mourning (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> against there being two courts which follow different customs in a single city, since this can cause great strife.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This decision has been the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis, because it appears to run contrary to one of the accepted principles of halachah.<br>The Rabbis concluded that whenever there is a difference in opinion between Abbaye and Ravva, the halachah follows Ravva, with the exception of six specific instances (יעל קגם). In the present case, the Rambam quotes Abbaye's opinion even though Ravva differs, stating that the prohibition applies only when one follows a divergent opinion without the support of a formal Rabbinical court (<i>Yevamot</i> 14a). When, however, there is a Rabbinical court which advocates each of the differing opinions - e.g., the differences of opinion between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel - there is no prohibition against following either view until the halachah is determined by the supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>.<br>Many authorities have advanced different explanations for the Rambam's decision. The most straightforward is that of the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1384), who explains that the Rambam favored Abbaye's view because of the emphasis on unity. Furthermore, selecting it over Ravva's in this instance does not represent a break with the accepted tradition, since the difference of opinion here does not center on positions adopted by Abbaye and Ravva independently, but rather on their interpretation of Resh Lakish's statements.</i> [Because of the similarity in the Hebrew roots,]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew גדד means both "gash" and "group."</i> the prohibition against gashing ourselves [can be interpreted] to mean: "Do not separate into various different groupings."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It must be noted that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> does not quote this halachah as law. It would appear that while many of the subsequent Rabbis appreciate the ideal of unity this halachah espouses, they felt that compelling people to conform to a uniform standard would create more strife than would result from the existence of different views.<br>One of the practical applications of the issues under discussion is the issue of differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazic religious practices (and similarly, the variety of different approaches that exist within these two major groupings). All of the contemporary authorities agree that it is desirable for each group to adhere to its native customs without change. This plurality of halachic perspectives is an expression - and not a negation - of the all-encompassing unity that permeates Torah Judaism. (See <i>Ezrat Cohen</i>, Responsum 103.)</i>
