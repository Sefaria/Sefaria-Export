Mishneh Torah, Human Dispositions



Chapter 1

Each and every one of the sons of man has many innate tendencies which differ one from the other and which are extremely afar. There is one man of a feverish temperment, constantly vexed, and there is another man of a calm disposition, without angry moods whatever, and if he does show anger it is but one bit of anger in many years; one man is overmuch supercilious, and another man is extremely unobtrusive; one is sensual, whose being is never stilled by the pursuit of propensity, and one is so pure-hearted that he feels no craving even for the barest necessities of the body; one's being is so greedy that the world's money will not satisfy him, as the subject is spoken of: "He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver" (Ecc. 5.10); and one's being is so restrained that he considers enough even part of the little which is insufficient for his need and he will not pursue to attain all needs; one suffers hunger in his effort of hoarding and does not eat a cent's worth of his own without great torture to himself, and another wastes his money with his own hand deliberately. And of such ways are all the rest of the tendencies, as the optimist and pessimist, miser and philanthropist, cruel and merciful, coward and stout-hearted and the like.
And there are between each and every extreme tendency of an opposite vein mean tendencies one distinct from the other. Pertaining to tendencies in general, there are such tendencies which a man acquires at his birth, in keeping with the nature of his body; and there are particular tendencies to which a particular person is by nature prepared to acquire them more aptly than other tendencies; there are among them such which do not come naturally to a person at his birth, but which he learns from others, or by leaning towards them as a result of a thought invented by his heart, or by having heard that this particular tendency is good for him and proper to follow it, and he did follow it until it was set in his heart.
The two extremes in each and every tendency is not a good way, and it is not proper for a man to follow them, nor to have himself instructed in them. If one finds his nature leaning toward one of them, or susceptible to one of them, or if he already acquired one of them and followed it, he should turn himself toward goodness by following the path of the good which is the straight path.
The straight path is the mean disposition found in each and every tendency of all the human tendencies. Such tendency is removed from both extremes an equal distance, and is not nearer to one than to the other. Therefore have the wise men of yore commanded that man should ever review his tendencies,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah, 5b. C.</i> estimate them, and direct them toward the middle-path so that he will be sound in body. How may one do it? He should not be an excitable person, easily angered; nor like the dead without feelings, but adopt a middle-course, not to become indignant, save only at something big which is worthy enough to be angry at, so that the like should not be done another time. Likewise shall he not crave for aught save the things which the body requires, and without which it is impossible to be, as the subject is spoken of: "The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul" (Pro. 13.25). Likewise shall he not continue to fatigue himself in his affairs, save to acquire what is necessary for him to live on for the time being as the subject is mentioned, saying: "A little that a righteous man hath is better" (Ps. 37.16). He should not be too close-fisted, nor yet squander his money, but give Z'dakah within the means of his hand, and lend accordingly to the needy. He should not be too optimistic and playful, nor too pessimistic and mournful, but spend all of his days in good cheer and with a pleasant countenance. So should he measure all the rest of his tendencies. And this path is the path of the wise men. Every man whose tendencies are mean tendencies of the middle-course, is called wise.
One who controls himself with increased restrictions, and distances himself even from the mean tendency,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat, 30-31. G.</i> a little one way or a little the other way, is called devout. How may one do it? One who will distance himself from the extreme point of arrogance and become exceedingly humble is called devout for, this is the tendency of piety. If one distances himself to the mean point only and practices meekness he is called a wise man for, this is the tendency of wisdom. A like pathway exists in all the rest of the tendencies. The ancient devotees diverged their tendencies from the middle-path facing the two extremes; some tendency they bent opposite to the last extreme and some tendency they bent opposite the first extreme. This is more than being within the limits of the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Mezi’a 30a. G.</i> As for us, we are charged to walk in these middle-paths, which are the good and straight paths, even as it is said: "And thou shalt walk in His ways" (Deut. 28 9).
In explaining this commandment the sages taught thus: Even as He is called gracious, be thou gracious; even as He is called merciful, be thou merciful; even as He is called holy, be thou holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat, 133b.; Sotah, 14a. C.</i> In this wise did the prophets attribute to God all such terms as long-suffering, abundant in benificence, just and right, perfect, mighty and powerful and others like these, to proclaim that they are good and straight paths, and that man is obligated to lead himself in them, and to be like unto Him in proportion to his power.
And how may a man inure himself in these tendencies so that they be permanent with him? He should try once, repeat it, and do a third time the things he is called upon to do in harmony with the tendencies of the middle-course, and repeat the practice continuously until the doing it will be accomplished with slight effort, and they will not be burdensome upon him, then will the tendencies be a fixed part of his being. And because the Creator is termed by these attributes which are the middle-way, this way is called the Lord's way. And, it is even in this that Abraham our father instructed his sons, saying: "For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, that they shall keep the way of the Lord" (Gen. 18.19). And he who walks in this way brings goodness and blessing upon himself, even as it is said: "In order that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken concerning him" (Ibid.).

Chapter 2

To the physically sick the bitter tastes sweet, and the sweet bitter. Of among the sick there may be one who craves and desires food which is unfit for consumption, for instance, dirt and coal, and despises good food such as bread and meat, according to the seriousness of the disease. Even so are people whose souls are sick; they desire and love the evil tendencies, and hate the good way, and are lazy to follow it, for it becomes a very heavy load upon them, in proportion to their ailment. Even so does Isaiah speak of such people: "Woe unto those that say of the evil it is good, and of the good it is evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter" (Is. 5.20). Respecting their like it is said: "Who leave the path of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness" (Prov. 2.13). And what is the corrective measure for the soul-sick? Let them go to the wise who are doctors of the souls and they will heal their disease with tendencies wherein they will instruct them until they will bring them back to the right way. And they that are conscious of their evil tendencies and do not go to the wise to be cured by them, concerning them Solomon said: "Wisdom and instruction fools alone despise" (Prov. 1.7).
And how may their cure be? He who is of a hot temperment should be taught to demean himself this wise: If he be smitten and cursed, he must not feel the insult at all. and follow this way a long time until anger will be completely rooted out from his heart. And he who was arrogant should accustom himself to a life of extreme self-abasement by occupying the lowermost seat of everybody, and dress in such rags which shame those that wear them, and do such in like matters until the haughtiness of his heart will be rooted out of him, when he will return to the middle-way, which is the good way. But when he will return to the middle-way he should follow it throughout his lifetime. And this line he should follow in all the rest of his tendencies; if he had distanced himself to the extreme point of one he should remove himself to the extreme end of the other and follow it up a long time until he may return to the good way, which is the middle-standard in each and every tendency.
And, yet, there are certain tendencies which man is forbidden to follow in the middle-way, but must distance himself from extreme to extreme. The good way is not merely that man be meek, but that he should be humble-spirited, then his spirit will be extremely lowly. This is the reason why it is said of Moses that he was very meek (Num. 12.3) and not merely meek. This is also the reason why the sages commanded saying: "Be exceedingly humble of spirit" (Pir. Ab. 4.4). They, moreover, said: "He who is of a haughty heart denies the head principle" (Sotah, 4b), even as it is said: "Thine heart be then lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God" (Deut. 8.14); and they also said: "Isolated be he in whom there is a haughty spirit, even a little thereof" (Sotah. 5a). So is anger an extremely evil tendency and it is proper for man to remove himself from it to the other extreme. One should teach himself not to get angry, even over a matter which befits anger. If one desires to engender awe in his children and his household, or in the public, if he be at the head of a community, even if he desire to get angry at them so as to bring them back to the good way, he should only act angry in their presence so as to reprove them, but his disposition must remain calm within himself, even as a man imitates, who is angry when the time calls forth anger but in reality he is not angry. The sages of yore said: "He who yields to anger is as if he worshiped idolatry".<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Nedarim, 22b. G.</i> They also said: "Whosoever yields to anger, if he be a wise man his wisdom leaves him, and if he be a prophet his prophecy leaves him."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Pesahim, 66b. C.</i> Verily the life of irritable persons is no life.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Pesahim, 113a. C.</i> They have, therefore, commanded to be afar from anger, so that one will train himself not to mind even the things which do cause irritation, for such is the good way. The conduct of the just is to take insults but not give insults, hear themselves flouted but make no reply, do their duty as a work of love, and bear affliction cheerfully. Concerning them the Verse says: "But may those that love Him be as the rising of the sun in his might" (Judg. 5.31).
Ever let man multiply silence, and not speak aught else save in a matter of wisdom or of things which he needs for the sustenance of life in his body. Of Rab, the disciple of our Holy Master, it was said, that he never in his life uttered idle talk<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> Caro contradicts the text here, saying: “I found in Sukkah, 28, that this distinction was attributed to Rabbi Johanan, but about Rab I DO not now know where to locate such statement.” The text is correct, as Maimonides only quotes references which are laws of conduct and not sermons. See Yoma, 19b about the name Kaputal and Kabutal. G.</i>. Verily, such is the talk of a majority of the people, whereas, even of the necessities of the body man should not multiply words. Concerning this the sages admonished, saying: "Whosoever propogates words generates sin" (Pir. Ab. 1.17). And they, moreover, said: "I found nothing better for the body than silence" (Ibid). Likewise in words of Torah and in words of wisdom shall man's words be few but the thought therein sagacious, which is what the sages charged saying: "Ever let the master instruct his disciples concisely" (Hullin. 63b). But if the words be many and their meaning insignificant it is but stupidity, concerning which it was said: "For a dream cometh through a multitude of matter, and the voice of a fool cometh with a multitude of words" (Ecc. 5.3).
Silence is the boundary of wisdom; therefore shall one not reply in haste, and not propogate speech. One shall instruct his disciples with forebearance and calmness, without vociferation and without circumlocution. That is what Solomon said: "The words of the wise men, spoken quietly, are heard" (Ecc. 9.17).
It is forbidden for man to demean himself by the use of the language of flattery and allurement; and he shall not be one thing with his mouth and another with his heart; but his inner and outer being must be the same, for the subject of the heart is the matter of the mouth. And, it is forbidden to steal the mind of people, even the mind of the alien. For example? One shall not sell to an alien meat of a beast that died of itself or that was improperly slaughtered (Nebelah) and represent that it was meat of an animal that was slaughtered properly; or shoes of the hide of a beast that died of itself and represent that it was of a slaughtered beast; one shall not urge his friend to dine with him, when he knows that he would not eat; nor over-burden him with offerings when he knows that he would not accept; nor open a barrel, which he must open for his trade, to talk in his friend that he opened it in his honor, and so other like deceptions. Even one word of allurement and stealing of mind is forbidden. But man must be of true lip, steadfast spirit, and pure heart, free from all travail and clamor.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> Hullin, 94a. C.</i>
Man shall not be frivolous and sarcastic, nor sad and pessimistic, but of good cheer. Thus said the wise men: "Frivolity and light-headedness train man for prostitution" (Pir. Ab. 3.13). And they have commanded: Man shall not be boisterous in laughter, nor sad and forlorn, but receive every person with a kind expression upon his face.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Pir. Ab. 1.15.C</i> And so should he not be a man of an over-ambitious soul rushing for wealth, nor despondent and idle from work; but a being with a goodly eye, engage in affairs but little and be occupied in the study of the Torah, and in that little portion of his he shall rejoice. He shall not be contentious, envious, covetous or vain-glorious. Thus have the wise men said: "Envy, covetousness, and vain-gloriousness remove man from life" (Pir. Ab. 4.25). As a general rule of the matter he should follow the tendency of the middle-course of each and every disposition to the end that all of his tendencies will be firmly in the center, which is as Solomon said: "Balance well the track of thy foot, and let all thy ways be firmly right" (Prov. 4.26).

Chapter 3

Peradventure man will say: Seeing that envy, desire and vainglory and like tendencies are evil tendencies and remove man from life, I will separate myself from them exceedingly and reach their remotest extreme. Until he will eat no meat, drink no wine, marry no woman, dwell in no comfortable quarters, dress in no proper clothes but in a sack and coarse wool, and the like, as for instance the idolatrous priests do. Even such is an evil way, and it is forbidden to follow it. He who follows this way is called a sinner, for it is said of a Nazarite: "And make an atonement for him, because he hath sinned against the soul" (Num. 6.11), whereupon the sages said: "If the Nazarite, who did not separate himself from aught but wine must have atonement, he who deprives himself from each and every thing how manifold must his atonement be" (Baba Kama. 91b)!<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Ta’anit, 11a. G.</i> Therefore did the sages command, saying: A man shall not deprive himself of ought save the things which the Torah itself deprived him of; nor shall he bind himself by vows and oaths to abstain from things which are permitted. They have even said: "Is it not enough for thee what the Torah has forbidden, that thou doest forbid thyself even other things" (Yeru. Nedarim. 7.37)? And in this rule are included such who are continuously fasting, for they are not in the good way, and the sages prohibited one from punishing himself with fast days. Concerning such and like matters Solomon admonished saying: "Be not righteous overmuch; neither show thyself wise; why wouldst thou destroy thyself" (Ecc. 7.16).
It is necessary for man to set his heart and all his efforts solely to know the Name, blessed is He! so that his sitting down, his rising up and his speech shall be facing this goal. How may he accomplish it? When he will buy, or sell, or do work for wages, he should not have in his heart the accumulation of money only but he should perform these duties as a means to acquire the necessities of the body, as food, drink, dwelling-place and marriage; likewise when he will eat, drink, or lead a family life, he should not set his heart upon these things for the sole enjoyment thereof, until, as a consequence he will not eat and drink save that which is sweet to the palate, and marry to gratify his sensuality only. But he shall set his heart to eat and drink solely in order to keep his body and limbs in good health. He, therefore, should not eat everything his palate craves for like a dog or an ass, but partake of the things which are wholesome to the body whether bitter or sweet; and he shall not eat food which is bad for the body even though it be sweet to the palate. For example? One whose body was feverish shall not eat meat, nor honey, and drink no wine, as the subject was proverbally expressed by Solomon: "To eat too much honey is not good" (Prov. 25.27); he should rather drink cichorium intybus, even though it is bitter, as a consequence whereof he will eat and drink solely as a remedial means so that he may become healthy and stay healthy, seeing that it is impossible for man to sustain life save by food and drink. Likewise in connubial relation there shall be no coition save when it is of benefit to health, or to sustain species. One should, therefore, not yield to every urge, save when knowing that emission of semen is a helpful means medically or to sustain species.
He who follows the medical directions, but sets his heart merely to keep his body and limbs healthy and beget children to do his work and strive for his needs, such is not the good way. But he should set his heart to have a sound and strong body so that his soul be tranquil to acquire the knowledge of the Lord; for, it is impossible that one should comprehend and improve himself in scholarship when he is hungry, or sick, or when one of his limbs pains; but he should set his heart to have a son who, perhaps will be a great sage in Israel Consequently, one who follows such way all of his life, is constantly in God's service, even when he is buying and selling, even when he performs the grossest duty, seeing that his thought beneath it all is to find enough to satisfy his wants, so that his body be sound, ready to serve God. Even when one sleeps, if his sleep be purposeful so that his mind be rested, and rests his body so as to prevent himself from becoming sick and be unable to serve God as a result of sickness, it will be found that even his very sleep is part of his service to God, blessed is He! And on this subject the sages commanded and said: "And let all thine actions be with devotion to the Name of God" (Pir. Av. 2.12); and, concerning this Solomon in his wisdom said: "In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will make level thy paths" (Prov. 3.6).

Chapter 4

Seeing that the maintenance of the body in a healthy and sound condition is a God-chosen way, for, lo, it is impossible that one should understand or know aught of the divine knowledge concerning the Creator when he is sick, it is necessary for man to distance himself from things which destroy the body, and accustom himself in things which are healthful and life-imparting. These are: never shall man partake food save when hungry, nor drink save when thirsty; he shall not defer elimination even one minute, but the moment he feels the need to evacuate urine or feces he must rise immediately.
Man shall not eat his stomach-full, but should reduce about one fourth of the quantity which would sate him; nor shall he drink water during the meal, save a little mixed with wine; but when the food will commence to be digested in his bowels, he may drink whatever quantity he needs, nevertheless, he should not drink over-much water even after the food was digested. He shall not eat before a thorough examination of self whether there is a need for elimination. Man shall not eat without warming his body either by walking before mealtime, by some manual labor, or by some other form of exercise which will tire him. As a general rule, he shall exercise his body and tire it every day during the morning so that it will commence to perspire, when he shall rest a little until his spirit will be calm then eat. If he take a warm bath after hard exercise it is still better, after which he should rest a little then eat.
Ever after a man eats, he should remain for a time sitting in his place, or leaning on his left side; he shall not walk, ride horseback, tire himself, exercise his body, or ramble about ere the food in his stomach is digested; and he who does ramble about or tires himself after eating invites upon himself bad and serious ailments.
The day and the night consist of twenty-four hours. It is enough that a man should sleep a third of it, which is eight hours. But it should terminate at the end of the night, so that from the time he commences his sleep till sun-dawn will be eight hours. As a consequence whereof he will arise from his bed before sun-up.
Man shall not sleep with his face downward, nor with his face upward, but on his side; at the beginning of the night on his left side, and at the end of the night on his right side. He shall not sleep immediately after meals, but wait about three or four hours after eating. He shall not sleep in the day-time.
Things which soften the bowels, as grapes, figs, morus nigra, pears, cucumis melo, cucumis sativus, or cucurbita, man shall eat before partaking of the principal dishes, and not mix it with the other food, but wait a bit till it leaves the esophagus, then take his meal; and things which stiffen the bowels as pomum granatum, quince, apples, or persicum he may eat right after the meal. But of these he should not eat in large quantities.
When man desires to have fowl and beef in one meal, he should eat the meat of the fowl first; eggs and poultry in one meal, he should eat eggs first; meat of the flock and meat of the herd in one meal, he should eat the meat of the flock first; he should ever eat the lighter food first and the heavier food last.
During the summer season he should eat his food cold, and not much spices, and partake of vinegar; during the rainy season he should eat his food warm with a liberal dose of spices therein, and partake of some mustard and asafetida. And, in this way he may continue to do in cold zones and in warm zones, in each and every place that which is fit for it.
There are some extremely bad foodstuffs and it is proper that man should not eat them at any time. For instance, the large, salted, old fishes; or stale, salted cheese; or cummin and mushrooms; or old, salted meat; or unfermented wine; or stale odorous victuals; and likewise all kinds of food of a bad smell, or of extremely bitter taste, are to the body like poison. And there are some foodstuffs, while bad, are not as deadly as the former; it is, therefore, advisable for man to partake of them but little, and at long intervals; nor shall he accustom himself to make of them his staple food, or to partake of them constantly along with his staple food. For instance, large fishes, cheese, or milk older than twenty-four hours; meat of big oxen and big rams; beans, lentils, pease, bread made of barley, unleavened-bread, cabbage, leek, onions, garlick, mustard and raddish are all bad food, and it is inadvisable for man to partake of these save only a very small quantity, and during the rainy season only. But during the summer season he should not eat of them at all, save, however, beans and lentils are unfit to eat, neither in summer season nor in rainy season. Pumkins should be eaten during the summer season.
There are still other foodstuffs which are bad, but not as bad as these. They are: water fowl, young pigeons, dates, bread toasted in oil, or bread kneeded in oil, fine meal wherein no trace of bran was left, brine and herring-brine. Of these it is unfit to eat much. A wise man, who can control himself, and not be carried away by his desires, who would not eat of the named foodstuffs altogether, save when he needs them as a drug, behold, he is a strong man.
Man should ever avoid himself from fruits of trees, surely not to partake overmuch thereof, even dried, not to mention fresh; but unripe fruits are daggers to the body. Likewise are Carobs ever bad to eat. And all citrous fruits are bad, and must not be eaten but in small quantities during the summer season, or in warm zones. But figs, grapes and almonds are ever good to eat, whether dry or fresh; of them man may eat all he is in need of, but he should not make them part of his diet permanently, notwithstanding that they are better than all other fruits of the trees.
Honey and wine are bad for the young but good for the old, particularly in the rainy season. A man needs during the summer season but two-thirds of the food he consumes during the rainy season.
Man should ever endeavor to have his bowels soft, near a bit to looseness. Here is a general rule in medicine: As long as there is either complete constipation or the voiding comes with great effort, it is a warning of impending serious ailments. What with shall man cure his bowels if they be somewhat constipated? If he be young, he shall eat every morning salted things, scalded, spiced with olive oil, brine and salt, but without bread; or drink hot extract of spinach, or of Carob mixed with olive oil, brine and salt; if he be old, he should drink in the morning honey in warm water, and wait about four hours, then he may eat his breakfast; this way he shall continue one day or, if needed, three or four days, until his bowels will become soft.
And yet another rule was laid down with respect to the health of the body; As long as a man works, and tires himself out to the extreme, and does not eat to his full satiety, and his bowels are soft, no ailment will visit him, and his strength will increase, even though he partakes of foods which are considered bad.
But whosoever sits idle and takes no exercise, or who witholds eliminations of his bowels, or whose bowels are constipated, even though he will eat only good food and keep himself up after the prescribed medical rules, he will suffer pain all his life, and his strength will fade away. Ravenous eating is as deadly to the body of every man as poison, and is the base of all sickness; for, most diseases which visit man are not possible save either because of bad food, or because he fills up his bowels with overmuch food, even though the food be of good quality. Concerning this Solomon in his wisdom said: "Whoso guardeth his mouth and his tongue guardeth his soul against distresses" (Prov. 21.23), meaning, that whoso guards his mouth against bad food and ravenous eating, and his tongue from speaking aught but of the things he needs, guards his soul against distresses.
The way of proper bathing: A man should bathe once every seven days, but never at meal-time, nor when hungry, only when the food will commence to be digested. His whole body one should wash in warm water of a temperature which does not scald the body; save the head on which he may use water of a temperature which would scald the body. Then he should wash his body in lukewarm water, then in water of a temperature lower than that, until he should finish washing his body in cold water. But upon his head he shall use neither lukewarm nor cold water. During the rainy season he should not bathe in cold water. He should not bathe before he will perspire and tire out his whole body; neither should he remain long in the bath-house, but as soon as he will perspire and tire his body he should wash freely and depart. He should examine himself before he enters the bath-house and after his departure if there be a need for elimination of the bowels. Likewise one should examine himself that way continuously before and after meals, before and after coition, before and after exercise, before and after sleeping, totaling ten times.
On leaving the bath-house he shoud dress and cover his head in the outer room, so as not to expose himself to a draft, the precaution being necessary even during the summer season. After he departs from the bath-house he should linger a while till he be composed in spirit, and rested in body, and be rid of the warmth, after which he may eat. If he sleep a while, after leaving the bath-house, before he partakes of a meal, it is very good. He should not drink cold water immediately after leaving the bath-house, needless to say that he should not drink while in the bath-house. If he be thirsty when leaving the bath-house, and is unable to restrain himself he should mix the water with wine or honey and drink. If he massaged himself with oil while in the bath-house, in the rainy season, after taking a plunge, it is wholesome.
Man should not make a constant practice of blood-letting, and he should not let blood save when there is an extraordinary need for it. He should not let blood either during the summer season or during the rainy season, but a little in the spring (during the days of Nisan) and a little in the fall (during the days of Tishri). After his fiftieth year he should never let blood. Neither shall he let blood and go to a bath-house on the same day, nor let blood and start on a journey, nor on the day he returns from a journey; and on the day of blood-letting he should eat and drink less than his accustomed portion. On the day of blood-letting he should rest and not tire himself, nor take exercise, nor walk about.
Semen is the vigor of the body, its very life, and the light of the eyes, and its too frequent emission sets decay in the body, wastes its strength, and ends life itself, which is as Solomon in his wisdom said: "Give not unto women thy vigor" (Prov. 31.3). Whosoever indulges in sensuality ages before his time, his strength fails him, his eyes become dim, a foul odor issues from his mouth and from underneath his arms, the hair of his head, eye-brows, and eye-lids fall out; the hair of his beard, under his arms and his feet grow heavier, his teeth fall out, and many more ailments besides these come upon him. Doctors of medicine said: "One in a thousand die of other diseases, and the rest of the thousand from overindulgence of sex. Therefore, must man be careful in this matter, if he desires to lead a good life. He should not yield to an urge save if his body be in good health and exceedingly vigorous, with involuntary erection despite diversion, and a pressure on the genitocrural arteries accompanied by warm wave over his body, when there is a hygienic need of relief. But he should not still an urge when sated and not when hungry, but after the food in his bowels be digested. Care should be taken, before and after, whether there is a need of elimination. Neither standing nor sitting; neither in the bath-house nor on the day of bathing; neither on the day of blood-letting nor on the day of departing for or returning from a journey; neither preceding nor following all these.
Whosoever trains himself in these ways which were pointed out, I assure him that he will encounter no sickness all of his days, until he will die of old age; he will need no doctor; his body will be sound and well preserved throughout his life, unless his body be bad from its very formation or if there be a visitation of a pestilence or famine upon the world.
But all of the aforesaid good rules none but the healthy should follow. One who is sick, or he who has a diseased limb, or one who followed bad habits for many years, for each of such there are different ways of cure and rules of conduct, according to the nature of his ailment, as it is more clearly stated in the book of medicine. As a rule a change in routine of life is the germ of disease.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Batra, 146; Ketubot 112. G.</i>
Wherever there is no doctor of medicine to be found, whether one is healthy or whether one is sick, it is not advisable for any one to deviate from the rules of conduct laid down in this chapter, for each of these leads to a good goal.
In any city where these ten conveniences are not found a disciple of the wise is not permitted to live: a physician, a surgeon, a bath-house, a comfort-station, running water, as a river or spring, a house of worship, a school teacher, a recorder, a collector of charity, and a tribunal with police powers.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 17.

Chapter 5

Even as the wise man is recognized by his wisdom and ideas, whereby he is distinguished from the rest of the public, so it is necessary for him to be distinguished in his conduct, eating, drinking, sexual relations, elimination, speech, rendevous, dress, temperate in words, and in his business relations. All these deeds should be aesthetic and exceedingly cultured. A disciple of the wise must not be voracious, but eat proper food to strengthen his body; but even of such food he shall not partake a large quantity, nor be after eating in order to have a full stomach, as those who fill themselves up with food and drink until their bellies swell, concerning whom it is traditionally commented saying: "And I will spread dung upon your faces" (Mal. 2.3) refers, according to the sages, to those people who eat and drink and act as if determined to make of their lives a continuous feast.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat, 15G.</i> And, it is they that say: "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we must die" (Is. 22.13), which typifies the way wicked people eat, and it is such festive tables which were shamed in the verse saying: "For all tables are full of vomit, of filthiness, there is no place clean" (Ibid. 28.8). But the wise does not eat save one or two dishes, and of that he eats only enough to sustain his life and is satisfied, which is as Solomon said: "The righteous eateth to satisfy his soul" (Prov. 13.25).
When the wise eats the little that is proper for him, he should not eat it elsewhere than in his own house, at his own table. He should not eat either in a restaurant or on the street, unless because of an extreme need, so that he be not dishonored before people; nor should he eat together with the uncivilized, and indeed, not at those tables which are filled with vomit filthiness; nor should he take his meals too frequent in outside places even in company of the wise.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Pesahim, 49. C.</i> He should not eat at banquets where the gatherings are large. It is improper for him to eat in public, save at a mandatory feast, such as feasts of engagements and weddings, and then only when a disciple of the wise takes to wife the daughter of a disciple of the wise. The righteous and the pious of yore never partook of a meal which was not of their own.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin, 7. C.</i>
When the wise drinks wine he partakes only enough to moisten the food in his bowels; but whosoever intoxicates himself is a sinner, contemptible, and brings about the loss of his wisdom. If he intoxicates himself in the presence of the uncivilized, behold, this one blashphemed the Name. It is forbidden to drink wine at noon, even a small quantity, save it be included in the meal; for, drink which is part of the meal is not intoxicating. However, no warning is needed, save from wine after meals.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">T. Y. Pesahim, 37. G.</i>
Though one's wife is ever lawful to him, it is proper that a disciple of the wise should demean himself with sanctity, and not be like a rooster;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Berakot, 22a. G.</i> a Sabbath to Sabbath visitation,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ketubot, 62. C.</i> if there be no physical reason to the contrary, not in the beginning of the night<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim, 20; Niddah, 16. C. G.</i> when in a state of satiety, nor at the end of the night when hungry, but about midnight after the food in his bowels be digested, unaccompanied by either exceeding boisterousness or profanity of mouth with vain words, even between themselves. Behold, it is traditionally said that the Verse, "And he declareth unto man what his language is" (Amos. 4.13), the sages interpreted: "Even on account of indecent conversation a man carries on with his own wife, he will have to render an accounting" (Hegigah. 5b). Both of them shall not be intoxicated, nor sluggish, nor in mourning; nor either of them in such state; nor when she be asleep, nor by overpowering her contrary mood; but with the consent and happy mood of both, with few pleasant and light-hearted words to please her being, stilling his urge diffidently and not impudently and dissociate immediately.
He who follows such conduct will not only sanctify his soul, and live in a state of purity, and improve his ideas, but if he will father children they will be refined and modest, prepared for wisdom and piety; but he who follows the conduct of the rest of the people who walk in darkness will father children in their likeness.
The disciples of the wise conduct themselves with an abundance of privacy. They should not degrade themselves; and they should not uncover their heads and not their bodies. Even when entering a lavatory he should act decently, not to bare himself before sitting down nor use his right hand to dry himself, and remove himself from every human being and use an inner room, or an inner cave, and if it be behind a trench he should distance himself so that his neighbor will not hear him, and if it be on a plain, distance himself so that his neighbor will not see him; and not talk when voiding even if there be great need. And, in the self-same decent manner he follows by day he should follow by night; but one should train himself to have elimination morning and evening, to avoid the need of distancing himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Berakot, 62; Horayot, 13; Tamid, 27; Shabbat, 82. C. G.</i>
A disciple of the wise should not be noisy and loud like cattle and animals when talking, nor even raise his voice overmuch, but converse calmly with all people; nevertheless, in speaking calmly he should not overdo it lest he resemble the overpoliteness of the arrogant. He should be first to greet every person, so that their spirit be pleased with him He should judge every person favorably, telling the praiseworthy things about his friend and not at all about the blameworthy things; love peace and pursue it. If he can see his words acceptable he may speak, if not he should be silent. For instance? He should not appease his friend when the latter is moody; nor question him concerning his vow at the time the vow was made, but wait until his friend's mind will be composed and collected; he should not offer condolence while the remains of the deceased are in the presence of his friend, because he is upset until after the remains are buried, and so in other matters of a like delicate nature. He should not call upon his friend while the latter is down through a failing, but keep his eye off of him. He should not change his word, nor add to or diminish from it, unless it be for the sake of peace and similar worthy objects. As a general rule, he should not speak much else save words of wisdom, or charity and the like. He should not carry on a conversation with a woman on the street, even though she be his wife, or his sister, or his daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 86a; Kiddushin, 70b; Yebamot, 65a; Pirke Abot, 1; Ibid. 4; Berakot, 43a; Ibid, 48. C. G.</i>
A disciple of the wise shall not walk about with his head high up in the air and neck stretched out, the subject of which was denounced, saying: "And they walk with stretched necks and wanton eyes" (Is. 3.16); nor overslow as bringing heel to toe like some women and the arrogant, the subject of which was denounced, saying: "Walking and measuring as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet" (Ibid.); nor run about after the fashion of the mad, nor bent as if hunch-backed, but looking downward as if in praying position, and as if occupied and going on some errand of business. Even from the way a person walks it is apparent whether he is wise and sensible or foolish and imprudent. For even so did Solomon in his wisdom say: "Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool" (Ecc. 10.3), meaning that he himself proclaims to everybody that he is a fool.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Berakot, 43b. C.</i>
The disciple of the wise should wear becoming and clean clothes, and it is forbidden to have a spot or grease or anything of a like unclean nature, found upon his garment. He should not wear clothes fit for a king such as trimmed with gold or purple which attract everybody's gaze, nor the clothes of a pauper which put the wearer to shame, but average garments of becoming style. He should not wear transparent garments as, for example, garments made of very fine linen which are made in Egypt; nor should they be too long, trailing upon the ground, like the garments of the arrogant, but it may reach to the heel, and the sleeves to his finger-tips. He should not permit to trail his fringed garment, as it appears arrogant, save only on the Sabbath, if he has no other to change. He should not wear patched-up shoes, patch upon a patch, in summer time; but in winter time it is permitted if he be poor. He should not go out on the street perfumed, nor with perfumed garments, nor put perfume in his hair; but if he puts perfume upon his skin to remove perspiration there is no rule forbidding it. Likewise should he not go out alone at night, unless he had set a specified time to go out to his studies. All these ethical rules are so as not to cast any suspicion upon the disciples of the wise.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin, 91b; Pesahim 112a; Berakot 45b C. G.</i>
A disciple of the wise adjusts his affairs judiciously: he eats, drinks and supports his family within his capital and material success; but he should not overburden himself more than necessary. The wise men command a worldly custom that a man should not eat meat save when craving it, even as it is said: "Because thy soul desireth to eat flesh" (Deut. 12.20). It is enough for a healthy person to eat meat from Friday night to Friday night. If, however, he be rich enough to eat meat daily he may eat. The wise men commanded and said: "Ever let a man eat less than what his financial means allow, dress within his means, but honor his wife and children with more than his means allow".<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin, 84b. C.</i>
The way of sensible people: A man should first select a permanent vocation out of which to derive a livelihood, then buy a home, and after that take unto himself a wife, as it is said: "And what man is there that built a new house and hath not dedicated it, And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof, And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her". (Deut. 20.5–7).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text quotes “And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard” first, which is an evident error; Maimonides only emphasizes that marriage should take place only after attaining an established livelihood. G.</i> But fools reverse it by taking a wife first, and after that, if he be able, purchase a home, and after that, in his declining years, he will turn about looking for a vocation, or be supported on charity. Even so is it reversed when pronouncing adversity: "Thou shalt betroth a wife, thou shalt build a house, thou shalt plant a vineyard" (Deut. 28.30), meaning, thy actions shall be reverse so that thou be unsuccessful in thy ways. But of a blessing it is said: "And David acted wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was with him" (First Samuel. 18.14).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Pesahim, 50, about one who is supported by his wife’s earnings. G.</i>
A man is forbidden either to give away or to make holy all of his property and burden society for his support. He should not sell a farm and buy a house, or a house and buy moveables; or engage in merchandise with the proceeds of his house; but he may sell moveables and buy a farm. As a general rule in such matter, he should set his mind to increase his property successfully and exchange the thing which is perishable for the thing which is lasting; he should not direct his intention to find a bit of temporary joy, or enjoy for a while and thereby sustain great loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Arakin, 28a. C.</i>
The business conduct of the disciple of the wise must be accompanied by truth and good faith; he must say: no, when it is no, and yea, when it is yea; restricting himself in accounting to others, but liberal in giving to and benevolent when receiving from others and place no restrictions upon them; he should make payment immediately after the bargain is made; he should not become surety for others, nor act as trustee, or agent; he should not oblige himself in matters of business in instances where the Torah made it not obligatory upon him, so that he be able to keep his word and not change he obtain judgment by law against others, he should grant them delay, be forgiving to them, aid them with a loan and be gracious to them. He must not go down after the trade of his neighbor, nor ever in his life oppress any one in the world. As a rule he should be among the pursued and not among the pursuers, among the insulted and not among the insulting. For, a man who does all such deeds or their like, of him the Verse says: "And He said unto me, 'thou art My servant, Israel in whom I will be glorified'" (Is. 49.3).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gittin, 52b; Yoma, 86a; Shebu’ot, 31a; Sanhedrin, 81b; Baba Kamma, 93a; Yoma, 20a; Gittin, 36b.

Chapter 6

It is a natural tendency of man to be influenced in his ideas and conduct by his fellows and associates, and to follow the usage of the people of his state. Because thereof, it is necessary for man to be in the company of the righteous, and to sit near the wise, in order to learn from their conduct, and to distance himself from the evil-doers who follow the path of darkness, in order not to learn from their conduct; for of such Solomon said: "He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but the companion of fools shall smart for it" (Prov. 13.20); and it is also said: "Happy is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked etc. (Ps. 1.1.). Likewise, if a man be in a state where evil customs prevail and where the people are not following the righteous ways, he should go to a place where the inhabitants are righteous and follow the way of the good. If all the states known to him, or of which intelligence reached him, be followers of a path which is not good, even as it is in our own times, or if he be unable to migrate to a state whose rules of conduct are good, either on account of military operations or on account of sickness, he should isolate himself and live in seclusion, even as it is said on the subject: "Let him sit alone and keep silence" (Lam. 3.28). And, if the inhabitants of his state be evildoers and sinners, who deny him the right of residence in the state unless he become assimilated with them, and follows their evil conduct, he should go forth and dwell in caves, or cliffs, or deserts, but not accustom himself in the way of the sinners, even as it is said on the subject: "Oh that I were in the wilderness,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Berakot, 35b. G.</i> in a lodging place of wayfaring men" (Jer. 9.1.).
It is a mandatory commandment to cleave to the wise and their disciples, in order to learn of their deeds, even as it is said on the subject: "And to Him shalt thou cleave" (Deut. 10.20). Is it possible to cleave to the Shekinah? But even thus the wise men commented upon in interpreting this commandment, saying: "Cleave to the wise men and their disciples" (Ketubot, 111b). Man shall, therefore, find the necessary means to take to wife the daughter of a disciple of the wise, and to give his daughter in marriage to a disciple of the wise; to eat and drink with the disciples of the wise, to do business for and with the disciples of the wise, and to associate with them in every form of companionship, even as it is said, "And to cleave to him" (Deut. 11.22). Even so have the wise men commanded, saying: "Sit amidst the dust of their feet, and drink their words with thirst" (Pirke Abot. 1.4.).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Pesahim, 49; Baba Batra, 126a; See Shabbat, 63a. G.</i>
It is mandatory upon every man to love each and every one of Israel even as he loves his own self, for it is said: "But thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Lev. 19.19.). One is therefore, obliged to speak in praise of his neighbor, and to be considerate of his money, even as he is considerate of his own money, or desires to preserve his own honor. "But whosoever glorifies himself in disgracing his neighbor has no share in the world to come" (Yerushalmi, Hegigah. 2.1).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cairo quotes Pirke Abot, chapter 2, as authority for this; but the error evidently was made by copyist. G.</i>
The love for the proselyte, who came and embraced the protection beneath the wings of the Shekinah, rests upon two mandatory commandments, one because he is included in the commandment concerning a neighbor, and the other because he is a stranger, and the Torah charged us, saying: "Love ye therefore the stranger" (Deut. 10.19.). He commanded on the love for the stranger as He commanded concerning the love for Himself, saying: "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God" (Ibid. 6.5.). The Holy One, blessed is He! loves the strangers Himself, even as it is said: "And (He) loveth the stranger" (Ibid. 10.18).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Mezi’a, 59b. G.</i>
Whosoever hates any one of Israel within his heart, violates a prohibitive commandment, even as it is said: "Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart" (Lev. 19.17.); but the punishment of flogging is not pronounced for violating this prohibitive commandment, as no act was committed, for, the Torah did not admonish save by hatred within the heart. Moreover, he who smites his fellow, or besmirches him with words, although forbidden to do so, there is no violation of the prohibitive commandment of "Thou shalt not hate" connected thereto.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Arakin, 16b. G.</i>
If one man commit a sin against another man, the one sinned against shall not remain in silent hate against the sinner, as it is said of the wicked: "And Absalom spoke unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon" (Second Samuel. 13.22); but, on the contrary, it is obligatory upon him to make known to him and say unto him: "Why have you done to me thus and such, and wherefore have you sinned against me in that particular matter?"; for, it is said: "And thou shalt indeed rebuke thy neighbor" (Lev. 19.17). And, if the sinner did repent and begged to be forgiven by him, he must forgive him; and in doing so he should not be cruel, for it is said: "And Abraham prayed unto God" (Gen. 20.17).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For Abimelech, who sinned against him. G.</i>
He who beholds his fellow stooping to sin or following an unrighteous path, is obliged to return him toward the good, and to let him know that he is actually sinning against himself in pursuing wicked deeds for, it is said: "And thou shalt indeed rebuke thy neighbor" (Lev. 19.17). He who rebukes his fellow, whether it be regarding a sin committed between man and man, or whether it be regarding matters between man and God, it is essential that the rebuke be administered only between them both; and he shall speak to him calmly, employing soft language, telling him that he does not speak of it to him, save for his own good, to bring him to a life in the world to come. If he receive it attentively from him, it is well; if not, he should rebuke him a second, even a third time. So is the constant duty of a man to continue to rebuke his fellow, even until the sinner strike him, and say unto him: "I will not listen". He in whose power it is to prevent sin and does not take the means to prevent it, he himself is ultimately overtaken by their sin, since it was possible for him to prevent them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat, 54a; Ibid. 119b; Baba Mezi’a 31a. C. G.</i>
He who rebukes a friend, at the beginning, no hard words should be used against him to shame him, for it is said: "And thou shalt bear no sin upon him" (Lev. 19.17). Thus did the wise men say: "Understand it not by rebuking him thou mayest cause his countenance to change expression; for, it is said: 'And thou shalt bear no sin upon him'" (Ibid.; Arakin, 16b); herefrom we learn that it is forbidden to put an Israelite to shame, needless to say publicly. Although he who does put his fellow to shame is not flogged, it is a grievous sin. Even so did the wise men say: "He who publicly puts his fellow's countenance to shame has no share in the world to come" (Pirke Abot, 3.11). A man is, therefore obliged to guard himself against putting his fellow to shame publicly, regardless of whether he be young or old; not to call him by a name of which he feels ashamed, nor tell aught in his presence of which he is ashamed. However, all these refer to matters touching the relationship between man and man; but if it concern heavenly matters, if the sinner does not repent after being rebuked privately, he should be shamed publicly, and his sin should be proclaimed, and harsh words should be used in his presence, and he should be shamed and cursed till he repent and take up the good path, even as all of the prophets in Israel did with the wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Mezi’a 59a; Yoma, 86b. C. G.</i>
He against whom a fellow sinned, who did not want to rebuke him, nor to speak aught to him, because the sinner is extremely common, or possessed of a distorted mind, but within his heart forgave him, and lodged no hatred against him, though he rebuked him not, behold, such is a pious conduct for, the Torah did not concern itself with aught save against hatred.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 16b. G.</i>
A man is obliged to watch out for orphans and widows, for their soul is very lowly, and their spirit humble even though they be wealthy in money, even though they be the widow and orphans of a king, we are charged concerning them, for it is said: "Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child" (Ex. 22.22.). What, then, are the rules of conduct toward them? One must not speak to them save in soft words; not to treat them in any way, save in an honorable way; not to pain their body with labor, nor their heart with hard words; to be careful with their money more than with the money of one's own self. He who worries them, or vexes them, or pains them, or masters them, or causes the loss of their money, violates a prohibitive commandment, needless to mention one who smites them or curses them. This prohibitive commandment, notwithstanding that the punishment of flogging is not inflicted for its violation, behold, the punishment therefor is plainly stated in the Torah: "My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword" (Ibid. 22.23). Moreover, He Who spoke and called the universe into being, made a covenant with them, that whenever they will cry out against violence, they shall be answered, even as it is said: "For if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry" (Ibid. 22.22). But all these warnings are applicable when one afflicts them out of a selfish motive; but if the master who, in order to instruct them in the Torah, or teach them a trade, or lead them in a righteous path, does inflict punishment upon them when they are contrary, behold, such he may do. Nevertheless, he should not follow the rules of other people in dealing with them but conduct himself toward them differently, to lead them slowly, with great mercy and honorable consideration, even as it is said: "For the Lord will plead their cause" (Prov. 22.23). Whether it be a fatherless orphan or a motherless orphan, the treatment to be accorded to them must be identical. Now, until when are such called orphans for the purpose of the subject treated herein? Until they will have no need to lean upon a grown-up person to rear them and support them, but each one be able to take care of all his personal needs even as all other adults do.

Chapter 7

He who bears tales against his fellow violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: "Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people" (Lev. 19.16.); and although the punishment of flogging is not inflicted for violating this charge, it is a gross iniquity, and is the cause of the slaughtering of many souls in Israel; it is because thereof, that following this commandment is this Verse: "Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor" (Ibid.). Now, go ye and learn of that which happened to Doeg the Edomite.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">First Samuel, 22.9-19. G.</i>
Who is a sycophant? One who loads himself up with matters, and goes from this one to that one, saying to each, such did that man say, thus and such have I heard concerning that man, even though it be true, behold him, he destroys the universe. There is yet an extremely grosser iniquity, which, too, is included in this prohibitive commandment, and that is, the evil tongue, one who spreads scandal about his fellow even though he be telling truth. If he be lying, he is called a maligner who invents an evil name against his fellow. The owner of an evil tongue, behold him, he sits in company and relates, saying: thus and such did that certain party, thus and such were his parents, and thus and such I did hear about him and of course, he relates scandalous matters. Of him, the Verse says: "May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things" (Ps. 12.4).
The wise men said: "There are three transgresssions which call forth retribution from the man who perpetrates in this world, and disinherit him from a share in the world to come. They are: idolatry, adultery, and bloodshed; but the evil tongue outweighs them all" (Arakin, 16b). The wise men, moreover, said:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Arakin, 16b. G.</i> "He who speaks with an evil tongue is like an atheist, for it is said: 'Who have said, Our tongues will we make mighty, our lips are with us, who is Lord over us'"? (Ps. 12.5.). And, again, the wise men said: "The evil tongue kills three persons, the one who speaks it, the one of whom it is spoken, and the one who receives it". In fact, the greatest harm comes to the one who receives the evil report.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.; Shabbat, 56. G.</i>
And, there are certain kinds of words which are the grinding of the evil tongue. For example: One will say, "Who will tell that person to be as he is now"? Or he will say: "Hold your peace concerning that person, I am disinclined to relate what happened, or what was", or like such expressions. Even he who tells the good qualities of his fellow in the presence of his fellow's enemies is making grinding of an evil tongue, because he calls forth his fellow's shame from the mouths of his enemies and concerning this subject Solomon said: "He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him" (Prov. 27.14). Out of his goodness for him, he brings about evil to him. Likewise, he who tells with an evil tongue under the guise of a joke, or lightheadedness, that is, he does not speak it in tones of hatred, even of him Solomon in his wisdom said: "As a madman who casteth firebrands, arrows and death; so is the man that deceiveth his neighbor and saith, 'Am not I in sport?'" (Ibid. 26 18–19.). Among such is also the one who uses an evil tongue deceitfully, relating innocently, as if ignorant that his speech be words of an evil tongue, but when there is a protest against what he says, he avers that he does not know that such tale is evil speech, or that such was really the conduct of that person.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Yeru. Pe’ah, 1; Shabbat, 33a. C. G.</i>
Regardless of whether the slander is spoken in the presence of his fellow, or in his absence, or if the slander spread from mouth to mouth cause harm to his fellow, to his body, or property, even to cause him anguish, or fear to his soul, behold this is the iniquity of an evil tongue. If such evil be spoken in the presence of three persons, the matter is thereby considered public. Thus, if one of the three who heard it repeat it to others no sin of an evil tongue is found therein, provided that in re-telling it he had no intention to spread the rumor and advertise it still more.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Arakin, 16b. C. G.</i>
All such are owners of an evil tongue, in whose neighborhood it is forbidden to dwell, needless to say to be in their company and listen to their words. The doom against our fathers in the wilderness was not sealed for aught else, save for that of an evil tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C.</i>
He who takes vengeance of his fellow violates the prohibitive commandment of, "Thou shalt not take vengeance" (Lev. 19.18.); and, even though he is not flogged for the violation, it is an extremely evil tendency. Forsooth, it becomes man to be indulgent in his ethical conduct in all temporal matters, for, to those who can reason all worldly matters are vanity and absurdity, unworthy to call forth vengeance on their account. How is the sin of taking vengeance established? Said his friend to him: "Lend me your ax". Answered he: "No, I will not lend it to you." On the morrow, he needs to borrow an ax himself. Says he to his friend: "Lend me your ax." Answered his friend: "No, I will not lend it to you, even as you refused to lend it to me when I asked for it." Behold, this one takes vengeance. For when one comes to lend aught of the other, he should give it to him whole-heartedly, and not to deal with him as he was dealt with by him. And so in all like matters. Even so David expressed it in his good ethical ideas: "If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness etc." (Ps. 7.5).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 23a; Rosh ha-Shanah, 17b; Sifra, Lev. 4. C. G.</i>
Likewise, whoso bears a grudge against one in Israel, violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: "Nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people" (Lev. 19.18.). How is the sin of bearing a grudge established? Said Reuben to Simeon: "Lease me this house, or lend me this ox." Simeon refused. After an interval comes Simeon to Reuben to lease or lend aught from him. Said Reuben to him: "Here, you may have it, behold, I am lending it to you, for I am not as you are, I will not pay you as you deserve." He who does so violates the prohibitive commandment of, "Thou shalt bear no grudge." For, he should blot the thing out of his heart completely, and not lodge it therein. Forsooth, as long as he bears the matter and remembers it, he might be tempted to take vengeance. It is on account of this that the Torah is particular concerning the bearing of a grudge to blot such sin out of his heart and not remember it at all. This, is the proper ethical idea which makes possible the stability of organized society and the business relationship between man and man upon earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Megillah, 2G.</i>
