Mishneh Torah, Repentance



Chapter 1

With regard to all the commandments, which are contained in the law, whether they be positive or negative commandments, if a man happen to trespass against any one of them, either presumptuously or through ignorance, he is bound to confess before God, blessed be He! when he repents and turns from his sin; for it is said:<i> When a man or woman shall commit, etc.,... Then they shall confess their sin which they have done</i>, (Numb. 5. 6, 7). By which is meant verbal confession. Now this confession is a positive commandment. But how ought we to confess?—We ought to say thus: “I beseech Thee, O God! I have sinned; I have done perversely; I have committed wickedness before Thee, and I have done so and so; and behold! I repent and am ashamed of my doings, and I will never relapse into these sins again.” This is the principle formula of confession; and the more amply one confesses and expatiates on the matter the more praiseworthy it is. And also, with regard to those who bring sin-offerings or trespass offerings; at the time when they offer their sacrifices, for their ignorance or for their presumption, their sacrifice does not atone for them, unless they repent and confess in distinct words; for it is said: <i>He shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing</i>, (Lev. 5. 5). Likewise with regard to those who are sentenced to death by a court of justice, or who are sentenced to stripes, their suffering death or their corporal chastisement does not atone for them, unless they repent and confess. Moreover if one inflicts a wound on his fellow creature, or if he cause him any pecuniary damage, although he pay him what he owes him, this does not atone for him, unless he con fess and refrain from ever doing so again; for it is said: <i>Any sin that men commit, etc.,”</i> (Numb. 5. 6).
With regard to the scape-goat, as it was intended as an atonement for the whole of Israel, the high priest confessed over it in the name of the whole of Israel; for it is said: <i>And confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel</i>, (Lev. 16. 21). Now the scape-goat atoned for all the transgressions mentioned in the Divine law, slight as well as important; whether one transgressed presumptuously or through ignorance; whether he was made aware of it, or was not made aware of it; the scape-goat still atoned for every thing, provided he repented; but if he did not repent, then the scape-goat atoned only for his slight transgressions. But now, which are said to be slight, and which heavy? The heavy ones are those for which one <i>deserves death by the court of justice</i> or <i>excision.</i> Moreover vain and false oaths, (though the punishment of <i>excision</i> is not attached to them), yet they also are important transgressions; but all other commandments, negative as well as positive, to which no punishment of <i>excision</i> is attached, are said to be slight ones.
Now in our days, when the house of sanctuary exists no longer, and when we have no atoning altar—there is nothing left for us but repentance. Repentance, however, atones for all transgressions. Even he who has been wicked through the whole of his days, if at the end he repent—not the least part of his wickedness is recorded against him; for it is said: <i>As for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness</i>, (Ezek. 33. 12). Yea, the very nature of the day of atonement is to atone for the penitent; for it is said: <i>For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you</i>, (Lev. 16. 30).
Although repentance atones for every thing, and although the very nature of the day of atonement is to atone, there are still transgressions, which may be atoned for immediately; and also transgressions, which cannot be atoned for until a certain time has elapsed. For instance, if a man transgress any <i>positive</i> commandment to which the punishment of <i>excision</i> is not attached, and repent of it—he is pardoned immediately; and with regard to such men, it is said: <i>Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings, etc.</i>, (Jer. 3. 22). Again if one transgress a negative commandment, to which neither the punishment of <i>excision</i>, nor that of <i>death by the court of justice</i> is attached, and repent of it—then repentance causes a suspension of Divine wrath, and the day of atonement atones for it; and with respect to such men, it is said: <i>for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you</i>, (Lev. 16. 30). But if one transgress a commandment to which the punishment of <i>excision</i> or <i>death by the court of justice</i> is attached, and repent of it—then repentance, together with the day of atonement, causes the suspension, and the afflictions which come upon him, render the atonement complete; indeed his atonement can never be complete, unless afflictions come upon him; and with regard to such sinners, it is said:<i> Then will I visit their transgression with the rod</i>, (Ps. 89. 32). All this however only applies to cases in which he did not profane the name of God, at the time when he transgressed, but he who profanes the name of God, although he repent, and although the day of atonement arrive whilst he is still persevering in his repentance, yea although afflictions come upon him, still his atonement is not complete until he die; so that with such a sinner, repentance, the day of atonement, and afflictions, cause merely suspension of judgment, and death alone makes the atonement complete; for it is said: <i>And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts</i>, SURELY THIS INIQUITY SHALL NOT BE PURGED FROM YOU TILL YE DIE, (Isai. 22. 14).

Chapter 2

What constitutes perfect repentance?—If an occasion in which a man has once transgressed occurs again, and when he moreover has it in his power to commit the same offence again, and he yet shrinks back from it, and does not commit it solely from repentance, and not out of fear or impotence. For instance; if one who once had a criminal intercourse with a woman; now if after a lapse of time he happen to have again a private meeting with her, (whilst still persevering in his love to her, and whilst still possessing his full bodily power; moreover whilst still in the same country where he once sinned with her)—if then he shrink back from her, and do not commit the sin—such an one is a true penitent; and this is what Solomon said: <i>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth</i>, (Eccles. 12. 1). However if one repent only in his old age, or at a time when it is no longer in his power to do that which he was in the habit of doing; although this is certainly not genuine repentance, yet it still avails him, and he is still said to be a penitent. Though even he may have been a transgressor all his life, yet if he repent but on the day before his death, so that he die a penitent, all his sins are pardoned; for it is said:<i> While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain</i>, (Eccles. 12. 2); which is an allusion to the day of death. Whence we infer that if the sinner remember but his Creator and repent, before he dies, he is still pardoned.
Now what is that repentance to consist in?—In this, that the sinner forsake his sin, and remove it from his thoughts; moreover that he resolve in his heart, never to do it again; for it is said: <i>Let the wicked forsake his way</i>, (Isai. 55. 7). He also ought to be sorry for the past; for it is said: <i>Surely after that I was turned, I repented</i>, (Jer. 31. 19). And he ought also to call to witness Him who knoweth all secrets, that he will never return to this sin again; for it is said: <i>Neither will we say any more to the work of our hands: Ye are our gods, etc.</i> (Hos. 14. 3). Moreover it is necessary that he make a verbal confession, and that he utter with his mouth the contrite resolutions of his heart.
He who confesses with words, without having resolved in his heart to forsake his sins, he is compared to one who dips in water, by way of performing the necessary purification, whilst holding the unclean animal in his hand, when his dipping can avail him nothing, unless he throw away the unclean animal; for so it is said: <i>But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy</i>, (Prov. 28. 13). Moreover it is necessary to name distinctly his sin; for it is said: <i>Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold</i>, (Exod. 32. 31).
It is also the usual course of repentance, that the penitent should cry unremittingly to the Lord, with weepings and entreaties; that he should exercise charity as much as is in his power; that he should remove very far from the object of his transgression, and that he should alter his name, just as if he were to say: I am quite another person, and not the same man who committed those actions; moreover that he should altogether alter his actions for the better, and in a direction towards the way of righteousness; and also that he should wander from his settled place; for exile atones a man’s iniquity, inasmuch as it causes him to give way, and to become meek and humble-minded.
It is also very commendable in the penitent to confess before a multitude of persons, and to make known unto them his transgressions; also to reveal to others the offences existing between himself and his fellow creatures, saying unto them: Surely I have offended such and such an one, and I have done unto him so and so; but I now repent of, and deeply regret it. But he who is proud, and does not make his transgressions public, and conceals the same —his repentance is no true repentance; for it is said: <i>He that covereth his sins shall not prosper</i>, (Prov. 28. 13). This however refers only to transgressions between man and man; but with regard to transgressions between man and God, he need not make them public, and indeed it would be affrontery in him if he were to make public the same; and therefore in such a case he need only repent before God, blessed be He! and name his sins to Him alone, but in public his confession ought to be a general one. Indeed it is well for him that his sin should not transpire; for it is said: <i>Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered</i>, (Ps. 32. 1).
Although repentance and praying aloud are at all times commendable, they are still more so during the ten days intervening the new year’s day and the day of atonement, as then they (the supplications of the penitent) are accepted forthwith; for it is said: <i>Seek ye the Lord while He may be found</i>, (Isai. 55. 6). This however applies only to an individual; but as to a congregation, whenever these repent and pray aloud with all their hearts, they are listened to; for it is said:<i> As the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for</i>, (Deut. 4. 7 ).
The day of atonement however is the proper time for repentance for all, both for individuals and the public, as being the ultimate time of pardon and forgiveness to Israel. Every one is therefore bound to repent and to confess on the day of atonement. And with regard to confessing on the day of atonement, we are commanded that it (the confession) should begin on the day preceding that day, and before eating the evening meal, lest death overtakes him before he has confessed. But although one has confessed already before eating the evenings meal, he ought to confess again in the evening of the night preceding the day of atonement, and likewise to confess again in the morning prayer, additional prayer, oblation prayer, and closing prayer. But now where (<i>i. e.</i> at which part of the prayer), ought the confession to be made?—An individual ought to confess after his prayer (<b>Shmonah Esreh</b>, eighteen blessings), and the reader in the midst of his prayer, namely at the fourth blessing.
The formula of confession used amongst Israel, is this: <i>Surely we have all of us sinned, etc.</i>, this being the principle formula of confession. The transgressions which one confesses on one day of atonement, he ought to confess again on the day of atonement following, even though he may have been firm in his repentance during the whole of the intermediate time; for it is said: <i>For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me</i>, (Ps. 51. 5).
Repentance and the day of atonement atone only for transgressions between man and God; such, for instance, as eating a thing which is forbidden, or having unlawful sexual inter course, and the like transgressions; but with regard to offences between man and man, for instance, if one bodily injures or curses his fellow man, or robs him, and the like offences, he is never pardoned until he restores to him that which he owes him, and until he appeases him. For although he restore to the other the money which he owed him, it is still necessary to appease him, and to entreat his pardon. Even though he have only provoked him with words, it is necessary to appease him, and to urge him with entreaties, until he pardon him. Should he however not be willing to pardon him, he ought to bring with him a company of three of his friends, in order that these may urge, and beg pardon in his behalf; should the offended party still not be reconciled, he ought to bring a second, and even a third company of friends; but should the other still be unwilling to grant his pardon, he may leave him and betake himself away, and then the one who refuses pardon, becomes the sinner. However if the offended party happen to be his teacher, (<i>i. e.</i> his religious instructor), he must repeat his entreaties even a thousand times, until he obtains his pardon.
It is not lawful for a man to be cruel and inexorable; he should be easily moved to reconciliation, and with difficulty moved to anger; so that when the man who offended him entreats his pardon, he should forgive with a perfect heart and benevolent mind. Even though the other have seriously oppressed or offended him, still he ought not to avenge himself, nor to bear a grudge; this forbearance being the characteristic of the benevolence of mind in the seed of Israel; but with regard to idolators who are of uncircumcised hearts, these are not so, but they keep their wrath for ever; and so it is said with regard to the Gibeonites, in consequence of their not having forgiven and of their having shown themselves unrelenting: <i>Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel,</i> (II Sam. 21. 2).
If one offended another, and the other happen to die before the offender has entreated his pardon, he ought to take with him ten men, and place them over the other’s grave, and say before them these words: I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and also against this man, having done unto him so and so. Moreover if he owed the other money, he ought to restore it to his heirs: if, so far as he knows, the other have no heirs, he ought to deposit it in a court of justice, and also make his confession. 

Chapter 3

Every man has his merits and his failings. He whose meritorious deeds exceed his sins is a righteous man, and he whose wicked deeds preponderate his good deeds, is <i>a wicked man</i>, and he whose merits and failings are equally balanced, belongs to the <i>intermediate class.</i> Also with regard to a whole country, if the good deeds of its inhabitants generally exceed their wicked deeds, it may be termed a righteous country; but if the wicked deeds preponderate, it is a wicked country. And so it is with regard to the whole world.
The man whose wicked deeds exceed his good ones, dies in consequence of his wickedness; for it is said: <i>For the multitude of thine iniquity</i>, (Hos. 9. 7); also a country, whose wicked deeds preponderate, perishes; for it is in consequence thereof said: <i>Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, etc.</i>, (Gen. 18. 20). —And so it is with regard to the inhabitants of the whole world, viz., if their wicked deeds exceed their good ones, they are doomed to immediate destruction; for it is said; <i>And God saw that the wickedness of man was great</i>, (Gen. 6. 5). However the balancing of the merits and failings of man is not according to numbers but according to importance; so that there may be one good deed which neutralizes many wicked ones; for it is said: <i>Because in him there is found some good thing</i>, (1 Kings 14. 13); and again there may be one wicked deed which sets aside many good ones; for it is said: <i>But one sinner destroyeth much good</i>, (Eccles. 9. 18). They (the deeds of a man) can therefore be balanced by the knowledge of the God of knowledge only, and it is He alone who knows how to estimate the good deeds against the wicked ones.
He who regrets having fulfilled the commandments, and who is sorry for his good deeds, saying to himself: What profit have I in having fulfilled the same!—this man has altogether undone his previous good deeds, and no merit of his whatever will be remembered to him; for it is said: <i>The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression</i>, (Ezek. 33. 12); which applies to him who is sorry for his former good deeds. Now in the same way as merits and failings are balanced at the hour of death, so are also the wicked deeds of every one that exists in this world, balanced against his good ones, every year, on the festival of the new year’s day. He who is found to be a righteous man, is decreed to live, and he who is found to be a wicked man is decreed to die; again he who belongs to the intermediate class, his judgment is suspended until the day of atonement; if he repent, he is decreed to live, and if not, he is doomed to die.
Although the blowing of the trumpet on the new year’s day is an ordinance of Scripture, it also bears a symbolical significance, as if calling: Ye sleepers, awake from your sleep; and ye who are in a deep slumber, arise; search into your actions, turn with repentance, and remember your Creator!—Ye who have become forgetful of truth by pursuing things that are vain and transient, and who have been absorbed the whole year in vain and idle matters, which can neither avail nor deliver you, look after your souls, mend your manners and your deeds; and may every one of you forsake his wicked way and his ungodly thoughts. Every man ought therefore to look upon himself during the whole year as though his merits and failings were equally balanced, and also to look upon the whole world as though it were half innocent and half guilty; now if he commit but ONE sin more, then by this single sin he causes the scale of guilt to preponderate, both with regard to himself and to the whole world; and consequently brings destruction upon it; on the other hand, if he fulfils but one single commandment more, then by this single good deed, he causes the scale of innocence to preponderate both with regard to himself and to the whole world, and consequently brings salvation and deliverance both upon himself and them, as it is said: <i>But the righteous is an everlasting foundation</i>, (Prov. 10. 25), meaning that: This man, by acting righteously, causes the innocence of the whole world to preponderate, and by this means brings about the deliverance of the same. For this reason have the house of Israel made it a practice to multiply their charitable and good deeds, and to occupy themselves with religious actions from the new year’s day to the day of atonement, even more than in the other days of the year. They have moreover made it a general practice to rise, during these ten days in the night time, and to pray in the synagogues with words of supplication and fervent entreaties until day-light.
All the wicked men, though their sins be numerous, judgment is pronounced according to their sins, but yet they have a claim to future bliss, in which all Israel participate, although they have sinned; for it is said:<i> Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever</i>, (Isai. 60. 21); here the expression<i> land</i> figuratively represents the future and <i>everlasting life.</i> Also the pious of other nations participate in the felicity of future life.
These however (<i>i.e.</i> sinners of the following description), have no claims to the blessings of the world that is to come, but they are cut off, destroyed and condemned for ever and ever, in consequence of their great wickedness and sinfulness; namely, heretics; they who deny the <i>law;</i> they who deny the resurrection of the dead and the coming of the Redeemer; apostates; they who cause the public to sin; they who depart from the moral and religious practices of the congregation; he who trespasses presumptuously and openly like Jehoiakim; informers; they who keep the congregation in awe, not for any religious purpose, but for their private interest; they who shed blood; slanderers; he who violates the Abrahamic covenant.
There are five descriptions of Israelites that are called <b>minim,</b> lnfidels; namely, he who says, that there is no God and no Providence; he who says that there is at Providence, but that this Providence consists of two or more Deities; he who says, that there is indeed only one God, but that he is corporeal and has a similitude; he who says, that He (God) is not the only first being and the Rock of the whole universe; and also he who worships besides Him, some star or planet, that the same may become an intercessor between himself and the Lord of the universe. Now every one of these five descriptions of Israelites, is called a <b>min</b>.
There are also three descriptions of Israelites, that are called <b>Apicursim;</b> namely, he who says, that there is altogether no prophecy, and that there is no kind of knowledge which, emanating from the Creator, enters into the minds of the sons of men; he who denies the prophecy of Moses, our Teacher; and also he who says, that the Creator has no knowledge of the actions of the sons of men. Every one of these three is called <b>Apicurus.</b> Again there are three descriptions of Israelites, who are deniers of the Divine law; namely, he who says that the law is not from the Lord; even if he say of one single verse, or of one single word only, that it was invented by Moses himself, (and not dictated to him by God), such a man denies the law. Likewise he who denies the interpretation thereof which constitutes the oral law, or he who denies the authority of its promulgators, as Zaduck and Bythos did; and also he who says, that the Creator has changed one law for another, so that this law is already abolished, although it was originally from the Lord. Every one of these three descriptions is a denier of the Divine law.
There are two descriptions of <i>transgressors</i>, among the Israelites; namely, he who transgresses only one commandment, and again he who transgresses the whole law. By one who transgresses only one commandment, we understand him who persists in committing that one transgression presumptuously, habituates himself to it, and becomes notorious for the same; even though it be one of the less important transgressions; for instance, if he continually persist in wearing garments of “divers sorts,” or in “rounding the corners of his head,” and consequently to him this commandment is just as though it were altogether abolished; then he is a transgressor in this matter, provided that he does it with the intention of provoking God. By a transgressor against the whole law, we understand those who apostatise to the creed of the idolaters at the time of religious persecution, and adhere to them (<i>i. e.</i> to the idolaters), saying: Of what benefit will it be to me to adhere to the Israelites who are humbled and persecuted?—It will be better for me to adhere to these idolators whose power is uppermost, such a man is a transgressor against the whole of the Divine law.
With regard to those who cause the public to sin, it is the same, whether one cause others to sin in important matters, as Jeroboam, Zaduck and Bythos did; or whether one cause others to sin in slighter matters, ever though it be only in setting aside any positive commandment; or whether one force others to sin, as Manasseh did, who slew the Israelites unless they submitted to worship idols; or whether one delude others, and thrust them away (from the service of the true God, by wicked insinuations, though not by force).
He who departs from the moral and religious practices of the congregation, though he commits no real transgression, but only separates from the congregation of Israel, so that he neither fulfils the commandments in common with them, nor sympathizes with them when they are in distress, nor fasts on their fast days, but takes his own self-willed course, just as if he were not one of them, such a man has forfeited his claim to future bliss. He who commits transgressions presumptuously like Jehoiakim, whether slight or important ones, has no share in the blessings of the world to come. Moreover such an one is said to be boldly perverting the Divine law; inasmuch as he was brazenfaced enough unblushingly to violate the sacred law.
There are two descriptions of informers, namely, he who by his information delivers up his fellow-man into the hands of cruel Pagans to be slain or smitten; and again he who delivers up the property of his fellow-man into the hands of an idolator or into the hands of one of the Israelites that has been forced to embrace Paganism, which is the same as if he were a Pagan himself. Now both these descriptions of informers have no share in the blessings of the world to come.
By him who keeps the congregation in awe, not for any religious purpose we understand, one who rules over a congregation by force, so that they stand in awe of him, and fear him greatly, whilst the object he has in view is merely that of gratifying his ambition, and not that of delighting in the glory of Heaven.
Now of these twenty-four descriptions of men which we have enumerated in this Chapter, though they be Israelites, none have a share in the blessings of the world that is to come. There are, however, transgressions less serious than those mentioned above, but still according to the opinion of the sages, he who habituates himself to these sins, has no share in the blessings of the world to come. And indeed they are serious enough to be shunned and carefully avoided. The following are the sins alluded to:—He who gives his fellow-man a degrading by-name, or he who calls his fellow-man by a degrading by-name given by others; he who puts the face of his fellow-man to the blush in public; he who glories in the disgrace of his fellow-man; he who despises scholars, [men that are learned in the law of God]; he who despises his teachers, (<i>i. e.</i> his religious instructors); he who violates the festival days; and he who pollutes consecrated things. What we have said here however, namely, that none of these sinners have a share in the blessings of the world to come—holds good only when he (the sinner) dies without repentance; but if he turn from his wickedness, and die a penitent, then such a man has a share in the blessings of the world to come, for there is nothing which cannot be atoned for by repentance; even though one were to deny the radical religious principle all his life, still if he repent at the end, he has a share in the blessings of the world to come; for it is said: <i>Peace, Peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him</i>, (Isai, 57. 19). Indeed all wicked men, sinners, transgressors, and the like, if they turn but with repentance, whether publicly or secretly, are accepted; for it is said, <i>Return ye backsliding children</i>, (Jer. 3. 22.); meaning that although one be still considered by others as a backslider, inasmuch he has only turned secretly and not publicly, he is yet accepted in consequence of his repentance.

Chapter 4

There are four and twenty causes which prevent man from becoming penitent. Moreover four of these being serious offences, the Holy One, blessed be He! does not suffer him who commits any of them to become a penitent, for this very reason, that his offence is of too serious a nature; the following are the sins alluded to:—1. He who causes the public to sin; and to this class of offenders he also belongs, who prevents the public from fulfilling any one of the Divine commandments. 2. He who causes his fellow-man to turn aside from the good to the wicked way, as, for instance, the seducer and enticer, (Deut. 13). 3. He who sees his son degenerating into vice, and yet does not check him in his career, whilst his son being under his control, might have been reclaimed, had he been restrained in time; and consequently the father is the real cause of this sinfulness. To this class of offenders he also belongs, who has it in his power to restrain others (not his children), whether an individual or a multitude, and yet does not restrain them, but suffers them to stumble. 4. He who says to himself: I will sin now and afterwards repent. To this class he also belongs who says to himself: I well sin now, but the day of atonement will atone for it.
Again there are five causes including the twenty-four sins mentioned at the head of this Chapter, which shut up the ways of repentance to him who practises them; they are the following:—1. He who separates from the congregation; because he does not participate in the course of their repentance, and consequently he will not be benefited in common with them by their merits. 2. He who gainsays the words of the sages; because such refutation causes him to separate from them, and remain ignorant of the nature of repentance. 3. He who scorns the Divine commandments; for as soon as these are despised by him, he will neither seek after them nor fulfil them; and if he do not fulfil them, by what means can he cleanse himself?— 4. He who despises his religious instructors; because this will cause the instructor to discard and expel him, as Gehazi was expelled by his master. Being thus expelled, he will scarcely find a teacher to guide him in the way of truth. 5. He who hates rebuke; by which he has left to himself no opening for repentance; it being rebuke only which gives rise to repentance, inasmuch as at the time when a man is made aware of his sins, and is put to shame for them, he may turn penitently, as it is written in the law: <i>Remember, and forget not</i>,... YE HAVE BEEN REBELLIOUS, (Deut. 9. 7); <i>Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart</i>, (Deut. 29. 4); <i>O foolish people and unwise</i>, (Deut. 32. 6); (all these being expressions of rebuke intended to call forth repentance). In the same way Isaiah also rebuked the Israelites and said: <i>Ah sinful nation</i>, (Isai 1. 4). <i>The ox knoweth his owner</i>, (lsai. 1. 3). <i>Because I knew that thou art obstinate</i>, (Isai. 48. 4). And indeed God commanded him (Isaiah) to rebuke sinners; for it is said: <i>Cry aloud, spare not</i>, (lsai. 58. 1). Moreover all the other prophets also rebuked Israel until they turned penitently. For this reason it is necessary that in every congregation of Israel, a wise, great and old man, who has feared God from his youth, and who is beloved by the people, should be raised on purpose that he may rebuke the multitude and that he may cause them to turn penitently; but now he who hates rebuke will neither come to the admonisher nor hearken to his words; and consequently he will persevere in his sins, which appear to him harmless.
Again there are five sins included in the above twenty-four, from which he who commits them, cannot possibly turn with true repentance, inasmuch as they consist of offences between man and man, in cases when he (the offender) does not know enough of the person offended to be able to make amends to him, or to entreat his pardon. They are the following: 1. He who curses a multitude of men; without having specified any one in particular, that he might have been so able to ask forgiveness of him. 2. He who without committing the theft himself, shares in the produce with the thief; because he cannot know to whom the thing stolen, belonged, it being the thief alone who stole the same from various men, and who brought it to him, so that he only bought it of the thief, (and consequently, how shall he know to whom he ought to make restoration, or of whom he ought to ask forgiveness for the offence?). Moreover by purchasing stolen goods he encourages the thief, and consequently causes him to sin. 3. He who finds a thing which was lost, and has it not advertised, so as to be enabled to restore it to its owner; for should he even after a lapse of time happen to become a penitent, he will still not know to whom he ought to restore the thing. 4. He who lives by the spoil of the poor, orphans, or widows. Now these being a class of people who are dejected and not well known, and who moreover are sometimes reduced to wander from one city to another, it may so happen that there will be no one who knows any thing of them, and of whom he (the spoiler) can learn to whom that spoil belongs, and to whom he ought to make amends for the same should he one day become a penitent. 5. He who takes a bribe to pervert judgment; because he cannot precisely know how far this perversion may extend, or what consequences the same may have, so that he might have been able to make amends for it, for it being a question of law, and may have a variety of bearings, he will construe in favour of his judgment.
Again among these twenty-four there are five sins for which the offender is not likely ever to become a penitent, because by the generality of men they are looked upon to be trifling matters, and consequently one may sin by committing the same, and yet imagine that it is no sin. They are the following: 1. He who partakes as a guest of a repast, which he knows is not sufficient even for his host alone; now this is indeed indirect injury, and yet he may fancy that he commits no sin, saying to himself: Surely I have not eaten without his (the host’s) permission!—2. He who uses for his own advantage the pledge of a poor man; now as the pledge of a poor man consists commonly of tools, such for instance as his axe or plough-share, he may say to himself: They have lost nothing of their value, and therefore I have not injured him; (and consequently he will never think of indemnifying the poor man for the loss which he has sustained). 3. He who with a lustful eye looks at women whom, by law he is forbidden to marry; now he may imagine that there is nothing wrong in it, and say to himself: Did I cohabit with her? or did I even approach her? —not knowing that a lustful look is a great sin, inasmuch as it may lead a man to the very crime of lewdness, as it is said: <i>And that ye seek not after your own heart and</i> YOUR OWN EYES, (Numb. 15. 39). 4. He who glories in the disgrace of his fellow-man; because he may say to himself, that this is no sin, since his fellow-man was not present to witness his exultation, and consequently could not feel any shame on that account; moreover that he did not absolutely put him to shame, as he was merely comparing his own good actions, or his own wisdom, with the actions or the wisdom of his fellow-man, in such a manner as to leave it to be inferred, that he is a respectable man, and that his fellow-man is a contemptible person; and so not being aware of the offence, he will never think of repenting of the same. 5. He who suspects an honest man, may perchance think in his heart, that he is not a sinner on that account, saying to himself: What have I done unto him?—Was there on my part any thing more than a mere suspicion?—inasmuch as I only said: perhaps he has done that which I suspected him of—and perhaps he has not done it; not knowing that this very suspicion is a sin; because in his mind he regards an innocent man as a transgressor.
And again among these twenty- four there are five sins of such a nature that he who commits the same will always be addicted to them, so that at the end it will be difficult for him to renounce them. A man ought therefore to be very careful lest he cleave to them, seeing that they are all of them exceedingly wicked propensities; they are the following; talebearing; a bad tongue (opprobrious language); to be given to passion; to harbour wicked imaginations; and lastly to associate with the wicked; because one is apt to learn to imitate those wicked actions, when they have once become impressed on the heart; this is what Solomon said: <i>But a companion of fools shall be destroyed</i>, (Prov. 13. 20). Now in the <i>Precepts relating to the government of the temper</i>, we have stated already the rules which every man ought to practise; but how much more ought he to practise them who is a penitent!
All these and the like sins however, although they may retard a man from becoming a penitent, cannot altogether deprive him of that benefit, but on the contrary if one who has committed these sins repent of the same, he is actually entitled to all the merits of a penitent, and has a share in the blessings of the world to come.


Chapter 5

Free-will is granted to every man. If he desire to incline towards the good way, and to become a righteous man, he has the power to do so; and if he desire to incline towards the wicked way, and to become a wicked man, he has also the power to do so. This is what is written in the law: <i>Behold! the man is become as one of Us, to know good and evil</i>, (Gen. 3. 22); which signifies that the human race are become unique in this world; inasmuch as there is not another kind of living creature equal to them in this respect, namely, in knowing by itself, by its own knowledge and by its own reflection, what is good and what is evil; and moreover in being able to do all that it wishes, without there being any one to prevent it from doing that which is good or that which is evil; and now this being so, Scripture says: <i>Lest he put forth his hand, etc.</i>, (Gen. 3. 22).
Give no room in your minds to that which is asserted by the fools of other nations, and also by the greater part of the uninformed men among the Israelites themselves, namely; that the Holy One, blessed be He! decrees that a man, from his birth, should be either a righteous man or a wicked man. The fact is by no means so; but on the contrary, every man is fit to be, as righteous a man as Moses our Teacher, or as wicked a man as Jeroboam; a wise man or a fool; a charitable man or a cruel man; a miser or a liberal man; and so it is with regard to all other dispositions. Moreover there is no one who compels, determines, or forcibly draws him to either of the two ways, but it is man himself, who by his own knowledge inclines toward the way which he likes best. This is what Jeremiah said: <i>Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not evil and good</i>, (Lam. 3. 38); meaning, that the Creator does not decree that a man should be either good or wicked. Hence it follows that the sinner himself is the cause of his own ruin; it therefore befits him to weep and lament over his sin, and to grieve for having done this to his own soul, by dealing so wickedly with the same. This is what follows immediately the above passage:<i> Wherefore doth a living man complain, etc.</i> And then he (the Prophet Jeremiah) says again: Since the power of doing good or evil is in our own hands, and since all the wicked deeds which we have committed have been committed with our full consciousness, it befits us to turn penitently and to forsake our wickedness; the power of doing so being still in our own hands. This is what follows immediately that passage: <i>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord</i>, (Lam. 3. 40).
Now this is a very important religious principle; indeed it is the pillar of the law and of the commandments, as it is said: <i>See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil</i>, (Deut. 30. 15); and again it is written: <i>Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse</i>, (Deut. 11. 26); signifying that the power of doing good or evil is in your hands, and that any of the actions which are within the reach of men, he has free agency to choose between good and evil. And for this reason it is also said: <i>O that there were such an heart in them</i>, (Deut. 5. 29); by which it was meant to express: that the Creator neither compels the sons of men, nor decrees that they should do either good or evil, but that all this is left to themselves.
If God were to decree that a man should be either righteous or wicked, or if there were any thing in the nature of his nativity which could attract a man to any one of the two ways, (<i>i. e.</i> to the good or wicked way), or to incline him to any particular opinion, to any particular disposition, or to any particular action, as those foolish star-gazers invent in their own minds how could He have commanded us through the medium of the prophets: Do this, and avoid that; mend your ways, and go not after your wickedness; if he (the man) was, from his very nativity doomed, or, if he is involuntarily drawn by his nature, to one alternative which he has no power to resist?—Now what stand-point would there have been for the whole of the Divine law?-—And by what justice, or by what right, could He punish the wicked man, or reward the righteous?-— SHALL NOT THE JUDGE OF ALL THE EARTH DO RIGHT?—You must not however be astounded and object: How can a man do all that he desires? and how can his actions be left to himself? whereas, he can do nothing in the world without the permission and will of his heavenly Possessor? as Scripture says: <i>Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did He in heaven and in earth</i>, (Ps. 135. 6)?—The answer is: Know, that every thing is actually done by His pleasure, although our actions are left to ourselves. But how is this compatible?—In the same way as it was the pleasure of the Creator, that fire and air should have an ascending power, that water and earth should have a descending power, that the orb should move in a circle, and also that all other things that were created in the universe, should have such tendencies as pleased the Creator, so was it also His pleasure that a man should be possessed of free will, that all his actions should be left to himself, and that there should not be any thing to compel or involuntarily attract him, but that he, by himself, and by the knowledge imparted to him by God, should be able to do all that a man can do. And for this reason is man judged according to his actions; if he do that which is good, good is done unto him; and if he do that which is evil, evil is done unto him. This is what the prophet says: <i>This hath been by</i> YOUR <i>means</i>, (Mal 1. 9). <i>Yea, they have chosen their own ways</i>, (Isai. 66. 3). In the same spirit Solomon says: <i>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth...but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment</i>, (Eccles. 11. 9); signifying: Know thou that the power is in thine own hands to do what thou pleasest, but that in future thou shalt have to give an account of thy doings.
Perchance you will again object: Does not the Holy one, blessed be He! know all that which is to happen? He therefore either must have known, even before it came to pass, that such and such a man would be righteous or wicked, or He must not have known it; now if he knew that such a man would be righteous, then it was impossible for him not to be righteous; for if we were to say: that although He knew that he would be a righteous man, it was still possible for him to be a wicked man, then He did not know the thing to perfection? To this we answer, Know that with regard to the discussion of this problem, <i>“the measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea,”</i> and that many principles of the greatest importance, and of sublime magnitude are pending thereon, but the following remark must be well considered: It has already been explained by us in the second Chapter of <i>the Precepts relating to the foundations of the law</i>, that the Holy One, blessed be He! does not know things by a knowledge distinct from Himself, as men do; for they and their knowledge are two distinct things; but He (whose name be exalted!) and His knowledge, are one. Now this idea, the mind of man is not able perfectly to comprehend; and in the same way as it is not in the power of man to comprehend or to find out the essentiality of the Creator, as it is said: <i>For there shall no man see Me, and live</i>, (Exod. 33. 20), so neither is it in the power of man to comprehend or fathom the KNOWLEDGE of the Creator (<i>i. e.</i> the manner in which He knows things); this is what the prophet says: FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS, <i>neither are your ways My ways</i>, (Isai. 55. 8); now this being the fact, it must be admitted that we have not the power of understanding how the Holy One, blessed be He! knows all creatures and their doings; but this we undoubtedly know, that the actions of man are in his own power, and that the Holy One, blessed be He! neither forces him nor predetermines his actions. This fact is not ascertained by revelation only, but also by clear scientific demonstrations. Now in consequence of this principle it was announced to us in prophecy, that a man will be judged for all his actions, according to their nature, whether they be good or evil; this being the principle on which all the words of prophecy are based. 

Chapter 6

There are many verses in the Divine law as well as in the words of the Prophets, which apparently oppose this principle (namely, the principle of free-will established in the preceding Chapter), so that they are a stumbling-block to the generality of men; and some are even led by them to entertain the opinion, that the Holy One, blessed be He! decrees that a man should do good or evil, and that the heart of a man is by no means under his own control, to incline it which way he pleases. I shall therefore explain one important principle, by which you will know the true meaning of all those verses. At the time when an individual, or when the inhabitants of a country happen to sin; moreover when the sin is committed with a full consciousness of the same on the part of the sinner, and with his free-will, as previously stated; it is but just to punish him for it; and it is the Holy One, blessed be He! who knows in what manner to punish him. Some sins there are, for which justice requires that the sinner should be punished in this world, namely, by inflicting the penalty either on his body, or his property...Again some sins there are for which justice requires that the sinner should be punished in the world that is to come only, and that no hurt whatever should be done unto him in this world. And again some sins there are for which the sinner is punished both in this world, and in the world to come.
The above applies only to a case when the sinner does not repent; but if he do repent, then repentance serves him as a shield to protect him from punishment. Now in the same way as a man sins with his full consciousness and with his free-will, so he must also repent with his full consciousness and with his free-will.
It may however also happen that man commit so great a sin, or many sins, so that the judge of truth may deem it right, that the punishment of that sinner, for the sins thus committed with his own free-will and full consciousness, should consist in PREVENTING HIM FROM BECOMING A PENITENT, by not granting him the power of turning from his wickedness, in order that he may die and perish by the sin which he committed—This is that which the Holy One, blessed be He! has pronounced through the medium of Isaiah: <i>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed</i>, (lsai. 6.10); it is also said: <i>But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and misused His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people, till there was no remedy</i>, (2 Chron. 36. 16); implying, that they sinned with their own free-will; but then their transgressions were so many, that they deserved to be prevented from benefiting themselves by the atoning power of repentance, which would have been the remedy necessary for them. Upon this principle Scripture, says: <i>And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart</i>, (Exod. 14. 4.); for Pharaoh having first sinned by himself (i.e. with his free will), in having dealt so wickedly with the Israelites who were sojourning in his land, as it is said: <i>Come on, let us deal wisely with them</i>, (Exod. 1. 10), justice required, that he should be prevented from becoming a penitent, in order that punishment might be inflicted on him; and for this reason the Holy One, blessed be He! hardened his heart. But, it may be objected, why then did He send word to him by Moses, saying: Let My people go and repent; whereas the Holy One, blessed be He! had already said to him: I know that thou wilt not let them go, as it is said: <i>But as for thee and thy servants, I know, &amp;c.,</i> (Exod. 9. 30); <i>And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up</i>, (Exod. 9. 16)? The answer is to show to the inhabitants of the world, that whenever the Holy One, blessed be He! prevents the sinner from becoming a penitent, it is no longer in his power to turn, but that he must die in that wickedness, which he first committed with his own free-will. This was also the case with Sihon, who. in consequence of his iniquities, likewise deserved to be prevented from becoming a penitent, as it is said: <i>For the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate</i>, (Deut. 2. 30). And so it was with the Canaanites, whom He also prevented from becoming penitents, in consequence of their abominations, so that they made war against Israel, as it is said: <i>For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might destroy them utterly</i>, (Josh. 11. 20) Again so it was with the Israelites, in the days of Elijah, namely, that in consequence of their having so grievously transgressed, He prevented those incessant offenders, from becoming penitents, as it is said:<i> And that Thou hast turned their heart back again</i>, (1 Kings 18. 37); signifying: Thou hast withholden repentance from them. Hence we conclude that God neither decreed that Pharaoh should deal wickedly with Israel, nor that Sihon should sin by refusing to the Israelites a passage through his land, nor that the Canaanites should commit abominable deeds, nor that Israel should worship idols, but that all these sinned with their free-will; and that all of them deserved to have repentance withholden from them.
According to this principle, the righteous and the prophets used to entreat God in their prayers, to assist them in arriving at the way of truth, as David said: <i>Teach me Thy way, O Lord;</i> (Ps. 87. 11); meaning: May my sins not prevent me from arriving at the way of truth by which I may come to know Thy way and the Unity of Thy Name. This is also that which David said:<i> So that the free-spirit uphold me</i>, (Ps. 2. 12); signifying: May my free-spirit suffer me to fulfil Thy desire; and may my sins not become the cause of my being prevented from repentance; but rather may that free-spirit continue with me, so that I may be able to turn, to comprehend, and to know the way of truth. And in the same manner may be explained similar Scriptural passages.
It may, however, be asked, what means that which David said: <i>Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will He teach sinners in the way</i>, (Ps. 25. 8)?—<i>The meek will He guide, &amp;c.,</i> (Ps. 25. 9)? —To which we reply, this refers to His having sent prophets to them, (<i>i. e.</i> to the Israelites) who revealed the ways of the Lord to them, and who caused them to turn penitently; and also with regard to His having bestowed on them the power of learning and of becoming wise; a faculty which every man is possessed of; so that whenever he inclines towards the way of wisdom and of righteousness, he will long after and search for the same, as our Rabbins, of blessed memory, say: He who strives after purity, will be assisted by heaven; meaning, that he will feel himself strengthened by this striving after holiness. But, it may again be objected, is it not written in the law: <i>And shall serve them, and they shall afflict them</i>, (Gen. 15. 13)?—Which shows that He actually did decree that the Egyptians should do that which is wicked?—Again it is written: <i>And this people will rise up, and wickedly follow after the gods of the strangers of the land</i>, (Deut. 31. 16); from which it appears that He actually did decree that Israel should worship idols; wherefore then did he punish them?—The answer is: because He did not definitely decree that any <i>particular individual</i> should be the one who would follow after the gods of the strangers of the land; so that with respect to every one of those who did worship idols, had it been his wish not to worship them, he would, in fact, not have done so; and consequently the Creator only informed Moses of the usual course of things in this world. This may be compared to one saying: Among this people, I know that there will be righteous and wicked men; in which case the wicked man could not surely, on this account say, that it was already decreed that he should be a wicked man, namely, because He informed Moses in general terms, that there would be wicked men in Israel, in the same way as it is said also in general terms: <i>For the poor shall never cease out of the land</i>, (Deut. 15. 11)?—Now it was exactly so with regard to the Egyptians, namely, that every one of those Egyptians, who dealt so wickedly with the Israelites, had it not been his wish to deal wickedly with them, was at liberty not to do so, seeing that He did by no means definitely decree that any particular individual should do so, but He merely revealed to Abraham, that his seed would ultimately be in bondage in a land that was not theirs. But now we have already said, that it is not in the power of man to comprehend how the Holy One, blessed be He! knows the things that are to come to pass in future times.

Chapter 7

Now since free-will was granted to every man as was demonstrated by us, a man should endeavour to become a penitent, to make a verbal confession of his sins; and to purify his hands from them; so that he may die a penitent, and thus deserve to partake of the blessings of the life of the world that is to come.
Man ought always to look upon himself as if he were at the point of death; now per chance he may die at this very hour, and thus abide by his sins; he ought therefore to turn from his sins forthwith, and not to say: I will turn when I grow old; lest he die before he grows old. This is which Solomon alludes to in his wisdom: <i>Let thy garments be always white</i>, (Eccles. 9. 8).
Ye must not think that only such transgressions require repentance as are connected with a positive act, as for instance, fornication, robbery, or theft; it is not so, but in the same way as one ought to turn from these transgressions, so ought he also to search into the wicked dispositions which he may have, and to turn from anger, hatred, jealousy, mockery, hunting for mammon and honours, or hunting for dainty food, and the like; from all these ought a man to turn with repentance. And indeed these sins are even more serious than those connected with a positive act, inasmuch as when man is plunged in these, it is very difficult for him to extricate himself from them, just as it is said: <i>Let the wicked forsake, etc.</i>  (Isai. 55. 7).
Moreover the penitent must not imagine that, in consequence of the iniquities and sins which he had committed, he is far below the degree of the righteous; the matter is not so; but he is as beloved and as accepted to the Creator as if he had never sinned; indeed his reward will be greater still; for he has tasted of sin, and yet has abandoned them, and subdued his wicked imagination. Thus the sages say: The position which the penitent occupy, not even the perfectly righteous themselves can attain; meaning that their degree (<i>i. e.</i> the degree of the penitent) is even higher than the degree of those who never sinned, inasmuch as they had to contend with their wicked imaginations, far more than the others.
All the prophets have given us strict injunctions respecting repentance. And indeed Israel cannot be redeemed by any other means than by repentance. Moreover the Divine law has already assured us: that Israel will in the end become penitent, namely, at the close of their captivity, when they will also be redeemed forthwith; for it is said:<i> And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, etc. And shalt return unto the Lord thy God… That then the Lord thy God will return, etc.</i> (Deut. 30. 1, 2, 3).
Repentance is of the greatest importance; inasmuch as it brings a man nearer to the Shechinah; for it is said:<i> O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God</i>, (Hos. 14. 1); again it is said:<i> Yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the Lord</i>, (Amos 4. 6.); and it is also said: <i>If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto Me</i>, (Jer. 4. 1); meaning, if thou wilt but turn with repentance, thou wilt cleave unto Me. Repentance brings near to God those that were remote from Him. The same man who, but the day before, was despised, condemned, and rejected by God, is now beloved, accepted, a kin and a favorite. And thus we find, that the same expressions, wherewith the Holy One, blessed be He! rejected sinners, were used by Him, when He recalled penitents, individuals as well as multitudes of men; for it is said: <i>And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not My people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God</i>, (Hos. 2. 10). Also respecting Jeconiah at the time when he persevered in his wickedness, it was said: <i>Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days</i>, (Jer. 22. 30); <i>Though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon My right hand</i>, (Jer. 22 24); yet when he repented in his captivity, it was said respecting Zerubbabel his son:<i> In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet</i>, (Hag. 2. 23).
How great is the excellence of repentance! The same man who, the day before, was separated from the Lord God of Israel, as it is said: <i>But your iniquities have separated between you and your God</i>, (Isai. 59. 2)—who cried to God and yet was not listened unto, as it is said: <i>Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear</i>, (lsai. 1. 15)—whose good deeds, though he happened to fulfil any commandment, were indignantly rejected, as it is said: <i>Who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</i> (Isai. 1. 12);<i> Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on Mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of Hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</i> (Mal. 1. 10)—the same man is this day (after having turned penitently) cleaving unto the <i>Shechinah;</i> for it is said: <i>But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God</i>, (Deut. 4. 4). Should he now cry to God, he will be answered forthwith, as it is said: <i>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer</i>, (lsai. 65. 24); should he now fulfil any of the Divine commandments, they will be accepted with delight and with joy, as it is said:<i> For God now accepteth thy works</i>, (Eccles. 9. 7); and not only are they accepted, but they are even desired from on High, as it is said: Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years, (Mal. 3. 4).
The nature of the truly penitent is to be humble and exceedingly meek. If foolish men happen to reproach them with their former deeds, saying unto them: “It is but recently thou didst act or say this or that," the penitent do not mind them, but hear this reproach and rejoice in it, knowing that this very reproach increases their merit, inasmuch as whenever they are put to shame on account of their former transgressions, and have to blush for the same, their merit becomes greater, and their virtue more exalted. It is however a grievous sin to say unto a penitent, “Remember thy former doings; ” or to mention them in his presence, with the intention of putting him to shame; or even to mention things or matters of this nature, with the intention of recalling to his mind that which he once did. All this is forbidden as being comprehended in the admonition against insidious vexation by words, against which the law warns, saying: <i>Ye therefore shall not oppress one another</i>, (Lev. 25. 17).

Chapter 8

The good which is treasured up for the righteous, consists in the life of the world that is to come; a life exempt from death; and a good, unalloyed by evil. This is, which is expressed in the Divine law: <i>That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days</i>, (Deut. 22. 7). Tradition interprets: <i>That it may be well with thee</i>—in that world which is altogether good; and <i>that thou mayest prolong thy days</i>—in that world which is prolonged for ever. Now the reward of the righteous, consists in their attaining this bliss, and enjoying this felicity; again the retribution which awaits the wicked is in their not attaining eternal life, but that they are to be cut off and die. Moreover he who does not merit that life, is virtually dead, who is never to live again, seeing that he is to be cut off in consequence of his wickedness, and perish like a beast. Now this is the nature of <i>excision</i> recorded in the Divine law, when it says: <i>That soul shall utterly be cut off;</i> (Numb. 15. 31); Tradition explains: <i>to be cut off</i>, implies, <i>from this world; shall be cut off</i> implies, <i>from the world that is to come;</i> signifying, that the soul, after departing from the body in this world, does not merit the life of the world that is to come, but is to be entirely out off therefrom.
In the world to come, there is neither body nor frame, but the souls only of the righteous dwell therein divested of body, similar to the <i>ministering angels.</i> Now since that heavenly region exists without being inhabited by bodies, there can be neither eating or drinking, nor any other of those things which the bodies of men stand in need of in this world; nor can there occur in that region any of the incidents to which bodies are subject to in this world, as, for instance, sitting, standing, sleep, death, melancholy, mirth or the like. Thus the sages of Old said: In the world that is to come there is neither eating, nor drinking, nor any transient gratification; but there the righteous dwell, crowned with everlasting Glory and delight in the effulgence of the <i>Shechinah.</i> Now this clearly proves, that there can be no corporeal existence there, seeing that there is neither eating nor drinking. And with regard to that which the sages said: that there the righteous dwell, &amp;c., &amp;c., this they say by way of allegory; meaning, that the souls of the righteous exist there <i>without labour or toil;</i> moreover by saying: <i>with their crowns on their head</i>, they meant to express: that the <i>knowledge</i> which the righteous possessed in this life, and by means of which they attained unto the life of the world to come, still continues with them, and constitutes now their crown; just as Solomon said: <i>With the crown wherewith his mother crowned him</i>, (Song of Songs, 3. 11). It is also said: <i>And everlasting joy upon their heads</i>, (Isai. 35. 10); but now joy is not a body, (<i>i. e.</i> not a corporal thing) that it should be said to rest on the head?—it must therefore have been expressed in a figurative sense, so also the <i>Crown</i>, spoken of here by the sages, implies<i> intelligence.</i> Again what is understood by the Rabbinical phrase: <i>delighting in the shining glory of the Shechinah?</i>—it means that the souls of the righteous know and comprehend more of the truth of the Holy One, blessed be He! than they knew, while in this dark and low body.
Whenever the expression <b>Nephesh,</b> <i> soul</i>, is here made use of, it does not refer to the <i>breath</i> of life which the body requires, but to the <i>quality</i> of the soul, namely to that <i>intelligence</i> which comprehends as much of the Creator as it is in its power, and which also comprehends those intelligences that are distinct from matter, as well as all other things created. So that it is that <i>quality</i>, the nature of which we have explained in the fourth Chapter of the <i>Precepts</i> relating to the foundations of the law, which in this instance, goes by the name of <b>Nephesh,</b> <i> Soul.</i> That life, (<i>i. e.</i> the life hereafter), because not subject to death, (seeing that death is one of the incidents which can befall the body only, and that no body exists in that life), is called the treasure of life, as it is said: <i>But the soul of my lord shall be bound in the treasure of life</i>, (I Sam. 25. 29.), alluding to that reward, than which there can be no greater, and that bliss, beyond which there is no higher. It is that state of blissful life, which all the prophets so eagerly desired.
Various names were given by way of allegory to that life, as for instance, <i>The mountain of the Lord; His holy place; The way of holiness; The courts of the Lord, The Beauty of the Lord, The tabernacle of the Lord; The temple of the Lord; The house of the Lord</i>, and <i>the gate of the Lord.</i> The sages by way of allegory called that good which is prepared for the righteous, <b>Seudah,</b> <i>the feast;</i> but more generally they call it: <b>OIam Habba,</b> <i> the world to come.</i>
Again the retribution, than which there can be no greater, consists in this, namely, that the soul is cut off, and does not attain unto that heavenly life, as it is said: <i>That soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him</i>, (Numb. 15. 31). Now this destruction the prophets called, by way of allegory, <i>the pit of destruction</i>, <b>Abaddon,</b> <i> destruction;</i> <b>Tophteh,</b> <i> Tophteh;</i> and also <b>Alukah,</b> <i> the horseleach;</i> so that they called it by all kinds of expressions denoting destruction and corruption, in consequence of its being that destruction from which there is no recovery, and that ruin which admits of no reparation.
That bliss already described as awaiting the righteous in the life hereafter will perchance be slighted by you, imagining, that the reward for one’s fulfilling the Divine commandments, and for being perfect in the way of truth, consists in eating dainty food and drinking delicious beverages, in being arrayed in raiment of fine linen and embroidered work, in dwelling in pavilions of ivory, and in having for his use vessels of silver and gold, or similar luxuries, as those ignorant Arabs imagine, who are plunged in sensuality. But now, wise and intelligent men know that all these things are idle, vain, and futile; and that if with us, in this world, they are considered as something desirable, it is only because we consist of bodies and frames, and because all these things are cravings of the body, so that the soul neither longs after, nor wishes for them, but inasmuch as they are craved by the body, namely, for the realization of its desires, to the end that the body may be preserved in a perfect state. But at a time when there will be no body (<i>i. e.</i> no corporal existence), all these things must needs become vain. With regard however to that great bliss, which the soul is to attain in the world to come—there is no possibility of comprehending or of knowing the same, whilst in this world; seeing that here beneath, we are sensible of that only which is good for the body, and to which also our wishes are confined; but with respect to the celestial bliss, it is exceedingly great, that all earthly good can bear no comparison with the same, except by way of figure. So that truly to estimate the happiness of the soul in the world to come, by the happiness of the body in this world, as for instance, eating or drinking, is utterly impossible; that celestial happiness being so unsearchably great, that it can admit of no comparison or simile. This is which David expresses, in exclaiming: <i>Oh, how great is Thy goodness, which Thou has treasured up for them that fear Thee, &amp;c.</i> (Ps. 31. 19).
Verily, how fervently did David long and pant for future life; for it is said:<i> I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living,</i> (Ps. 27. 13). The sages of old have already informed us, that with respect to future bliss, it is not in the power of man to comprehend it unto perfection, and that no one knows its excellency, beauty, and nature, save the Holy One, blessed be He! alone; moreover that all the good, happiness which the prophets predicted for Israel, related only to bodily matters, such as the Israelites are to enjoy in the days of our King the Messiah, namely, at the time when the rulership shall be restored to Israel; but that with regard to the bliss of the life of the world that is to come—seeing that this cannot admit of comparison or simile—the prophets never attempted to represent the same by any simile, lest they should thereby depreciate it. This is what Isaiah said:<i> Neither hath the eye seen O God, beside Thee, what He hath prepared for him that waiteth for Him</i>, (Isai. 64. 4); signifying the bliss such as not even the eye of a prophet hath beheld, and such as no one hath seen but God Himself, hath He prepared for the man that waiteth for Him. So also the sages said: All the prophets predicted only concerning the events to happen at the days of the Messiah; but as to the world that is to come—NEITHER HATH THE EYE SEEN, O God, BESIDE THEE.
Now the reason why the sages called it <b>OIam Habba,</b> <i> the world to come</i>, is not because it does not exist now, so that we should imagine that this world is first to be destroyed, and then only the other world will come into existence, such is not the case, it actually does exist, as it is said: <i>Which Thou</i> HAST <i>treasured up for them that fear Thee; which Thou</i> HAST <i>wrought</i>, (Ps. 31. 19.) But the sages called it <i>the world to come</i>, because that life is allotted to man subsequently to the life of this world, in which we are preserved both with body and soul, and which is the first stage of human existence. 

Chapter 9

But now since it has been show that the reward which is to be bestowed for the fulfilling of the Divine commandments, and the bliss which we are to attain to, if we keep the way of the Lord as prescribed in the Divine law, consist in the life of the world to come, as it is said: <i>That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days</i> (Deut. 22. 7); also that the punishment which is to be inflicted on the wicked, who forsake the paths of righteousness prescribed in the law, consists in <b>Careth,</b> <i>excision</i>; as it is said: <i>That soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him</i> (Numb. 15. 31); what then is the signification of the repeated passages in the Divine law “If ye obey—such will be your lot; and if ye obey not—such will befal you; all these matters relating to this world, as for instance, plenty or famine; war or peace; kingly power or subjugation; possession of the land or captivity; success in our enterprises or total ruin; and all predictions stated in the words of the covenant”? Now all these things actually have come to pass, and will again come to pass; so that, whenever we fulfil all the commandments of the law, all the Divine happiness of this world, will reach us; and, whenever we trespass against the same, the evil things recorded in the law shall befal us. But still, these Divine blessings are by no means to be the ultimate reward bestowed for the fulfilling of the commandments: nor are these evil things to be the ultimate punishment inflicted on him who trespasses against all the commandments; but the solution of the matter is as follows. The Holy One, blessed be He! has given us this law, which is a tree of life to every one who performs all that is prescribed in it; moreover he who understands it with a perfect and correct knowledge, shall thereby attain unto, and partake of, the life of the world to come, in proportion to the excellence of his deeds, and the greatness of his wisdom. But independent of this He has also assured us in the law, that if we fulfil the same joyfully and with a good will, and if we constantly meditate on the wisdom thereof, He will remove from us all the things which may prevent us from fulfilling the ordinances of the same, such as illness, war, famine, or the like; moreover that He will bounteously diffuse over us all the blessings which may serve to strengthen our hands in fulfilling the law, such as plenty, peace, and abundance of silver and gold; to the end that we may not, during the whole of our days, employ ourselves in providing matters necessary for the body, but that we may dwell in tranquility, so as to be enabled both to study and to fulfil the commandments, whereby we may attain unto the life of the world to come; as the law, after having vouchsafed to us the blessings of this world, continues:<i> And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us</i>, (Deut. 6. 24, 25). And again He has informed us in the law, that if we intentionally depart from it, and employ our selves in pursuing the vanities of time, as it is said: <i>But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked</i>, (Deut. 32. 15). He, the Judge of truth, will then deprive those who forsake the law, of all the blessings of this world, which rendered them so presumptuous as to revolt; moreover that He will bring upon them all kinds of evil things, such as may prevent them from acquiring the virtues requisite for their being admitted into the world to come, to the end that they may perish in their wickedness. This is which the law expresses: <i>Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things, and He shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until He have destroyed thee</i>, (Deut. 28. 48). <i>Because thou servedst not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things</i>, (Deut. 28. 47). It follows, therefore, that these blessings and curses mentioned in the Divine law, ought to be understood as signifying: If ye do serve the Lord joyfully, and if ye do keep His way, He will bounteously diffuse over you all these blessings, and moreover remove from you all these curses, so that ye may live in tranquility; grow wise by the law; and employ yourselves in studying and fulfilling the same; to the end that ye may attain unto the life of the world to come; <i>that it may be well with thee</i>—in that world which is altogether good; and <i>that thou mayest prolong thy days</i>— in that world which is to endure forever; and consequently ye will partake of the blessings of both worlds, namely, of a happy life in this world, leading at the same time to the life of the world to come; for if one were not to acquire wisdom, and perform good actions here beneath, he would have no means of rendering himself worthy of the blessings of the world to come; as it is said: <i>For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave</i>, (Eccles. 9. 10). But, if ye forsake the Lord, and if ye are absorbed in the pleasures of eating, drinking, and in other sensual gratifications, He will bring upon you all these curses, and moreover remove from you all these blessings, so that your days shall be wasted in confusion and terror; so that ye shall neither have peace of mind nor physical health, such as are requisite to enable you to fulfill the commandments; to the end that ye may forfeit your lives in the world to come. And consequently ye shall have forfeited both worlds; inasmuch as when a man is troubled in this world with illness, war, or famine, he cannot employ himself either in the pursuits of wisdom, or in the fulfilling of the commandments, which are the only means of attaining unto the life of the world to come.
Now it is for this reason that all Israel, their prophets, and their wise men, so earnestly long for the days of the Messiah; their object being this, namely, that they may be released from those rulers, who do not suffer them to employ themselves in the study and performance of the Divine law and the commandments in a proper manner; to the end that they may have peace of mind, and thereby be enabled to increase in wisdom, and thus to attain unto the life of the world to come; whilst in those days (viz. in the days of the Messiah) there will be a great increase of knowledge, wisdom, and truth; as it is said: <i>For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord</i>, (lsai. 11. 9); and it is also said: <i>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother</i>, (Jer. 31. 34); and again it is said: <i>And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh</i>, (Ezek. 36. 26). For the king who is to arise out of the seed of David will be wiser than Solomon; moreover he will be a great prophet, nearly as great as Moses, our Teacher; he will therefore instruct the whole nation, and guide them in the way of God; nay all other nations will come to hear him, as it is said; <i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains</i>, (Isai. 2. 2). All these however will be mere precursory advantages, but with regard to the ultimate and full reward, as well as to that ultimate bliss which is to have neither cessation nor diminution, this will consist in the life of the world to come; whilst the days of the Messiah are to influence the concerns of this world, so that matters therein will still have their natural course, with this difference only, that the dignity of an independent kingdom will be restored to Israel. This the sages of old have declared already, saying: “There will be no difference between this world as it is now, and as it will be in the days of the Messiah, except that we shall then be no more subjected to other governments.”

Chapter 10

A man must not say: I will fulfil the commandments of the Divine law, and I will devote myself to study its wisdom, to the end that I may obtain all the blessings which are written therein, or in order that I may attain unto the life of the world to come; moreover, I will refrain from the transgressions against which the Divine law warns men, in order that I may be released from the curses which are written therein, or to the end that I may not be cut off from the life of the world to come.—No, it is by no means becoming to serve God after this manner, for he who serves God thus, does it out of fear, and consequently will not reach the degree of prophets or of the wise. And indeed no one serves the Lord after this manner, except ignorant men and women, or children, these being trained to serve God out of fear, until they increase in knowledge, and then they serve him out of love.
He who serves God out of love, devotes himself to the study and the performance of the divine law and the commandments, and more over walk in the paths of wisdom, not for the sake of any worldly advantage; not because he is afraid of the evil which awaits the wicked; nor because he wishes to secure to himself the bliss vouchsafed to the righteous; but practices truth solely because it is truth, and its good results will naturally follow: now such is of an exceedingly high degree, such as not every wise man can attain unto; this being the degree which Abraham, our father, held, whom the Holy One, blessed be He! called His FRIEND, for this very reason, that he served Him out of love only; and this is a degree which the Holy One, blessed be He! has commanded us through the medium of Moses to aspire unto; for it is said: <i>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God,</i> (Deut. 6. 5). Now when man once arrives to this, namely, to love the Lord with that love which is due unto Him, he will as a matter of course, fulfil all the commandments purely out of love.
But now, what is the nature of that love which is due unto Him?—It is that a man should love the Lord with a love so fervent and so exceedingly strong, that his soul should be bound up in the love of the Lord, and to be constantly absorbed therein, as He commanded us: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.”
The sages of yore said: “Peradventure one might say: Behold! I will study the Divine law, for the purpose of becoming rich, or of being called <i>Rabbi</i>, or of receiving the promised reward in the world to come; observe therefore that it is expressly said: <i>That thou mayst love the Lord</i>, (Deut. 30. 20); implying that every thing that is done by you in compliance with His ordinances, must be done solely out of love of Him.—Again the sages say: “It is written: <i>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in His Commandments</i>, (Ps. 112. 1): signifying, that man must find his delight in the Divine commandments themselves, and not for the sake of the reward attached to them.” Now in conformity with this, the most eminent men amongst the sages, especially enjoined upon their intelligent disciples: “Be ye not like servants who serve their master for the purpose of being rewarded;” but be ye like servants who serve their master, “not for the purpose of being rewarded;” meaning that their service is due to Him, because He is their <i>Master;</i> in other words: Serve Him out of love.
The man who devotes himself to the study of the Divine law with the view of receiving reward, or of escaping from punishment—such a man does not study the law for its own sake; whereas the man who employs himself in studying the same, not out of fear of punishment, nor with the view of receiving reward, but solely out of love to the Lord of the whole earth, by whom he was commanded to do so—such a man employs himself in studying the law for the sake of the law itself. The sages, however, say thus: “Man ought to persevere in employing himself in the study of the Divine law, be it even not for its own sake; because it will lead him ultimately to devote himself thereto for its own merits.” And therefore, when we instruct children, women, or the common class of men, we direct them, to serve God out of fear, and with a view of receiving a reward, until their knowledge becomes greater, and their wisdom more transcendent; when we ought by degrees to initiate them into the true spirit, and gently to train them to the truth of the matter, until they comprehend and know it, and then they will serve God out of love.
It is clear and manifest, that the love of the Holy One, blessed be He! cannot be bound up in the heart of man, unless he be constantly and duly absorbed in the same, and unless he renounce every thing in the world except this love, as He has commanded us, saying: <i>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God</i>, WITH ALL THINE HEART, AND WITH ALL THY SOUL, (Deut. 6. 5). A man, however, can love the Holy One, blessed be He! only by the knowledge which he has of Him; so that his love will be in proportion to his knowledge; if the latter be slight, the former will also be slight; if the latter be great, the former will likewise be great. And therefore a man ought solely and entirely to devote himself to the acquisition of knowledge and understanding, by applying to those sciences and doctrines, which are calculated to give him such an idea of his Creator, as it is in the power of the intellect of man to conceive; as was stated by us in the <i>Precepts relating to the foundations of the law.</i>
