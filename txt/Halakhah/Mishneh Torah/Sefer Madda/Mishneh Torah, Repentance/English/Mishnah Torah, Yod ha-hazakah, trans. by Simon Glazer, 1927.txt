Mishneh Torah, Repentance



Chapter 1

All commandments of the Torah, whether they be mandatory or prohibitive, if a man violates any one of them, either presumptuously or erroneously, when he will repent himself and turn away from his sinful way, he is obliged to confess before God, blessed is He! even as it is said: "When a man or woman shall commit any sin..… Then they shall confess their sin which they have done (Num. 5.6–7), which is a confession of words. Such confession is a mandatory commandment. How is the verbal confession made? The sinner says thus: "I beseech Thee, O Great Name! I have sinned; I have been obstinate; I have committed profanity against Thee, particularly in doing thus and such. Now, behold! I have repented and am ashamed of my actions; forever will I not relapse into this thing again." This is the elementary form of confession; but whosoever elaborates in confessing and extends this subject is, indeed, praise-worthy. Likewise all those who bring sin-offerings or trespass-offerings, when they offer their sacrifices, whether for their errors or for their spitefulness, find no atonement in their sacrifices, unless they repent, and deliver themselves of a verbal confession, even as it is said: "He shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing" (Lev. 5.5) So, too, are the guilty upon whom the tribunal pronounced either a sentence of death or of stripes, who find no atonement either in their death or in being lashed unless they do repent and make verbal confession. Even he, who injures his friend or causes him damages in money matters, although he makes restitution of what he owes him, finds no atonement, unless he makes verbal confession and repents by obligating himself never to repeat this again, even as is said: "Any sin that man commits" (Num. 5.6).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra, Lev. 5; Yoma, 36b; Shebu’ot, 13a; Sanhedrin, 43a; Baba Kama, 92b.C.</i>
The Azazel-goat, because it is atoning for all Israel, the High-Priest confesses over it in the speech of all Israel, even as it is said: "And confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel" (Lev. 16.21). The Azazel-goat, moreover, atones for all transgressions mentioned in the Torah, both, minor and major, whether one committed it in spite or whether he committed it in error, whether it was done by him knowingly or unknowingly— for all the Azazel-goat atones, provided the sinner did repent. But if he repenteth not, the Azazel-goat atones not save for his minor sins. And, what are the minor and what are the major sins? The major sins are such as carry the guilt of death or excision, included among which are also vain and false swearing, although they do not carry the guilt of excision; and all other prohibitive or mandatory commandments which do not carry the guilt of excision are the minor.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Shebu’ot, 2a; Ibid. 12b; Yoma, 85b. C.</i>
At this time, when the Temple is not established and, therefore, no altar to atone for us, there is nothing else left for us but repentance. Repentance atones for all sins. Even one who was an evildoer all his life but repented in the end, not a thing of the wickedness is held out against him, even as it is said: "As for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness" (Ez. 33.12). Even the Day of Atonement itself atones only for those who did repent, even as it is said: "For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you" (Lev. 16.30).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin, 40b; Keritot, 6b; Yoma, 85b. C. G.</i>
Even on the presumption that repentance atones for all sins, and the Day of Atonement as such, too, atones, there are yet certain sins which are wiped off at the time, and certain other sins which are are not wiped off but after a lapse of time. For example? If a man violated a mandatory commandment which does not carry the guilt of excision and did repent, he moves not from the place of prayer before he is forgiven. Of such it is said: "Return, ye backsliding children and I will heal your back-slidings" (Jer. 3.22). If he violated a prohibitive commandment which carries neither excision nor death by a tribunal, and did repent, the repentance suspends punishment, whereafter the Day of Atonement wipes out the sin. Of such it is said: "For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you" (Lev. 16. 30). If he sinned in matters which carry excisions and deaths by a tribunal and did repent, repentance and the Day of Atonement suspend punishment, and the pain which he suffers thereafter complete the atonement for him. Forsooth, no complete atonement ever comes to the penitent before he has a visitation of suffering. Of such it is said: "Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes'" (Ps. 89.32). That saying is concerning a sinner who did not blaspheme the Name in connnection with his transgression, but whosoever blasphemes the Name even he did repent, and the Day of Atonement did come and he still be a penitent, and sufferings did visit him, no complete atonement is granted to him till his death, for, repentance, the Day of Atonement and sufferings suspend punishment, and only death atones for him, even as it is said: "And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts. Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die" (Is. 22.14)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 87a. C. G.</i>

Chapter 2

What is complete repentance? He who once more had in it in his power to repeat a violation, but separated himself therefrom, and did not do it because of repentance, not out of fear or lack of strength. For example? One who knew a woman sinfully, and after a process of time he met her again privately, and he still loving her as theretofore, and he being in a state of potency, and the meeting is in the same land where the sin was first committed, if he parted without sinning, he has attained complete repentance. Of such Solomon said: "Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth" (Ecc. 12.1). Even if he made no reparation save in his old age, at a time when it was already impossible for him to repeat his misdeeds, although it is not the best repentance, it still is of help to him and he is considered a penitent. Moreover, though he continued a life of sin but did repent on his dying day, and did die a penitent, all of his sins are forgiven, even as it is said: "While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain" (Ibid. 12.2), yea, that is the day of death. Deduct herefrom that if he remembered his Creator and did repent ere he died, he was forgiven.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 86b; Kiddushin, 40b; Shabbat, 151a. C.</i>
What is repentance? The sinner shall cease sinning, and remove sin from his thoughts, and wholeheartedly conclude not to revert back to it, even as it is said: "Let the wicked forsake his way" (Is. 55.7); so, too, shall he be remorseful on what was past, even as it is said: "Surely after that I was turned, I repented" (Jer. 31. 19). In addition thereto he should take to witness Him Who knoweth all secrets that forever he will not turn to repeat that sin again, according to what it is said: "Say unto Him.… neither will we call any more the work of our hands our gods" (Hos. 14.3–4). It is, moreover, essential that his confession shall be by spoken words of his lips, and all that which he concluded in his heart shall be formed in speech.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 57b; Shabbat, 121. G.</i>
He who confesses by speech but has not his heart's consent to abandon his erstwhile conduct, behold him, he is like one taking an immersion of purification and in his grasp is an impure creeping thing, when he knows the immersion to be of no value till he cast away the impure creeping thing. Even so it is advised to do, saying: "But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall shall obtain mercy" (Pro. 28. 13). In confessing to God, it is obligatory to name the sin, even as it is said: "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them a god of gold" (Ex. 32.31).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ta’anit, 16a; Yoma, 86b. C.</i>
Among the ways of repentance are, for the penitent to continue to cry out in tearful supplication before the Name, to bestow alms according to his means, and to distance himself exceedingly from the thing wherein he sinned, to have his identity changed, as if saying: "I am now another person, and not that person who perpetrated those misdeeds", to completely change his conduct for the good and straight path, and to exile himself from his place of residence, for exile atones iniquity, because it leads him to submissiveness and to be meek and humble-spirited.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh-ha-Shanah, 16b. C.</i>
The penitent who confesses publicly is praiseworthy, and it is commendable for him to let the public know his iniquities, and to reveal the sins between himself and his neighbor to others, saying to them: "Truly, I have sinned against that man, and I have wronged him thus and such, but, behold me this day, I repent and am remorseful". But he, who is arrogant and reveals not but covers up his sins, is not a wholehearted penitent, of whom it is said: "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper" (Prov. 28.13). But that is saying solely concerning sins between man and man, but sins between man and God, the penitent need not make public, on the contrary it would be impudent of him to reveal them. He, however, should repent before God, blessed is he! and before Him he should detail his sins; and then make public confession upon them by simply saying: "I have sinned". Such procedure is, indeed, for his own good, even as it is said: "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered (Ps. 32.1).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh ha-Shanah, 18a. C.</i>
Although it is ever well to cry out and repent, but during the space of the ten days' time between Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom ha-Kippurim it is exceedingly better, and the supplication is presently accepted, even as it is said: "Seek ye the Lord while He may be found" (Is. 55.6). But that is saying solely concerning an individual, but a community every time they cry out a whole hearted repentance they are answered, even as it is said: "As the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for" (Deut. 6.7).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh ha-Shanah, 18a. C.</i>
Yom ha-Kippurim is the time set aside for repentance for all, the individual as well as the many; for it is the goal of exoneration and quittance in Israel. Because thereof all are obliged to make reparation and confession on the Day of Atonement. The commandment to confess on the Day of Atonement obliges every one to commence it during the afternoon on the ninth day of Tishri, before the evening meal, lest he be sufficated eating his meal before he confess. And, though he did confess before his meal, one is obliged to confess gain during the night prayer of the Day of Atonement, and to repeat the confession during the Morning, Addition, Oblation, and Closing Prayers. At what part of the prayers is the confession made? Every individual delivers it after the silent Benedictions, but the public Reader in the midst of his prayers, after the Fourth Benediction.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 87b. C.</i>
The accepted confession of all Israel contains this verse: "But all of us have sinned", which is the component part of the confession. Sins which he had made confession of one Day of Atonement, one should repeat and make confession on every other Day of Atonement. though he continues to be a penitent, even as it is said: "For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me" (Ps. 51.3).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. C.</i>
Neither repentance nor the Day of Atonement atone for any save for sins committed between man and God, for instance, one who ate forbidden food, or had forbidden coition and the like; but sins between man and man, for instance, one injures his neighbor, or curses his neighbor or plunders him, or offends him in like matters, is ever not absolved unless he makes restitution of what he owes and begs the forgiveness of his neighbor. And, although he make restitution of the monetory debt, he is obliged to pacify him and to beg his forgiveness. Even he offended not his neighbor in aught save in words, he is obliged to appease him and implore him till he be forgiven by him. If his neighbor refuses a committee of three friends to forgive him, he should bring to implore and beg of him; if he still refuses he should bring a second, even a third committee, and if he remains obstinate, he may leave him to himself and pass on, for the sin then rests upon him who refuses forgiveness. But if it happened to be his master, he should go and come to him for forgiveness even a thousand times till he does forgive him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 85b; Baba Kamma, 92a; Yoma, 87b. C.</i>
It is forbidden for man to be ill-natured and unforgiving, for he must be easily appeased but unwidely to wrath; and when a sinner implores him for pardon, he should grant him pardon wholeheartedly and soulfully. Even if one persecuted him and sinned against him exceedingly he should not be vengeful and grudge-bearing, for such is the path of the seed of Israel and of their excellent heart. Only the idolaters are not so, they are of uncircumcised heart, and their wrath is ever-watchful; and, because the Gibonites were unforgiving and unappeasing, that of them it is said: "Now the Gibonites were not of the children of Israel" (II. Samuel, 21.2).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Kamma, 92a. C.</i>
One who committed a sin against a friend, and the friend died before he asked his forgiveness, should bring ten adults at his grave and there say: "I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel and against this man (naming him), and I have done against him thus and such (naming the sins). If he was indebted to him he should return the money to the heirs; if he knew not of his heirs he should leave the amount with the tribunal, whenafter his confession should be delivered.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 86a; Baba Kamma, 103a. C.</i>

Chapter 3

Each and every one of the sons of man has virtues and vices. He whose virtues exceed his vices is a just man, and he whose vices exceed his virtues is an evildoer; if both are evenly balanced, he is mediocre. Even so is a state. If the virtues of all of its inhabitants exceeded their vices, it is, indeed, a just state; but if their vices exceeded, it is, indeed, a wicked state. Even such is a standard for the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh ha-Shanah, 17a C.</i>
A man whose vices exceed his virtues presently dies in his wickedness, even as it is said: "For the multitude of thine iniquity" (Hos. 9. 7). So is a state whose vices exceed presently destroyed, even as it is said: "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorroh is great (Gen. 18. 20). So, too, is the whole world, if their vices exceeded their virtues they are presently destroyed, even as it is said: "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great" (6. 5). But the weighing of this is not according to the number of virtues and vices, but according to their magnitude. There is a virtue that overbalances many vices, even as it is said: "Because in him there is found some good thing" (I Kings, 14. 13); and there is a kind of vice which overbalances many virtues, even as it is said: "But one sinner destroyeth much good" (Ecc. 9. 18). Moreover these are not weighed by anyone, save only in the knowledge of the All-knowing God, for only He knoweth the estimate of virtues versus vices. (<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamot, 50a; Kiddushin 40a. C.</i>)
One who renounces his observance of the commandments, and recants his virtues, saying in his heart: "In what have I advanced by observing these, fain would I not have observed them"!, he, indeed, lost the virtues of all of them, and by no virtue in the world should he be remembered, even as it is said". The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression" (Ezek. 312); on no other can this be said than on him who recants his first virtues. And, even as man's virtues and vices are weighed at the time of his death so are the vices and virtues of each and every one who cometh on this earth weighed on the holy time of Rosh ha-Shanah. He who is found righteous is sealed for life; he who is found wicked is sealed for death, and the midiocre is suspended till the Day of Atonement, if he did repent he is sealed for life, if not he is sealed for death.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 40b; Rosh ha-Shanah, 16b. C.</i>
Notwithstanding that the blowing of the ram's horn trumpet on Rosh ha-Shanah is a Scriptural statute, its blast is symbolic, as if saying: "Ye that sleep, bestir yourselves from your sleep, and ye slumbering, emerge from your slumber, examine your conduct, turn in repentance, and remember your Creator! They that forget the truth because of the vanities of the times, who err all of their years by pursuing vanity and idleness, which are of neither benefit nor of salvation, care for your souls, improve your ways and your tendencies, let each one of you abandon his evil path and his thought which is not pure! It is, therefore, necessary for every man to behold himself throughout the whole year in a light of being evenly balanced between innocence and guilt, and look upon the entire world as if evenly balanced between innocence and guilt; thus, if he commit one sin, he will overbalance himself and the whole world to the side of guilt, and be a cause of its destruction; but if he perform one duty, behold, he will overbalance himself and the whole world to the side of virtue, and bring about his own and their salvation and escape, even as it is said: "But the righteous is an everlasting foundation" (Prov. 10. 25), it is he, by whose righteousness he overbalanced the whole world to virtue and saved it. And, because of this matter, it became the custom of the whole house of Israel to excel in alms-giving, in good conduct and in the performance of duties during the intervening days of Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom ha-Kippurim above what they do during the whole year. It also became a universal custom to rise early during those ten days, to deliver in the synagogues prayers of supplication and ardor till the dawn of the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin, 39b–40a. C.</i>
When the vices and virtues of man are weighed neither the first nor the second time is taken into consideration, but from the third time onward; if his vices from the third time onward exceed his virtues, then those two transgressions, too are added, and he is tried on all; but if his virtues balance his vices from the third transgression onward, all of his transgressions are wiped off one by one, as the third transgression is counted as the first for the two long since had been forgiven, so is the fourth considered thereafter first, as the third long since had been forgiven, and this way till end of the transgressions. That is saying concerning an individual, of whom it is said: "Lo, all these things does God work, twice, yea thrice, with a man" (Job. 33. 29): but concerning a congregation, the first, second and third transgression is held suspended over them, even as it is said: "Thus saith the Lord: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not reverse it" (Amos. 2. 6) and when the reckoning comes up, the reckoning is made even in this manner, i. e. from the fourth transgression and onward. The intermediary category, if there be among the half of their transgressions such sins as never having put on phylacteries, each one is judged according to his transgressions, but has a share in the World to Come. Even so are the wicked whose vices are more than their virtues judged according to their transgressions but have a share in the World to Come; for all Israel have a share in the World to Come, even as it is said: "Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever" (Is. 60. 21). So, too, do the righteous of among the nations of the world have a share in the World to Come.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 86b; Rosh ha-Shanah, 16a; Sanhedrin, 102b. C.</i>
And, the following are they that have no share in the World to Come but suffer excision and loss of identity, and are damned for ever and ever for their exceeding wickedness and sinfulness: atheists, infidels, traducers of the Torah, dissenters of resurrection and the coming of a Redeemer, apostates, enticers of many to sin, seceders from the congregation, a public perpetrator of sins emulating Jehoiakim,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See II. Kings, 23.36–24.6 G.</i> informers, leaders who cast fear upon the congregation not for the sake of God, shedders of blood by defaming people in public, evil-tongued people, he who abolishes circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh ha-Shanah, 17a. G.</i>
There are five categories of atheists;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Minim. G.</i> (1) he who says that there is no God and no Omnipotence; (2) he who says that there is an Omnipotence but that there are two or more such; (3) he who says that there is One Lord; but that He is corporeal and has a form; (4) Likewise one who says that He alone is not the First Cause and Creator of all; (5) likewise he who worships a star, or planet, or any other as a mediator between him and the Lord of the universe; every one of these five is an atheist.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 26b. C.</i>
There are three categories of infidels: (1) he who says that prophecy is altogether an invention, and that no knowledge reaches the heart of the sons of man from the Creator; (2) he who denies the prophecy of Moses our Master; (3) and he who says that the Creator knoweth not the affairs of the sons of man; every one of these three is an infidel. There are three categories of Torah traducers: (1) he who says that the Torah is not God given, even if he says that a single Verse or one word thereof was spoken by Moses on his own authority is, indeed, a traducer of the Torah; (2) he who denies its Oral explanation, that is the Oral Torah, or its exponents, even as Zaduk and Bythos did;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Abot D’Rabbi Nathan, Ch.5; also I. Chro. 5.3G.</i> (3) he who says that the Creator commuted this Duty for another duty and that the Torah had been nullified long ago though it really was God given; every one of these three is a traducer of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 90a; Ibid. 99b. C.</i>
There are two categories of apostates in Israel: (1) an apostate against one commandment; (2) an apostate against the whole Torah. The apostate against one commandment is; one who emboldens himself to transgress a given commandment consciously so that it becomes his habit of doing it publicly, even it be of the minor commandments, for instance, he persistently wears garment mixed of wool and flax, or rounds the corners of his head, as a consequence whereof it appears that such commandment no longer exists in his world, such one is, indeed, an apostate in this matter, if he does such spitefully. An apostate against the whole Torah is, a convert to the religion of the idolaters, for instance, at a time when they issue arbitrary edicts and he cleaves to them, saying: "Of what profit is there for me to cleave to Israel who are down-trodden and persecuted; it is rather best for me to cleave to these in whose hand lies the power", he, assuredly, is apostate against the whole Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Hullin, 5; Sanhedrin, 26b. C.</i>
How are they that cause the public to sin identified? All of the following are of one kind: whether one causes the public to sin in a major matter, as for instance, Jeroboam, Zaduck and Bythos did,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See I. Kings, 12.2. G.</i> or whether he causes the public to sin in a minor matter, even to nullify one mandatory commandment; whether one causes others to sin by force as Manasseh did, for he slew the people of Israel unless they worshiped idolatry, or whether he deceived others and enticed them.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Supra, (8) G.</i>
One who secedes from the paths of the congregation, although he committed no transgressions, but remains separated from the congregation of Israel, observes no commandments together with them, does not include himself in their troubles, nor afflicts himself on their fast-days, but follows his own path as the rest of the people of the land, acting as if he was not one of them, he has no share in the World to Come. One who commits transgressions high-handedly like Jehoiakim,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See II. Kings, 23.36. G.</i> whether his acts were against minor or against major commandments, he has no share in the World to Come. Verily, he is one of whom it is said: "He reveals a face in the Torah not according to law", seeing that he hardened his forehead, exposed his face and is not ashamed to disobey the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Supra, (8). G.</i>
There are two categories of informers: (1) he who informs against his neighbor so that he be turned over to an idolatrous hand either to be put to death or to be maltreated; (2) he who informs against his neighbor so that his money be turned over to an idolatrous hand, or to the hand of a robber, who is like an idolater; both categories of such have no share in the World to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Rosh ha-Shanah, 16a-17b; and Yoma, 86a–87b. G.</i>
They that cast fear upon the public for ungodly purposes are limited to one category; it is he who rules over the public by strong hand, and they fear and dread him, whereas his own objective is, self-aggrandizement, and all of his desires are not to glorify Heaven. An example of such, behold the idolatrous rulers.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. G.</i>
Each and every one of the enumerated twenty-four different categories of persons, Israelites though they be, have no share in the World to Come. And, there are yet lesser transgressions than those referred to concerning which the sages, nevertheless, said, that he who makes a practice to violate them has no share in the World to Come, and that they are of sufficient importance to be kept at a distance, and to watch out against them. They are: he who gives an alias name to his friend; he who calls his friend by his aliases; he who shames his friend publicly; he who glorifies himself by disgracing his friend; he who insults scholars; he who insults his masters; he who despises holy times; he who profanes holy objects. That is saying, that none of these will have a share in the World to Come, if he dies without repentance; but if he repent from his wickedness and died in a state of repentance, he is, indeed, of the sons of the World to Come, as there is not a thing to stand in the way of repentance. Even if one who denied the existence of God all of his life but in the end repented, has a share in the World to Come, for it is said: "Peace, peace, to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him" (Is. 57.19). All of the wicked, and apostates and their like who turned in repentance, whether publicly or secretly, should be accepted back into the folds of Israel, even as it is said: "Return ye backsliding children" (Jer. 3.22)—though he still be backsliding, for, 10, he repented secretly and not publicly, yet is his repentence accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Pirke Abot, 3.11; Sanhedrin, 99b; Baba Mezi’a, 58b; Megillah, 28a; Tosfot, Rosh ha-Shanah, 16b; Kiddushin, 38b; Abodah Zarah, 7a. C. G.</i>

Chapter 4

Twenty-four different transgressions withhold the acceptance of repentance, four of these are of great iniquity, and whosoever commits one of them, the Holy One, blessed is He! provides no means for him to repent, measured, of course, with the monstrosity of his sin. They are: (1) he who leads the public to sin, by which is also included one who witholds the public from performing a commandment; (2) he who diverts his neighbor from the good path to an evil one, for instance, a seducer and an enticer; (3) he who beholds his son cultivating bad habits and does not protest against it, for, his son being under his control, probably, by having protested, he could have separated him therefrom, as a consequence whereof it is as if he himself led him to sin; by which is also included the iniquity of every one who has a possibility to protest against others, whether individuals or many, and does not protest against them but leaves them to their stumbling; (4) he who says: "I will sin and repent"; by which is also included one who says: "I will sin and the Day of Atonement will atone".
Among this group of twenty-four are five transgressions which block the way of repentance against the sinners, they are: (1) he who secedes from the community, for he would be absent at the time they repent and could not acquire aught in their virtuous performance; (2) He who opposes the decisions of the sages, for his opposition to them brings about his own separation from them, and he knows not the path leading to repentance; (3) he who disdains the precepts, for as they appear debased to him he does not pursue after them nor perform them, and without performance what virtue can he attain? (4) he who insults his masters, for such conduct brings about his displacement and repudiation, even as it happened to Gehazi<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See II. Kings, 4.1G.</i>, and being repudiated he will not find a teacher to guide him to the path of truth; (5) He who despises criticism for he, indeed, left no path open for repentance, as it is criticism that begets repentance. Forsooth, when a man is informed that his sins are known, and that he should be ashamed of himself for his wrongdoings, he does repent. For example: it written in the Torah: "Remember, forget thou not, how thou didst make the Lord thy God wroth in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst go forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the Lord" (Deut. 9.7), and: "But the Lord hath not given you a heart to know" (Ibid. 29.3), and: "A foolish people and unwise" (Ibid. 32.6); and Isaiah, likewise, rebuked Israel and exclaimed: "Ah sinful nation!" (Is. 1.4) and, "The ox knoweth his owner" (Ibid. –3), and, "Because I knew that thou are obstinate" (Ibid. 48.4). Almighty, too, charged him to rebuke the sinners, saying: "Cry aloud, spare not" (Is. 58. 1). In like manner did all of the prophets criticise Israel until they turned in repentance. It is, therefore, necessary to appoint over each and every community in Israel a great scholar of mature age, God-fearing since his early youth, and loved by them, people, to preach to the public and turn them to repentance. But he who despises criticism does not come to hear the preacher and does not pay attention to his words, he, therefore, holds on to his sins, which to his eyes appear to be good.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Alfasi, Yoma, Chapter 8. 7a. G.</i>
And, again, there are among this group of twenty-four, five transgressors, each of which, block the path of complete repentance for the one commits it, because they are sins between man and man, and the sinner does not know the neighbor against whom he sinned, to whom to make restitution or of whom to beg forgiveness. They are: (1) he who curses the public and did not curse a single man in particular to whom he might plead for pardon; (2) he who shares spoils with a thief, because he knows not to whom the stolen goods belong, for the thief steals at large and brings it to him and he becomes the fence, thereby adding to the iniquity by upholding the thief and leading him on to further sin; (3) he who finds a lost article and does not advertise it so as to restore it to its owner, thus after a process of time when he would repent he knows not to whom to make restitution; (4) he who partakes of an ox<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Alfasi gives the text as Shod, (Spoils) not Shor (Ox). (Ibid). G.</i> which is the property of the poor, the orphans or the widows, for such people are languid, unknown and un-heralded, wandering from city to city without a friend, and he, therefore, would not know to whom such ox belongs if he desired to make restitution; (5) he who takes bribery to pervert justice, for he knows not the extent of the perversion, or what its power is, as such matter has auxiliary factors, and, therefore, could possibly not estimate the amount of restitution; and he, moreover, is supporting the evil hand of the bribe-giver and thereby leads him on to sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. Alfasi. G.</i>
And, there are, furthermore, five transgressions among this group of twenty-four, the presumption of one who commits each and every one of them being against his inclination to turn toward repentance, because the majority of people consider them of minor importance, as a consequence whereof one stoops in sin imagining that what he does is no sin at all. They are: (1) he who dines at a table knowing that the meal is of insufficient quantity to satisfy even the appetite of the host, for such is an offshoot of robbery, whereas he imagines, saying: "Have I not eaten with the consent of the host?" (2) he who makes use of a poor man's pledge, for a poor man's pledge is none else save an article such as an axe or plough, whereas he will say in his imagination: "Nothing thereof was diminished, I have not robbed him"; (3) he who wantonly stares at the opposite sex, for he thinks that it is of no matter, saying: "Have I stilled an urge, or even been near her"? whereas he remains oblivious to the fact that purposeful eye-staring is a great iniquity and begets actual unchastity, even as it is said: "And that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes" (Num. 15.39); (4) he who acquires honor by disgracing his neighbor, for he thinks that he committed no sin, as his neighbor stood not by, and did not feel the shame, as he did not insult him personally, save by comparing his own good conduct and his own education against the conduct of his neighbor or his education so that the audience may infer that he is honorable and his neighbor disgraceful; (5) he who casts suspicion upon the upright, for he thinks within his heart that he sinned not, saying to himself: "What have I done to him, is there anything more to it than mere suspicion? perhaps he did it, and perhaps he did it not;" whereas he does realize that this is an iniquity to place an upright man in his mind on the same level with an evil-doer.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. G.</i>
And among this group of twenty-four there are five such transgressions that whosoever commits them is continuously pursuing them, so that it becomes hard for him to separate himself from them. It is, therefore, necessary for a man to beware of them, lest they become part of his habits, for they are all extremely evil tendencies. They are: (1) sycophancy; (2) an evil tongue; (3) ill temper; (4) bad thoughts; (5) companionship with the wicked, for he learns his conduct and his actions become indited in his heart. Of such Solomon said: "But a companion of fools shall be shattered" (Prov. 13.20). Regarding this, we have already elucidated in the "Treatise of Ethics" how a man of the average should conduct himself, deduct the major from the minor for a penitent.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. G.</i>
All the enumerated transgressions and their like, though they withold the sinners from turning to repentance they should not be prevented from doing so, for if a man did turn away from these in repentance, lo, he is a penitent, and he will inherit a share in the World to Come.

Chapter 5

Every man was endowed with a free will; if he desires to bend himself toward the good path and to be just it is within the power of his hand to reach out for it, and if he desires to bend himself to a bad path and to be wicked it is within the power of his hand to reach out for it. This is known from what it is written in the Torah, saying: "Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil" (Gen. 3.22), that is as if saying: "Behold, this species, man, stands alone in the world, and there is no other kind like him, as regards this subject of being able of his own accord, by his reason and thought, to know the good and the evil, and to do whatever his inclination dictates him with none to stay his hand from either doing good or evil; and, being that he is so, 'Lest he put forth his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever'" (Ibid.)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah, 16b; Megillah, 25a. G.</i>
Permit not your thought to dwell upon that which ridiculous fools of other peoples and a majority of asinine individuals among the children of Israel say, that the Holy One, blessed is He! decrees at the very embryonic state of every man whether he should be just or wicked. The matter is not so. Every man is capable of being as just as Moses our Master or as wicked as Jeroboam, wise or incony, merciful or human, miser or philanthropist, and so in all other tendencies. There is none to either force things upon him or to decree things against him; either to pull him one way or draw him another way, but he alone, of his own free will, with the consent of his mind, bends to any path he may desire to follow. It is concerning this that Jeremiah said: "Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not the evil and the good" (Lam. 3. 38),<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I am amazed that the English version of the American Jewish Publication Society, too, makes this sentence interrogatory. G.</i> which is as if saying, the Creator decrees not that man should be either good or bad. Now, this being so, the consequence hereof is that the sinner alone brought harm upon himself. It is, therefore, meet that he should lament and shed tears because he sinned, and because of what he did to his soul and rewarded it with evil. Even this is the meaning of the succeeding Verse: "Wherefore doth a living man complain, or a strong man? Because of his sins" (Ibid.)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The English version in all existing translations is entirely opposed to what was an accepted doctorine by all medieval and modern Hebrew scholars. I corrected it to harmonize the texts. G.</i> Again, he continues, in the succeeding Verse seeing that it all is in our power, and we did all the evil of our own free will and accord, it is, indeed meet for us to turn in repentance and abandon our wickedness, for our free will is in our hands now as well as at the time we committed the sins saying: "Let us search and try our ways, and return to the Lord" (Ibid.–40).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Niddah, 16b; but the Maimoni doctorine does not contradict that text; you can not teach a brainless idiot wisdom, but a man with brains is often a charlatan; the choice is his. C. G.</i>
And, this matter is a great and component part, the very pillar of the Torah and its precepts, even as it is said: "See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil" (Deut. 30.15), and it is, moreover, written: "Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and curse" (Ibid. 11.26). This is as if saying, the power is in your hand, and whatever human activity man may be inclined to carry on he has a free will to elect either good or evil. And, because of this very subject it is said: "Oh, who would grant that they had such a heart as this, to fear Me, and to keep all my commandments at all times" (Ibid. 5.26). This is as if saying, that the Creator forces not the sons of man, and makes no decrees against them that they should do good or evil, but that it all is in their own keeping.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since Maimoni no authority in Israel disputed this. G.</i>
Had the decree of God prompted man to be either just or wicked, or had there been a fundamentally inborn something to draw man to either of the paths, or to any one branch of knowledge, or to a given tendency of the tendencies, or to particular act of all actions as the astrologists maintain by their foolish inventions, how did He charge us by the prophets, to do thus and not to do such, improve your ways, and do not follow your wickedness, whereas man from his embryonic state already had a decree of his conduct issued, or his inborn nature draws him toward a given path of conduct from which he can not deviate? Moreover, what need would there be, under such circumstances, for the Torah altogether? And by what law, and under what system of justice could the wicked be punished, or the just rewarded? Shall the judge of the whole earth not exercise justice? Now, do not wonder and ask: "How is it possible for man to do what his heart desires, and have his entire course of action lodged within himself seeing that he can not do aught in the world without the permission of his Master and without His Will, even as the Verse says: "Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that hath He done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps" (Ps. 135.6)? Know all that man does is in accordance with His Will, although our actions are really in our own keeping. For example? Even as it is the Creator's Will that fire and air shall ascend upward, and that water and earth shall descend downward, or that the sphere shall revolve in a circle, and that other creatures of the universe should likewise follow their respective natural laws, as it was His Will for them to be, so was it His Will that man shall have the free choice of conduct in his own hand, and that all his actions should be lodged within him, and that he should be neither forced or drawn, but he, of his own free will and accord, as God endowed him with, he exercises in all that is possible for man to do. He is, therefore, judged according to actions; if he did good, his is rewarded with good; and if he did wrong, he is punished. This is in harmony with what the prophet said: "This hath been of your own doing" (Mal. 1.9); and: "According as they have chosen their own ways" (Is. 66.3); and of this very subject Solomon said: "Rejoice O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment" (Ecc. 11. 9); as if saying: "True, it is within the power of thine hand to do so, but thou art to render an accounting on the day of judgment".<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Shabbat, 156a; Maimonides, herein, does not deny the variations in human intelligence, nor native excellence of one and native shortcomings of another; what he maintains is that man is not governed in his conduct by natural laws, as is every creature below him. G.</i>
Peradventure, thou wilt ask: "The Holy One, blessed is He, does he not know what it will be before it will come to pass? Did he know whether a certain person will be either just or wicked, or did He not know it? If he knew that he would be just, then it would be impossible for him not to be just? If thou wilt say that He did know that he would be just but that it is possible for him to be wicked, lo, He did not know the matter clearly? Know, that the answer to this question is longer in measure than the earth and broader than the sea, and many great elements and ranking mountains are suspended thereon; but it is essential that you know this fundamental matter which I outline. In the second chapter of the treatise of Fundamentals of the Torah it was already elucidated that the Holy One, blessed is He! does not know of things with a knowledge which exists outside of Himself, like, for instance, the sons of man do, for they and their knowledge are two separate things; but, He, may His Name be exalted! and his knowledge are One, and it is not within the power of the knowledge of man to attain this matter clearly, and even as it is not within the power of man to attain and find the truth of the Creator, even as it is said: "For man shall not see Me and live" (Ex. 33.20), even so it is not within the power of man to attain and find the knowledge of the Creator. This is even what the prophet said: "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord" (Is. 55.8). This being so, it is not within our intellectual power to know in what manner the Holy One, blessed is He! knows all the creatures and their actions, but we do know without a doubt that man's behavior is in the hand of man, and that the Holy One, blessed is He! neither draws him nor issues edicts against him to do as he does. And, not solely because of having accepted the religion do we know that there is no predestination, but even by clear evidence of the words of wisdom. Because thereof it is said in prophecy that man is judged for his actions according to his actions, whether they be good or evil, and this is the very foundation upon which all the words of prophecy depend.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat, 63b; Berakot, 33b. G.</i>

Chapter 6

There are many verses in the Torah and in the texts of the prophets which appear to contradict this principle, and most people are stumbling thereby, and therefrom they suppose in their mind that the Holy One, blessed is He! predestines for man either to do evil or good, and that the heart of man is not his to bend it to his own will. Wherefor, behold, I am making clear a great principle, out which thou shalt know the explanation of all those verses. When an individual or a people of a state do sin, and the sinner transgressed consciously and of his own free will, as we have already made known in the preceding chapter, it is meet that retribution is visited upon him, and the Holy One, blessed is He! knoweth how to inflict the punishment. There is a category of sin for which justice demands that punishment should be visited upon the sinner in this world, on his body, or his property, or on his infant children, for the little children of man, who have not yet reached the age of intelligence nor attained the age when they are included among those who are obliged to observe the precepts, are considered man's own acquisition, even as it is written: "Every man shall be put to death for his own sin" (Deut. 24.16)—he suffers for his own sins when he reaches the age of man;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment herein spoken of is retribution by the Judge of the whole earth, and not by tribunal of man; no tribunal has the power under the laws of the Torah to inflict the punishment of death upon infant children for the crime of a parent. G.</i> and there is a category of sin for which justice demands that punishment should be visited upon the transgressors only in the World to Come, and the sinner suffers no harm whatever in this world; and there is still another category of sin for which punishment is inflicted upon the sinner both in this world and the World to Come.<sup>1</sup>
That is saying concerning a sinner as long as he did not repent; but if he did repent, repentance to him is then a coat of armor against punishment. And, to the same extent that man sins consciously and of his own free will, he should turn to repentance consciously and of his own free will.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Pirke Abot, 4.13. G.</i>
And, it is possible that a man should commit either one grievous iniquity or a multitude of sins so that the Judge of Truth will decree against him that, whereas this sinner committed those sins of his own free will and consciously, repentance should be witheld from him altogether, and grant him no leave to repent, so that he might die and perish in the iniquity he committed. Even this is what the Holy One, blessed is He! said through Isaiah: "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their eyes heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding with their heart will return and be healed" (Is. 6.10). It is, moreover, said: "But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people till there was no remedy". (II Chro. 36.16)—as if saying: "They sinned of their own free will and they have multiplied iniquities, until their guilt carried the punishment to withold repentance from them, which is the remedy". It is, therefore, written in the Torah; "And I will harden Pharaoh's heart" (Ex. 14.4), because at the beginning he sinned of his own free will, and meted out evil to Israel who sojourned in his land, even as it is said: "Come, let us deal wisely with them" (Ibid. 1.10). Thereat justice demanded to withold repentance from him, so that due punishment might be visited upon him. Wherefor, the Holy One, blessed is He! hardened his heart. If it be so, then why did He delegate Moses to him, charging him to let Israel go forth and turn to repentance seeing that the Holy One, blessed is He! long since told him thou wilt not let them go forth, saying: "But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God" (Ibid. 9.30), and again saying: "But in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee My power, and that My name be declared throughout all the earth"(Ibid. –16)? To demonstrate to the future generations whenever the Holy One, blessed is He! witholds repentance from a sinner he can not repent, but must die in the original evil which he perpetrated of his own free will. Sihon, too, by the measure of his iniquity became guilty of an offence which carried the punishment to have repentance witheld from him, even as it is said: "For the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate" (Deut. 2.30). Likewise the Canaanites, according to their abominations, did He withold repentance from them so that they engaged Israel in battle, even as it is said: "For it was of the Lord, to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed" (Joshua, 11.20). Even so was with Israel in the days of Elijah, because of the multiplied iniquity repentance was witheld from the gross evildoers, for it is said: "For Thou didst turn their heart backward" (I. Kings, 18.37)—as if saying: "Thou didst withold repentance from them". Thus, as a consequence hereof, we must say: God's predestination prompted not Pharaoh to wrong Israel, nor Sihon to sin in his land, nor the Canaanites to be abominable, nor Israel to worship idolatry; for they all sinned of their own free will and accord, and, therefore, were they all guilty of an offence which carries along the punishment to withold repentance from them.
Even on this very subject do the righteous and the prophets supplicate and pray that the Lord may help them to discover the truth. As David said: "Teach me Thy way, O Lord, that I may walk in Thy truth" (Ps. 86.11), as if saying: "let not my sins withold the way of truth, by which I may discover Thy way, and the Oneness of thy Name". Likewise, this Verse: "Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and let a free spirit uphold me" (Ibid. 51.14), is as if saying: "Grant leave to my spirit to do Thy will, and let not my sins be a cause to withold repentance from me; but let the power be in my hand until I will turn, and understand and know the true way". And, in such way all other like verses are interpreted.
But what is this that king David said: "Good and upright is the Lord; therefore doth he instruct sinners in the way. He guideth the humble in justice; and He teacheth the humble His way" (Ibid. 210.11)? This is a reference to the prophets who were sent to make the ways of God known, and to turn the people to repentance. Moreover, He endowed them with a power to study and understand, as it is the tendency of every man to pursue wisdom and righteousness as long as he is trained in the ways of wisdom. This is in harmony with what our Masters, of blessed memory! said: "He who comes to be cleansed receives aid"<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat, 104a; Yoma, 38b. Minahot, 29a. G.</i>, as if saying: "He will find himself aided in the matter he strives after. Now, reverting back to the subject of predestination is it not written in the Torah: "Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them" (Gen. 113), lo, here is a decree against the Egyptians to do evil? And it, moreover, written: "And this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land" (Deut. 31.16), lo, here is a decree against Israel to worship idolatry, then why visit retribution upon them? Because He did not decree that that particularly known person shall be the one to go astray. Forsooth, every individual of those who did go astray to worship idolatry, had he not done so to worship of his own free will, he would not have worshiped. And God made known no more than custom of the world. This is like to one who says: "Among this people will be righteous and wicked". Not because of this will the wicked one say that it had long since been decreed that he should be an evildoer, seeing that God made known to Moses that there will be wicked people among Israel. Or, this is like the subject of poverty, of which it is said: "For the poor shall never cease out of the land" (Ibid. 15.11). Likewise the Egyptians, if each and every one of those who vexed and wronged Israel had no desire so to wrong them, he had it in his power to refrain from doing it; for, He did not decree against a particular man, but made known to Abraham that in the end his seed will be enslaved in a land which is not theirs. But we have already stated that it is not within the power to comprehend the foreknowledge of the Holy One, blessed is He!

Chapter 7

Because every man was endowed with self-will, as we have elucidated, it is meet that man shall strive to repent, to confess his sins by word of his mouth, and to dust off his hands from his sins, as a preparation for death after repentance, so that he may acquire life in the World to Come.
Ever should man look upon himself as if he is nigh to death, lest he die during the interval, as a consequence whereof he will be outstanding in his sin; he should, therefore not tarry but repent presently. He should not say: "In old age I will repent", perhaps he will die before old age overtakes him. To this Solomon in his wisdom pointed, saying: "Let thy garments always be white". (Ecc. 9.8).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Pirke Abot, 2.15; Shabbat, 153a. C.</i>
Do not say that no repentance is needed save on sins to which action is attached, for example: prostitution, robbery, or theft. For even as it is necessary for man to repent from such, so it is necessary for him to search his bad tendencies, to turn in repentance from anger, from hatred, from jealousy, from deceit, from pursuing after wealth, honor, feasting and such like these; yea, from all of these it is necessary for him to turn in repentance. Indeed these iniquities are more grievous and more difficult for a man to be separated from than those which require action, for on such the prophet Isaiah said: "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts" (Is. 55.7).
Let not a penitent man imagine that he is removed at a distance from the degree of the righteous on account of the iniquities and sins which he had committed. It is not so, forsooth, but the Creator considers him beloved and desirable, as if he had ever known of no sin. Moreover, his reward is great; for, after having partaken of the taste of sin, he separated himself therefrom and conquered his passion. The sages said: "The place whereon the penitent stand the wholly righteous could not stand;" as if saying: "their degree is above the degree of those who ever did not sin, because it is more difficult for them to subdue their passion than for the others.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Berakot, 34b. C. G.</i>
All of the prophets commanded concerning repentance; Israel will not be redeemed save by repentance. Indeed, the Torah long since assured us that in the end, at the close of the period of exile Israel will turn to repentance and be momentarily redeemed, even as it is said: "And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessings and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt bethink thyself among all the nations, whither the Lord thy God had driven thee, and shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and hearken to His voice according to all that I commanded thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee" (Deut. 30.14).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma, 87b. C. G.</i>
Great, indeed, is repentance for it brings man nigh to the Shekinah, even as it is said: "Return, O Israel, unto the Lord thy God" (Hosea, 14. 2); and it is further said: "Yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the Lord" (Amos, 4.6); and it is yet again said: "If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, yea, return unto Me" (Jer. 4.1), as if saying: "If thou wilt turn in repentance ye will cleave unto Me". Repentance brings near the far apart. But yesterday this sinner was hateful to the presence of God, scorned, ostracized and abominate, and to-day he is beloved, desirable, companionable and a friend. Thou findest, moreover, that in the very language God employs to distance the sinners He employs to bring nigh unto Him the penitent whether the individual or the many, even as it is said: "And it shall come to pass that, instead of that which was said unto them, 'Ye are not My people', it shall be said unto them: 'Ye are the children of the living God'. And, again it is said of Jeconiah: "Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days, (Jer. 22.30) though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon My right hand yet would I pluck thee thence" (Ibid. – 24); but when he repented, being in exile, it is said of his son Zerubbabel: "In that day, saith the lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet" (Haggai, 2.23).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Coniah, Jehoiachin, Joiachin, Jeconiah and Jeconiahi are all one and the same king, who in 11. Chr. 36.9 is said to have been eight years old when he ascended the throne of David, and reigned three years and ten days, and in Second Kings, 24.8, is said to have been eighteen years old, and reigned three years. He was the grandfather of Zerubbabel, and was a prisoner thirty-seven years. However, in First Chr. 3.19, it is said that Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah, brother of Shealtiel. Maimonides, evidently did not accept this version. G.</i>
How superior is the degree of repentance! But yesterday was this sinner separated from the Lord God of Israel, even as it is said:" But your iniquities have separated between you and your God" (Is. 59.2); cries, but received no answer, even as it is said:" "Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear" (Ibid. 1.15); does obey commandments, but they are thrown back in his face, even as it is said: "Who hath required this at your hand, to trample My courts"? (Ibid.–12), and, "Oh that there were even among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on Mine altar in vain!" (Mal. 1.10). But to-day he is connected with the Shekinah, even as it is said: "But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day" (Deut. 4.4); he cries and receives answer momentarily, even as it is said: "And it shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer" (Is. 65.24); he observes commandments, and they are received with pleasure and joy, even as it is said: "For God hath already accepted thy works" (Ecc. 9.7); moreover, his works are pleasurably anticipated, even as it is said: "Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years" (Mal. 3.4).
It is the custom of the penitent to be exceedingly lowly and humble. If fools insult them by reminding them of their former conduct, saying: "But yesterday you did thus and such; yesterday you said thus and such", it is best to have no feelings against them, for this very insult is meritorious for the penitent. Indeed, as long as they feel the shame of their past conduct, and the reproach thereof, their virtue increases and their degree grows. But it is, nevertheless, a grievous sin to say to the penitent: "Remember your erstwhile conduct", or to remind them in his presence so as to put him to shame, or to mention things and subjects similar to them so as to remind him of what he did. All such is forbidden, and comes under the general law of deceiving one with words, concerning which the Torah did give warning, even as it is said: "And ye shall not deceive one another" (Lev. 25.17).

Chapter 8

The hidden good in store for the righteous is, life in the World to Come, which is a life connected with no death and a kind of good connected with no evil; such as is described in the Torah: "That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest prolong thy days" (Deut. 22.7), which was traditionally deducted to mean, "That it may be well with thee" in a world which is entirely good; "and that thou mayest prolong thy days"—in a world existing forever; and this is the World to Come. The reward of the just is, that they will acquire the sweetness thereof, to be in such goodness; and the punishment of the wicked is, that they will not share in such life, but will suffer excision and eternal death. And, whosoever does not earn such life, is to be dead, without coming to life forever; for he is severed from life by his iniquity and goes to oblivion like a cattle. This is the meaning of excision described in the Torah, saying: "That soul shall utterly be cut off" (Num. 15.31), which was traditionally deducted to mean, "utterly cut of," both in this world and in the World to Come.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The translation here can not be literally given on account of the English text of the quotation. “Utterly”, stands for the Hebrew word “Hikorat” and “cut off”, for “Tikorat”. The Talmud (Sanhedrin, 64b) defines “Hikorat” literally, being cut off of itself, to refer to this world; and “Tikorat”, literally, being cut off by another, refers to the World to Come. G.</i> as if saying: "That soul which was separated from the body in this world shares not in the life of the World to Come, for even from the World to Come is it cut off".<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Mezi’a, 58b-59a; Kiddushin, 39b-40a; Hullin, 142a. C.</i>
The World to Come harbors neither body nor aught of a concrete form, save only the souls of the righteous divested of body as are the ministering angels. Inasmuch as it harbors no concrete forms there is no need there for eating, drinking, or other of the bodily necessities of the sons of man in this world; neither will any of the many things which happen to bodies in this world come to pass there, as, for instance, sitting down, standing up, sleep, death, sadness, mirth or the like. Thus did the ancient sages say: "In the World to Come there is no eating, no drinking, and no family life, save that the righteous are sitting, graced with garlands upon their heads, and indulge in feasting upon the luminousness of the Shekinah".<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Berakot, 17a. C.</i> Herefrom, 10, it is clear to you that no body exists there, seeing that there is neither eating nor drinking. That expression of "sitting" herein employed, is figurative, as if saying that they are there without effort or fatigue, and the phrase they employed, saying: "graced with garlands upon their heads", means that they have conscious knowledge of the reason why they have merited to be in the World to Come, and this is their crown of garlands, as, for example, Solomon said: "The crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him" (Songs. 3.11). Moreover, it was said: "And everlasting shall joy be upon their heads (Is. 35.10); now joy is not a body to rest upon one's head, even so the crown spoken of by the sages refers to knowledge. But what is the meaning of the phrase, "and indulge in feasting upon the luminousness of the Shekinah"? It is that by which they know and attain part of the Truth of the Holy One, blessed is He! something they do not know while in the dark, low body.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. G.</i>
The term soul employed on this subject refers not to the breath of life necessary for the body, but the form of the soul which is the intelligence by which it attained knowledge of the Creator's Being according to its intellectual power, and by which it attained knowledge of the non-concrete intelligences and other works of God, even it is the form which we have explained in the fourth chapter of the treatise concerning Fundamentals of the Torah, and it is called soul for the purpose of this subject. The life herein spoken of, because there is no death connected with it, seeing that death is only incidental to the happenings which befall a body, and as there exists no body, is called a collection of life, even as it is said: "Yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life" (I. Sam. 25.29). And, this reward is such that there is no reward higher than it, and the kind of good after which no other good exists, and it is for it that all of the prophets craved.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Pesahim, 54a. G.</i>
And this reward is known by many figurative names: The Lord's Mountain; His Holy Place; Holy Path; the Lord's Courts; the Lord's Graciousness; the Lord's Tent; the Lord's Temple; the Lord's House; and the Lord's Gate. And the sages, figuratively, named this Good which is in store for the righteous, Banquet. But its universal name is, the World to Come.
The vengeance, than which there is none greater is, that the soul will be cut off and will obtain no share in that life, even as it is said: "That soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him" (Num. 15.31). As for hell, it is what the prophets call figuratively by different names, such as, pit of destruction, burning flame, leech, and by every word which means decay and destruction is it called, because it is an expression of terminating decay from which there is no regeneration and a loss which remains forever unreturned.
Peradventure you will consider this Good lightly, and imagine that no reward for observing the precepts and for man to be following wholly the paths of truth is of any worth save if he be eating and drinking good food, enjoying beautiful faces, dressing in garments of embroidered linen, lounging in tents of ivory, being served in dishes of gold or silver, and similar things, as these stupid, silly, licentious Arabs imagine. But scholars and sensible people should know that all such things are idle and vain, wherein there is nothing consequential, and if they are considered of the greatest good by us in this world, it is because we are owners of bodies and concrete forms, and all such things are bodily necessities, and the soul neither craves nor desires for them save because of bodily necessity, so that it may satisfy its desire and remain normal. But when there is no body, all these things are found to be completely nullified. But as to the great Good in which the soul will be in the World to Come, there is no way in this world to attain or know it, for in this world we know of no other good, save that of the body, for which we crave; but that Good is exceedingly exalted and has no estimate alongside the good of this world save as a figure of speech; but by the way of truth to draw a comparison between the Good in store for the soul in the World to Come and the good of the body by eating and drinking in this world is impossible. Forsooth, that Good is so great that by no search can it be attained, and by no form of estimate and comparison can it be comprehended, even as David said: "Oh how great is Thy goodness which Thou hast treasured up for those that fear Thee" (Ps. 31.19).
How David longed and craved for the life in the World to Come! even as it is said: "If I had not believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living" (Ibid. 27.13). We were long since informed by the ancient sages that it is not within the power of man to attain clearly the good of the World to Come, nor to know its grandeur beauty and quantity, save only the Holy One, blessed is He! and that all the good the prophets did prophesy for Israel are none else save corporeal matters, of which Israel will enjoy during the Messianic era, when government will be restored to Israel; but as the good in the life of the World to Come has neither estimate nor comparison, the prophets did not compare it to aught so as to not lessen it by comparison. This is what Isaiah said: "Neither hath an eye seen a God besides Thee, Who worketh for him that waiteth for Him" (Is. 64.3), as if saying: "The good which the eye of a prophet had not seen, and none save God saw it, did God make for man who waits for Him. The sages declared: "All of the prophets combined prophesied not save concerning the Messianic era, but the World to Come no eye saw, O God, besides Thee".<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat, 63a; Sanhedrin, 99b; Abodah Zarah, 65a. C. G.</i>
As for the reason why the sages called it "the World to Come": it is not because it is not now in existence, so that it might be inferred that this world will be destroyed and thereafter will come that world; the matter is not so, for that World is and ready, even as it is said: "Oh how great is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee; which thou hast wrought for them that take their refuge in Thee" (Ps. 31.19–20). They called it not World to Come, save alone because that life comes to man after the life of this world wherein we exist with a body and soul, and this life is found by man first.

Chapter 9

Now, after it is known that the reward and the good which we will acquire for observing the precepts and the way of the Lord according to what it is written in the Torah consist of life in the World to Come, even as it is said: "That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days" (Deut. 22.7), and that the punishment inflicted upon the wicked who abandoned the righteous paths described in the Torah consists of excision, even as it is said: "That soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him" (Num.15.31), what is this which it is written throughout the Torah, if ye will hearken you will be overtaken by thus, but if ye will not hearken you will be met with such, and all those things are in this world, for instance, plenty, famine, war, peace, government, oppression, permanency in the land, exile, success in undertakings, its failure, and other similar text in the Covenant? All those things were and will be true, and as long as we observe the precepts of the Torah all the good of this world will overtake us, and as long as we transgress them we will be met by those evil things described therein. Nevertheless, neither are those good things the end of the reward for observing the commandments nor are those evil things the end of the punishment to be inflicted upon one who violates the precepts. For so are all these matters balanced: The Holy One, blessed is He! bestowed upon us this Torah as a tree of life, and whosoever conducts himself after the prescribed order therein, and studies to know it with a complete and upright knowledge, he acquires therewith life in the World to Come. And, in the measure of his works and wisdom he obtains his acquisition. We were moreover, assured in the Torah that if we will observe it in joy and out of goodness of soul, and constantly meditate in its wisdom, He will detach from us all such things which prevent us from observing it, such as sickness, war, famine and the like. He will, in addition thereto, be bountiful unto us by giving us all good which sustain our hands to observe the Torah, as plenty, peace, and an increase in silver and gold, so that we be not occupied all of our days in the things that are of bodily need, but, instead, be at leisure to study wisdom and observe the precept in order to acquire life in the World to Come. Even so it is said in the Torah: "And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments, before the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us" (Deut. 6.24–25). He made likewise known to us, that if we will purposely abandon the Torah, and busy ourselves with the vanities of the times, as the subject is spoken of, saying: "But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked (Ibid. 32.15). The True Judge will detatch from the forsakers all the good of this world which had strengthened their hands so that they kicked, and bring upon them all the evil to prevent them from acquiring the World to Come, so that they be lost in their wickedness. This is as it is written in the Torah: "Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy who the Lord shall send against thee" (Ibid. 28. 46–47) Consequently, the interpretation of all those blessings and curses is this way: As if saying, if you have served the Lord with joyfulness and observed His way, he will bestow in abundance these blessings upon you and set at a distance the curses from you, so that you be at leisure to grow wise in the wisdom of the Torah, and to busy yourselves therein, and so that you will merit life in the World to Come, and to do you good in the world which is all good, and prolong your days in the world which is unending, and you will find yourselves acquiring two worlds, to good living in this world, which will bring to a life in the World to Come, for if one does not acquire wisdom and good works here he has nothing else to acquire it with, even as it said: "For there is no work, no device, no knowledge nor wisdom in the grave (Ecc. 9.10). But if you have forsaken the Lord, and did err in eating drinking and prostitution, and their like, he will bring upon you those curses and detach from you all blessings until you will end your days in confusion and dread, and your will have neither a heart of leisure nor a sound body to perform the precepts, so that you lose the life in the World to Come, as a consequence whereof you will have lost two worlds; for, as long as a man is occupied in this world with sickness, war and hunger he can not be engaged either in wisdom or in precepts, by which to acquire the World to Come.
Because of this, all Israel their prophets and their scholars craved for the Messianic era so that they may rest up from tyrannical government which do not give them the tranquility to study the Torah and observe the precepts as they ought to, and so that they may find the peacefulness of mind to increase wisdom in order to acquire life in the World to Come. For, in those days knowledge and wisdom and truth will increase, even as it is said: "For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord" (Is. 11.9); and it is again said: "And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother" (Jer. 31.34); and it is yet again said: "And I will take the stony heart out of your flesh" (Ez. 36.26), as that king who will arise from the seed of David will be gifted with wisdom more than Solomon, and great in prophecy nigh unto Moses our Master. He will, therefore, teach the whole people and point out to them the Lord's path, and all nations will come to listen to him, even as it is said: "And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains" (Is. 2.2). Nevertheless, the end of the whole reward, and the last good which has neither interruption nor diminution is life in the World to Come. As for the Messianic era, it is in this world, and the world goes on after its fashion, save only that Israel will again have a government. Indeed, the ancient sages have long since said: "There is no difference between this world and the Messianic era, save alone in the oppression of government.<sup>1</sup>

Chapter 10

Let no man say: "Behold, I perform the precepts of the Torah, and engage myself in its wisdom so that I will receive all the blessings described therein, or so that I will merit the life in the World to Come; and I will separate myself from the transgressions against which the Torah gave warning so that I will escape the curses described therein, or so that I will suffer excision from the life in the World to Come". It is improper to serve the Lord in such way, for whosoever serves the Lord in such way, he is a worshiper because of fear, which is neither the degree of the prophets nor the degree of the sages. And the Lord should not be worshiped that way, save only by ignorant men, women and infants who are trained to worship because of fear, until their knowledge increases when they will worship because of love.
The worshiper because of love, engages himself in the study of the Torah and the observance of precepts and follows the paths of wisdom on no account in the world, neither for fear of evil nor in order to inherit the good; but he does the true thing because it is true, and in the end the good comes because thereof,. That degree is a great degree, indeed and not every scholar attains it; for such was the degree of Abraham our father, whom the Holy One, blessed is He! called His beloved, because he worshiped not, save because of love, and it is, furthermore, the degree concerning which the Holy One, blessed is He! commanded through Moses, saying: "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God" (Deut. 6.5); for, when man will love the Lord with a proper love, he will momentarily perform all of the commandments because of love.
And what is the proper love? He shall love the Lord with an exceeding great and very strong love so that his soul be tied to the love of the Lord, finding himself in a constant tremor, as if he were suffering of lovesickness, when his mind is free because of love for that woman, being continuously agitated about her, whether he sitting down, or whether he is standing up, even when he is eating and drinking. More than this should the love for the Lord be in the heart of those who love him, meditating therein constantly, even as He commanded us: "With all thy heart and with all thy soul" (Ibid.). This is what Solomon allegorically said: "For I am love-sick" (Songs 2.5). And, the whole book, Song of Songs, is an allegory on this subject.
Said the ancient sages: "Peradventure you will say, behold, I study the Torah so that I will become rich, so that I will be called Rabbi, or so that I will receive reward in the World to Come, learn from what it is said: "That thou mayest love the Lord" (Deut. 30.20), all that you do, you shall not do save because of love. The sages, moreover, said: "For his commandments crave exceedingly, but not for the reward of His commandments". And the great sages likewise commanded particularly their intelligent and progressive disciples: "Be not like servants who minister to their master on condition of receiving a reward; but be like servants who minister to their master without condition of receiving a reward"; for, because he is the master it is proper to minister to him, as if saying, minister because of love.
He who engages himself in the study of the Torah in order to receive a reward, or in order to prevent himself from being overtaken by punishment, is one who studies the Torah not for its own sake. But he who studies it neither because of fear nor because of reward, but because of love for the Lord of the whole earth Who commanded concerning it, is one who studies it for its own sake. Therefore when instructions are given to infants, to women and the ignorant in general, they should not be instructed save to worship because of fear, until their knowledge will increase, and they will became wise in wisdom, when this secret is revealed to them little by little, and get them acquainted with this subject slowly, until they will attain and know it, when they will serve Him because of Love.
It is a known and clear matter that the love for the Holy One, blessed is He! does not become tied up within the heart of man unless he will constantly feel its proper tremor, and abandon everything in the world save that alone, even as He commanded: "With all thine heart and with all thine soul" (Ibid. 6.5). No one loves the Holy One, blessed is He! save by the measure of knowledge that he knows Him. According to that knowledge will that love be; if it be small, the love will be small; if it be abundant, the love will be abundant. It is, therefore, necessary for man to dedicate himself to understand and acquire intelligence in the sciences and reasonings which make known to him his Owner, in the measure of power that man possesses to understand and attain it, as we have elucidated it in the treatise concerning the Foundations of the Torah.
