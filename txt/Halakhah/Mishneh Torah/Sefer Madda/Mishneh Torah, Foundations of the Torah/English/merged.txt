Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah



Chapter 1

The foundation of all foundations and the pillar of wisdom is to know that there is a Primary Being who brought into being all existence. All the beings of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them came into existence only from the truth of His being.
If one would imagine that He does not exist, no other being could possibly exist.
If one would imagine that none of the entities aside from Him exist, He alone would continue to exist, and the nullification of their [existence] would not nullify His existence, because all the [other] entities require Him and He, blessed be He, does not require them nor any one of them. Therefore, the truth of His [being] does not resemble the truth of any of their [beings].
This is implied by the prophet's statement [Jeremiah 10:10]: "And God, your Lord, is true" - i.e., He alone is true and no other entity possesses truth that compares to His truth. This is what [is meant by] the Torah's statement [Deuteronomy 4:35]: "There is nothing else aside from Him" - i.e., aside from Him, there is no true existence like His.
This entity is the God of the world and the Lord of the entire earth. He controls the sphere with infinite and unbounded power. This power [continues] without interruption, because the sphere is constantly revolving, and it is impossible for it to revolve without someone causing it to revolve. [That one is] He, blessed be He, who causes it to revolve without a hand or any [other] corporeal dimension.
The knowledge of this concept is a positive commandment, as [implied by Exodus 20:2]: "I am God, your Lord...."<br>Anyone who presumes that there is another god transgresses a negative commandment, as [Exodus 20:3] states: "You shall have no other gods before Me" and denies a fundamental principle [of faith], because this is the great principle [of faith] upon which all depends.
This God is one. He is not two or more, but one, unified in a manner which [surpasses] any unity that is found in the world; i.e., He is not one in the manner of a general category which includes many individual entities, nor one in the way that the body is divided into different portions and dimensions. Rather, He is unified, and there exists no unity similar to His in this world.<br>If there were many gods, they would have body and form, because like entities are separated from each other only through the circumstances associated with body and form.<br>Were the Creator to have body and form, He would have limitation and definition, because it is impossible for a body not to be limited. And any entity which itself is limited and defined [possesses] only limited and defined power. Since our God, blessed be His name, possesses unlimited power, as evidenced by the continuous revolution of the sphere, we see that His power is not the power of a body. Since He is not a body, the circumstances associated with bodies that produce division and separation are not relevant to Him. Therefore, it is impossible for Him to be anything other than one.<br>The knowledge of this concept fulfills a positive commandment, as [implied by Deuteronomy 6:4]: "[Hear, Israel,] God is our Lord, God is one."
Behold, it is explicitly stated in the Torah and [the works of] the prophets that the Holy One, blessed be He, is not [confined to] a body or physical form, as [Deuteronomy 4:39, Joshua 2:11] states: "Because God, your Lord, is the Lord in the heavens above and the earth below," and a body cannot exist in two places [simultaneously].<br>Also, [Deuteronomy 4:15] states: "For you did not see any image," and [Isaiah 40:25] states: "To whom can you liken Me, with whom I will be equal." Were He [confined to] a body, He would resemble other bodies.
If so, what is the meaning of the expressions employed by the Torah: "Below His feet" [Exodus 24:10], "Written by the finger of God" [ibid. 31:18], "God's hand" [ibid. 9:3], "God's eyes" [Genesis 38:7], "God's ears" [Numbers 11:1], and the like?<br>All these [expressions were used] to relate to human thought processes which know only corporeal imagery, for the Torah speaks in the language of man. They are only descriptive terms, as [apparent from Deuteronomy 32:41]: "I will whet My lightning sword." Does He have a sword? Does He need a sword to kill? Rather, this is metaphoric imagery. [Similarly,] all [such expressions] are metaphoric imagery.<br>A proof of this concept: One prophet says that he saw the Holy One, blessed be He, "clothed in snow white" [Daniel 7:9], and another envisioned Him [coming] "with crimson garments from Batzra" [Isaiah 63:1]. Moses, our teacher, himself envisioned Him at the [Red] Sea as a mighty man, waging war, and, at Mount Sinai, [saw Him] as the leader of a congregation, wrapped [in a <i>tallit</i>].<br>This shows that He has no image or form. All these are merely expressions of prophetic vision and imagery and the truth of this concept cannot be grasped or comprehended by human thought. This is what the verse [Job 11:7] states: "Can you find the comprehension of God? Can you find the ultimate bounds of the Almighty?"
[If so,] what did Moses, our teacher, want to comprehend when he requested: "Please show me Your glory" [Exodus 33:18]?<br>He asked to know the truth of the existence of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the extent that it could be internalized within his mind, as one knows a particular person whose face he saw and whose image has been engraved within one's heart. Thus, this person's [identity] is distinguished within one's mind from [that of] other men. Similarly, Moses, our teacher, asked that the existence of the Holy One, blessed be He, be distinguished in his mind from the existence of other entities, to the extent that he would know the truth of His existence as it is [in its own right].<br>He, blessed be He, replied to him that it is not within the potential of a living man, [a creature of] body and soul, to comprehend this matter in its entirety. [Nevertheless,] He, blessed be He, revealed to [Moses] matters which no other man had known before him - nor would ever know afterward - until he was able to comprehend [enough] from the truth of His existence, for the Holy One, blessed be He, to be distinguished in his mind from other entities, as a person is distinguished from other men when one sees his back and knows the structure of his body and [the manner in which] he is clothed.<br>This is alluded to by the verse [Exodus 33:23]: "You shall see My back, but you shall not see My face."
Since it has been clarified that He does not have a body or corporeal form, it is also clear that none of the functions of the body are appropriate to Him: neither connection nor separation, neither place nor measure, neither ascent nor descent, neither right nor left, neither front nor back, neither standing nor sitting.<br>He is not found within time, so that He would possess a beginning, an end, or age. He does not change, for there is nothing that can cause Him to change.<br>[The concept of] death is not applicable to Him, nor is [that of] life within the context of physical life. [The concept of] foolishness is not applicable to Him, nor is [that of] wisdom in terms of human wisdom.<br>Neither sleep nor waking, neither anger nor laughter, neither joy nor sadness, neither silence nor speech in the human understanding of speech [are appropriate terms with which to describe Him]. Our Sages declared: "Above, there is no sitting or standing, separation or connection."
Since this is so, all such [descriptions] and the like which are related in the Torah and the words of the Prophets - all these are metaphors and imagery. [For example,] "He who sits in the heavens shall laugh" [Psalms 2:4], "They angered Me with their emptiness" [Deuteronomy 32:21], and "As God rejoiced" [ibid. 28:63]. With regard to all such statements, our Sages said: "The Torah speaks in the language of man."<br>This is [borne out by the rhetorical question (Jeremiah 7:19 :] "Are they enraging Me?" Behold, [Malachi 3:6] states: "I, God, have not changed." Now were He to at times be enraged and at times be happy, He would change. Rather, all these matters are found only with regard to the dark and low bodies, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is dust. In contrast, He, blessed be He, is elevated and exalted above all this.

Chapter 2

It is a mitzvah to love and fear this glorious and awesome God, as [Deuteronomy 6:5] states: "And you shall love God, your Lord" and, as [Deuteronomy 6:13] states: "Fear God, your Lord."
What is the path [to attain] love and fear of Him? When a person contemplates His wondrous and great deeds and creations and appreciates His infinite wisdom that surpasses all comparison, he will immediately love, praise, and glorify [Him], yearning with tremendous desire to know [God's] great name, as David stated: "My soul thirsts for the Lord, for the living God" [Psalms 42:3].<br>When he [continues] to reflect on these same matters, he will immediately recoil in awe and fear, appreciating how he is a tiny, lowly, and dark creature, standing with his flimsy, limited, wisdom before He who is of perfect knowledge, as David stated: "When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers... [I wonder] what is man that You should recall Him" [Psalms 8:4-5].<br>Based on these concepts, I will explain important principles regarding the deeds of the Master of the worlds to provide a foothold for a person of understanding to [develop] love for God, as our Sages said regarding love: "In this manner, you will recognize He who spoke and [thus,] brought the world into being."
Everything which the Holy One, blessed be He, created within His world is divided into three categories. They include:<br>a) Creations which are a combination of matter and form. They are constantly coming into existence and ceasing to exist; for example, the bodies of man and beasts, plants, and metals.<br>b) Creations which are [also] a combination of matter and form, but do not change from body to body and from form to form as those in the first category. Rather, their form is permanently fixed in their matter, and they do not change as the others do; for example, the spheres and the stars [which revolve] in them. The matter [from which] they [are composed] differs from [a simple conception of] matter, and their form differs from [a simple conception of] form.<br>c) Creations which have form, but no matter at all; for example, the angels, for the angels do not possess bodies or corporeal being, but rather are forms which are separate from each other.
What is meant by the prophets' statements that they saw an angel of fire or with wings? All these are prophetic visions and parables, as [Deuteronomy 4:24] states: "God, your Lord, is consuming fire," though He is not fire and [the description of Him in this manner] is only metaphoric. Similarly, [Psalms 104:4] states: "He makes His angels as winds...."
Since they possess no body, what separates the form [of the angels] from each other? Their existence is not alike. Rather each one is below the level of the other and exists by virtue of its influence, [in a progression of levels,] one above the other.<br>Everything exists by virtue of the influence of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His goodness. Solomon alluded to this [concept] in his wisdom, saying (Ecclesiastes 5:7 : "Because above the one who is high there is a watcher [and there are others higher than them]."
The expression "below the level of the other" does not refer to height in a spatial sense as [one might say], he is sitting higher than his colleague, [but rather, in regard to spiritual level]. For example, when speaking about two sages, one of whom is greater than the other, we say, "one is above the level of the other." Similarly, a cause is referred to as "above" the effect [it produces].
The different names with which the angels are called reflect their [spiritual] levels. Thus, they are called:<br>1) The holy <i>chayyot,</i> who are above all the others;<br><i>2)</i> the <i>ofanim; 7)</i> the <i>elohim;</i><br><i>3)</i> the <i>er'elim; 8)</i> the sons of the <i>elohim;</i><br><i>4)</i> the <i>chashmalim; 9)</i> the <i>keruvim;</i><br><i>5)</i> the <i>serafim;</i> 10) the <i>ishim.</i><br><i>6)</i> the <i>mal'achim;</i><br>These ten names which are used to refer to the angels reflect their ten [different spiritual] levels. The level above which there is no higher level except that of God, blessed be He, is that of the form called <i>chayyot.</i> Therefore, the prophets state that they are below God's throne of glory.<br>The tenth [and lowest] level is that of the form called <i>ishim.</i> They are the angels who communicate with the prophets and are perceived by them in prophetic visions. Therefore, they are called <i>ishim,</i> (“men”), because their level is close to the level of human knowledge.
All these [spiritual] forms are alive. They recognize and know the Creator with very immense knowledge, each of the forms according to its level and not according to its greatness.<br>Even the highest level is unable to conceive of the true nature of the Creator as He [truly] is, since its intellectual capacity is too limited to know or to grasp [Him]. It does, however, comprehend and know more than the form which is below it.<br>This is true regarding each and every level, including the tenth level. This [level] also knows the Creator in a manner that surpasses the potential to know and comprehend [God possessed by] human beings made up of body and soul. None [of these levels] can know the Creator as He knows Himself.
All existence, aside from the Creator - from the first form down to a small mosquito in the depths of the earth - came into being from the influence of His truth. Since He knows Himself and recognizes His greatness, beauty, and truth, He knows everything, and nothing is hidden from Him.
The Holy One, blessed be He, recognizes His truth and knows it as it is. He does not know with a knowledge which is external to Him in the way that we know, for ourselves and our knowledge are not one. Rather, the Creator, may He be blessed, He, His knowledge, and His life are one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity.<br>Were He to live as life is [usually conceived], or know with a knowledge that is external from Him, there would be many gods, Him, His life, and His knowledge. The matter is not so. Rather, He is one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity. Thus, you could say, "He is the Knower, He is the Subject of Knowledge, and He is the Knowledge itself." All is one.<br>This matter is beyond the ability of our mouths to relate, [or our] ears to hear, nor is there [the capacity] within the heart of man to grasp it in its entirety. [In expression of this concept, Genesis 42:15] states: "<i>chay</i> (By the life) of Pharaoh" and [I Samuel 25:26] states "<i>chay,</i> (By the life) of your soul," but [I Samuel, <i>ibid.</i>] does not say: "<i>chay,</i> (By the life) of God" but <i>chai Adonai</i>, “As God lives.” [This shows] that the Creator and His life are not two, as are the lives of living beings or the lives of the angels.<br>Thus, He does not recognize and know the creations in terms of the creations as we know them, but rather He knows them in terms of Himself. Thus, since He knows Himself, He knows everything, for the existence of everything else is dependent on Him.
The concepts that we have mentioned about the subject matter in these two chapters are like a drop from the sea [when compared to] what is necessary to explain this matter. The explanation of all the fundamental principles of these two chapters is referred to as <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah,</i> (lit. “the work of [G‑d’s] chariot.”)
The Sages of the early generations commanded that these matters should not be explained except to a single individual [at a time]. He should be a wise man, who can reach understanding with his [powers of] knowledge. In such an instance, he is given fundamental points, and an outline of the concepts is made known to him. He [is expected to continue to contemplate] until he reaches understanding with his powers of knowledge and knows the ultimate meaning and depth of the concept.<br>These concepts are extremely deep, and not every [person has] the knowledge necessary to appreciate them. In his wisdom, Solomon described them with the metaphor [Proverbs 27:26]: "Lambs for your clothing." [The root <i>kevas</i> - "lamb" - also has the meaning "hide."] Thus, our Sages interpreted this metaphor [to mean]: Matters which are the secrets of the world will be your clothing - i.e., they will be for you alone, and you should not discuss them in public.<br>Concerning them, [Proverbs 5:17] teaches: "They shall be for you and not for others with you." [Similarly, the Song of Songs 4:11] states: "Honey and milk will be under your tongue." The Sages of the early generations interpreted this [as a metaphor]: Subjects that are like honey and milk should be [kept] under your tongue.

Chapter 3

The spheres are called the heavens, the firmament, the habitation, the skies.<br>There are nine spheres. The closest sphere is the sphere of the moon. The second sphere, which is above it, is the sphere which contains the planet <i>Kochav.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In translation, this word means "star" or "planet." It refers to the planet Mercury.</i> The third sphere, which is above it, contains [the planet] <i>Nogah.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In translation, this word means "shining." It refers to the planet Venus.</i> The fourth sphere contains the sun. The fifth sphere contains [the planet] <i>Ma'dim.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In translation, this word means "reddening." It refers to the planet Mars.</i> The sixth sphere contains the planet <i>Tzedek.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In translation, this word means "justice." It refers to the planet Jupiter.</i> The seventh sphere contains [the planet] <i>Shabbtai.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In translation, this word means "the Sabbatical." It refers to the planet Saturn.</i>The eighth sphere contains all the stars which are seen in the sky. The ninth sphere is the sphere which revolves each day from the east to the west.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 91b states that the <i>Shechinah</i> (Divine Presence) is in the west. Hence, the movement of this sphere in this direction can be considered an act of service to God.</i> It surrounds and encompasses everything.<br>The planets and stars all appear to be in one sphere, even though one is higher than another. This is because the spheres are pure and refined like glass or sapphire. Therefore, the stars in the eighth sphere appear lower than the first sphere.
Each of the eight spheres which contain the planets and stars are themselves divided into many spheres, one above the other like the layers of an onion. Some of these spheres revolve from the west to the east, and some revolve from the east to the west, such as the ninth sphere, which revolves from the east to the west. There is no empty space between any of them.
None of the spheres are light or heavy. They are neither red, black, nor any other color. Though we see them as blue, this is only our perception, because of the height of the atmosphere.<br>Similarly, they have neither taste nor smell, because these phenomena are present only in matter lower than they. <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 10 and in Chapter 2, Halachah 3, the state of matter of the spheres differs from the state of matter in our world.</i>
All these [nine] spheres which surround the world are spherical like a ball, and the Earth is suspended in their midst.<br>Some of the planets have small spheres fixed [around] them. These spheres do not surround the Earth. Rather, a small sphere which does not surround the Earth is fixed within a large sphere which does.
The total number of spheres which surround the Earth entirely is eighteen,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">These include some of the smaller spheres which are included with the eight larger spheres.</i> and the number of smaller spheres which do not surround [the world] is eight.<br>From the movement of the planets and the knowledge of the extent of their revolution each day and each moment, their position either northward or southward, and their distance above the Earth and closeness to it, [it is possible to] know the number of all these spheres, the manner in which they proceed, and the nature of their orbit. This is the science of calculating the seasons and astronomy. Many books about these subjects were written by the wise men of Greece.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Rambam's remarks in <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 17:24:<br>This is the science of the seasons and geometry about which the wise men of Greece composed many books. These are presently found in the hands of the Sages. However, the texts which were composed by the Sages of Israel of the tribe of Issachar in the time of the Prophets have not reached us.<br>[Nevertheless,] since these concepts have been proven conclusively... we are not concerned about the author, regardless of whether they were authored by the prophets or the gentiles.... We are not relying on the person who states or teaches the concept, but on the proofs.</i>
The ninth sphere, which encompasses all the others, was divided by the Sages of the early generations into twelve sections. They gave each of these sections a name, based on the shapes that appeared to be formed by the stars below it which correspond to it.<br>These are the <i>mazalot,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>mazal</i> literally means "source of influence." In the Rambam's time, it was commonly felt that the position of the stars affected one's future. For this reason, the word <i>mazal</i> is often translated as "fortune" or "luck." Many Torah Sages shared these ideas - albeit with the qualification that a Jew always has the potential to rise above these influences. (See the Ra'avad's comments to <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 5:5; Ramban, Responsum 282; and the Nimukei Yosef, Sanhedrin, Chapter 7).<br>The Rambam totally dismisses the influence of astrology. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7, he describes it as "empty words and lies," and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 8, he mentions "the madness with which the astrologers attempt to deceive."</i> which are called the lamb, the ox, the twins, the crab, the lion, the virgin, the scales, the scorpion, the bow, the goat, the bucket, and the fish.
The ninth sphere itself has no division, nor does it possess any of these shapes or any stars. Rather, the larger stars of the constellations of the eighth sphere are seen in the shape of these forms, or [in a form] resembling them.<br>These twelve forms corresponded to these divisions only at the time of the flood and then, they were given these names. However, at present, they have already moved slightly, because all the stars in the eighth sphere move, as the sun and the moon do. It is just that [these stars] move more slowly. It would take any of these stars approximately seventy years to move the [same] distance which the sun and the moon'' move in one day.
[Among] all the stars we see are small ones which the Earth surpasses in size and large ones which are several times larger than the Earth.<br>Our Earth is approximately 40 times larger than the moon, and the sun is approximately 170 times larger than the Earth. Thus, the moon is approximately one 6800th the size of the sun. None of the other stars is as large as the sun, nor is one as small as [the planet] <i>Kochav,</i> in the second sphere.
All the stars and spheres possess a soul, knowledge, and intellect. They are alive and stand in recognition of the One who spoke and [thus brought] the world into being.<br>According to their size and level, each one praises and glorifies their Creator as the angels do.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, <i>Pesachim</i> 2a interprets Psalms 148:3, "Praise Him all shining stars," simply - i.e., the stars render praise to God. However, note how the <i>Targum</i> and the <i>Midrash Sachar Tov</i> interpret Psalms 19:2, "The heavens relate the glory of God," as "The heavens cause others to relate.</i> Just as they are aware of the Holy One, blessed be He, they are also aware of themselves and of the angels which surpass them. The knowledge of the stars and the spheres is less than the knowledge of the angels, but greater than that of men.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Note the differences between this halachah and Chapter 2, Halachah 8.</i>
Below the sphere of the moon, God created a [type of] matter<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to primeval, unformed matter. In Greek terminology, it is referred to as <i>hyli.</i></i> which differs from the matter of the spheres. He created four forms<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The word "form" in this context refers to the entity's spiritual qualities and not its physical shape.</i> for this matter, which differ from the forms of matter of the spheres.<br>Each of these forms was fixed in a portion of this matter [as it exists in its totality]. The first of these forms is the form of fire. [When] it became connected to a portion of this matter, from the two there came into being a body of fire.<br>The second of these forms is the form of wind. [When] it became connected to a portion of this matter, from the two there came into being a body of wind.<br>The third of these forms is the form of water. [When] it became connected to a portion of this matter, from the two there came into being a body of water.<br>The fourth of these forms is the form of earth. [When] it became connected to a portion of this matter, from the two there came into being a body of earth.<br>Thus, below the sky there are four different states of matter, one above the other, each one encompassing the one below it from all directions, like a sphere. The first of these bodies, which is closest to the sphere of the moon, is that of fire. Below it is the body of wind, below it the body of water, and below it the body of Earth. There is no empty space without any matter between them at all.
These four bodies do not possess a soul, nor are they conscious or knowing. Rather, they are like dead bodies. Each one has its inclinations. However, it is not conscious or knowledgeable [of these inclinations], nor can it change them.<br>David's statement (Psalms 148:7-8): "Praise God from the Earth, sea-monsters and all the depths; fire and hail, snow and vapor" [does not contradict the above statement].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Although Notes 6 and 11 mention the Sages' interpretation of the movement of the stars and spheres as an expression of their praise of God, such a statement cannot be made with regard to these four fundamental elements. They, unlike the stars, are not conscious beings, and their movement and activity are merely natural patterns imprinted within them by God, as explained in Chapter 4, Halachah 2.</i> That verse should be interpreted: Men, praise [God] for His mightiness which is apparent in the fire, hail, and other creations that can be seen below the sky, because their power is always visible to [both] the great and the small.

Chapter 4

These four bodies: fire, wind, water, and earth are the fundamental [elements] of all the creations below the sky. Everything that exists - [be it] man, beast, fowl, crawling creature, fish, plant, metal, precious stone, pearl, building stone, mountain, or lump of earth - the body of all these [entities] is a combination of these four fundamental [elements].<br>Thus, all the bodies which are found below the sky, with the exception of these four bodies, are a combination of matter and form,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Here and in the following halachot, the word "form" refers to the entity's spiritual qualities, and not its physical shape.</i> and their matter is a combination of these fundamental [elements]. These fundamental [elements], however, are a combination of matter and form [as they exist in a <i>hylian</i> state] alone.
The tendency of fire and wind is to ascend upwards from the depths of the earth toward the sky. The tendency of water and earth is to descend from the sky to the midpoint of the sky, [i.e., the center of the Earth,] for the midpoint of the sky is the lowest point, below which nothing is lower.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since the heavens are spherical, anything past the midpoint of the Earth can be considered to be "higher" when approaching from the opposite side.</i> These tendencies are not a conscious matter, nor are they willful. Rather, it is a pattern affixed within them and a nature they were given.<br>The natural characteristics of fire are that it is warm and dry. It is the lightest of all [these fundamental elements]. Wind is warm and moist. Water is cold and moist, and earth is dry and cold. It is the heaviest of all [these fundamental elements].<br>Water is lighter than earth. Therefore, it is found above it. Wind is lighter than water. Therefore, it hovers above it. Fire is even lighter than wind.<br>Since these are the fundamental [elements] for all the bodies below the sky, the matter of every single body - man, animal, beast, fowl, fish, plant, metal, and stone - is a combination of fire, wind, water, and earth. [In the process of] the combination of these four, each one of them changes while they are being combined. Thus, the combination of the four [fundamental elements] does not resemble any one of the [elements] as it exists alone. [Similarly,] in any combination of them, there cannot be found even one portion of fire as it exists alone, wind as it exists alone, water as it exists alone, nor earth as it exists alone. Rather, they have all changed and become a single body.<br>Each and every body which is a combination of these four [fundamental elements] will have a combination of cold and warmth, moistness and dryness. There are some bodies which have a more powerful [concentration] of the fundamental [element] of fire - for example, creatures with living souls. Accordingly, they have a higher temperature. [Conversely,] there are some bodies with a more powerful concentration of the element of earth - for example, the stones. Accordingly, they are very dry. Similarly, some of them have bodies with a greater concentration of the element of water. Accordingly, they are moist.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From the above statements, it appears that the "fundamental elements" of fire, wind, water, and earth are different from the entities to which we generally refer with these names.</i><br>In this manner, one may find one body which is warmer than another body, which is itself warm, and one body drier than another body, which is itself dry. Similarly, there are bodies in which cold alone is noticeable, and other bodies in which moistness alone is noticeable. In some bodies, cold and dryness are equally noticeable; in others, cold and moistness are equally noticeable; in others, warmth and dryness are equally noticeable; and in others, warmth and moistness are equally noticeable. According to the predominance of the element that is found in the essential combination, the inclination and nature of that element will be expressed in the body [resulting from] a mixture [of all the elements].
Every entity which is a combination of these four fundamental [elements] will ultimately decompose into them.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Note the similarities to the concept of entropy.</i> Some will decompose after a mere few days, and others will decompose after many years. [However,] it is impossible for everything which is a combination of them not to decompose into them. It is impossible even for gold and ruby not to decompose and return to their fundamental elements: a portion becoming fire, a portion water, a portion wind, and a portion earth.
Since every [entity will] decompose and separate into these four fundamental [elements], why was Adam told: "You will return to dust," [implying that man will return to dust alone]? Because the major part of man's composition is from dust. <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This statement appears to contradict the statement in Halacha 2 that creatures with souls are predominantly from the element of fire. It is possible to explain that Halachah 2 refers even to animal life, while this halacha refers explicitly to man. Man's body – being predominantly from earth – is less refined than that of the animals. His soul, however, is on a much higher level that the animal's life-force.</i> every [entity that] decomposes will not return to the four fundamental [elements] immediately. Rather, it will decompose and change into another entity. That entity will, in turn, change into another entity, until ultimately, it will return to the elements. Thus, all entities are constantly returning [to their elemental state] in a cycle.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The cycle of change is discussed in the following halachah.</i>
These four fundamental [elements] are in a constant [state of flux], with a certain portion - but never the entire matter - of one changing into another every day and every hour.<br>What is implied? A portion of the earth which is close to the water changes, dissolves, and becomes water. Similarly, a portion of the water which is close to the wind changes, evaporates, and becomes wind. A portion of the wind which is close to the fire changes, goes through a metamorphosis, and becomes fire.<br>Similarly, a portion of the fire close to the wind goes through a metamorphosis, changes, contracts and becomes wind. The wind which is close to the water changes, contracts, and becomes water; and the water which is close to the earth changes, contracts, and becomes earth.<br>This [cycle of] change [proceeds] little by little over the course of time. The entire fundamental [element] will never change – [for example], all the water will never become wind, nor all the wind fire – because it is impossible for [the existence of] one of the four fundamental [elements] to be nullified. Rather, a portion of the fire will change to wind, and a portion of the wind to fire. Similarly, between each pair of these four, change will go on in an unceasing recurrent cycle.
This [cycle of] change is caused by the revolution of the sphere. Its revolution causes the four [fundamental elements] to combine, and thus forms the matter of men, living beasts, plants, stones, and metals.<br>God gives each body the form appropriate to it through the angels of the tenth [level], which are the form called <i>ishim.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabbah 10:6 states: "There is no blade of grass that grows without having a spiritual force... telling it to grow.<sup>"</sup></i></i></i>
You will never see matter without form, or form without matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Every entity in this world has physical matter and a spiritual life force. However, the two cannot be separated from each other. The matter cannot exist without the life force, nor can the life force be discerned by human eyes except through its expression in a body.</i> It is the heart of man which in its knowledge considers the bodies that are found and knows that they are a combination of matter and form.<br>It appreciates that there are bodies whose matter is a combination of the four fundamental [elements],<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the creations of our physical world, as explained in Halachah 2.</i> bodies whose matter is simple and contains only one type of matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the spheres and the stars. As explained in Chapter 3, Halachah 3, and Chapter 2, Halachah 3, they are composed of a different type of matter from the creations in our world.</i> and forms which have no matter and cannot be seen by the eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the angels. As explained in Chapter 2, Halachah 4, they are spiritual beings without material bodies.</i> [The latter] are discernible only to the eye of the heart. [We can appreciate their existence, just] as we know of [the existence of] the Master of everything, [though we do] not see [Him] with [our] eyes.
The soul of all flesh is the form which it was given by God. The extra dimension which is found in the soul of man is the form of man who is perfect in his knowledge. Concerning this form, the Torah states [Genesis 1:26]: "Let us make man in our image and in our likeness" - i.e., granting man a form which knows and comprehends ideas that are not material, like the angels, who are form without body, until he can resemble them.[This statement] does not refer to the form of the body perceived by the eye - i.e., the mouth, the nose, the cheeks, and the remainder of the structure of the body. This is referred to as <i>to'ar</i> (appearance).<br>It is not the soul found in all living flesh which allows it to eat, drink, reproduce, feel, and think. Rather, knowledge is the form of this [dimension of] soul and it is concerning this form of the soul, that the verse states: "in our image and in our likeness." Frequently, this form is referred to as <i>nefesh</i> or <i>ruach.</i> Therefore, one must be careful regarding these names, lest another person err regarding them. Each name reveals its characteristics.
The form of this soul is not a combination of the fundamental [elements] into which it will ultimately decompose, nor does it come from the <i>neshamah</i> so that it would require the <i>neshamah,</i> as the <i>neshamah</i> requires the body. Rather, it is from God, from heaven.<br>Therefore, when the matter [of the body], which is a combination of the fundamental [elements], decomposes, and the <i>neshamah</i> ceases to exist - for [the <i>neshamah]</i> exists only together with the body and requires the body for all its deeds - this form will not be cut off, for this form does not require the <i>neshamah</i> for its deeds. Rather, it knows and comprehends knowledge which is above matter, knows the Creator of all things, and exists forever. In his wisdom, Solomon [gave this description (Ecclesiastes 12:7 ]: "The dust will return to the Earth as it [originally] was, and the <i>ruach</i> will return to God who granted it."
All these concepts which we have explained in this context are like a drop in a bucket. They are deep matters. Nevertheless, their depth does not approach the depth of the subject matter of the first and second chapters.<br>The explanation of all the subject matter in the third and fourth chapters is referred to as <i>Ma'aseh Bereshit</i> (“the work of Creation”).The Sages of the early generations commanded that these matters should not be expounded upon in public. Rather, a single individual should be informed about them and taught them.
What is the difference between the subject matter of <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah</i> and the subject matter of <i>Ma'aseh Bereshit?</i> The subject matter of <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah</i> should never be expounded upon - even to a single individual - unless he is wise and capable of understanding, [in which instance,] he is given fundamental points.<br>[In contrast,] the subject matter of <i>Ma'aseh Bereshit</i> may be taught to an individual even though he is incapable of comprehending it with his own powers of understanding [alone]. He may be informed about everything that he can possibly know about these matters. Why are they not taught publicly? Because not every person has the vast knowledge necessary to grasp the interpretation and the explanation of these matters in a complete manner.
When a person meditates on these matters and recognizes all the creations, the angels, the spheres, man, and the like, and appreciates the wisdom of the Holy One, blessed be He, in all these creations, he will add to his love for God. His soul will thirst and his flesh will long with love for God, blessed be He.<br>He will stand in awe and fear from his humble, lowly, and base [nature] when he compares himself to one of the great and holy bodies, how much more so when comparing himself to the pure forms which are separate from matter and do not share any connection with it. He will see himself as a vessel full of embarrassment and shame, empty and lacking.
The matters discussed in these four chapters concerning these five mitzvot are what the Sages of the early generations termed the <i>Pardes,</i> as they related: "Four entered the <i>Pardes...."</i> Even though they were great men of Israel and great Sages, not all of them had the potential to know and comprehend all these matters in their totality.<br>I maintain that it is not proper for a person to stroll in the <i>Pardes</i> unless he has filled his belly with bread and meat. "Bread and meat" refer to the knowledge of what is permitted and what is forbidden, and similar matters concerning other mitzvot. Even though the Sages referred to these as "a small matter" - for our Sages said: "'A great matter,’ this refers to <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah.</i> `A small matter,’ this refers to the debates of Abbaye and Ravva" - nevertheless, it is fitting for them to be given precedence, because they settle a person's mind.<br>Also, they are the great good which the Holy One, blessed be He, has granted, [to allow for] stable [living] within this world and the acquisition of the life of the world to come. They can be known in their totality by the great and the small, man or woman, whether [granted] expansive knowledge or limited knowledge.

Chapter 5

The entire house of Israel are commanded regarding the sanctification of [God's] great name, as [Leviticus 22:32] states: "And I shall be sanctified amidst the children of Israel." Also, they are warned against desecrating [His holy name], as [the above verse] states: "And they shall not desecrate My holy name."<br>What is implied? Should a gentile arise and force a Jew to violate one of the Torah's commandments at the pain of death, he should violate the commandment rather than be killed, because [Leviticus 18:5] states concerning the mitzvot: "which a man will perform and live by them." [They were given so that] one may live by them and not die because of them. If a person dies rather than transgress, he is held accountable for his life.
When does the above apply? With regard to other mitzvot, with the exception of the worship of other gods, forbidden sexual relations, and murder. However, with regard to these three sins, if one is ordered: "Transgress one of them or be killed," one should sacrifice his life rather than transgress.<br>When does the above apply? When the gentile desires his own personal benefit - for example, he forces a person to build a house or cook food for him on the Sabbath, he rapes a woman, or the like. However, if his intention is solely to have him violate the mitzvot, [the following rules apply:] If he is alone and there are not ten other Jews present, he should transgress and not sacrifice his life. However, if he forces him [to transgress] with the intention that he violate [a mitzvah] in the presence of ten Jews, he should sacrifice his life and not transgress. [This applies] even if [the gentile] intended merely that he violate only one of the [Torah's] mitzvot.
All the above [distinctions] apply [only in times] other than times of a decree. However, in times of a decree - i.e., when a wicked king like Nebuchadnezzar or his like will arise and issue a decree against the Jews to nullify their faith or one of the mitzvot - one should sacrifice one's life rather than transgress any of the other mitzvot, whether one is compelled [to transgress] amidst ten [Jews] or one is compelled [to transgress merely] amidst gentiles.
If anyone about whom it is said: "Transgress and do not sacrifice your life," sacrifices his life and does not transgress, he is held accountable for his life.<br>When anyone about whom it is said: "Sacrifice your life and do not transgress," sacrifices his life and does not transgress, he sanctifies [God's] name. If he does so in the presence of ten Jews, he sanctifies [God's] name in public, like Daniel, Chananiah, Mishael, Azariah, and Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues. These are those slain by [the wicked] kingdom, above whom there is no higher level. Concerning them, [Psalms 44:23] states: "For Your sake, we have been slain all day, we are viewed as sheep for the slaughter," and [Psalms 50:5] states: "Gather unto Me, My pious ones, those who have made a covenant with Me by slaughter."<br>When anyone about whom it is said: "Sacrifice your life and do not transgress," transgresses instead of sacrificing his life, he desecrates [God's] name. If he does so in the presence of ten Jews, he desecrates [God's] name in public, nullifies [the fulfillment of] the positive commandment of the sanctification of [God's] name, and violates the negative commandment against the desecration of God's name.<br>Nevertheless, since he was forced to transgress, he is not [punished by] lashing, and, needless to say, is not executed by the court even if he was forced to slay [a person]. The [punishments of] lashes and execution are administered only to one who transgresses voluntarily, [when the transgression is observed by] witnesses, and [when] a warning [was given], as [Leviticus 20:5] states concerning one who gives his children to [the worship of] Molech: "I will turn My face against that person."<br>The oral tradition teaches [that we can infer]: "that person" and not one who is forced [to transgress, who transgresses] inadvertently, or [who transgresses] because of an error. If, concerning the worship of false gods, which is the most serious [of sins], a person who is forced to worship is not liable for <i>karet,</i> nor, needless to say, execution by a court, how much more so [does this principle apply] regarding the other mitzvot of the Torah? [Similarly,] regarding forbidden sexual relations, [Deuteronomy 22:26] states: "Do not do anything to the maiden."<br>One who could, however, escape and flee from under the power of a wicked king and fails to do so is like a dog who returns [to lick] his vomit. He is considered as one who worships false gods willingly. He will be prevented from reaching the world to come and will descend to the lowest levels of Gehinnom.
If gentiles tell [a group of] women: "Give us one of you to defile. If not, we will defile all of you," they should allow themselves all to be defiled rather than give over a single Jewish soul to [the gentiles].<br>Similarly, if gentiles told [a group of Jews]: "Give us one of you to kill. If not, we will kill all of you," they should allow themselves all to be killed rather than give over a single soul to [the gentiles].<br>However, if [the gentiles] single out [a specific individual] and say: "Give us so and so or we will kill all of you," [different rules apply]: If the person is obligated to die like Sheva ben Bichri, they may give him over to them. Initially, however, this instruction is not conveyed to them. If he is not obligated to die, they should allow themselves all to be killed rather than give over a single soul to [the gentiles].
Just as these principles apply regarding being forced [to transgress], they also apply regarding sicknesses. What is implied?<br>When a person becomes sick and is in danger of dying, if the physicians say that his cure involves transgressing a given Torah prohibition, [the physicians' advice] should be followed. When there is a danger [to life], one may use any of the Torah prohibitions as a remedy, with the exception of the worship of false gods, forbidden sexual relations, and murder. Even when there is a danger [to life], one may not use them as a remedy. If one transgresses and uses them as a remedy, the court may impose the appropriate punishment upon him.
What is the source [which teaches] that even when there is a danger to life, these three sins should not be violated? [Deuteronomy 6:5] states: "And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might." [The words "with all your soul" imply] even if one takes your soul.<br>With regard to the killing of a Jewish person to heal another person or to save a person from one who is compelling him, it is logical that one person's life should not be sacrificed for another. [The Torah has] established an equation between forbidden sexual relations and murder, as [Deuteronomy 22:26] states: "This matter is just like a case where a person rises up against his colleague and slays him."
When does the above - that one may be healed using other prohibitions only when [one's life] is in danger - apply? When one uses them in a way which affords satisfaction - e.g., when one feeds a sick person insects or creeping animals, or chametz on Pesach, or when one is fed on Yom Kippur.<br>When, however, [the prohibited substances are used] in a way that does not grant satisfaction - e.g., one makes a bandage or compress of <i>chametz</i> on Pesach or from <i>orlah,</i> or when one is given bitter-tasting substances mixed with forbidden foods to drink - since one's palate derives no satisfaction, it is permitted even when no danger to life is involved.<br>Exceptions [to this leniency] are <i>kilai hakerem</i> and [mixtures of] milk and meat. [Deriving benefit] from them is forbidden even in a way that does not offer satisfaction. Therefore, they may not be used as a remedy even in a manner which does not grant satisfaction, except when there is danger [to life].
[When] someone becomes attracted to a woman and is [love-]sick [to the extent that] he is in danger of dying, [although] the physicians say he has no remedy except engaging in sexual relations with her, he should be allowed to die rather than engage in sexual relations with her. [This applies] even if she is unmarried.<br>He is even not to be given instructions to speak to her [in private] behind a fence. Rather, he should die rather than be given instructions to speak to her behind a fence. [These restrictions were instituted] so that Jewish women would not be regarded capriciously, and [to prevent] these matters from [ultimately] leading to promiscuity.
Whoever consciously transgresses one of the mitzvot related in the Torah, without being forced to, in a spirit of derision, to arouse [Divine] anger, desecrates [God's] name. Therefore, [Leviticus 19:12] states, regarding [taking] an oath in vain: "[for] you are desecrating the name of your Lord; I am God." If he transgresses amidst ten Jews, he desecrates [God's] name in public.<br>Conversely, anyone who refrains from committing a sin or performs a mitzvah for no ulterior motive, neither out of fear or dread, nor to seek honor, but for the sake of the Creator, blessed be He - as Joseph held himself back from his master's wife - sanctifies God's name.
There are other deeds which are also included in [the category of] the desecration of [God's] name, if performed by a person of great Torah stature who is renowned for his piety - i.e., deeds which, although they are not transgressions, [will cause] people to speak disparagingly of him. This also constitutes the desecration of [God's] name.<br>For example, a person who purchases [merchandise] and does not pay for it immediately, although he possesses the money, and thus, the sellers demand payment and he pushes them off; a person who jests immoderately; or who eats and drinks near or among the common people; or whose conduct with other people is not gentle and he does not receive them with a favorable countenance, but rather contests with them and vents his anger; and the like. Everything depends on the stature of the sage. [The extent to which] he must be careful with himself and go beyond the measure of the law [depends on the level of his Torah stature.]<br>[The converse is] also [true]. When a sage is stringent with himself, speaks pleasantly with others, his social conduct is [attractive] to others, he receives them pleasantly, he is humbled by them and does not humble them in return, he honors them - even though they disrespect him - he does business faithfully, and does not frequently accept the hospitality of the common people or sit with them, and at all times is seen only studying Torah, wrapped in <i>tzitzit,</i> crowned with <i>tefillin,</i> and carrying out all his deeds beyond the measure of the law - provided he does not separate too far [from normal living] and thus become forlorn – to the extent that all praise him, love him, and find his deeds attractive - such a person sanctifies [God's] name. The verse [Isaiah 49:3]: "And He said to me: `Israel, you are My servant, in whom I will be glorified'" refers to him.

Chapter 6

Whoever destroys one of the holy and pure names with which the Holy One, blessed be He, is called is liable for lashes according to Scriptural [Law].<br>[This punishment is given because such an act violates one of the Torah's prohibitions. The prohibition is derived as follows:] With regard to the worship of false gods, [Deuteronomy 12:3-4] states: "And you shall destroy their names from this place. Do not do this to God, your Lord."
There are seven names [for God]:<br>a) The name which is written <i>Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey</i>. This is [referred to as God's] explicit name and is [also] written <i>Alef-Daled-Nun-Yud</i>.<br><i>b)</i> [The name] <i>El;</i><br><i>c)</i> [The name] <i>Elo'ah;</i><br><i>d)</i> [The name] <i>Elohim;</i><br><i>e)</i> [The name] <i>Elohai;</i><br><i>f)</i> [The name] <i>Shaddai;</i><br><i>g)</i> [The name] <i>Tz'vaot;</i><br>Whoever erases even one letter from [any of] these seven names is [liable for] lashes.
All [the letters] which are connected to [God's] name, [but are placed] before [the name itself] may be erased - e.g., the <i>lamed</i> of <i>Lamed-Alef-Daled-Nun-Yud</i> or the <i>bet</i> of <i>B’Elohim</i> and the like. They do not possess the same degree of holiness as [God's] name [itself].<br>All [the letters] which are connected to [God's] name, [but placed] after [the name itself] - e.g., the final <i>chaf</i> of <i>Elohecha or the</i> chaf and the final <i>mem</i> of <i>Eloheichem,</i> and the like may not be erased. They are considered like the other letters of [God's] name, because the name conveys holiness upon them.<br>Although holiness is conveyed upon them and it is forbidden to erase them, nevertheless, a person who erases these letters which are connected to [God's] name is not [liable for] lashes. However, he does receives "stripes for rebelliousness."
If one writes the <i>alef</i> and the <i>lamed</i> of the name <i>Elohim</i> or the <i>yud</i> and the <i>hey</i> of the name <i>Yud-Hey–Vav–Hey</i>, [these letters] may not be erased. Needless to say, the name <i>Yud-Hey</i> [may not be erased]. It is [considered as] a name in its own right because it is part of [God's] explicit name.<br>However, if one writes the <i>shin</i> and the <i>dalet</i> of the name <i>Shaddai,</i> or the <i>tzadi</i> and the <i>bet</i> of the name <i>Tz'vaot,</i> [these letters] may be erased.
Other descriptive terms which are used to praise the Holy One, blessed be He - e.g., the Gracious, the Merciful, the Great, the Mighty, the Awesome, the Faithful, the Jealous, the Powerful, and the like, are considered as other holy texts and may be erased.
[When God's] name is written on a utensil, one should cut off [God's] name and bury it. Even [when God's] name is engraved on a metal or glass utensil and one melts the utensil, one should be [punished by] lashing. Instead, one should cut off [God's] name and bury it.<br>Similarly, if [God's] name was written on one's flesh, one should not wash or anoint oneself. Nor may one stand in a place of filth. If it occurs that such a person must immerse because of a mitzvah, he should wind reeds around [the name] and immerse himself. If he cannot find reeds, he should wind his clothes around it, but should not [wind them] tightly so they will not intervene [between his flesh and the water]. [This is acceptable because] the reason he is required to wind reeds around it is only because it is forbidden to stand before [God's] name when he is naked.
A person who removes even one stone from the altar, the Temple building, or the Temple courtyard with a destructive intent is [liable for] lashes. [The prohibition is derived as follows:] with regard to the worship of false gods, [Deuteronomy 12:3] states: "And you shall tear down their altars," and [the following verse] continues: "Do not do this to God, your Lord."<br>Similarly, a person who, with a destructive intent, burns wood consecrated to the Temple is [liable for] lashes. [The prohibition is derived as follows:] with regard to the worship of false gods, [Deuteronomy 12:3] states: "And you shall burn their <i>asherot</i> with fire," and [the following verse] continues: "Do not do this to God, your Lord."
It is forbidden to burn or to destroy by direct action any sacred texts, their commentaries, and their explanations. A person who destroys them by his direct action is given "stripes for rebelliousness."<br>To what does the above apply? To sacred texts written by a Jew with a sacred intent. However, should a Jewish heretic write a Torah scroll, it and the name of God it contains must be burnt, since he does not believe in the sanctity of [God's] name and did not compose it for this purpose. Rather, he considers this to be similar to any other text. Since this is his intent, the names [of God he writes] do not become holy.<br>It is a mitzvah to burn it so that no remembrance will be left of the heretics or their deeds. In contrast, if a gentile writes [God's] name, it should be buried. Similarly, sacred texts that have become worn out or which were written by gentiles should be buried.
All the names [of God] written in [the passage concerning] Abraham [and the angels] are sacred. Even [the name of God in Genesis 18:3]: "My Lord, if I have found favor in Your eyes," is also sacred. All the names [of God] written in [the passage concerning] Lot are not sacred, except [Genesis 19:18-19]: "And Lot said to them: `Please, do not, O Lord! I have found favor in Your eyes... and You have saved my life.'"<br>All the names [of God] written in [the passage concerning] the hill of Benjamin are sacred. All the names [of God] written in [the passage concerning] Michah are not sacred. All the names [of God] written in [the passage concerning] Navot are sacred.<br>Every mention of the name "Shelomoh" in the Song of Songs is sacred, except [8:12]: "You, Shelomoh, may have the thousand." Every mention of the word "king" in the Book of Daniel is not sacred, except [2:37]: "You are the King, the King of kings." Its status is like other descriptive terms [for God].

Chapter 7

It is [one] of the foundations of [our] faith that God conveys prophecy to man.<br>Prophecy is bestowed only upon a very wise sage of a strong character, who is never overcome by his natural inclinations in any regard. Instead, with his mind, he overcomes his natural inclinations at all times. He must [also] possess a very broad and accurate mental capacity.<br>A person who is full of all these qualities and is physically sound [is fit for prophecy]. When he enters the <i>Pardes</i> and is drawn into these great and sublime concepts, if he possesses an accurate mental capacity to comprehend and grasp [them], he will become holy. He will advance and separate himself from the masses who proceed in the darkness of the time. He must continue and diligently train himself not to have any thoughts whatsoever about fruitless things or the vanities and intrigues of the times.<br>Instead, his mind should constantly be directed upward, bound beneath [God's] throne [of Glory, striving] to comprehend the holy and pure forms and gazing at the wisdom of the Holy One, blessed be He, in its entirety, [in its manifold manifestations] from the most elevated [spiritual] form until the navel of the earth, appreciating His greatness from them. [After these preparations,] the divine spirit will immediately rest upon him.<br>When the spirit rests upon him, his soul becomes intermingled with the angels called <i>ishim,</i> and he will be transformed into a different person and will understand with a knowledge different from what it was previously. He will rise above the level of other wise men, as [the prophet, Samuel] told Saul [I Samuel 10:6]: "[The spirit of God will descend upon you] and you shall prophesy with them. And you will be transformed into a different person."
There are a number of levels among the prophets. Just as with regard to wisdom, one sage is greater than his colleague, so, too, with regard to prophecy, one prophet is greater than another. They all, [however, share certain commonalities]. They receive prophetic visions only in a visionary dream or during the day after slumber has overtaken them, as [Numbers 12:6] states: "I make Myself known to him in a vision. I speak to him in a dream."<br>When any of them prophesy, their limbs tremble, their physical powers become weak, they lose control of their senses, and thus, their minds are free to comprehend what they see, as [Genesis 15:12] states concerning Abraham: "and a great, dark dread fell over him." Similarly, Daniel [10:8] states: "My appearance was horribly changed and I retained no strength."
When a prophet is informed of a message in a vision, it is granted to him in metaphoric imagery. Immediately, the interpretation of the imagery is imprinted upon his heart, and he knows its meaning.<br>For example, the ladder with the angels ascending and descending envisioned by the patriarch, Jacob, was an allegory for the empires and their subjugation [of his descendants]. Similarly, the creatures Ezekiel saw, the boiling pot and the rod from an almond tree envisioned by Jeremiah, the scroll Ezekiel saw, and the measure seen by Zechariah [were all metaphoric images]. This is also true with regard to the other prophets.<br>Some would relate the allegory and its explanation as these did. Others would relate only the explanation. At times, they would relate only the imagery without explaining it, as can be seen in some of the prophecies of Ezekiel and Zechariah.<br>All of the prophecies come in the form of metaphoric imagery and allegories.
All the prophets do not prophesy whenever they desire. Instead, they must concentrate their attention [upon spiritual concepts] and seclude themselves, [waiting] in a happy, joyous mood, because prophecy cannot rest upon a person when he is sad or languid, but only when he is happy.<br>Therefore, the prophets' disciples would always have a harp, drum, flute, and lyre [before them when] they were seeking prophecy. This is what is meant by the expression [I Samuel 10:5]: "They were prophesying" - i.e., following the path of prophecy until they would actually prophesy - as one might say, "So and so aspires to greatness."
Those who aspire to prophecy are called "the disciples of the prophets." Even though they concentrate their attention, it is possible that the Divine Presence will rest upon them, and it is possible that it will not rest upon them.
All the statements made above describe the path of prophecy of all the early and later prophets, with the exception of Moses, our teacher, the master of all prophets.<br>What is the difference between Moses' prophecy and that of all the other prophets? [Divine insight is bestowed upon] all the [other] prophets in a dream or vision. Moses, our teacher, would prophesy while standing awake, as [Numbers 7:89] states: "When Moses came into the Tent of Meeting to speak to Him, he heard the Voice speaking to him."<br>[Divine insight is bestowed upon] all the [other] prophets through the medium of an angel. Therefore, they perceive only metaphoric imagery and allegories. Moses, our teacher, [would prophesy] without the medium of an angel, as [Numbers 12:8] states: "Mouth to mouth I speak to him," and [Numbers 12:8] states: "He gazes upon the image of God" - i.e., there was no metaphor. Rather, he would perceive the matter in its fullness, without metaphor or allegory. The Torah testifies concerning him [Numbers 12:8]: ["I speak to him...] manifestly, without allegory." His appreciation of prophecy would not be through metaphor, but through open revelation, appreciating the matter in its fullness. All the [other] prophets are overawed, terrified, and confounded [by the revelations they experience], but Moses, our teacher, would not [respond in this manner], as [Exodus 33:11] relates: "[God spoke to Moses...] as a man speaks to a friend" - i.e., just as a person will not be awe-struck from hearing his friend's words, so, too, Moses' mental power was sufficient to comprehend the words of prophecy while he was standing in a composed state.<br>All the [other] prophets cannot prophesy whenever they desire. Moses, our teacher, was different. Whenever he desired, the holy spirit would envelop him, and prophecy would rest upon him. He did not have to concentrate his attention to prepare himself [for prophecy], because his [mind] was always concentrated, prepared, and ready [to appreciate spiritual truth] as the angels [are]. Therefore, he would prophesy at all times, as [Numbers 9:8] states: "Stand and hear what God will command you."<br>He was promised this by God, as [implied by Deuteronomy 5:27-28]: "Go and tell them: `Return to your tents,' but you stand here together with Me." This should be interpreted to mean: When prophecy departs from all the [other] prophets, they return to their "tents" - i.e., the needs of the body like other people. Therefore, they do not separate themselves from their wives. Moses, our teacher, never returned to his original "tent." Therefore, he separated himself from women and everything of that nature forever. He bound his mind to the Eternal Rock. [Accordingly,] the glory never left him forever. The flesh of his countenance shone, [for] he became holy like the angels.
There is the possibility that a prophet will experience prophecy for his own sake alone - i.e., to expand his mental capacities and to increase his knowledge - [allowing him] to know more about the lofty concepts than he knew before.<br>It is also possible that he will be sent to one of the nations of the world, or to the inhabitants of a particular city or kingdom, to prepare them and to inform them what they should do or to prevent them [from continuing] the evil which they are doing.<br>When he is sent [on such a mission], he is given a sign or a wonder [to perform], so that the people will know that God has truly sent him.<br>Not everyone who performs signs or wonders should be accepted as a prophet: only a person who is known to be fit for prophecy beforehand; i.e., his wisdom and his [good] deeds surpass those of all his contemporaries. If he follows the paths of prophecy in holiness, separating himself from worldly matters, and afterwards performs a sign or wonder and states that he was sent by God, it is a mitzvah to listen to him, as [Deuteronomy 18:15] states: "Listen to him."<br>It is possible that a person will perform a sign or wonder even though he is not a prophet - rather, the wonder will have [another cause] behind it. It is, nevertheless, a mitzvah to listen to him. Since he is a wise man of stature and fit for prophecy, we accept [his prophecy as true], for so have we been commanded.<br>[To give an example of a parallel:] We are commanded to render a [legal] judgment based on the testimony of two witnesses. Even though they may testify falsely, since we know them to be acceptable [as witnesses], we presume that they [are telling the truth].<br>Considering these matters and the like, [Deuteronomy 29:28] states: "The hidden matters are for God, our Lord, but what is revealed is for us and our children," and [I Samuel 16:7] states: "Man sees what is revealed to the eyes, but God sees into the heart."

Chapter 8

The Jews did not believe in Moses, our teacher, because of the wonders that he performed. Whenever anyone's belief is based on wonders, [the commitment of] his heart has shortcomings, because it is possible to perform a wonder through magic or sorcery.<br>All the wonders performed by Moses in the desert were not intended to serve as proof [of the legitimacy] of his prophecy, but rather were performed for a purpose. It was necessary to drown the Egyptians, so he split the sea and sank them in it. We needed food, so he provided us with manna. We were thirsty, so he split the rock [providing us with water]. Korach's band mutinied against him, so the earth swallowed them up. The same applies to the other wonders.<br>What is the source of our belief in him? The [revelation] at Mount Sinai. Our eyes saw, and not a stranger's. Our ears heard, and not another's. There was fire, thunder, and lightning. He entered the thick clouds; the Voice spoke to him and we heard, "Moses, Moses, go tell them the following:...."<br>Thus, [Deuteronomy 5:4] relates: "Face to face, God spoke to you," and [Deuteronomy 5:3] states: "God did not make this covenant with our fathers, [but with us, who are all here alive today]."<br>How is it known that the [revelation] at Mount Sinai alone is proof of the truth of Moses' prophecy that leaves no shortcoming? [Exodus 19:9] states: "Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people will hear Me speaking to you, [so that] they will believe in you forever." It appears that before this happened, they did not believe in him with a faith that would last forever, but rather with a faith that allowed for suspicions and doubts.
Thus, those to whom [Moses] was sent witnessed [his appointment] as a prophet, and it was not necessary to perform another wonder for them. He and they were witnesses, like two witnesses who observed the same event together. Each one serves as a witness to his colleague that he is telling the truth, and neither has to bring any other proof to his collegue.<br>Similarly, all Israel were witnesses to [the appointment of] Moses, our teacher, at the [revelation] at Mount Sinai, and it was unnecessary for him to perform any further wonders for them.<br>This concept [is alluded to in the interchange between God and Moses at the revelation of the burning bush]. At the beginning of his prophecy, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him the signs [and wonders] to perform in Egypt and told him [Exodus 3:18], "And they will listen to your voice."<br>Moses, our teacher, knew that one who believes [in another person] because of signs has apprehension in his heart; he has doubts and suspicions. Therefore, he sought to be released from the mission, saying: "They will not believe me" [Exodus 4:1], until the Holy One, blessed be He, informed him that these wonders [were intended only as a temporary measure,] until they left Egypt. After they would leave, they would stand on this mountain and all doubts which they had about him would be removed.<br>[God told him:] Here, I will give you a sign so that they will know that I truly sent you from the outset, and thus, no doubts will remain in their hearts. This is what is meant by [Exodus 3:12]: "This will be your sign that I sent you: When you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve God on this mountain."<br>Thus, we do not believe in any prophet who arises after Moses, our teacher, because of the wonder [he performs] alone, as if to say: If he performs a wonder we will listen to everything he says. Rather, [we believe him] because it is a mitzvah which we were commanded by Moses who said: If he performs a wonder, listen to him.<br>Just as we are commanded to render a [legal] judgment based on the testimony of two witnesses, even though we do not know if they are testifying truthfully or falsely, similarly, it is a mitzvah to listen to this prophet even though we do not know whether the wonder is true or performed by magic or sorcery.
Therefore, if a prophet arises and attempts to dispute Moses' prophecy by performing great signs and wonders, we should not listen to him. We know with certainty that he performed those signs through magic or sorcery. [This conclusion is reached] because the prophecy of Moses, our teacher, is not dependent on wonders, so that we could compare these wonders, one against the other. Rather we saw and heard with our own eyes and ears as he did.<br>To what can this be compared? To witnesses who gave testimony concerning a matter to a man who had observed the situation with his own eyes. He will never listen to them and will know for certain that they are false witnesses.<br>Therefore, the Torah states (Deuteronomy 13:3-4) that "[Even] if [such] a sign or wonder will come, you should not listen to the words of that prophet." He comes to you with signs and wonders to deny what you saw with your own eyes. We believe in a wonder [as evidence of a prophet's reliability] only because of the mitzvah which Moses commanded us. Therefore, how can a wonder [cause us to] accept this [person] who comes to deny the prophecy of Moses which we saw and heard?

Chapter 9

It is clear and explicit in the Torah that it is [God's] commandment, remaining forever without change, addition, or diminishment, as [Deuteronomy 13:1] states: "All these matters which I command to you, you shall be careful to perform. You may not add to it or diminish from it," and [Deuteronomy 29:28] states: "What is revealed is for us and our children forever, to carry out all the words of this Torah." This teaches that we are commanded to fulfill all the Torah's directives forever.<br>It is also said: "It is an everlasting statute for all your generations," and [Deuteronomy 30:12] states: "It is not in the heavens." This teaches that a prophet can no longer add a new precept [to the Torah].<br>Therefore, if a person will arise, whether Jew or gentile, and perform a sign or wonder and say that God sent him to:<br>a) add a mitzvah,<br>b) withdraw a mitzvah<br>c) explain a mitzvah in a manner which differs from the tradition received from Moses, or<br>d) if he says that the mitzvot commanded to the Jews are not forever, but rather were given for a limited time,<br>he is a false prophet. He comes to deny the prophecy of Moses and should be executed by strangulation, because he dared to make statements in God's name which God never made.<br>God, blessed be His name, commanded Moses that this commandment is for us and our children forever, and, God is not man that He speak falsely.
If so, what is meant by the Torah's statement [Deuteronomy 18:18]: "I will appoint a prophet from among their brethren like you, and I<br>will place My words in his mouth and he will speak..."? He is not coming to establish a [new] faith, but rather to command the people [to fulfill] the precepts of the Torah and to warn against its transgression, as evidenced by the final prophet [Malachi], who proclaimed [Malachi 3:22], "Remember the Torah of Moses, My servant."<br>Also, a prophet may command us to do something which [is neither permitted nor forbidden by Torah law] - for example, "Go to such and such a place," "Do not go there," "Wage war today," or "Do not do so," "Build a wall," or "Do not build it."<br>[In these instances,] it is a mitzvah to listen to him. Anyone who violates his directives is liable for death at the hand of God, as [Deuteronomy 18:19] states: "And a person who will not heed My words which he speaks in My name, I will seek [retribution] from him."
Similarly, a prophet who violated his own prophetic instructions, and one who refrains from prophesying, are liable for death at the hand of God, since concerning the three of them, it is said, "I will seek [retribution] from him."<br>When a prophet - who has already proven himself to be a prophet - instructs us to violate one of the mitzvot of the Torah or many mitzvot, whether they be of a severe or light nature, for a limited amount of time, it is a mitzvah to listen to him.<br>The Sages of the early generation taught as part of the oral tradition: If a prophet tells you to violate the precepts of the Torah as Elijah did on Mount Carmel, listen to him with regard to all things except the worship of false gods. This applies when his command is temporary in nature.<br>For example, on Mount Carmel, Elijah offered a sacrifice outside [the Temple's premises], even though Jerusalem was chosen for such [service], and one who offers a sacrifice outside [the Temple's premises] is liable for <i>karet.</i> Since he was [already established as] a prophet, it was a mitzvah to listen to him. The commandment, "Listen to him," applies in these circumstances as well.<br>If they would have asked Elijah: How can we violate the Torah's command [Deuteronomy 12:13]: "[Be careful...] lest you offer your burnt offerings everywhere"?, he would have told them: We should not say anything, but anyone who offers a sacrifice outside [the Temple premises] is liable for <i>karet,</i> as Moses said. [The present instance,] however, [is an exception]. I am offering a sacrifice today outside [the Temple] at God's command in order to disprove the prophets of Ba'al.<br>Similarly, if any [other] prophet commands us to transgress for a limited time, it is a mitzvah to listen to him. If, however, he says that the mitzvah has been nullified forever, he is liable for execution by strangulation, for the Torah has told us: "[It is] for us and our children forever."
Similarly, if [a "prophet"] nullifies a concept which was transmitted by the oral tradition, or states with regard to one of the Torah's laws that God commanded him to render such and such a judgment, or that such and such is the law regarding a particular instance and the decision follows a certain opinion, he is a false prophet and should be [executed by] strangulation. [This applies] even if he performs a wonder, for he is coming to deny the Torah, which states: "It is not in the heavens."<br>If, however, [he states that] for a limited time [we should follow a particular course of behavior], he should be listened to with regard to all things.
When does the above apply? With regard to all other mitzvot. Regarding the worship of false gods, however, he should not be heeded, even for a limited time. Even if he performs great wonders and miracles and says that God commanded him to worship false gods only on this day or only during this hour, he is considered to have "spoken perversely against God."<br>Concerning this, the Torah has commanded [us, Deuteronomy 13:3-6]: "If a sign or miracle is performed... [and he tells you, `Let us serve other gods...'] Do not listen to the words of this prophet... for he has spoken perversely against God, your Lord." He is coming to deny the prophecy of Moses. Therefore, we may definitely conclude that he is a false prophet, and everything that he did was performed through sorcery and magic. [Hence,] he should be [executed by] strangulation.

Chapter 10

Any prophet who arises and tells us that God has sent him does not have to [prove himself by] performing wonders like those performed by Moses, our teacher, or like the wonders of Elijah or Elisha, which altered the natural order.<br>Rather, the sign of [the truth of his prophecy] will be the fulfillment of his prediction of future events, as [implied by Deuteronomy 18:21]: "How shall we recognize that a prophecy was not spoken by God?..."<br>Therefore, if a person whose [progress] in the service of God makes him worthy of prophecy arises [and claims to be a prophet] - if he does not intend to add [to] or diminish [the Torah], but rather to serve God through the mitzvot of the Torah - we do not tell him: "Split the sea for us, revive the dead, or the like, and then we will believe in you." Instead, we tell him, "If you are a prophet, tell us what will happen in the future." He makes his statements, and we wait to see whether [his "prophecy"] comes to fruition or not.<br>Should even a minute particular of his "prophecy" not materialize, he is surely a false prophet. If his entire prophecy materializes, we should consider him a true [prophet].
We should test him many times. If all of his statements prove true, he should be considered to be a true prophet, as [I Samuel 3:20] states concerning Samuel, "And all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, knew that Samuel had been proven to be a prophet unto God."
Behold, the diviners and sorcerers also predict the future. What differentiates between them and a prophet?<br>[Though] some of the prophecies made by diviners, sorcerers, and the like materialize, some do not [as implied by Isaiah 47:13]: "Let the stargazers, the astrologers, and the diviners of what will happen in the months, come and save you from what will come upon you." [Our Sages note that the verse states] "from what" rather than "from all that."<br>Also, it is possible that none of their predictions will come true and they will err completely, as [Isaiah 44:25] states: "He frustrates the omens of imposters and drives diviners mad."<br>In contrast, all the words of a prophet come true, as [II Kings 10:10] states: "God's word will not fall to the ground." Similarly, [Jeremiah 23:28] states: "'The prophet who has a dream may relate his dream, but he who [receives] My word shall speak words of truth. What is the chaff to the grain?' declares God." This implies that the words of sorcerers and dreamers are like chaff that has been mixed with some grain, while the word of God is like grain without any chaff at all.<br>Concerning this, the Torah promises that a prophet will relate the truth about those matters for which the soothsayers and diviners give false predictions to the gentiles, so that [the Jews] will not need a sorcerer, a diviner, or the like, as [Deuteronomy 18:10, 14-15] states: "Among you, there shall not be found anyone who passes his son through fire, [a sorcerer, a diviner...] For these nations... [listen to diviners and sorcerers, God has not given you this lot. God will] set up a prophet from your midst."<br>We see from this that a prophet will arise for the sole purpose of telling us the future events which will transpire in the world, whether there will be plenty or famine, war or peace, and the like. He even will inform a particular individual regarding his needs. Hence, when Saul lost an object, he went to the prophet to discover where it was. These are the types of things that a prophet will say. He will not come to found a new faith or add or withdraw a mitzvah.
[The above principles do not apply to] prophecies of retribution which a prophet will utter - e.g., "So and so will die," "This or that year will be a year of famine or a year of war," and the like. If his words do not come true, this does not nullify the validity of his prophecy, nor do we say [in condemnation of him]: "Behold, he spoke and his words were not fulfilled."<br>[This is because] the Holy One, Blessed be He, is slow to anger, abundant in kindness, and forgiving of evil. Thus, it is possible that they will repent and [their sin] will be forgiven, as in the case of the people of Nineveh, or that [retribution] will be held in abeyance, as in the case of Hezekiah.<br>[This does not apply regarding prophecies for the good.] If [a prophet] promised that good would come and such and such will occur, and the good about which he prophesied did not materialize, he is surely a false prophet. Any good which God decrees - even if [the decree] is provisional - will never be nullified. {We find [God] nullifying a positive prophecy only during the destruction of the first Temple. He had promised the righteous that they would not die together with the wicked; however, He nullified this prophecy, as explained in the tractate of Shabbat.}<br>We can conclude from this that a prophet should be tested on the basis of his positive prophecies. This was what Jeremiah meant by his reply to Chananiah ben Azur, when he was prophesying doom and Chananiah was promising a [glorious future]. He told Chananiah: "If my words are not fulfilled, this will not lead to the conclusion that I am a false prophet. If your promises are not fulfilled, however, it will be proven that you are a false prophet," as implied by [Jeremiah 28:7,9]: "Hear, now, this word... As for the prophet who prophesies for peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, it will be known that God has truly sent this prophet."
When a prophet proclaims that another individual is [also] a prophet, we accept the latter as a prophet without requiring [any further] investigation. Thus, after Moses, our teacher, proclaimed that Joshua [was a prophet], all the Jews believed in him before he performed any wonders. The same holds true for subsequent generations.<br>Once a prophet has made known his prophecy, and his words have proven true time after time, or another prophet has proclaimed him a prophet, if he continues in the path of prophecy, it is forbidden to doubt him or to question the truth of his prophecy.<br>[When establishing the authenticity of a prophet,] it is forbidden to test him more than necessary. We may not continue to test him forever, as [Deuteronomy 6:16] states: "Do not test God, your Lord, as you tested him in Massah," when [the Jews] said [Exodus 17:7]: "Is God in our midst or not?" Rather, once an individual is established as a prophet, we should believe in him and know that God is in our midst. We should not doubt or question him, as implied by [Ezekiel 2:5]: "They shall know that a prophet was in their midst."
