Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah



Chapter 1

The foundation of foundations, and the prop of wisdom, is to know that there exists a first Being, and that He called all other beings into existence, and that all things existing from heaven to earth, and whatever is between them, exist only through the essentiality of His existence. 
So that if we were to suppose that He did not exist, no-other thing could exist. 
Again were we to suppose that all other things existing, beside Himself, did not exist, He Himself would still exist, and would not cease because of their non-existence; since all things existing stand in need of Him, but He, blessed be He! does not stand in need of them, not even of any one of them. His essentiality therefore is not like the truth of any one of them. 
Thus the prophet says: <i>But the Eternal is the</i> TRUE <i>God</i>. (Jer. 10. 10), indicating that He alone is essential truth, and that there belongs to no other being a truth like His truth. The same is also expressed in the law: <i>There is none else</i>, (Deut. 4. 39), that is to say, there is not a being, beside Himself, who as to essentiality, is like Him. 
 This Being is the God of the Universe, the Sovereign of the whole earth; and it is He who guides the orb with a power, to which there is neither end or limit—with a power, of which there is no interruption; for the orb revolves continually, and it is impossible that it should revolve without some one causing it to revolve; and it is He, blessed be He! who causes it to revolve, without a hand and without a body, (<i>i.e.</i>, without physical effort). 
Now the recognition of this matter is an affirmative commandment, for it is said: <i>I am the Lord thy God</i>, (Exod. 20. 2); and every one who entertains the opinion that there is another God besides this, transgresses a negative commandment, for it is said: <i>Thou shalt have no other Gods before me</i>, (Exod. 20. 3); and he at the same time denies the radical religious principle, for this is the great religious principle upon which everything depends. 
This God is one—not two, nor more than two, but absolutely one—whose unity is not like the unity of any one of the individuals existing in the universe—not one as a kind, for this would include many individuals; nor one as a body, for this would be divisible into parts and portions ; but a unity like unto which, there is no other existing in the universe. Were there many Deities they would needs be bodies and frames, since things, that can be numbered, which are equal in their essence, are distinguishable one from another only by the accidental qualities which belong to bodies or frames; now were the Creator a body or frame, He would have an end and a limit; for it is impossible that there should be a body which has not an end; and of every thing that has an end and a limit, its power must likewise have an end and a limit. But as to our God, blessed be His name! since His power has no end, and is never interrupted (for behold! the orb revolves continually) ; His power is not the power of a body; and since He is not a body, He is not subject to any events incident to body, so that He could be separated and divided from another. Therefore it is not possible that He should be other than One; and the recognition of this matter is a positive commandment, for it is said: <i>The Lord our God is</i> ONE <i>God</i>, (Deut. 6. 4). 
Behold! it is plainly stated in the law and in the Prophets that the Holy One, blessed be He! is not a body or frame; for it is said:<i> That the Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath</i>, (Deut. 4. 39); but a body cannot be in two places [at the same time]. Again it is said: <i>For ye saw no manner of similitude, </i>(Deut. 4. 15) ; and it is also said: <i>To whom then will ye compare me, that I should be like Him? </i>(Isa. 40. 25), now if He were a body, He might be comparable to other bodies. 
But how is this reconcilable with the Scriptural passages? what means this which is written in the law: <i>And there was under His</i> FEET, (Exod. 24. 10) ; <i>Written with the</i> FINGER<i> of God</i>, (Exod. 31. 18) ; <i>The</i> HAND<i> of the Lord, </i>(Exod. 9. 3); <i>The</i> EYES<i> of the Lord, </i>(Deut. 11. 12); <i>The</i> EARS <i>of the Lord</i>, (Num. 11. 18) ; and other expressions like these? The answer is: all these terms are used with reference to the intellectual capacity of the sons of men, who can comprehend only corporeal beings; the law therefore speaks in human language, and all these are merely epithets, just as we read :<i> If I whet my glittering sword, </i>(Deut. 32. 41); for has He then a sword? or does He slay with a sword? certainly not, this is only a parable; and thus all is parabolical. As a proof of this we may adduce the words of one prophet, who said, that he saw the Holy One, blessed be He! <i>whose garment was as white as snow</i>, (Dan. 7. 9) ; whilst another saw Him with red garments, (Isa. 63. 1). Moses our Teacher himself saw Him upon the sea, like a warrior making war in battle, and upon Sinai, like the messenger of a congregation wrapped in prayer; showing that He had neither similitude nor form, but that all this was only in an appearance of Prophecy, and in a vision. But the essentiality of the object the human intellect cannot comprehend, nor attain unto, nor search out; and this is what the Scripture says: <i>Canst thou dive into the foundation of God? or canst thou find out the intent or aim of the Almighty?</i> (Job 11. 7). 
What then was that which Moses our Teacher sought to attain when he said: <i> I beseech Thee, shew me Thy glory</i>, (Exod. 33. 18)? He sought to know the essentiality of the existence of the Holy One, blessed be He! to that degree that it should be known to his mind in the same way as he would know any person, whose countenance he had seen, and whose form was engraven upon his memory—so that that man is distinguished in his mind from other men;—in the same way Moses our Teacher sought to have the essence of the Holy One, blessed be He! distinguished in his mind from the essences of other beings; so that he might know the essentiality of His existence just as it is. But the Holy One, blessed be He! returned answer to him, that it was not in the power of the intellect of living man, composed of body and soul, distinctly to attain unto the truth of this matter. Yet the Holy One, blessed be He! made known unto him that which no man before him ever knew, and no man after him ever will know; so that he arrived at so much of the truth of His existence as to have the Holy One, blessed be He! distinguished in his mind from other beings, just as any one whose back he had seen, and whose form and dress he was acquainted with, would be distinguished in his mind from the forms of other men; and it is to this that the scripture alludes, in saying:<i> And thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shall not be seen, </i>(Exod. 33. 23). 
 And now since it has been demonstrated that He is not a body or a frame, it is clear that none of the accidental qualities, belonging to bodies, can be ascribed to Him; neither joining nor separation; neither place nor measure; neither ascent nor descent; neither right nor left; neither before nor behind; neither sitting not standing; neither is He limited by time, so that He should have a beginning or an end, or a precise number of years, nor is He liable to change, since in Him there is nothing, which can cause a change in Him. Again, with Him there is neither death nor life, like the life of a living body; neither folly nor wisdom, like the wisdom of a wise man; neither sleep nor waking; neither anger nor laughter; neither joy nor sorrow; neither silence nor speech, like the speech of the sons of men; and thus the sages say: “Above there is neither sitting nor standing, neither retrogression nor progression.” 
 Now since this is the fact, all these and similar expressions, which are made use of in the law and in the words of the prophets, are altogether figurative and rhetorical. Thus it is said: <i>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh</i>, (Ps. 2. 4); <i>They have provoked me to anger with their vanities, </i>(Deut. 32. 21) ; <i>As the Lord rejoiced</i>, (Deut. 28. 63); and other expressions like these. With regard to all these, the sages say: “The law spoke according to the language of the sons of men.” And thus it is said: Do they provoke me to anger, (Jer. 7. 19). Behold! it is said: <i>I am the Lord, I change not</i>, (Mal. 3. 6). If He were sometimes angry, and sometimes joyful, He would suffer change; now these things are found only in bodies obscure and low—in those who dwell in houses of clay, the foundation of which is in the dust; but as to Him, blessed be He! He is blessed and is exalted above all this.

Chapter 2

With regard to this glorious and awful God—we are commanded to love Him, and to fear Him, for it is said: <i>and thou shalt</i> LOVE <i>the Lord thy God</i>, (Deut. 6. 5), and it is also said: <i>Thou shalt </i>FEAR <i>the Lord thy God</i>, (Deut. 6. 13). 
But which is the way leading to love and fear Him?—At the time when one contemplates His works and His wonderful and stupendous creations, and perceives from them His wisdom, which is incomparable and unbounded, immediately he loves, praises, and glorifies, and longs with great eagerness to know that great God, just as David said: <i>My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God, </i>(Ps. 42. 2). Also when one reflects upon these very things, immediately he starts back, and is afraid, and feels terror, and is conscious that he is a creature, small, insignificant, and dark, standing with only a slight and scanty knowledge, before Him who is perfect in knowledge, as David said: <i>When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers</i>, (Ps. 8. 3); <i>What is man that Thou art mindful of him? </i>(Ps. 8. 4). Now, with reference to these things, I am about to explain some great principles, taught by the work of the Lord of the Universe, in order that they may be an opening to the intelligent man to love God, consonant with the words of the sages regarding love: “That thereby thou mayest know Him who spake [the word], and the Universe existed.”
All the things which the Holy One, blessed be He! has created in His Universe, are divisible into three classes. Some are creatures composed of matter and form; and which are perpetually coming into existence, and perishing. Such are the bodies of men, of beasts, of plants, and of minerals. Some again are creatures composed of matter and form, yet they do not change from body to body, and from form to form like the former; but their form is fixed in their matter for ever, so that they are not liable to change like the others. Such are the orbs and the stars which are in them. Moreover their matter is not like the matter of other things, nor their form like other forms. Again there are creatures possessing form, but no matter at all. Such are the Angels, for the Angels are not bodies or frames, but forms distinguished one from another.
What then is the sense of the Prophets saying: That they saw an angel of fire, and having wings? All this is conceived, in prophetic vision, and by way of allegory, in order to express that he (the angel) is not a body, nor possessing heaviness, as heavy bodies, as it is said: <i>For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire</i>, (Deut. 4. 24), now since he is not a fire, the expression must be taken figuratively, as it is said: <i>He maketh the winds His angels</i>, (Ps. 104. 4).
By what then are these forms distinguished one from another, seeing that they are not bodies? It is because they are not equal in their essence, but one stands a degree lower than his fellow in succession, so that each exists through the power of the one immediately above him; but all of them exists through the power and the goodness of the Holy One, blessed be He! And this it is to which Solomon in his wisdom alludes, when he says: <i>For He that is higher than the highest regardeth.</i>(Eccles. 5. 7).
When we say: <i>Beneath the degree of his fellow</i>, we do not mean the degree of place, as would be said of a man who sits higher than his fellow, but as it would be said of two wise men of whom one is greater than the other in wisdom, that the former is above the degree of the latter; or as it would be said, with respect to the cause, that it is above the effect.
There is a variety in the names of the angels depending upon their degrees; and thence they are called <i>Haiioth Hakkodesh</i> (the holy living creatures), which are the highest of all; <i>Ophanim</i> (the wheels); <i>Erellim</i> (the ambassadors); <i>Hashmallim</i> (those that are of great brightness); <i>Seraphim</i> (those that are of burning fire); <i>Mallachim</i> (the messengers); <i>Elohim</i> (gods, or those that possess great power); <i>Benay-Elohim</i> (the sons of God); <i>Cherubim</i> (those who have the appearance of little children), and <i>Ishim</i> (men). All these ten names by which the Angels are called, are [given] in respect of their ten degrees, and that degree, to which there is no degree superior but the degree of' God, blessed be He! is the degree of that Intelligence called <i>Haiioth.</i> On this account it is said in the Prophecy: “that they are [immediately] under the throne of glory.” Also the tenth degree is the degree of that Intelligence which is called <i>Ishim</i> (men), these being the Angels which spoke with the Prophets, and were seen by them in prophetic vision; therefore they are called <i>Ishim</i> (men), because their degree is next to the degree of the knowledge of the sons of men.
Now all these Intelligences are alive, and can discern the Creator, and they know Him with an exceedingly great knowledge; each Intelligence in proportion to its degree, not in proportion to its size. However, even the first degree cannot arrive at the essence of the Creator such as it really is; because the knowledge even of the first degree being too limited to arrive at and to know that essence; but yet it attains unto and knows more than that which the Intelligence beneath it can attain and know. And thus also every degree, even to the tenth, knows the Creator with a knowledge which the power of the sons of men, who are composed of matter and form, cannot attain unto and know; none how ever know the Creator as perfectly as He knows Himself.
All things existing, beside the Creator, from the first degree of Intelligences to the smallest insect which may be found in the centre of the earth—all these exist by the power of His truth. And because He knows Himself, and can discern His own greatness and His glory and His truth—He knows every thing, and nothing is concealed from Him.
The Holy One, blessed be He perceives His own essentiality, and know it just as it really is. And He does not know with a knowledge distinct from Himself, as we know; because we and our knowledge are not one, but, as to the Creator, may He be blessed! He, His knowledge, and His life are one, in every possible respect, and in every mode of Unity; seeing that if He were living with a life, and knowing with a knowledge distinct from Himself, there would be many Deities, viz. He, His life, and His knowledge. But this is not the fact, but on the contrary, He is one in every possible respect, and in every mode of Unity. Hence you may say: that He is the one who <i>knows</i>, the<i> known</i>, and <i>knowledge itself</i>, all at once. Now this idea the mouth has not the power of expressing, nor the ear of perceiving, nor the human mind of perfectly comprehending; and on this account it is said: <i>By the</i> LIVES<i> of Pharaoh</i>, (Gen. 42. 15), <i>By the</i> LIVES <i>of thy soul</i>, (I Sam. 1. 26, and-in many other places). It is not however said <i>By the </i>LIVES <i>of the Lord</i>, but <i>By the</i> LIFE <i>of the Lord, </i>(Judg. 8. 19, and in- many other places); because the Creator and His life are not two, as are the lives of living bodies, or the lives of Angels. Therefore He does not perceive creatures and know them, by means of the creatures, as we know them; but He knows them, by means of Himself; so that, by dint of His knowing Himself, He knows every thing; because every thing is supported by its existing through Him.
That which we have said on this subject, in these two chapters, is, as a drop of the ocean, in comparison with what ought to be explained under this head. Moreover, the explanation of all the radical principles, contained in these two chapters, is called the <i>work of the Chariot</i>, in reference to the description of the vision of the chariot in the vision of Ezekiel, chap. 1.
The sages of old have directed, that no one shall expound these subjects except to a single person, who also must be wise and intelligent by his own knowledge; and after that, we may only give him the outlines; and convey to him more hints on the subject; and he being intelligent by his own knowledge, may become acquainted with the end and depth of the matter. Now these things are exceedingly profound, and not every intellect is capable of sustaining them, wherefore Solomon in his wisdom says, respecting them, by way of parable: <b>Kebusin Lilbushecha</b>, <i>The Lambs [are] for thy clothing</i>, (Prov. 27. 26). So the sages say as an explanation to this parable :<i> the things which are the</i> MYSTERY <i>of the Universe, let them be <b>Lilbushecha</b> as a garment to thee;</i> meaning, [let them be kept] to thyself alone, and do not discuss them before many people. Thus also he (Solomon) says respecting them: <i>Let them be only thine own, and not strangers with thee</i>, (Prov. 5. 17). Again with respect to them he says: <i>Honey and milk [are] under thy tongue</i>, (Song of Songs, 4. 11); which the sages of old explain in this manner: <i>The things which are like honey and milk ought to be under thy tongue.</i>

Chapter 3

As to the Orbs, these are called <b>Shamayim</b> <i>Heaven</i>, <b>Rakiah</b> <i>the Expansion</i>, <b>Zebul</b><i> the Habitation</i>, and <b>Araboth</b><i> the Darkness (of the Ether).</i> Now these consist of nine Orbs; the orb that is nearest to us is the orb of the Moon; the second orb, immediately above, is the orb in which is the planet called <b>Cohab</b> <i> Mercury;</i> the third orb [immediately] above this, is the one, in which is <b>Nogah</b> <i> Venus;</i> the fourth orb, is that, in which is <b>Chamah</b> <i> the Sun;</i> the fifth is that, in which is <b>Maadim</b> <i> Mars;</i> the sixth orb is that, in which is the planet <b>Zedek</b> <i>Jupiter</i>, the seventh orb, is that, in which is <b>Sabathi</b> <i> Saturn;</i> the eighth orb, is that, in which are all the other stars that are seen in the firmament; and the ninth is the orb which revolves daily from the East to the West, and which also encompasses and surrounds the whole. The reason why, you see all the stars as if they were all of them in the same orb, though some among them are one above the other is, because the orbs are pure and transparent, like crystal and sapphire; therefore, the stars which are in the eighth orb are seen beneath the first orb.
Every one of the eight orbs, in which are the planets, contains many more orbs, one above the other, like the skins of onions: some of them are orbs which revolve from the West to the East, and some of them, which revolve from the East to the West, as is the ninth orb, which revolves from the East to the West. Moreover none of them have any empty space between them.
All these orbs are neither light nor heavy; neither have they a red colour, nor a black colour, nor any other colour. But that we see in them a colour like that of blue, is a mere optical illusion, arising from the height of the atmosphere; moreover they have neither flavour nor odour, these being properties belonging to those bodies only which are beneath them.
All these orbs, which encompass the world, are circular, like a globe, and the Earth is suspended in the midst of them; but some of the planets have again smaller orbs, which are fixed in them, and which do not encompass the earth, each of them being a smaller and not encompassing orb, fixed in a greater and encompassing orb.
The orbs, which encompass the world, are eighteen and the smaller orbs, which do not encompass, are eight in number; and it is by the course of the stars, by knowing the rate of their daily and hourly revolutions, by their declension from the South to the North, or from the North to the South, and by their height, or proximity to the earth, that the number of all these orbs, the form of their paths, and the direction of their revolutions may be known; which is the science of the calculation of the revolutions and of the planets (Astronomy), and on which many books were composed by the sages of Greece.
As to the ninth orb, which encompasses the whole, the sages of old have divided it into twelve parts, and to each part they have given a name, after the name of the figure perceived in it, reflected by the stars which are directly beneath it, and these are the signs of the Zodiac; the names of which are <b>Teleh</b> <i> The Ram</i>, <b>Shor</b> <i> The Bull</i>, <b>Theomim</b> <i>The Twins</i>, <b> Sartan</b> <i>The Crab</i>, <b>Aryah</b> <i> The Lion</i>, <b>Bethulah</b> <i> The Virgin</i>, <b>Moznayim</b> <i> The Scales</i>, <b>Akrab</b> <i>The Scorpion</i>, <b>Kesheth</b> <i> The Archer</i>, <b>Gedi</b> <i> The Kid</i>, <b>Deli</b> <i>The Pail</i>, <b>Dagim</b> <i> The Fishes</i>.
However in the ninth orb itself there is neither division nor any of those figures, nor even any star; and, it is only by joining together the stars which are in the eighth orb, that the large stars contained in the same will represent those figures or something like them. Now these twelve figures coincided with those parts only at the time of the flood, when these names were also given to them; but at this time they are removed a little, for all the stars, that are in the eighth orb revolve just the same as the sun and the moon do, only they revolve slowly; so that the part of a circle through which the sun and the moon move in a day, any one of those stars moves through in about seventy years.
As to the planets which we see, there are some among them which are small planets, such that the earth is greater than any one of them; and again there are among them some great planets, such that any one of them is greater than the earth by many times; now the earth is greater than the moon by about forty times, and the sun is again greater than the earth by about a hundred and seventy times; consequently the moon is about a six thousand and eight hundredth part of the sun; but there is no one among the planets which is greater than the sun, nor is there any planet smaller than <b>Cochab</b> <i> Mercury</i>, which is in the second orb. 
All the planets and orbs are beings possessed of soul, mind and understanding. Moreover they are alive, they exist, and know Him who spake the word and the Universe existed. All of them, in proportion to their magnitude and to their degree, praise and glorify their Creator, just as the Angels do; and in the same way as they know the Holy One, blessed be He! so do they also know themselves; they also know the angels that are above them. Now the knowledge of the planets and of the orbs is less than the knowledge of the angels, yet it is greater than the knowledge of the sons of men.
God has created, beneath the orb of the moon, a matter which is not like the matter of the orbs: and He has also created four qualities, suitable to this matter, which are not like the qualities of the orbs; and every quality is fixed in a part of this matter. The first quality is the quality of fire; this was joined to a part of this matter, and so there resulted from both of them the body of fire. The second quality is the quality of air; this was joined to a part of it, viz. to a part of the matter, and so there resulted from both of them the body of air. The third quality is the quality of water, this was joined to a part of it, and so there resulted from both of them the body of water; and the fourth quality is the quality of earth; this was joined to a part of it, and so there resulted from both of them the body of earth. Consequently there are beneath the firmament four different bodies, one above the other, and every one [of them] encompasses the one which is beneath it, on all its sides, like a wheel. The first body, which is nearest to the orb of the moon, is the body of fire; beneath this is the body of air; again, beneath this is the body of water; and again beneath this is the body of earth; however there is not between them any space void, and altogether, without matter.
Now these four bodies are not beings possessed of soul, on the contrary, they have no understanding and no perception, but are like inanimate bodies; yet every one of them has a tendency which it neither knows nor comprehends, nor has the power of altering; and this is what David says: <i>Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all deeps. Fire and hail, snow and vapours</i>, (Ps. 148. 7, 8); the meaning of these words being this: Praise Him ye sons of men, from His power which ye perceive in the fire, and in the hail, and in the other things created, which are seen beneath the firmament; for the power of these may at all times be perceived both by small and great.

Chapter 4

These four bodies, namely, fire, air, water, and earth, are the elements of all the things created, which are beneath the firmament; so as regards all things existing, whether they be man or beast, fowl, creeping thing, fish, planet, mineral, precious stones, pearls, or other stones—namely such as are used for building—mountains, or lumps of clay, their matter is composed of these four elements. Hence all the bodies which are beneath the firmament, (these four elements excepted) are composed of matter, and form; and their matter is again composed of these four elements; but every one of these four elements is composed of nothing but matter and form alone.
The nature of fire and of air is that their movement is from beneath, namely from the centre of the earth upwards, towards the firmament; and the nature of water and of earth is again inclined to move from beneath the firmament downwards as far as the centre; for the centre of the firmament is that lowest point lower than which nothing exists. But now that motion takes place, neither by their consciousness nor their desire; but only by the innate property, and by the nature grafted upon them. Fire is by its nature hot and dry; it also is the lightest of them all. Air is warm and moist. Water is cold and moist. Earth is dry and cold, and is also the heaviest of all of them. Now water being lighter than earth, is found above the earth. Again, air being lighter than water, floats on the surface of the water. But fire is even lighter than air. And because these are the elements of all bodies beneath the firmament, every body, whether it be that of man, or cattle, beast, fowl, fish, plant, mineral or stone, will be found to have its matter composed of fire, air, water and earth. But all these four mixed together, and on their being mixed together, every one of them becomes altered, in such a manner, that the compound of all the four proves to have no similarity with any one of them when by itself; so that in the mixture not even one single particle is fire by itself, water by itself, earth by itself, or air by itself; but all of them are altered, and become one body. Now in every body composed of these four elements will be found cold, warmth, moisture and dryness all at once. Yet some of them are bodies in which the element of fire is the most predominant, as for instance those which possess animal life; and therefore warmth is the most prominent in them. Again some of them are bodies in which the element of earth is the most predominant, as stones for instance, consequently dryness is the most prominent in them. Again, there are bodies in which the element of water is the most predominant, and therefore, consequently moisture will be perceived most. Also in the same manner will one body be found to be warmer than another warm body; and again, one body to be more dry than another dry body; there will likewise be found bodies in which cold alone is perceptible, and again bodies in which moisture alone is perceptible, and also bodies in which cold and dryness are to be perceived both at once and in an equal degree, or cold and moisture both at once and in an equal degree, or warmth and dryness both at once and in an equal degree, or warmth and moisture both at once and in an equal degree; so that in proportion to the quantity of the element which is found among the ingredients of the mixture, will the effect of that element and its nature be perceived in the body which is compounded.
Now every thing that is composed of these four elements must ultimately be dissolved. Some dissolve after a few days, and some only after many years; yet it is impossible for a thing that has been composed of them not to be again decomposed into them; it is not even possible for gold or ruby not to become decomposed and be reduced again to its elements; but part of it must again become fire, part of it water, part of it air, and part of it earth.
But since every thing, when destroyed, must be decomposed into these elements, why was it said unto man: <i>and unto</i> DUST <i>shalt thou return</i>, (Gen. 3. 19)? It is because the greatest part of his structure consists of dust. Moreover every thing, which is destroyed, is not reduced to the four elements immediately after it is destroyed; but, when destroyed, it first becomes another thing, and that other thing again becomes another; but ultimately things must be reduced to their primitive elements; and consequently all things return to their origin.
These four elements [themselves] change into each other constantly, daily, and hourly; yet part of them only, and not the whole bulk of them; for instance, that part of the earth which is nearest to the water changes, crumbles to pieces and becomes water; likewise that part of the water, which is nearest to the air changes, melts away, and becomes air; and so it is, with the air, namely, that part of it which is nearest to the fire changes, labours, and becomes fire; and also the fire, namely, that part of it which is nearest to the air changes, labours, gets condensed, and becomes air; again the air, namely that part of it which is nearest to the water changes, gets condensed and becomes water; and lastly, also the water, namely that part of it which is nearest to the earth changes, gets condensed, and becomes earth. But this change takes place by degrees, and, in process of time. But it is not the whole of the element which is changed, so that the whole of the water should ever become air, or the whole of the air fire, for it is impossible that one of the four elements should be lost; but part only of the fire becomes air, and part of the air becomes fire. And so it is with every one of them mutually, namely that a mutual change is found to take place between all four of them, and that they return again to their origin.
Now this change arises from the revolution of the orb, and it is by this revolution also that the four elements join each other, and that there result from them all other substances (bodies); as men, living creatures, plants, stones, and minerals; and it is God who imparts to every substance the form which is suitable to it, by means of the angels of the tenth degree, namely, by those Intelligences which are called <i>Ishim</i> (men).
You can never see matter without form, nor form without matter, and it is only the understanding of man which abstractedly parts the existing body, and perceives that it is composed of matter and form; and also perceives that there are bodies, the matter of which is composed of four elements, and that again there embodies, the matter of which is simple, and consists only of one matter. And as to those Intelligences which have no matter at all—these cannot be perceived by the eye, but are perceived only by the mind’s eye, in the same manner as we know the Lord of All; though not by the sight of the eye.
The soul of all flesh is the quality thereof, given to it by God; moreover the superior knowledge, which is found in the soul of man is the quality of man, who is perfect in his knowledge; and it is with regard to this quality that it is said in the law: <i>Let us make man in</i> OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS, (Gen. i. 26), meaning; that he (man) should be possessed of that quality which is able to know and to comprehend those Intelligences that have no matter like angels; who have a form without matter, and thus be similar to them. This however does not apply to that form which may be perceived by the eye, as for instance, the mouth, the nose, the cheek bones, or the other features of the body, for this is expressed by <b>Toar</b> SHAPE; nor does it refer to the life which is found in every creature possessing animal life, by which it eats, drinks, propogates, feels and reflects; but it refers to that knowledge only which constitutes the quality of the soul, and it is of the QUALITY OF THE SOUL that Scripture says “IN OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS.” Now this quality is very often called <b>Nephesh</b> SOUL, and also <b>Ruach</b> SPIRIT; men therefore ought to be very careful with regard to these expressions, so as not to confound them; and they must learn to know the true meaning of every such expression from its context.
This quality of the soul is not composed of the elements, so that it ever could be again decomposed into them; nor does it proceed from the power of breath of life, so that it should stand in need of the breath of life in the same manner as the breath of life, stands in need of the body; but it proceeds from the Lord—from Heaven; therefore when the matter, which is composed of the elements, becomes decomposed, and when the breath of life also perishes (for this can exist no otherwise than with the body, and stands in need of the body, in all its functions), that quality is nevertheless not destroyed, because it does not in its functions stand in need of the breath of life, but continues to know and to comprehend those Intelliigences that are distinct from all matter, and also to know the Creator of all things; and it lasts for ever and ever. This is what Solomon said in his wisdom: <i>Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it </i>(Eccles. 12. 7).
All the things, that we have said respecting this matter, are like a drop of a bucket; these things being very profound, but yet not so profound as in the matter treated upon in the first and second chapters. Now the explanation of these things, which are treated upon in the third and fourth chapters, is called <b>Cosmogony Maasei Bereshith</b> and thus the sages of old have directed, that even these things must not be expounded publicly, and it is only to an individual that these things may be made known and taught.
But then what difference is there between the subject relating to the <b>Maasei Mercabah</b> <i> description of the Chariot</i>, and the subject relating to the <b>Maasei Bereshith Cosmogony</b>? It is this, namely, that on the subject relating to the <i>description of the Chariot</i> we must not expound even to one person, unless he be wise and of a penetrating intellect, and even then we are only to convey the outlines to him; whereas in subjects relating to <b>Cosmogony</b> we may instruct one single person, though he could not reach it by his own knowledge; moreover we may make known to him all that he is able to know of these matters. And why may we not teach it in public? Because every man has not a mind extensive enough perfectly to comprehend all the interpretations and explanations requisite for these matters.
At the time when a man reflects on these things, and know all the creatures, whether they be angels, orbs, or men, or the like, and sees the wisdom of the Holy One, blessed be He! in all the things formed and created, he increases in his love to the Omnipresent, his soul thirsts, and his flesh longs to love God, blessed be He; moreover he stands in awe, and is terrified on account of his lowness, his destitution and his insignificance, when comparing himself to one of those sacred and great bodies, and so much more when comparing himself to one of those pure Intelligences which are distinct from all matter, and composed of no matter whatever; as then he finds himself to be a vessel full of shame and ignominy, destitute and needy.
Now the subject treated upon in these four chapters, as comprehending these five commandments, is that which was called by the sages of old <b>Pardeis</b> <i> The Garden</i>; so they said: <i>Four</i> men <i>have entered the Garden. </i>Now although these were great men in Israel, and also very wise men, still all of them had not the power of knowing and comprehending these matters to perfection. I am, however, of opinion, that it, would not be advisable to perambulate in the garden, viz., to indulge in metaphysical studies, except after having taken substantial food, viz., having previously become fully acquainted with the knowledge of the lawful and unlawful, and similar practical laws. Now although these things were called by the sages <i>minor things</i>, for behold! the sages say: “A great thing is <i>the description of the Chariot</i>, and minor things are <i>discussions like those of Abajah and Ravah,”</i> yet the latter are entitled to precedence, inasmuch as they tend to calm the mind of man, and as they are also the great benefit which the Holy One, blessed be He! has bounteously conferred upon the habitable globe, to the end that they may inherit the life of the world that is to come; moreover these every one may know, small and great, man and woman, he that has an extensive mind, and he that has a limited mind.

Chapter 5

All the house of Israel are commanded to sacrifice their lives for the sanctification of the name of the Great God, for scripture says:<i> And I will be sanctified among the children of Israel</i>, (Levit. 22. 32). They are also cautioned not to profane it, as it is written: <i>Neither shall ye profane my holy name, (Levit. 22. 32).</i> For instance, should a heathen rise to compel an Israelite to transgress any of the commandments which are written in the law on pain of death, the Israelite shall rather transgress and not be killed, for it is said, as regards the commandments, <i>That man shall do them and</i> live <i>in them</i>, (Levit. 18. 5), signifying that he is to <i>live</i> by them, (the laws) but not sacrifice his life by them; and if he chooses rather to sacrifice his life than transgress, then he renders himself guilty of suicide. 
 The above, however, applies only to the other commandments, except idolatry, adultery, and murder; but as regards these three crimes, if any one should bid an Israelite to transgress any of them on pain of death, he must sacrifice his life, and not transgress. But even as regards the other commandments, he is only allowed to prefer transgression to death, in case the heathen has only the intention to draw personal advantage from it; for instance, if he intends to compel him to build for him (the heathen) a house on Sabbath, or to cook his victuals on Sabbath, or to force a woman to commit inchastity; but if the heathen’s object is only to make the Israelite transgress the commandments, the latter may transgress and not sacrifice his life, if the sin is to be committed privately and not in the presence of ten Israelites. But if the heathen compels him to transgress a commandment in the presence of ten Israelites, he must sacrifice his life and not transgress; even if the heathen’s object is merely to make the Israelite transgress any scriptural commandment besides the above named three.
These rules, however, relate only to ordinary times and circumstances, but in time of religious persecution, viz., if a cruel heathen, like Nebuchadnezzar, and such like, should rise and issue a decree against Israel, to abolish their law or any of the Divine commandments, the Israelite must sacrifice his life and not transgress even any of the other commandments, whether compelled to do so publicly or privately. 
 In whatever case the law says that he (the Israelite) should transgress and not sacrifice his life, and he sacrificed his life and would not transgress, he is guilty of suicide; and in such cases where the law says that he should sacrifice his life rather than transgress, and he acted accordingly, he has verily sanctified the name of God; and if such was done in the presence of ten Israelites, he has sanctified the Divine name publicly, like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, and Rabbi Ackiba and his colleagues. These are the religious martyrs who have suffered death by the decrees of tyrannical governments, which is the highest degree of religious martyrdom, and of them Scripture says: <i>Yea, for Thy sake are we killed continually, we are counted as sheep for the slaughter</i>, (Psalms 44. 26). Further it is said: <i> Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice, </i>(Psalms 55. 5). And in whatever case the law says that he shall be killed and not transgress, but he acted contrarily, he has defiled the Divine name; and if it happened in the presence of ten Israelites, he has desecrated the Divine name publicly, and set aside an affirmative commandment, which is the sanctification of the Divine name, and has also transgressed a negative precept which is the profanation of the name of God; yet as his transgression was from compulsion, he is not amenable to the infliction of stripes, and it is not necessary to say that he is not to suffer death by the decree of the tribunal, even if he has been compelled to take away human life; because the punishment of stripes or death is inflicted only when the crime is committed wilfully in the presence of witnesses and after due caution; as it is said in reference to one who gives his seed to the idol Molech: <i> And I will set my face against</i> THAT MAN, (Levit. 20. 3). Tradition explains the phrase <b>Beish Hahu</b>, <i>against that man</i>, that he must not be compelled, nor act by mistake, nor be misled. Now, if even in reference to idolatry, which is the most heinous crime of all, Scripture says, that if he commits the crime compulsorily, he has not rendered himself amenable to the Punishment of<i> Careth</i> (excision)—much less to suffer death by ecclesiastical authority—how much more is this principle applicable to the other Scriptural commandments. As to the crime of inchastity, Scripture says: <i>But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing</i>, (Deut. 22. 26); inasmuch as she was forced to it. Should he, however, be able to save his life and to escape from the power of the cruel heathen, but refrains from doing so, he is then to be regarded <i>like a dog that returneth to his vomit</i> and is called a wilful idolator, has forfeited his claim to a future state, and sinks to the lowest ebb of perdition. 
Should heathens demand of Israelites to give up one for execution, on threat to kill all if they should refuse, they must sooner submit to be all put to death rather than deliver up one body of Israel. If, however, the heathens have singled out an individual, and asked for his being given up or to kill all, should that individual be guilty of death, like Sheba-ben-Bichri—who was guilty of high treason—he is to be given up. This, however, requires serious consideration, but if that individual is not guilty of death they shall all submit to execution rather than deliver up one single body of Israel.
The same which has been said as regards compulsion may also be applied to physical illness; for instance, if a sick person is on the point of death, and the physicians assert that he might be cured by some remedy which is prohibited in Scripture, we may, in a case where life is in danger, do it, and apply any remedy, though prohibited in the law; except if the remedy involves the crime of idolatry, or adultery, or murder, we dare not apply the remedy, even if life is in danger. Should he, however, transgress, and be cured by that prohibited remedy, the tribunal has to inflict due punishment. 
But whence do we know, that even in a case where life is in danger, we are not to commit one of these three crimes? Scripture says:<i> And thou shall love the Eternal thy God, with all thy heart and with all thy soul, and with all thy might</i>, the words, <i>with all thy soul</i>, signifying even if thy life is to be taken away. To sacrifice the life of one lsraelite in order to effect the cure of another, or to rescue one from the hand of violence, reason dictates not to sacrifice one life to save another. And the crime of adultery is equal to that of murder; for Scripture says: <i>For as when a man riseth against his neighbour and slayeth him, even so is this matter</i>, (Deut. 22. 26). 
 As regards the above stated prohibition of applying remedies which involve the use of things unlawful besides the three capital crimes—except when life is in danger, such is only the case when they are applied in a manner, as they are regularly used, for instance, if the patient is ordered reptiles or any other creeping things, or leaven on passover, or any food on the day of atonement; but if the patient is ordered to take them, not in the regular way, for instance to make a plaster or poultice of leaven in passover, or of prohibited fruit, or to give him to drink of things in which some thing bitter is mixed with unlawful ingredients, which is not agreeable to the palate, such remedy we may apply, even if life is not in danger, except “Divers seeds sewn in one vineyard,” or flesh with milk, which are prohibited, even if not in their regular use, and therefore we must not apply them as a remedy, even in an irregular use, except in case of danger of life. 

Whoever wilfully, without any compulsion, transgresses one of the commandments stated in the law, presumptiously and spitefully, he verily profanes the Divine name; and therefore, Scripture says of false swearing: <i>Thou hast thereby defiled the name of thy God: I am the Lord</i>, (Levit. 19. 12), moreover, if he has committed such transgressions in the presence of ten Israelites, he has verily profaned the name of God publicly. On the other hand, if a person resists the temptation of sin, or fulfils a commandment, not from any worldly cause, neither fear or anguish, nor to seek honour, but solely because of the Divine Creator, blessed be He! like the resistance of the pious Joseph against the temptation of his master’s wife, such a person verily sanctifies the name of God.
There are, however, other things which come under the category of profanation of the Divine name; for instance, if a man, eminent in the law, and distinguished for piety, commit things which give rise to people to censure him in his absence, though those things are not actual offences, yet he has thereby profaned the Divine name; for instance, he made a purchase without paying for it at once, although he had the money, and the sellers demand payment and he postpones it; or he indulges in frivolity, or eating and drinking with the low and ignorant, and frequenting their company; or if his conversation with people is not gentle; or he does not receive them in a friendly way, but is quarrelsome and passionate, and such like. All depends on the high position of the sage, according to which he must be very strictly careful in his manners, and must even exceed that which is expected from him. If thus the wise man is strictly careful in his manners, his conversation with people is gentle, having friendly intercourse with them, receives people kindly, even suffers reproach from them without retort, and honours even those who slight them, and is faithful in his dealings, and does not stay long in the company of the low and ignorant, and is not seen idling about, but occupies himself with the study of the law, wrapt up in finger garments, adorned with phylacteries, and his general conduct is even beyond the boundaries of justice, at the same time, he does not go to extremes, which would make him appear eccentric, but conducts himself in a manner that all praise him, love him, and try to emulate his actions; such a one verily sanctifies the name of God, and of him Scripture says: <i>And He said unto me, thou art my servant, Israel, in whom I am glorified, </i>(Isaiah 49. 3)

Chapter 6

Whosoever destroys the inscription of one of the holy and pure names, by which the Holy One, blessed be He! is called, has according to the Divine law, incurred the punishment of stripes; for Scripture says of idols: <i>Ye shall destroy their names of that place; ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God</i>, (Deut. 11. 3, 4). 
 These holy names, are seven in number. The written [ineffable] name, composed of<i> Yod, He; Vav, He</i>, which is the distinctly expressive name of God, or the name which is written;<i> Adonai</i> and <i>El, Elohah, Elohim, Elohai, Shadai</i>, and <i>Zebaoth. </i>Whoever effaces even one letter only of these seven names is punished with stripes. 
Any letter, standing as an affix to the Divine name may be effaced; for instance the <i>Lamed</i> of<i> La-Adonai</i>, and the <i>Beth</i> of<i> Belohim</i>, and such like, which have not the same degree of holiness as the name itself. Any letter standing as a suffix to one of these holy names, for instance, the <i>chaph</i> of<i> Eloheeha</i>, or <i>chem</i> in <i>Elohechem</i>, and the like must not be effaced, and are considered as any of the letters composing the Divine name; because the Divine name imparts sanctity to them; but although they are considered holy, and not allowed to be effaced, yet whosoever effaces one of these <i>suffixa</i> is not punished with the usual stripes ordained by Scripture, but he is liable to corporal punishment for his disobedience.
 If one has written <i>Alef, Lamed</i> of<i> Elohim</i>, or<i> Yod, He</i>, of the ineffable name, these letters must not be effaced, [and it is not necessary to state that if he has written <i>Ya</i>, which is also a Divine name by itself], because these letters form part of the ineffable name. But if any one writes, <i>Shin Daleth</i> of<i> Shadai</i>, or<i> Zadick Beth</i> of Zebaoth they may be effaced.
 The other nouns of attributes, by which we praise the Holy One, blessed be He! for instance, <i>Hanun</i> (the most gracious); <i>Rachum</i> (the most merciful); <i>Hagadol</i> (the great); <i>Haggibbor</i> (the mighty one); <i>Hanorah</i> (the awful);<i> Hane-eman</i> (the faithful);<i> Kanna</i> (the zealous one); <i>Hachazak</i> (the strong one), and such like, these are like other words of Scripture, and maybe effaced.
 If we find a vessel bearing the inscription of one of the holy names, we cut out the place containing the holy name which must be carefully hidden. Even if the name was engraved on vessels of metal or glass, and he melted the vessel, he is punished with stripes, the place containing the name should be carefully cut out and hidden. Likewise, if any of the Divine names was marked on his body, he must not bathe that spot, nor to put ointment on it, nor remain at an unclean place. Should he have to perform a religious ablution, he must bind over it a reed, and then bathe; and if he has no reed at hand he must bind it up in his garments; it must not, however, be too fast, in order that the water may penetrate it; for it was only recommended to tie it up, because he is not allowed to stand naked in the presence of the Divine name. 
Whosoever pulls down even one single stone for the purpose of destruction, either from the altar, or from the temple, or from any part of the court-yard, he is punished with stripes; for it is said, in regard to idols : <i>Ye shall utterly overthrow their altars</i> and concludes: <i>Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God, </i>(Deut. 12. 4). Likewise, if one burns, for the purpose of destruction, wood appointed for sacred use, he is punished with stripes; for Scripture says:<i> Ye shall burn their groves with fire</i>, and concludes: <i>Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God</i>, (Deut. 12. 4). 
Any of the sacred writings or their explanations and commentaries are not allowed to be burned or wilfully to be destroyed; and he who does so is punished with stripes for contumacy. This, however, applies only to such sacred writings as were written by an Israelite in a sacred manner, but a scroll of the law, which has been written by an infidel Israelite, must be utterly burned, because he does not believe in the sanctity of the Divine name, and has not written it in a sacred manner, but treated like profane writings: hence it is imperative to burn it. But if a heathen writes the name of God, we have only to hide it. Likewise sacred writings which are worn out, or which were written by a heathen, must be hidden. 
All the Divine names which occur in sentences pronounced by Abraham are holy, even the name occurring in the passage: <i>And (Abraham) said, my Lord if now I have found favour in thy sight</i>, (Genesis 18. 3) is holy. All the names which were pronounced by Lot are profane, except the one in the passage: <i>“Oh, not so, my Lord! behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, </i>(Genesis 19. 18, 19). All the Divine names which were pronounced by the men of <i>Gibath Benjamin</i>, are holy (Judges 20). All the names which were pronounced by the idolator, Micha, are profaned (Judges 17.). All the Divine names which were pronounced by <i>Neboth</i> (I Kings 21. 3), are holy. Whenever the name <i>Shelomah</i> occurs in the Song of Songs, it is holy, and is like any other of the Divine attributes; except the one occurring in the passage: <i>Thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, </i>(Song of Songs 8. 12). Whenever the attribute, <i>King</i>, occurs in Daniel it is profane, except the passage: <i>Thou, O King, art King of Kings, </i>(Daniel 2. 37), and is like any other of the Divine attributes.

Chapter 7

It is one of the foundations of the law to acknowledge, that God inspires some of the children of men to prophesy. Now Prophecy can rest only on an eminently wise man, who excels in morals, over whom no passion whatever can prevail, but who by his strong convictions always conquers his evil imagination; and who more over is a man of a very extensive and well regulated mind. The man who is replete with such virtues, and whose bodily constitution too is in a perfect state, on his entering into the Paradise, and on his being carried along by those great and abstract matters, if he have a correct knowledge so as to understand and to comprehend them, if he continue to keep himself in holiness, if he keep aloof from the general manner of the people who walk in the darkness of temporary things—if he continue to be solicitous about himself, and to train his mind so that it should not entertain a thought of any of those perishable things, or of the vanities of time and its devices, but that his mind is constantly directed heavenwards, and bound to the <i>Throne</i> of Glory, so as to be able to comprehend those holy and pure Intelligences, and to meditate on the wisdom of the Holy One, blessed be He! which wisdom is displayed throughout, from the first Intelligence even to the centre of the earth; and if by these means he comes to know His greatness, then the <i>Holy Spirit</i> immediately dwells with him; and at the time when the Spirit rests on him, his soul mixes with the degree of those angels that are called <i>Ishim</i> (men), so that he is changed into another man. He will sensibly feel, that he is not as he was, but that he has become exalted above the degree of other wise men; just as it is said of Saul: <i>And thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man</i>, (I Sam. 10. 6). 
The prophets hold various degrees. As in <i>wisdom</i> one wise man may be greater than another, so in prophecy one prophet may be greater than another prophet. All of them see, however, the appearance of prophecy in a dream only, in a vision of the night, or on some particular day when deep sleep falls on them; just as it is said:<i> I the Lord will make myself known unto him</i> IN A VISION,<i> and will speak unto him</i> IN A DREAM, (Num. 12. 6). Moreover their frames tremble at the time when they are prophesying, their bodily power fails, their own ideas are perplexed, and their mind, divested of any other impression, is, left only to conceive that which it sees, as it is said of Abraham: <i>And lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him</i>, (Gen. 15. 12), and as it is also said of Daniel: <i>For my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength</i>, (Dan. 10. 8). 
 The things that are revealed to the prophet in a prophetic vision, are revealed to him by way of allegory; but then the interpretation of the allegory is also at once impressed on his mind by the same prophetic vision, so that he knows what it means; as was the <i>ladder</i> which Jacob our father saw,<i> And angels ascending and descending thereon</i>, which was an allegory of the rising of kingdoms and their ultimate subjugation; or the <i>living</i> creatures which Ezekiel saw; or the <i>seething pot</i>, and <i>the rod of an almond tree</i> which Jeremiah saw; or the <i>scroll</i> which Ezekiel saw; or the <i>ephah</i> which Zechariah saw; and so it was with all the other prophets; some of them like these, related the allegory, and also gave the interpretation thereof; and others told the interpretation only; and sometimes they related the allegory only, without giving any interpretation, as are part of the orations of Ezekiel and Zechariah; yet all of them prophesied in allegories, and by way of symbol.
The prophets in general were not able to prophesy at any time they desired, but were obliged to prepare their minds, and abide joyfully, cheerfully and solitarily; for prophecy dwells neither amidst melancholy nor amidst apathy, but amidst cheerfulness; and therefore the disciples of the prophets used to have before them a psaltery and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, and thus used to seek after prophecy; and on this account, it is said: <i>And they strove to prophecy, </i>(I Sam. 10. 5); meaning that: <i>they trained themselves in the manner of prophecy</i>, so they might in time prophesy, just as we say: <i>such and such a man strives after greatness.</i>
Those who sought to prophesy were called the <i>disciples of prophets</i>, (young prophets), but although they were thus preparing their minds, it still was doubtful whether the <i>Shechina</i> (the Divine Glory) would dwell with them or not. 
 All that which we have said on this head relates to the manner of prophecy of all the former and latter prophets, except Moses our Teacher, the master of all prophets. But what difference was their between the prophecy of Moses, and the prophecy of all the other-prophets?—All the other prophets, saw the prophecy in a dream or in a vision; but our Teacher Moses saw it, whilst he was awake, and standing upright, for it is said: <i>And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with Him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him</i>, (Num. 7. 89). To all the other prophets, the prophecy was conveyed through an angel, and therefore they saw, that which they saw in an allegory or symbol, but to Moses our Teacher it was not through an angel, for it is said: <i>With him I speak </i>MOUTH TO MOUTH, (Num. 12. 8). And it is also said: <i>And the Lord spake unto Moses</i> FACE TO FACE, (Exod. 33. 11). And again it is said: <i>And the</i> SIMILTUDE OF THE LORD SHALL HE BEHOLD, (Num. 12. 8); by which it was meant to express, that there was no allegory but that he saw the thing quite perspicuously, not in an enigma, nor in any allegory; and this is what the law bears witness concerning him [by saying]: EVEN APPARENTLY <i>and</i> NOT IN DARK SPEECHES, (Num. 12. 8), meaning, that he did not prophecy in dark speeches, but openly, because he saw the thing quite perspicuously. All the other prophets were terrified, troubled and trembling; but with Moses our Teacher it was not so, and this is what Scripture says: <i>As a man speaketh unto his friend</i>, (Exod. 33. 11); meaning, that as a man is not troubled by hearing the words of his fellow, so the mind of Moses our Teacher had the power of conceiving the word of prophecy, whilst retaining all its faculties unimpaired. All the other prophets could not prophesy at any time they desired; but with Moses our Teacher it was not so; but at any time when he wished for it, he was invested with the Holy Spirit, and prophecy dwelt with him; so that it was not necessary for him to prepare his mind, and to put himself in readiness: for, behold! he was always ready, and standing prepared for it, like the ministering angels. He therefore was able to prophesy at any time, as it is said:<i> Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you</i>, (Num. 9. 8). And this was assured to him by God, for it is said: <i>Go say to him, get you into your tents again. But as for thee stand thou here by me, </i>(Deut. 5. 30, 31). Behold! by this you learn, that with regard to all the other prophets, these, when prophecy departed from them, returned to their tents again, by which is meant, that they returned again to their bodily wants, like the rest of the people, and therefore did not keep away from their wives, but as to Moses our Teacher, he did not return to his former tent, and therefore he did keep away from women, and from all similar wants forever, so that his mind became bound into the Rock of the Universe; glory never departed from him; <i>his countenance shone</i>, (Exod. 34. 30); and he became sanctified like the angels.
 As to the prophet, it is possible that his prophecy might be merely for his own spiritual advantage, namely, that it might enlarge his own mind, and extend his own knowledge; to the end that he might know of these sublime matters that which he did not know before; and it is also possible that he might be sent to any nation of the nations of the earth, or to the inhabitants of any city or kingdom, in order to set them right, and to make known unto them that which they ought to do, or to restrain them from the wicked deeds which they were practising and in this case, namely, when he is sent on such missions, a sign or wonder is delivered to him, to the end that the people may know that God has really sent him. We do not, however, believe every one who performs a sign or wonder to be a prophet, unless he be a man whom we previously knew to have been worthy of prophecy, in consequence of his wisdom and his actions, whereby he was exalted above all his fellow creatures, and also to have walked in the way of prophecy, with its requisite holiness and abstemiousness; and if then he come and perform a sign or wonder, saying at the same time that God has sent him, we are commanded to hearken unto him, for it is said: <i>Unto him ye shall hearken</i>, (Deut. 18. 15). But still it is possible that he should perform a sign or wonder, and yet not be a prophet; and as to the sign—there may be something doubtful about it; yet for all that we are commanded to hearken unto him, because he, having been a great and wise man, and worthy of prophecy, we place reliance on his high position, for so we are commanded. Just as we are commanded to decide a legal case, by the deposition of two eligible witnesses, although it is possible that they should have borne false witness; since, however, with us they are [supposed to be] honest [men], we ought to take their honesty for granted. And respecting such and the like matters it is said: <i>The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our children</i>, (Deut. 29. 29.); and again it is said: <i>For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart</i>, (I Sam. 16. 7). 

Chapter 8

With regard to Moses our Teacher, the Israelites did not believe him in consequence of the signs which he performed, (for he who believes in consequence of signs, must still have some suspicion in his mind whether it might not have been possible that the sign should have been performed by enchantment, illusion or deception); but, on the contrary, all the signs which Moses performed in the wilderness were performed by him, as a mere matter of necessity, and not with the purpose of giving proof of [the truth of] his prophecy. When it was necessary to drown the Egyptians—he divided the sea, and plunged them into it. When we had need of food—he brought us down Manna. When they were thirsty—he split the rock for their sake. When Korah and his confederates denied him—the earth swallowed them up. And so it was with all the other signs. But what caused them to believe him? It was in consequence of their presence at Mount Sinai; when our own eyes and not another’s beheld, and when our own ears and not another’s heard, the fire, the thunderings and the lightnings; whilst he approached the thick darkness, and the voice spake unto him in our own hearing: Moses! Moses! go, and say unto them thus, just as it is said: <i>The Lord spake with you face to face</i>, (Deut. 5. 4). And again it is said: <i>The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers</i>, (Deut. 5. 3). But how do we know that their presence at Mount Sinai alone proved to them the truth of his prophecy, and removed all suspicion?—It is because it is said: <i>Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and</i> BELIEVE THEE FOR EVER, (Exod. 19. 9). Consequently, before that event, they did not believe him with a perfect and lasting faith, but with a belief which was still open to doubt and suspicion.
 And therefore, we maintain that those very men, to whom he was sent, were the witnesses to the truth of his prophecy; so that he needed not to perform any other sign for them, for both they and he himself were witnesses in the matter, just as two witnesses who saw together any one thing, would mutually bear witness to each other, that they spoke the truth; and neither of them would need to give a proof to the other; so with regard to Moses our Teacher, after their presence at Mount Sinai, all the Israelites became his witnesses, and there was no need for him to perform any sign before them. Now this is that which the Holy One, blessed be He! spake unto him at the beginning of his prophecy, when He delivered unto him the signs to be performed in Egypt, saying: <i>And they shall hearken to thy voice</i>, (Exod. 3. 18). For Moses our Teacher well knew, that he who believes in consequence of signs, still entertains in his mind some suspicion—that he still doubts and hesitates—and therefore was reluctant to go, and said: <i>But, behold! they will not believe me, </i>(Exod. 4. 1). Until the Holy One, blessed be He! made known unto him that “these signs are only to serve until they have gone out from Egypt; but that after they have gone out and stood at this mount, all suspicion, that they may have entertained against thee, will be removed; for I give thee here a sign, by which they will know that I have truly sent thee from the very first, so that no suspicion shall remain in their minds.” And this is that which Scripture says: <i>And this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain</i>, (Exod. 3. 12). Hence we say, that we would not believe any prophet that should arise after Moses our Teacher, in consequence of the sign alone, saying: “If he perform a sign, we will hearken unto him in every thing that he may say,”—but if we hearken unto him, it is in consequence of the commandment, with which Moses charged us in the law, saying: “When he gives you a sign, ye shall hearken unto him;” just as he commanded us to decide a legal matter by two witnesses, although we may not know whether they have borne true or false witness, so are we also commanded to hearken unto this prophet, although we do not know whether the sign be true, or the work of illusion or deception.
And therefore if a prophet were to arise and perform great signs or wonders, but sought to deny the prophecy of Moses our Teacher, we should not hearken to him, but should know clearly that the signs were performed by illusions or deception, seeing that the prophecy of Moses our Teacher was not established by signs, so that we could compare the signs of this man with the signs of the other; but we saw it with our own eyes, and heard it with our own ears, the same as he (Moses) himself heard it. Indeed, this may be compared to witnesses who bear testimony before a person, respecting a thing which he saw with his own eyes, contrary to that which he actually saw; in which case he would surely not hearken unto them, but would know certainly that they were false witnesses. And therefore, the law says, that if even the sign or the wonder come to pass, thou shalt still not hearken unto the words of that prophet; for behold! this man comes to thee with a sign or wonder, to deny that which thou sawest with thine own eyes; and since we only believe signs, in consequence of the commandment with which Moses has charged us, how then are we to receive the sign of him, who comes to deny the prophecy of Moses our Teacher, which we both saw and heard.

Chapter 9

It is clearly and distinctly manifest from the law itself, that its enactments are permanent, lasting for ever and unto all eternities, and does not admit of any alteration, diminution or addition; for it is said: <i>What thing soever I command you, observe to do it;</i> THOU SHALT NOT ADD THERETO, NOR DIMINISH FROM IT, (Deut. 12. 32). Again it is said: <i>But those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children</i> FOR EVER,<i> that we may do all the words of this law;</i> (Deut. 29. 29). This teaches us, that, with respect to all the words of the law, we are commanded to perform the same FOR EVER. Moreover, it is said:<i> An ordinance</i> FOR EVER<i> in your generations</i>, (Num. 15. 15); and again it is said: <i>It is not in heaven, </i>(Deut. 30. 12). Hence we are taught, that no future prophet is allowed to introduce any innovation. Should therefore any man arise, either from among the nations or from among Israel, and perform any sign or wonder, and declare that the Lord has sent him to add any commandment, or to diminish any commandment, or to explain any of the commandments otherwise than we have heard from Moses; or if he were to say that the commandments which have been commanded to the Israelites are not to last for ever, and from generation to generation, but that they were only temporary commandments: such a man is a <i>false prophet</i>, for verily he comes to deny the prophecy of Moses, and so he made himself amenable unto death by strangulation in consequence of his having dealt presumtuously by thus speaking in the name of the Lord, things which He has not commanded him; for He, blessed be His name! has on the contrary enjoined Moses, that this commandment should be unto us and to our children FOR EVER, and God is not a man that He should lie. 
But, why then is it said in the law: <i>I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren</i> LIKE UNTO THEE, (Deut. 18. 18)? The answer is, that he (the prophet) is not to come to <i>establish</i> any new law, but only to enjoin the observation of the existing law, and to warn the people that they should not trespass against it; just as the last of the prophets said: <i>Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, </i>(Mal. 4. 4). Moreover, if he (the prophet) were to charge us with any thing respecting private matters; as, for instance: go into that place, or do not go; join battle to day, or do not join battle; build this wall, or do not build it; we are likewise' commanded to hearken unto him. And he who trespasses against his words, will be visited with punishment of death by Heaven, for it is said;<i> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto My words which he shall speak in My name, I</i> WILL REQUIRE IT OF HIM, (Deut. 18. 19).
Moreover a prophet who trespasses against his own words, or suppresses his prophecy, will likewise be visited with punishment of death by Heaven; and it is with regard to these three cases, that it is said: <i>I will require it of him.</i> Also if a prophet, whom we know to be a prophet, were to tell us that we should trespass against any one of the commandments stated in the law, or even against several commandments, whether they be slight or important ones, for a certain time only; we are commanded to hearken unto him. For thus we are taught by the sages of old, who received traditionally: “In every thing that the prophet bids thee trespass against the words of the law, as in the case of Elijah on mount Carmel, (as recorded in I Kings 18), hearken unto him except in matters of idolatry.” This bidding of the prophet, however must be an exceptional one for present circumstances, as was with Elijah on mount Carmel, namely, when he offered a burnt offering without Jerusalem, though that city alone was chosen for this purpose, and though he who offers a sacrifice without Jerusalem deserves <i>Careth</i> (excision); but notwithstanding this, because he was a prophet, we were commanded to hearken unto him; for in such cases Scripture says: <i>Unto him ye shall hearken</i>, (Deut. 18. 15). Now had one asked Elijah and said unto him: “How can we break that which is written in the law: <i>that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest, </i>(Deut. 12. 13)?” he would have answered thus: Scripture only says that he who always offers sacrifices without Jerusalem is guilty of <i>Careth</i> (excision) to be cut off, as Moses has commanded us; but as for myself, I shall offer a sacrifice without Jerusalem <i>this day only</i>, [and this I do] by the command of the Lord, in order to refute the prophets of Baal. And in this manner any one of the prophets order us to transgress a commandment <i>temporarily</i>, we are commanded to hearken unto him; but if he say that the thing is to be broken <i>for ever</i>, he renders himself amenable to death by strangulation; for the law says:<i> Unto us and to our children</i> FOR EVER, (Deut. 29. 29). 
 And in like manner if he (the prophet) propose to break any of the ordinances which we have learned by tradition; or if he say, with respect to any point of the law, that the Lord had made known to him that such was the decision, or that [in any rabbinical controversy] the point ought to be decided by the opinion of such and such a person; that man is a <i>false prophet</i>, and amenable to death by strangulation, although he perform a sign; for he came to deny the law, which says:<i> It is not in Heaven, </i>(Deut. 30. 12); but in temporary matters we must hearken unto him in every thing. 
 The above, however, applies only to all other commandments; but as regards matters of idolatry, we do not hearken unto him, even temporarily. And were he even to perform great signs and wonders, yet if he say that the Lord commanded him that some idol should be worshipped, though for that day only, or for that hour only—then this man has spoken <i>to turn you away from the Lord</i>, and with respect to such a one Scripture commands as follows: <i>And the sign or the wonder come to pass...Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet...Because he hath spoken</i> TO TURN YOU AWAY FROM THE LORD YOUR GOD, (Deut. 13. 2, 3, 5). For behold! this man came to deny the prophecy of Moses; and therefore we know for a certainty that he is a false prophet, and that which he performed was done by deception and illusion, and he has rendered himself amenable to death by strangulation. 

Chapter 10

Any prophet that may arise amongst us and say: that the Lord has sent him—need not perform any sign, like one of the signs of Moses our Teacher, or like the signs of Elijah or Elisha, which consisted in a change in the ordinary course of nature; but his sign ought to consist in predicting things which are to happen in the world, and that his words be verified; for it is said: <i>And thou say in thine heart: How shall we know the word, etc., </i> (Deut. 18. 21). Therefore if a man come, as a Divine messenger, who is worthy of prophesying, and moreover if he come neither to add nor to diminish, but to serve the Lord by [fulfilling] the commandments of the law, they must not say unto him: divide the sea before us; or: call a dead body into life before us, or do any of the like things, and then we will believe thee; but they must say unto him: If thou be a prophet, foretell things that are to happen; and so he has to tell them, and we wait to see whether his words will come to pass, or whether they will not come to pass. And, should even the least thing of what he foretold fail, it will be evident that he is a false prophet; but if all his words come to pass, he must be regarded as faithful.
 We must, however, examine him many times, if all his words are found to be true, then he is a true prophet, just as it is said of Samuel: <i>And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord</i>, (I Sam. 3. 20). 
 But do not the observers of times and the diviners also foretell that which is to happen?—what difference then is there between the prophet and them?—The answer is that the observers of times, diviners, and such men, some of their words may be fulfilled, and some of them may not be fulfilled, just as it is said:<i> Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee</i> FROM<i> these things</i> THAT<i> shall come upon thee</i>, (lsai. 47. 13); [here the prophet purposely uses the word] <b>Measher</b> FROM SOME<i> things</i> THAT<i> shall come upon thee, </i>and not [the words] <b>Coll asher</b> ALL<i> things</i> THAT<i> shall come upon thee.</i> And indeed it is also possible that none of their words should be fulfilled at all, but that they should have been altogether mistaken, just as it is said: <i>He frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad, </i>(Isa. 44. 25). But as to the prophet, all his words are fulfilled, for it is said: <i>That there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord</i>, (II Kings 10. 10). And again it is said: <i>The prophet, that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the Lord, </i>(Jer. 23. 28); signifying, that the words of diviners and dreamers, are like the chaff, in which there has been mixed a little wheat; the Word of God is like wheat, in which there is no chaff at all. And with regard to this, Scripture assures us, saying, that on the same subjects of which the observers of times, and the diviners foretell to other nations mixed with falsehood, the prophet will foretell to you, in the words of pure truth; so that you have no need of any observer of times, or diviner or the like men; for it is said: <i>There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, etc....For these nations, etc....</i>(Deut. 18. 10, 14). Scripture continues: <i>A prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, etc….</i>(Deut. 18. 15). Whence we learn when a prophet arises among us, it is only to foretell us things which are to happen in the world, such as plenty, famine, war or peace, and the like things. Yea, he may foretell events concerning individuals, just as Saul, when he sustained a loss, went to a prophet that he might inform him of the place where the lost thing was to be found; and it is only things like these that a prophet is to declare; he is by no means to establish a new law, or to add or diminish any commandment.
With regard to any calamity which the prophet may foretell, as, for instance, if he were to predict that such and such a person will die, or that in such and such a year there will be a famine or war, or such like; and if it happen that his words do not come to pass, this must not be considered as a denial to his prophecy, and we must not say: behold! he has spoken, and yet it never came to pass; for the Holy One, blessed be He! is <i>slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth Him of the evil;</i> and therefore, it is possible that they (the sinners) have repented, and obtained pardon, as was the case with the people of Ninevah; or it may be, that He has given them a respite, as was the case with Hezekiah. But if the prophet predicts good, saying that such a good event will happen; and yet the good, which he foretold, did not come to pass, then it is evident that he is a false prophet; inasmuch as every thing good which God decrees, though it be <i>on a certain condition</i>, is not retracted by Him; so that we do not find that He ever retracted any good promise, except at the destruction of the first temple, when He assured the righteous, that they should not be destroyed with the wicked; and yet retracted His word. Hence we learn, that the prophet can only be tried by the good which he foretells; and this is that which Jeremiah said in his answer to Hananiah the son of Azur, when Jeremiah was prophesying evil, and Hananiah good. Then he said to Hananiah: If MY words be not fulfilled, this will be no proof that I am a false prophet; but if THY words be not fulfilled, it will be known that thou art a false prophet; thus it is said: <i>Nevertheless hear thou now this word, etc....The prophet who prophesieth</i> OF PEACE, <i>when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known that the Lord hath truly sent him, </i>(Jer. 28. 7, 9). 
 If a prophet receives the testimony of another prophet that he is a true prophet, he is thereby confirmed as such, and is not subject to any further investigation; for behold! Moses our Teacher bore witness to Joshua, and then all Israel believed him (Joshua), even before he performed any sign. And so it is to be with respect to future generations, namely, if a prophet, whose prophecy has been known, and whose words have been repeatedly believed, or if a prophet bears testimony to him, and who moreover has been walking in the ways of prophecy—it will be unlawful to doubt, or to suspect in the least the truth of his prophecy. Moreover, it is unlawful to test him more than necessary; so that we must not be continually trying him; for it is said; <i>Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye tempted Him in Massah, </i>(Deut. 6. 16.); namely, when they said: <i>Is the Lord among us or not? </i>(Exod. 17. 7). But after it has become known that this man is a prophet, they ought to believe, and to know that the Lord is among them, and ought neither to suspect nor doubt him; as it is said:<i> Yet they</i> SHALL KNOW <i>that there hath been a prophet among them</i>, (Ezek. 2. 5).
