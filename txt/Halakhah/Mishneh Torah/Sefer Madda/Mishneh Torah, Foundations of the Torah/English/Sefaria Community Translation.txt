Chapter 1



Chapter 2

It is a mitzvah to love and fear this glorious and awesome God, as [Deuteronomy 6:5] states: "And you shall love God, your Lord" and, as [Deuteronomy 6:13] states: "Fear God, your Lord."What is the path [to attain] love and fear of Him? When a person contemplates His wondrous and great deeds and creations and appreciates His infinite wisdom that surpasses all comparison, he will immediately love, praise, and glorify [Him], yearning with tremendous desire to know [God's] great name, as David stated: "My soul thirsts for the Lord, for the living God" [Psalms 42:3].
When he [continues] to reflect on these same matters, he will immediately recoil in awe and fear, appreciating how he is a tiny, lowly, and dark creature, standing with his flimsy, limited, wisdom before He who is of perfect knowledge, as David stated: "When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers... [I wonder] what is man that You should recall Him" [Psalms 8:4-5]. Based on these concepts, I will explain important principles regarding the deeds of the Master of the worlds to provide a foothold for a person of understanding to [develop] love for God, as our Sages said regarding love: "In this manner, you will recognize He who spoke and [thus,] brought the world into being.
Everything which the Holy One, blessed be He, created within His world is divided into three categories. They include: a) Creations which are a combination of matter and form. They are constantly coming into existence and ceasing to exist; for example, the bodies of man and beasts, plants, and metals.b) Creations which are [also] a combination of matter and form, but do not change from body to body and from form to form as those in the first category. Rather, their form is permanently fixed in their matter, and they do not change as the others do; for example, the spheres and the stars [which revolve] in them. The matter [from which] they [are composed] differs from [a simple conception of] matter, and their form differs from [a simple conception of] form. c) Creations which have form, but no matter at all; for example, the angels, for the angels do not possess bodies or corporeal being, but rather are forms which are separate from each other.
What is meant by the prophets' statements that they saw an angel of fire or with wings? All these are prophetic visions and parables, as [Deuteronomy 4:24] states: "God, your Lord, is consuming fire," though He is not fire and [the description of Him in this manner] is only metaphoric. Similarly, [Psalms 104:4] states: "He makes His angels as winds...."
Since they possess no body, what separates the form [of the angels] from each other? Their existence is not alike. Rather each one is below the level of the other and exists by virtue of its influence, [in a progression of levels,] one above the other.Everything exists by virtue of the influence of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His goodness. Solomon alluded to this [concept] in his wisdom, saying (Ecclesiastes 5:7): "Because above the one who is high there is a watcher [and there are others higher than them]."
The expression "below the level of the other" does not refer to height in a spatial sense as [one might say], he is sitting higher than his colleague, [but rather, in regard to spiritual level]. For example, when speaking about two sages, one of whom is greater than the other, we say, "one is above the level of the other." Similarly, a cause is referred to as "above" the effect [it produces].
The different names with which the angels are called reflect their [spiritual] levels. Thus, they are called: 1) The holy chayyot, who are above all the others; 2) the ofanim; 7) the elohim; 3) the er'elim; 8) the sons of the elohim; 4) the chashmalim; 9) the keruvim; 5) the serafim; 10) the ishim. 6) the mal'achim; These ten names which are used to refer to the angels reflect their ten [different spiritual] levels. The level above which there is no higher level except that of God, blessed be He, is that of the form called chayyot. Therefore, the prophets state that they are below God's throne of glory. The tenth [and lowest] level is that of the form called ishim. They are the angels who communicate with the prophets and are perceived by them in prophetic visions. Therefore, they are called ishim, (“men”), because their level is close to the level of human knowledge.
All these [spiritual] forms are alive. They recognize and know the Creator with very immense knowledge, each of the forms according to its level and not according to its greatness. Even the highest level is unable to conceive of the true nature of the Creator as He [truly] is, since its intellectual capacity is too limited to know or to grasp [Him]. It does, however, comprehend and know more than the form which is below it. This is true regarding each and every level, including the tenth level. This [level] also knows the Creator in a manner that surpasses the potential to know and comprehend [God possessed by] human beings made up of body and soul. None [of these levels] can know the Creator as He knows Himself.
All existence, aside from the Creator - from the first form down to a small mosquito in the depths of the earth - came into being from the influence of His truth. Since He knows Himself and recognizes His greatness, beauty, and truth, He knows everything, and nothing is hidden from Him.
The Holy One, blessed be He, recognizes His truth and knows it as it is. He does not know with a knowledge which is external to Him in the way that we know, for ourselves and our knowledge are not one. Rather, the Creator, may He be blessed, He, His knowledge, and His life are one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity. Were He to live as life is [usually conceived], or know with a knowledge that is external from Him, there would be many gods, Him, His life, and His knowledge. The matter is not so. Rather, He is one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity. Thus, you could say, "He is the Knower, He is the Subject of Knowledge, and He is the Knowledge itself." All is one. This matter is beyond the ability of our mouths to relate, [or our] ears to hear, nor is there [the capacity] within the heart of man to grasp it in its entirety. [In expression of this concept, Genesis 42:15] states: "chay (By the life) of Pharaoh" and [I Samuel 25:26] states "chay, (By the life) of your soul," but [I Samuel, ibid.] does not say: "chay, (By the life) of God" but chai Adonai, “As God lives.” [This shows] that the Creator and His life are not two, as are the lives of living beings or the lives of the angels. Thus, He does not recognize and know the creations in terms of the creations as we know them, but rather He knows them in terms of Himself. Thus, since He knows Himself, He knows everything, for the existence of everything else is dependent on Him.
The concepts that we have mentioned about the subject matter in these two chapters are like a drop from the sea [when compared to] what is necessary to explain this matter. The explanation of all the fundamental principles of these two chapters is referred to as Ma'aseh Merkavah, (lit. “the work of [G-d’s] chariot.”)
The Sages of the early generations commanded that these matters should not be explained except to a single individual [at a time]. He should be a wise man, who can reach understanding with his [powers of] knowledge. In such an instance, he is given fundamental points, and an outline of the concepts is made known to him. He [is expected to continue to contemplate] until he reaches understanding with his powers of knowledge and knows the ultimate meaning and depth of the concept. These concepts are extremely deep, and not every [person has] the knowledge necessary to appreciate them. In his wisdom, Solomon described them with the metaphor [Proverbs 27:26]: "Lambs for your clothing." [The root kevas "lamb" - also has the meaning "hide."] Thus, our Sages interpreted this metaphor [to mean]: Matters which are the secrets of the world will be your clothing - i.e., they will be for you alone, and you should not discuss them in public. Concerning them, [Proverbs 5:17] teaches: "They shall be for you and not for others with you." [Similarly, the Song of Songs 4:11] states: "Honey and milk will be under your tongue." The Sages of the early generations interpreted this [as a metaphor]: Subjects that are like honey and milk should be [kept] under your tongue.

Chapter 3

The spheres are that which are called "sky," "firmament," "Zevul," and "Aravot," and they are the nine spheres.  The sphere that is closest to us is the sphere of the moon.  The second that is above us is the sphere within which is the star called Mercury.  The third that is above us contains Venus.  The fourth sphere that is above us contains the sun.  The fifth sphere contains Mars, the sixth sphere contains Jupiter, the seventh sphere contains Saturn, and the eighth sphere contains all the other stars that appear in the firmament.  The ninth sphere is the one that rotates every day from east to west, and it surrounds and encircles everything.  All of the stars appear to be in one sphere even though one is above the other because the spheres are pure and transparent like glass and sapphire.  Therefore, the stars that are in the eight sphere appear to be below the first sphere.

Chapter 4

1. The four elements of fire, wind, water, and earth, are the foundations for everything created below the firmament. Everything from man, animal, bird, insect, fish, grass, metal, good and precious rocks, all other building rocks, mountains, mounds of dirt--they are all composed from a mixture of those four foundational elements. Thus we find that all bodies below the firmament, except for those four foundational ones, are composed from those elements and their appearance and elemental components are composed from those four foundations. However, each of those four foundations only consist of themselves.

Chapter 6


There are seven names: the name which is written Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey. And this is the explicit name, or it is written Alef-Daled-Nun-Yud. El, Elo'ah, Elohim, Elohai, Shadai, Tz'vaot. Anyone who erases even one letter from these 7 names is lashed

Someone who wrote the aleph and lamed from Elohim or Yud Hay from Yud-Hay-Vov-Hay, they can't be erased. And I do not have to say that Yud-Hay is a name by itself, which is the shortened version of the explicit name. But if someone wrote the shin and daled from the name Shadai or the tzadi and beis from the name Tz'vaos they are allowed to be erased.
The other descriptive names to praise the Holy One Blessed Be He, for example: the Gracious, the Merciful, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, the Faithful, the Jealous, the Powerful, and the like, they are like other holy texts and it is permitted to erase them.

Chapter 7

It is of the foundations of religion to know that God makes men receive prophecy and prophecy does not occur to a person unless they are a wise person. Great in knowledge and strong in character traits and it shouldn't be that their inclination takes over them on anything in the world, rather he always overcomes his inclination. And he must have a broad knowledge base that is very correct. A person who is filled with all of these traits, complete in body and when they enter the orchard and get involved in the great ideas that are far away, he will have the correct knowledge to understand and and achieve. And he should be sanctified, and go, and separate from the ways of the rest of the nation that go in the ways of the times... 

Chapter 8

Moses, our teacher, was not believed in by the Jews because of the signs he performed. For one who believes [in anything] because of signs has a defect in his heart since it is possible that a sign was done through trickery and magic. Rather, all the signs that Moses did in the desert were done out of necessity, not to prove of his prophecy. It was necessary to drown the Egyptians, so he split the sea, and he made them sink in it. We needed to be fed, so the manna was brought down [from the sky] for us. They [the rebels] were thirsty so he split the stone for them [and water came forth] for them. The congregation of Korach denied [Moses' authority] so the earth swallowed them. And so too by all the other signs. So why do we believe in him? At Mt. Sinai, that which our eyes saw and not a stranger's, that which our ears heard and not another's, was the fire, the thunder, the lightning, and then [Moses] approached the fog and the voice [of God] spoke to him and we heard "Moses, Moses, go and say to them such and such." And so he said, (Deuteronomy 5:4) "Face to face did God speak with you." And so it says (Deuteronomy 5:3), "God did not make this covenant with our fathers."From where [do we know] that Mt. Sinai alone is proof to [Moses'] prophecy that has no defect? For it says (Exodus 19:9), "Behold, I am coming to you in the thick cloud in order that the nation will hear when I speak to you and also that they will believe in you forever." This implies that before this [event, the Jewish people] did not have a belief in [Moses] that would last forever, rather it was a belief that was speculation and apprehension.
What emerges is that [the Jewish people that Moses] was sent to, were witnesses to his prophecy, that it was true, and [so] he did not need to perform another sign for them. For both him and them were witnesses to the matter, similar to two witnesses that see an occurrence together, that both of them are witnesses that the other is speaking the truth and neither of them have to bring proof to each other. So was Moses our teacher: all of the Jewish people were witnesses regarding him after the revelation at Mt. Sinai and he did not need to perform a sign for them. This is what God said to him at beginning of his prophecy, at the time [God] gave him the signs that he was to perform in Egypt: And God said (Exodus 3:18), "They will listen to your voice." Moses our teacher knew that one who believes because of a sign has fault, suspicion and suspect in his heart. He [attempted to] be removed from going, saying (Exodus 4:1), "They will not believe me," until God informed him that these signs are only until the exodus from Egypt, and after they leave and stand at this mountain, I will remove the suspicion that they suspected after you for I will give you a sign here that it will be known that I really sent you from the beginning, and there will not remain in their hearts any suspicion. This is what the verse [means] when it says (Exodus 3:12), "This will be for you a sign that I sent you, when you take out the nation from Egypt you will worship God on this mountain." The statement emerges that we do not believe every prophet that arose after Moses our teacher solely because of the sign so that it would be said, "If he performs a sign then we will heed anything he says." Rather, it is because of the commandment that Moses commanded in the Torah and said (Deuteronomy 18:15), If a sign is given, "to him you shall listen." [This can be] compared to the commandment that we make a judgement by the word of two witnesses, even though we do not know if their testimony is true or false. Similarly, it is a commandment to listen to this prophet [that has a sign] even though we do not know if it is a true sign or magic and trickery. 
Therefore, if a prophet arises and performs great wonders and miracles and seeks to contradict the prophecy of Moses our teacher, we do not heed him, and we know clearly that those wonders [were performed with] trickery and magic. For, the prophecy of Moses our teacher, is not [based] on the signs [he performed] so we could compare this sign to another [prophet's] sign. Rather, we saw with our eyes and heard with our ears like [Moses] heard. What is [this false prophet] similar to? To witnesses that testify to a man concerning something that he saw with his own eyes, [but they claim to have] seen something different than what this man saw and different from what this man heard, therefore, this man knows with certainty that these are false witnesses. Therefore, the Torah says that if someone comes with signs and wonders, you should not listen to the false prophet's words, because this [false prophet] is bringing you signs and wonders to contradict something that you have seen with your own eyes. And since we only believe in wonders because of the commandments that Moses commanded us, how can we accept this sign that is being brought to contradict the prophecy of Moshe that we saw and we heard? 

Chapter 9

It is obvious, and also explained by the Torah, that the commandments were established forever and ever. They are not to be changed, and should not be added to or diminished, as it says "All this word which I command you, that shall ye observe to do; thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it." (Deut 13:1); and it says "What is revealed is for us and our children forever, to carry out all the words of this Torah." This teaches that we are commanded to fulfill all the Torah's directives forever.  It is also said: "It is an everlasting statute for all your generations," and [Deuteronomy 30:12] states: "It is not in the heavens." This teaches that a prophet can no longer add a new precept [to the Torah]. Therefore, if a person will arise, either from Israel or from the nations, and perform a sign or wonder and say that God sent him to: add a mitzvah, withdraw a mitzvah,  explain a mitzvah in a manner which different than explained by Moses, or if he says that the mitzvot commanded to the Jews are not forever, but rather were given for only that time, he is a false prophet. He comes to oppose the Moses' prophesy and should be executed by strangling, because he intentionally spoke in God's name what God didn't command. The One Whose Name is Blessed commanded Moses that "this commandment is for us and our children forever", and, "[God] is not man that He lies".

Chapter 10


And you check many times, if you find that his words are always true, then he is a true prophet. Like the verse states about Shmuel: "And all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, knew that Samuel had been proven to be a prophet unto God."
