Mishneh Torah, Torah Study



Chapter 1

Women,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 29b derives this concept from the use of the term <i>bineichem</i> - implying one's male offspring - in Deuteronomy 11:19, the verse which commands us to teach Torah to our children. Since others are not obligated to teach women, they are not obligated to study themselves.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:14) quotes this law, but also states that women are obligated to study the laws pertaining to all the mitzvot that they are required to fulfill. (See also <i>Agur, Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2; <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i>, Introduction; and <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> 313.) This includes a large number of mitzvot - e.g., Shabbat, Niddah, and Kashrut - to the extent that many men would be proud if their Torah knowledge encompassed these areas. Furthermore, women are also obligated to perform "spiritual" mitzvot - e.g., to love God, fear Him, and believe in Him. Thus, they must also study those aspects of Torah which relate to these commandments. See also Halachah 13 and its commentary.</i> slaves,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., gentile slaves. The Torah obligations of women and slaves are identical. Furthermore, <i>Ketubot</i> 28a states that a person is forbidden to teach Torah to his slaves.</i> and minors<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The latter are considered as lacking intellectual maturity. Hence, they are under no obligation at all according to Torah law. This concept is so clearly understood that some commentaries maintain that this word should not be included in the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> indeed omits it.</i> are free from the obligation of Torah study.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The question arises: Why does the Rambam begin his discussion of this mitzvah with the mention of those who are not obligated? Why does he not begin with a discussion of the obligation the mitzvah implies?</i> Nevertheless,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">though the son is not, himself, obligated to study</i> a father is obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 11) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 419) count this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to teach his son Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nazir</i> 29a also mentions a Rabbinic obligation to train one's children in the performance of mitzvot. The Rambam mentions this obligation with regard to many of the particular mitzvot - e.g., <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:10, <i>Hilchot Sukkah</i> 6:1 and also with regard to the responsibilities of a guardian, <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 11:10.</i> while he is a minor, as [Deuteronomy 11:19] states: "And you shall teach them to your sons to speak about them."<br>A<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Though this verse mentions teaching Torah only to one's children, the Rambam also maintains that the mitzvah of Torah study includes an adult's study of Torah (<i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>). Nevertheless, he begins his description of the mitzvah with the obligation to teach one's sons, since that is explicitly mentioned in the Torah.<br>It must be noted that <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) derives this mitzvah from a different verse, Deuteronomy 6:7, "And you shall teach them to your sons..."<br>[Homiletically, it is possible to explain that the reason the Torah mentions the commandment to study Torah with regard only to children is to teach us that we must apply ourselves to Torah study with the openness and simple faith of young children.]</i> woman is not obligated to teach her son,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">However, according to some opinions (see <i>Sh'lah, Sha'ar Ha'otiot</i>), she is obligated to train him in the performance of mitzvot.</i> for only those who are obligated to learn are obligated to teach.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is also derived by <i>Kiddushin</i>, <i>ibid.</i> However, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) writes:<br>Nevertheless, it is fitting that a woman endeavor that her children not be of the common people. Even though she is not commanded, she will receive a good reward for her efforts.</i>
Just as a person is obligated to teach his son, so, too, is he obligated to teach his grandson,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">More precisely, the Hebrew should be translated as "your son's son." There is a difference between the obligation one has to one's son's son and one's obligation to one's daughter's son or one's great grandson (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> as [Deuteronomy 4:9] commands: "And you shall teach them to your sons and your grandsons."<br>[Furthermore,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 30a praises the grandfather of Zevulun ben Dan for teaching him "the written law, the Mishnah, the Talmud, halachot, and <i>aggadot</i>."</i> this charge is not confined] to one's children and grandchildren alone. Rather, it is a mitzvah for each and every wise man<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah, Kuntres Acharon</i> 1) states that this applies only to an individual who merits this description. Even a student of Torah is not bound by this obligation until he attains a sufficient degree of knowledge himself.</i> to teach all students, even though they are not his children, as [Deuteronomy 6:7] states: "And you shall teach them to your sons..." The oral tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre, Va'etchanan</i>. The Hebrew, <i>mipi hash’mua</i>, refers to a halachah transmitted by Moses from Mount Sinai for which an allusion can be found in the written law (<i>Yad Malachi</i>).</i> explains: "Your sons," these are your students, for students are also called sons,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See also Chapter 5, Halachah 12, for a different dimension of this comparison.</i> as [II Kings 2:3] states: "And the sons of the prophets went forth."<br>If<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">to greet Elisha at Bet-El. That same narrative (<i>ibid.</i>, 12) relates how Elisha called his teacher, Elijah, "Father, Father." <i>Sanhedrin</i> 68a relates that Rabbi Akiva used the same expression to refer to his teacher, Rabbi Eliezar ben Horkanus.<br>The Rambam's words are quoted from the <i>Sifre</i>. Similarly, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 19b relates, "Whoever teaches his colleague's son Torah is considered as if he sired him."<br>Note <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 7:5, where the Rambam defines more precisely his understanding of the term, "the sons of the prophets."</i> so, why do the commandments<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">cited above</i> [explicitly mention] one's son and grandson? To grant precedence<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See also the following halachah.</i> to one's son over one's grandson, and one's grandson over the son of a colleague.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions whether one is obligated to give precedence to one's other descendants over people at large. However, the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 245:1) and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:8) accept that principle.</i>
Also,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., another difference between one's son and others. According to some editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, this sentence is included in the previous halachah.</i> one is obligated to hire a teacher for one's son,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the source for this ruling. He quotes Rav Yosef Kolon, who explains that since we find that the teachers of children are allowed to charge for their services (Halachah 7), it is obvious that the fathers are required to pay them. Others explain that since the obligation is placed upon a father's person, we may assume that it extends to his financial resources as well.<br>Since a person is obligated to pay for his children's studies, he cannot deduct those costs from the tithe he is required to give to charity. Nevertheless, there is no need to stint in fulfilling this obligation. <i>Beitzah</i> 16a relates that a person's income for the entire year is fixed, with the exception of the money he spends to prepare for the Sabbaths and festivals, and that spent in teaching his sons Torah. With regard to these matters, if he spends more, he will be granted more, and if he spends less, he will be granted less.<br>In addition, once children pass the age of six, the cost of their living expenses can be deducted from one's tithes if their time is being devoted to Torah study (<i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 10:16).<br>The commentaries question whether the obligation to pay for a teacher applies to one's grandson as well. The Maharshal and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) impose such a requirement, while the Radbaz frees one of the obligation.</i> while one is not required to undertake any expense to teach a colleague's son.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">as part of one's obligation to teach Torah. Nevertheless, every Jew is obligated to give charity, and one of the most important priorities (particularly, at present) for charity is the education of children. (See Ramah, <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 163:3; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:3.)</i><br>A person who was not instructed by his father is obligated to arrange for his own instruction<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">even if it involves an expense (See Halachah 7.)</i> when he can understand,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tzemach Tzedek</i> (<i>Piskei Dinim</i>) notes that the Rambam does not state "when he matures and can understand," and questions whether, in this unique instance, the Torah has placed an obligation on a minor.</i> as [Deuteronomy 5:1] states: "And you shall study them and take heed to perform them."<br>Similarly, in every place, one finds that study takes precedence over deed,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the performance of mitzvot. <i>Kiddushin</i> 40b relates that:<br>Rabbi Tarfon and the elders were dining in the loft of Bet Nitzah in Lod. This question was asked before them: Is study greater or is deed greater?Rabbi Tarfon replied: "Deed is greater."Rabbi Akiva replied: "Study is greater."All of them replied: "Study is greater..."</i> for study brings about deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries explain that Rabbi Tarfon maintains that a Jew's ultimate goal in life is the fulfillment of God's will as revealed in the mitzvot. By performing the mitzvot, a person steps beyond his humanity and performs Godly acts, thus establishing a connection with God's essence.<br>Rabbi Akiva maintains that study is also a mitzvah, and thus, by doing so, one also fulfills God's will. Furthermore, through study a person can internalize his connection to Godliness and reveal the connection to Him, not only in the realm of deed, but also in thought.<br>The Sages maintain that a person must be complete in both deed and study. Therefore, study has an advantage, for study leads to deed. In particular, this applies to a person who has never studied (see <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) for, unless he studies, he will never be able to perform the mitzvot properly.</i> However, deed does not bring about study.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This clause is the Rambam's own addition to the above Talmudic passage.</i>
If a person wants to study Torah and he has a son whom he should teach Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">and his financial capability allows only one of them to study.</i> his [study] takes priority over [that of] his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 29b relates that Rav Acha bar Ya'akov sent his son to study under Abbaye's tutelage. When his son returned, he saw that the son had not mastered his subject matter. Rav Acha told him, "Remain here, and I will go study."<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah, Kuntres Acharon</i> 1) limits this license, noting that a father has no right to ignore his son's Torah education entirely, regardless of his own ability for advancement. Rather, this applies after the son has gained a basis of Torah knowledge and seeks to continue his studies.</i> If his son is wiser and a more creative thinker and thus capable of understanding what he studies more than he [himself] is, his son is given priority.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">even though the father has not received any grounding in Torah study (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:7).</i><br>Even though his son is granted priority, he should not neglect [his own studies].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rather, he should establish fixed times for Torah study</i> For just as he is commanded to teach his son, he is commanded to teach himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., though enabling one's son to study and studying by oneself are included in the same mitzvah, a person cannot fulfill his obligation solely through facilitating his son's study. Rather, he must set aside time to learn himself, because the mitzvah is twofold in nature (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
A person should always<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., even if he is older than seventeen (the age, which according to the Rambam's interpretation, the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 5:22, suggests for marriage, <i>Merchevet HaMishneh</i>)</i> study Torah and, afterwards, marry.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 15:2-3, the Rambam writes that the mitzvah of studying Torah is sufficient cause to postpone the mitzvah of having children. Furthermore, even if one's desire to study is so great that one never marries, it is not considered a sin.</i> If he marries first, his mind will not be free for study.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">"With a millstone around his neck, will he be able to occupy himself in Torah study!" (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29b).</i> However, if his natural inclination overcomes him to the extent that his mind is not free,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">and he is continually preoccupied with sexual thoughts. Concerning these, <i>Yoma</i> 29a teaches: "The thoughts of sin are more severe than sin itself."</i> he should marry, and then study Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">consoling himself with the knowledge that he will still be able to study for two or three years before his financial burden becomes great (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:1,2).</i>
At what age is a father obligated to teach [his son]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Though <i>Avot</i> 5:22 states: "At five, one should begin the study of Scripture," the Rambam, based on <i>Sukkah</i> 42a, explains that certain elements of a child's study must begin earlier.</i> Torah?<br>When he<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">the child</i> begins to speak, he<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">the father</i> should teach him<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">how to use that potential for Torah study. Two verses are selected as being of fundamental importance.</i> <i>Torah tzivah lanu Moshe...</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">"The Torah Moses commanded us is the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob." This verse emphasizes the fundamental connection a Jew has to Torah. As soon as an heir is born, he becomes the legal owner of the inheritance left to him. Thus, since the Torah is every Jew's inheritance, as soon as a child is born he acquires his full share. (See also Chapter 3, Halachah 1.)</i> (Deuteronomy 33:4) and <i>Shema Yisrael<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">"Hear Israel, God is our Lord, God is One." This verse emphasizes the fundamental unity between God and creation, teaching us, not only that there is only one God, but also that all creation is at one with Him.<br>The <i>Menorat HaMaor</i> and Rashi (Deuteronomy 11:19 emphasize that the child need not understand the verses he is reciting. The recitation of these verses refines his power of speech and makes lasting impressions on his thinking processes, even though he is unaware of their intellectual message.</i>...</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 6:4).<br>Afterwards, he should teach him [selected verses],<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">each containing significant lessons</i> little by little, verse by verse, until he is six or seven<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">until this age, the child lacks sufficient maturity to apply himself to his studies diligently (<i>Bava Batra</i> 21a).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> 2:2 explains that this decision is no contradiction to the Mishnah in <i>Avot</i> quoted above. The latter can be interpreted to mean "after completing five years" - i.e., at the beginning of the sixth year. However, the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> (Positive Commandment 12) interprets the injunction from <i>Avot</i> to mean that when the child becomes five, his father teaches him to read at home, and when he becomes six or seven, he is taken to school. It is also possible to interpret the Rambam's words in this fashion.<br>[Indeed, that interpretation is more likely. Thought the above mentioned mishnah states: "at eighteen, one should marry," the Rambam (<i>Hilchut Ishut</i> 15:2) states a man is obligated to marry at the age of seventeen. Thus, we see that he interprets the different clauses of the Mishnah to mean "in his)...th year, one should..."]</i> - depending on his health<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tosafot, Bava Batra</i>, <i>ibid.</i></i> - [at which time] he should take him<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 30a relates that the Sages would physically take their children to their teachers.</i> to a teacher of young children.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">where the child will begin the study of the written Torah in an organized fashion. <i>Bava Batra</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) relates that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Gamla established a fixed ruled requiring all parents to take their children to teachers at this time. (See Chapter 2, Halachot 1 and 2 for further elaboration.)</i>
If it is local custom for a teacher of young children to take payment, he should be paid.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">as stated in Halachah 3.</i> [The father] is obligated to pay for his instruction until he can read the entire<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kovetz</i> and other commentaries explain that this word was added to include the works of the prophets and the holy writings (i.e., the entire <i>T'nach</i>). Rashi (<i>Bava Batra</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) is not of this opinion, and maintains that teaching the five books of Moses is sufficient. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 245:5) follows the latter opinion, while <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:1) quotes the former view.</i> written Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo notes that the Rambam's language implies that this constitutes the totality of a father's obligation, and he is not obligated to instruct his son in the Oral Law. In the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 245:6), he explains that a father's obligation also includes arranging for his son's instruction in the Oral Law, unless his financial situation is too pressing to allow him to do so.</i><br>In a place where it is customary to receive a wage for teaching the written Torah, one is permitted to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 37a relates that the wage a teacher receives is not for his actual tutelage, but rather for the effort involved in caring for the children. Alternatively, the money can be taken for teaching the proper cantillation notes. [At that time, there were few if any written texts, and the students were taught the entire Torah by heart.]<br>The difference between the two opinions is that according to the latter, one may also charge adults. Since the Rambam allows a wage to be charged without qualifying his words, one may assume that this applies even to teaching adults. This decision can also be derived from his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Nedarim</i> 4:3.</i> However, it is forbidden to take a wage for teaching the Oral Law,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary on <i>Nedarim</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rabbenu Nissim quotes the Jerusalem Talmud, which allows a teacher of Torah to receive compensation for the fact that were he not to teach, he could occupy himself in another profession which would yield him profit. The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> develops this matter further, noting that <i>Ketubot</i> 106a relates that the Temple treasury would pay people to instruct the priests regarding the laws of ritual slaughter. He also notes that authors of works of Torah scholarship are allowed to demand pay for their services. These ideas are quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:5).<br>Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that the Rambam would accept such an opinion. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), he writes:<br>According to our Torah, it is in no way permitted to take a wage for teaching any one of the Torah's professions...I am amazed at the men of stature who, aroused by desire, denied the truth and had wages designated for themselves for Torah decisions and teachings, using flimsy supports.<br>See also the citation from the Rambam's commentary on <i>Avot</i> below.</i> as [implied by Deuteronomy 4:5]: "Behold, I have taught you laws and statutes, as God commanded me."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, interprets that verse to mean that Moses told the people:</i> [Our Sages teach that Moses was implying:] Just as I learned at no cost,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">when God instructed me,</i> so, too, have you been taught from me at no cost.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., "I have taught you" at no cost, "as God commanded (i.e., taught) me" at no cost. Moses continues, commanding the people to emulate his example</i> Teach the coming generations in a like manner. Teach them at no cost as you have learned from<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Though the resulting decision is the same, the Rambam's interpretation of this passage differs slightly from Rabbenu Asher's and Rabbenu Nissim's.</i> me."<br>[Nevertheless,] if a person cannot find someone to teach him at no cost, he must pay for his studies, as [implied by Proverbs 23:23]: "Buy truth."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., Torah</i> May he charge to teach others? We learn [<i>ibid.</i>]: "but do not sell." Thus, it can be derived that it is forbidden to charge to teach Torah even though one's teacher charged to instruct him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam interprets <i>Avot</i> 4:7, which states: 'Do not make it (the Torah) an axe to chop with...' do not consider it a medium with which to derive a livelihood." He continues elaborating on how it is both undesirable - and forbidden - to derive benefit from Torah study or its instruction:<br>Some people thought foolishly that it is obligatory and fitting to support the wise men and students...who occupy themselves in Torah study...This is all erroneous. No source in the Torah or in the words of the Sages can be found to...support it.Among the Sages [of the Talmud], one does not find that they asked for money from other people. They did not receive any funding for their precious and glorious Yeshivot...Heaven forbid to say that those generations were not generous and did not give charity. Had a poor person stretched out his hand, they would have filled it with gold and pearls. But the poor person did not do so; rather, he was satisfied with what he could earn in his profession, whether a little or a lot...Hillel the Elder was a wood-chopper who would study before Shemayah and Avtalion and live in extreme poverty. He was so great that his students were compared to Moses and Aaron...There is no doubt that if he had taught the people to give him benefit, they would not have allowed him to continue chopping trees...The Sages would not allow themselves to take money from people. They considered taking such funds as a desecration of God's name in public, because the people would thus consider Torah as similar to any other profession and come to scorn it.<br>See also Chapter 3, Halachot 10 and 11.</i>
Every Jewish man is obligated to study Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the second aspect of the mitzvah of Torah study; studying oneself.</i> whether he is poor or rich,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 35b declares: "Hillel obligates the poor [in Torah study], Rabbi Eleazar ben Chersom obligates the rich." <br>The Talmud elaborates: Hillel would work and earn a <i><i>tarp'eick</i> </i>[a coin of little value] daily. Half he would give to the watchman at the Hall of Study, and half he would use for his livelihood and that of his family. One day he could not find work. The watchman at the entrance did not let him enter and so he hung himself over the window to hear "the words of the living God" from Shemayah and Avtalion.<br>In contrast, Rabbi Eleazar ben Chersom was extremely wealthy: His father left him one thousand villages on land and one thousand ships at sea. Each day, he would take a sack of flour on his shoulders and go from city to city to study Torah...Throughout his entire life, he did not go to see them [the villages and the ships], but rather sat and studied Torah the entire day and night.</i> whether his body is healthy and whole or afflicted by difficulties,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i><i>Bava Metzia</i></i> 84b relates that Rabbi Elazar ben Shimon was afflicted by severe physical difficulties.

However, even a person who does not make such an all-encompassing commitment to Torah must find time for study despite his family responsibilities.</i> he must establish a fixed time for Torah study during the day and at night, as [Joshua 1:8] commands: "You shall think about it day and night."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">There are two aspects to Torah study:a) One which requires total devotion, dedicating all of one's time and effort to Torah, because "the study of Torah has no limit." Though it is fitting for each Jew to apply himself to Torah study in this fashion, such a practice cannot be required of a person. Rather, this remains a voluntary decision to be made by a person, to quote Chapter 3, Halachah 6, "whose heart inspires him to fulfill this mitzvah in a fitting manner and to become crowned with the crown of Torah."b) The establishment of fixed times for Torah study. Regardless of the responsibilities and difficulties a person may have, he is obligated to set aside a certain portion of his day for Torah study.<br>On Joshua 1:8, which commands "This Torah shall not depart from your mouth" and Deuteronomy 11:14, which relates how "you will collect your grain, your wine, and your oil," implying an involvement in work and commerce.<br>Rabbi Yishmael explains that a person should follow "the way of the world," involving himself in work and devoting only part of his energies to Torah study. In contrast, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai exclaims: "If a person will plow in the plowing season, sow in the sowing season,...what will happen to the Torah! Rather, when the Jews do God's will, their work is performed by others."<br>The Talmud concludes: Many followed Rabbi Yishmael's advice and were successful. Many followed Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai's advice and were not successful.<br>Though the complete and total dedication demanded by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is beyond the reach of all at present, the passage is useful in order to appreciate two different approaches to the obligation of Torah study:a) That of Rabbi Yishmael, who sees it as a responsibility to be considered within the context of our daily activities;b) That of Rabbi Shimon, who sees Torah study as the paramount aspect of a person's life, to which he should be devoted without considering the demands of his financial position.</i>
The greater Sages of Israel included wood choppers,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Many, including the Rambam (Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 4:7), cite the example of Hillel. However, as of yet, there is no explicit Talmudic or Midrashic source which states that Hillel was occupied in this profession. <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> (Chapter 6) states that Rabbi Akiva was so employed.</i> water drawers,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketubot</i> 105a states that Rav Huna earned his livelihood in this manner</i> and blind men.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Yosef and Rav Sheshet, two of the more prominent <i>Amoraim</i>, were so afflicted (<i>Pesachim</i> 116b).</i> Despite these [difficulties],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See the commentary on Halachah 7, and on Chapter 3, Halachot 9-11.</i> they were occupied with Torah study day and night and were included among those who transmitted the Torah's teachings from [master] to [student in the chain stretching back to] Moses, our teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam lists the chain of teachers who transmitted Torah from generation to generation.

Until when is a person obligated to study Torah? Until the day he dies,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 83b states that even when a person feels death approaching, he should not neglect his Torah studies.</i> as [Deuteronomy 4:9] states: "Lest you remove it from your heart, <i>all</i> the days of your life."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The failure to study can be considered as "removing" one's previous study from one's heart because...</i> Whenever a person is not involved with study, he forgets.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chaggigah</i> 15a states: "The words of Torah are as difficult to acquire as gold vessels, and as easy to lose as glass utensils." <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> 24:6 elaborates on how easy it is to forget one's Torah knowledge.<br>Deuteronomy 4:9 states: "Be extremely careful... lest you forget these things." The <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i>, the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Kattan</i>, and others consider this as one of the Torah's 613 commandments, prohibiting forgetting the Torah one has studied. (See also <i>Menachot</i> 99b, Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura on <i>Avot</i> 3:10 and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 2:4-10.) The Rambam does not include this as one of the Torah's prohibitions in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, nor does he explicitly mention the prohibition in our halachot. Nevertheless, it is possible to explain that he considers this charge as part of the command to study Torah for one's entire life explained in this halachah.</i>
A person is obligated to divide his study time in three: one third should be devoted to the Written Law; one third to the Oral Law;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., <i>Mishnah</i>. This is not intended to mean only the <i>Mishnah</i> authored by Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi per se, but rather "halachic decisions without being concerned with their motivating principles" (Rashi, <i>Sotah</i> 22a). As is obvious from his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, where he defines it as "a collection of the entire Oral Law," the Rambam desired that his <i>Mishneh Torah</i> serve this purpose.<br>According to <i>Siftei Cohen, Choshen Mishpat</i> 25:7, the term <i>Mishnah</i> applies to the halachic decisions of contemporary authorities as well.

How is the above expressed?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin, ibid.</i>, asks this question, noting that, on the surface, it is impossible to divide one's years in three, since no one knows how long he will live.<br>There, the Talmud explains that one must divide "one's days."

Thus, these statements teach us what would be considered a commonplace division of one's time in the Rambam's age.</i> In those nine hours, he should spend three reading the Written Law; three, the Oral Law; and three, meditating with his intellect to derive one concept from another.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., <i>Gemara</i>; dividing his daily study sessions equally among these three areas of study.</i><br>The "words of the prophetic tradition"<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">the remainder of the Bible - i.e., the works of the prophets and the holy writings.</i> are considered part of the Written Law;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 5a relates that the entire <i>T'nach</i> has its source in the revelation at Sinai.

In response to the same question, <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 30a explains that the study of the Babylonian Talmud also fulfills that directive, because it combines all three areas of study in a single text.<br>At present, this pattern of study is not followed even in the early stages of a child's learning. Note the Maharal of Prague, <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>, Chapter 56, and the <i>Sh'lah, Masechet Shavuot</i>, who complain that the advice given in <i>Avot</i> 5:22: "At five, to the study of the Written Law; at ten, to the study of the Mishnah; and at fifteen, to the study of the Gemara" is not generally followed.<br>The basis for this departure can be explained in terms of two differences that exist between our contemporary circumstances and the situation which prevailed in Talmudic times:a) During the Talmudic era, written texts were rare, and it was necessary for a student to commit all his subject matter to memory. Thus, the emphasis was on teaching students by rote.b) Hebrew was a spoken language and, therefore, it was not necessary to spend time teaching the children the meaning of the subject matter.<br>At present, the major emphasis is on teaching learning skills and developing a student's powers of comprehension with the understanding that once one knows how to study, since the texts are easily available, he will be able to apply himself to the actual study at his convenience. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:6, 11; <i>Eglei Tal</i>, Introduction.)</i> However, when a person increases his knowledge and does not have the need to read the Written Law, or occupy himself with the Oral Law constantly,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">because he has already mastered them</i> he should study the Written Law and the oral tradition at designated times. Thus, he will not forget any aspect of the laws of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">as mentioned above, a lack of review will cause an individual to forget what he has already learned.</i> [However,] he should focus his attention<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">primarily</i> on the <i>Gemara</i> alone for his entire life,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">choosing the subject matter and the allocation of his time...</i> according to his ambition and his ability to concentrate.
A woman who studies Torah will receive reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">for her efforts.</i> However, that reward will not be [as great] as a man's, since she was not commanded [in this mitzvah]. Whoever performs a deed which he is not commanded to do, does not receive as great a reward as one who performs a mitzvah that he is commanded to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 31a explains that a person who is commanded to perform a mitzvah will be more conscious of his obligation and try to fulfill it more fastidiously than a person who performs the same act voluntarily.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Chassidic thought explains the concept differently. The Hebrew word <i>mitzvah</i> (commandment) shares the same root as the word <i>tzavtah</i> (connection). Fulfilling the commandments establishes a transcendent bond with Godliness. In contrast, a good deed that is not commanded, no matter how worthy, remains an act of man and does not establish such a connection.</i><br> Even though she will receive a reward, the Sages commanded that a person should not teach his daughter Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There is no explicit source for the Rambam's statements, though one may draw such a conclusion from <i>Sotah</i> 20a. That passage relates that one prominent sage, ben Azzai, did not share this opinion.<br>As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, the Rabbis require a woman to study the laws governing the mitzvot which she is obligated to fulfill. Based on that decision, many commentaries explain that the Rambam's statements refer only to intensive study of the subject matter described as <i>Gemara</i> in the previous halachot.</i> because most women<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Commentaries have mentioned that by adding the word "most," the Rambam implies that if a father sees that his daughter is capable of such study, he should afford her the opportunity.</i> cannot concentrate their attention on study, and thus transform the words of Torah into idle matters because of their lack of understanding.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes the contrast between the first clause, "A woman who studies," and the command the Sages gave "a father." He differentiates between study that a woman undertakes voluntarily, which is considered desirable, and a father's training his daughter in matters which are not necessarily relevant to her.</i><br>[Thus,] our Sages declared:<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 21b</i> "Whoever teaches his daughter Torah is like one who teaches her tales and parables."<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sotah</i> 3:3). From <i>Sotah</i> 21b, it would appear that <i>tiflos</i> (translated as “idle matters”) could be understood as "romance." The Meiri renders it as "vanity," explaining that a woman who has studied will boast of her achievements.</i> This applies to the Oral Law. [With regard to] the Written Law: at the outset, one should not teach one's daughter. However, if one teaches her, it is not considered as if she was taught idle things.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Though the Rambam's statements are quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:6), the source for his statements has been questioned.<br>Some point to the Mishnah, <i>Nedarim</i> 3:3, which, in passing, mentions a daughter's study of the Written Law. However, the Rambam's own text of that Mishnah lacks the words "or daughter." Others point to <i>Chaggigah</i> 3a (and more specifically, to the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>ibid.</i> 1:1), which describes the reading of the Torah by the king during the <i>Hakhel</i> celebration, which women were also required to attend. Nevertheless, there is a difference between study of the Written Law in its entirety and hearing the reading of a few inspirational passages. (See <i>Taz</i> 246:4.)<br>In this context, it might be noted that the <i>Tur's</i> text of the Rambam reverses these statements and mentioned teaching women the Oral Law as preferable to the Written Law. This can easily be reconciled with the opinions mentioned above, which require a woman to learn the laws governing the mitzvot she is obligated to fulfill. In contrast, the Written Law is a less closely defined field of study. There, a greater possibility exists that a woman who is not gifted may misinterpret the teachings.</i>

Chapter 2

Teachers of small children should be appointed in each and every land, in each and every region, and in each and every village.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 21a declares: Remember that man for good! Yehoshua ben Gamla is his name. Were it not for him, the Torah would have been forgotten by the Jewish people.Originally, a person who had a father would be instructed by him, while a person who had no father would not be instructed...[Afterwards,] they instituted [the practice of] employing teachers of young children in Jerusalem [as implied by the verse]: "From Zion shall go forth the Torah."Nevertheless, whoever had a father would be taken [to Jerusalem], while one who did not have a father would not be taken. [Therefore,] they instituted [the practice of] employing teachers in every region. They would begin study at sixteen or at seventeen. However, if a [student's] teacher were angry with him, he would scoff at him and leave. [This situation persisted] until Yehoshua ben Gamla came and instituted [the practice of] employing teachers of young children in each and every land, in each and every region, and in each and every village. They would bring them [to the schools] at the age of six or seven. This practice was continued in the subsequent generations. Even though the dispersion of the Jewish people and the subjugation to the gentile powers made the management of their communal affairs more difficult, throughout the ages we find references to the establishment of communal programs of education in both the codes of Jewish law and the chronicles of Jewish history. (See Ramah, <i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, 163:3; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:3.)<br>Originally, it was customary for the community to impose taxes to pay for the education of all the children, whether their parents were rich or poor.

In contrast, in these halachot the Rambam deals primarily with the importance of Torah study. Hence, he quotes a verse which emphasizes how important the increase of Torah study is (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. VI, p. 299).</i>

Similarly, on the verse from Deuteronomy quoted below, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 59a comments: "It is our inheritance and not theirs."<br>[Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that the same passage in <i>Sanhedrin</i> also describes the high levels which a gentile can attain by studying the rules of the seven general laws of human behavior given to Noah and his descendants. All Jews are obligated to assist the gentiles in this study.

Because of the fundamental message implied by this verse, the Rambam chooses to quote it, rather than the verse mentioned in <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan, ibid.</i> Similarly, the message conveyed by this verse is so important that it is taught to every Jewish child as soon as he learns to talk (Chapter 1, Halachah 6).<br>Nevertheless, although, as the above verse implies, each Jew has an inherent connection to Torah, effort must be expended in order to reveal and develop that connection. In that vein, <i>Avot</i> 2:15 counsels: "Prepare yourself to study Torah, for it is not an inheritance." Therefore, the Rambam continues...</i> Whoever desires<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 4:17, the Rambam relates the content of this halachah and uses the expression: "Whoever desires to be crowned with the crown of Torah."</i> may<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">fulfill the directives mentioned in this chapter, and thus...</i> come and take it.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">come and take it.</i><br> Lest you say that the other crowns surpass the crown of Torah, [Proverbs 8:15-16] states: "By me, kings reign, princes decree justice,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">the latter clause is omitted in many manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i> and nobles rule."

Thus, we can appreciate that the crown of Torah surpasses the crown of royalty.

When he heard this, Rabbi Abahu rebuked his son severely, "Is it because there are no graves in Caesarea that I sent you to Tiberias?"<br><i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 9b derives the priority of study over the performance of mitzvot as follows:<br>Proverbs 3:15 states: "None of your desires can be equated to it [the Torah]," implying that "your desires" - i.e., things which man wants - cannot be equated to Torah study, but "God's desires" - i.e., the mitzvot - can be equated with it.<br>In contrast, Proverbs 8:11 states: "No desire" - seemingly implying even God's desires, the mitzvot - "can be equated to it." How can the two be resolved? When it is possible for the mitzvah to be performed by another individual, nothing takes precedence over Torah study. However, if there is no one else to perform the mitzvah, the performance of the mitzvah is given priority.</i> If not,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If there is no way the mitzvah can be performed by another person - e.g., paying honor to a deceased person or collecting for charity, when one's position will cause one's words to have a greater effect than those of other people...</i> he should perform the mitzvah,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 17a teaches: "The ultimate of knowledge is Teshuvah and good deeds."

Thus, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:2) relates that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who would not interrupt his studies even for prayer, would stop studying to build a sukkah and to bind his lulav.<br> The rationale behind the above statements can be explained as follows: As explained in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 3, the ultimate level of fulfillment man can reach is to step beyond his humanity and fulfill God's will, as revealed in the mitzvot. Nevertheless, priority is given to Torah study, because it possesses a twofold advantage over the other mitzvot: first, it leads to their fulfillment; second, it allows for an internalized connection to be established between the person and God. However, when the person ignores the fulfillment of the mitzvot, both those advantages are lost. Obviously, the study does not lead to deed, and, furthermore, his intellectual activity appears to be a matter of personal interest and not a process of connection to God.</i> and then return to his studies.
The first aspect of a person's judgement [in the world to come] will center on Torah study.

Other sources (<i>Shabbat</i> 31a) state that the first question posed to a person in the world to come will be: "Did you deal faithfully in business?"<br><i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> <i>ibid.</i>, offers two possible resolutions to this apparent contradiction:a) A person who never studied at all is judged first regarding Torah study. However, one who studied, but did not establish fixed times for study is judged first regarding his business affairs;b) Even though the first question that the soul is asked centers on his business affairs, the first retribution he will receive will result from his neglect of Torah study.</i><br>Accordingly, our Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Pesachim</i> 50b, <i>Sotah</i> 22b, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 105b.</i> would say: "A person should always occupy himself in Torah study, whether for God's sake or even if not for God's sake,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam elaborates further on the definition of these concepts in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 10:4-5:<br>The Sages of the previous generations declared: Should one say: "I will study Torah in order that I become wealthy, in order that I be called a Rabbi, or in order that I receive reward in the world to come?"

[Desire His commandments] and not the reward [that comes from] His commandments...Anyone who occupies himself with the Torah in order to receive reward or in order to protect himself from retribution is considered as one who is not occupied for God's sake.[In contrast,] anyone who occupies himself with it, not because of fear, nor to receive a reward, but rather because of his love for the Lord of the entire earth, Who commanded it, is one who occupies himself for God's sake.</i> for from [the study of Torah which] is not carried out for God's sake<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 17a) and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Ta'anit</i> 7a) note that the Talmud is extremely critical of those who do not occupy themselves with the Torah for God's sake.<br><i>Ta'anit</i> 7a declares that whenever a person does not study Torah for God's sake, the Torah becomes a deadly potion for him. <i>Berachot</i> 17a states that it would have been better for a person who does not study Torah for God's sake not to have been born.

If a Jew frequently occupies himself with Torah, the inner Godly nature of Torah will eventually have an effect upon him and motivate him to serve God with the proper intentions.<br>There is a deeper aspect to this statement: The Hebrew <i>mitoch</i>, translated as "from," also can be interpreted as "from the inner part." Every element of a Jew's life is motivated by his Godly potential. Though he may think he is performing a mitzvah for selfish intent, the inner core of that service, its <i>toch</i>, is the Jew's desire to cling to God without any ulterior motive.<br>The Rambam elaborates on the principle that selfish desires can be used as motivation for involvement in Torah in his Commentary on the Mishnah, in his introduction to the tenth chapter of <i>Sanhedrin</i>:<br>When a young child is brought to a teacher to be taught the Torah, this is the greatest good for him, [allowing him] to attain fulfillment. However, because of his youth and underdeveloped intellect, [the child] does not comprehend this good...Therefore, it is necessary for the teacher...to motivate him to his studies with things that he loves...He should tell him: "I will give you nuts, figs, or a little honey." It is out of this motivation that the child [begins to] study. [The child studies] not because of the essence of the study, for the child has no comprehension of that, but because of the food. Eating these delicacies is more important to him than the actual study...When he becomes older and his intellect grows to the point where he realizes the worthlessness of these items, he should be encouraged and motivated to learn by the promise of things he holds dear. His teacher should tell him: "Study and I will buy you nice shoes or beautiful garments." Thus, he will study, not for the sake of the study itself, but for the garment, the garment becoming more valuable for him than the Torah...<br>The Rambam continues mentioning other factors that may be employed to motivate older children - e.g., money or honor. He concludes:<br>All this is degrading. Nevertheless, because of the limits of a person's intellect, it may be necessary to make the goal of wisdom something other than wisdom.<br>In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also emphasizes how a teacher must slowly mold a child's character and lead him, step by step, to an appreciation of the proper motives for the service of God:<br>As their knowledge grows and their wisdom increases, this secret [service of God for His sake] should be revealed to them [slowly,] bit by bit. They should become accustomed to this concept gradually, until they grasp it and know it and begin serving [God] out of love.</i>

If the teacher [desires] to instruct the students personally, he is entitled to do so. If he [desires to] teach through the medium of a spokesman,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion between the commentaries regarding the function of this individual. Rashi, <i>Yoma</i> 20b, considers him to be a translator, and, indeed, that is the literal meaning of the term <i>metargaman</i>. In Babylon and even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the popular spoken language was Aramaic, while many of the Sages preferred to teach in Hebrew. Therefore, they would speak to the spokesman in a hushed tone in Hebrew, and he would translate the teachings to Aramaic and teach them to the public in a loud voice.<br>Others maintain that the spokesman was no more than a "human microphone." Rather than have the sage weary himself in speaking in a tone which all could hear, he would speak softly, and the spokesman would speak in a tone that all could hear. This opinion is supported by certain passages (e.g., <i>Kiddushin</i> 31b), which refer to the spokesman as <i>amoriyah</i>, which is the Aramaic for <i>metargaman</i>.<br>The Ra'avad mentions a third perspective, explaining that the spokesman also communicated the teacher's words in a manner that could be understood and grasped by the students. Rabbi Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch follows a similar, but not identical, view. In <i>Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashanah</i> 5666, he elaborates on this concept in detail, explaining that the teacher was on too high a level to explain his ideas in a manner which the common people could understand. Therefore, he would employ a spokesman, who, though he was able to comprehend the teacher's statements, was on a level that his explanations would not be too sophisticated for the people to grasp. (See also <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 7:12, 9:24.)<br>The use of a spokesman was also a sign of honor and respect for the teacher.

The requirement to show an extra degree of respect to one's own teacher can be derived from the example of Rabbi Eliezer, who showed such deference to his teacher, Rabbi Yochanan (<i>Yoma</i> 53a).</i><br>A person is obligated to visit his teacher during the festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 27b relates:<br>An incident occurred concerning Rabbi Ellai, who journeyed to visit his teacher, Rabbi Eliezer, in Lod during a festival.He told him: "Ellai, you are not one of those who rests on the festivals,". Rabbi Eliezer would say: "I praise the lazy ones who do not leave their homes during the festivals, because it is written: 'And you shall rejoice on your festivals.’“That is unacceptable, because Rabbi Yitzchak taught: What is the source for the obligation that a person has to visit his teacher on the festival, it is written: "Why are you going to him today? It is not a day of rest or a new moon." From this we can infer that on a day of rest and on the new moon, a person is obligated to visit his teacher.There is no difficulty: the [latter reference] applies when he can go back and forth in one day.<br>The Rambam interprets Rabbi Yitzchak's statement simply, because, in a number of other instances (<i>Sukkah</i> 10b, 26a), the Talmud relates how students would visit their teachers on festivals.<br>The <i>Nodah Biyhudah, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. II, Responsum 94, notes that this law is not quoted by the <i>Tur</i> or the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>. Therefore, he explains that it applies only in the time of the Temple. In contrast, at present, since the Temple is destroyed and the festival pilgrimages are no longer made, it is improper to make a special visit to one's teacher. Doing so would imply that one is showing him greater deference than is shown the Divine Presence.<br>This view is not accepted by many commentators. Indeed, the Talmudic references to visiting one's teacher during the festival cited above took place in the period after the destruction of the Temple. Based on the statement quoted in Halachah 1, "Your fear for your teacher should be equivalent to your fear of Heaven," <i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> explains that there is a parallel between a visit to one's teacher and a pilgrimage to the Temple.</i>

Rabbi Yochanan complained to him that his student, Rabbi Eliezer, never made statements in his name.<br>Rabbi Ya'akov told him that there was a precedent to such behavior. Rabbi Meir would quote teachings in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, but would not quote teachings in the name of Rabbi Akiva, his teacher.Rabbi Yochanan answered that there was nothing wrong with that, because everyone knew that Rabbi Meir was Rabbi Akiva's disciple, and most of his teachings came from him.<br>Rabbi Ya'akov explained that the same concept applied at present: "Everyone knows that Rabbi Eliezer is your disciple, and that most of his teachings are yours."<br>Thus, were a student to mention a concept without mentioning its source, it is likely for the listeners to assume that it was authored by his teacher.

Chapter 7

Even though a sage who is distinguished for his wisdom, the <i>nasi</i>, or the <i>av beit din</i> acts shamefully, they should never be publically placed under a ban of ostracism unless their deeds resemble those of Jeroboam ben Nevat and his colleagues. However, if one [of these individuals] performs other sins, he should be lashed privately, as [implied by Hoshea 4:5]: “You shall stumble during the day and the prophet will stumble with you at night” - i.e., even though he stumbles, cover him like night. He is told: “Preserve your honor and stay at home.”<br>Similarly, whenever a Torah sage is obligated to be ostracized, it is forbidden for a court to act rashly and pronounce a ban hastily. Instead, they should shun the matter and try to avoid it. The pious among the Sages would be proud of the fact that they never participated in the ostracism of a Torah sage. Nevertheless, they would participate in sentencing him to be lashed. They would even participate in sentencing him to receive “stripes for rebellion.”
How is the ban [issued]? The [court] pronounces: “So and so shall be ostracized. If the ban is issued in his presence, [the court] pronounces: “This [person], so and so, shall be ostracized.”<br>A ban of excommunication [is issued as follows]: They tell him: “So and so is excommunicated.”<br>The expression “He is cursed” implies a curse, an oath, and a ban of ostracism.
How is a ban of ostracism or excommunication lifted? They tell him: “You are released. You are forgiven.” If the ban is lifted outside his presence, they say: “So and so is released. So and so is forgiven.”
What are the practices that must be observed by the person who is ostracized and those who come into contact with him?<br>a) he is forbidden to cut his hair or launder his clothes, like a mourner throughout his entire period of ostracism;<br>b) he is not included in a <i>zimmun,</i> nor in a quorum of ten with regard to any matter that requires ten;<br>c) no one should sit within four cubits of him.<br>He may, however, teach others and others may teach him. He may be hired and may hire others. If he dies while under ban, the court sends [an emissary who] places a stone on his coffin, as if to say that they are stoning him because he was separated from the community. Needless to say, eulogies are not recited for him, nor is his bier accompanied.
A person who is excommunicated has even more [severe restrictions]. He may not teach others and others may not teach him. Nevertheless, he may study himself, so that he does not forget what he has learned.<br>He may not be hired, nor is he allowed to hire others. We should not engage in trade with him. [Indeed,] we should not have any business dealings with him except the bare minimum necessary for his livelihood.
When a person was ostracized for thirty days and did not seek to be released from the ban, he is placed under a second ban. If he was ostracized for a second thirty days without seeking release, he is excommunicated.
How many [people] are necessary to release [a person from a] ban of ostracism or excommunication? Three. They may even be commoners. A single judge with unique expertise may release [a person from a] ban of ostracism or excommunication alone. A student may release [a person from a] ban of ostracism or excommunication even in the place of his teacher.

When three individuals issue a ban of ostracism, and then depart, if the person who was ostracized improves his behavior with regard to the matter for which he was ostracized, three others may come and release him [from that ban].
A person who does not know who placed him under a ban of ostracism should approach the <i>nasi</i> who may release him from that ban.
If a ban was issued conditionally, even if one imposed that [conditional ban] on himself, it must be nullified [before ordinary interaction with the person is permitted]. If a Torah sage issued a ban of ostracism against himself, even if he made that ban conditional on the consent of another person and even if he issued it because of a matter which requires ostracism, he may nullify the ban himself.
Whenever a person dreams that he was placed under a ban of ostracism, even if he knows who issued that ban, ten people who are proficient in Torah Law are required to release him from that ban. If he cannot find such people [in his immediate surroundings], he must journey a <i>parsah</i> in search of them.<br>If he cannot find [these people within that distance], the ban can be released even by ten people who study Mishnah. If he cannot find [such people], the ban can be released even by ten people who know how to read the Torah. If he cannot find ten people in his place, the ban can be released by three ordinary people.
Whenever a ban of ostracism is imposed in a person's presence, it should only be lifted in his presence. If it was issued outside his presence, it may be lifted in his presence or outside his presence. There is no [fixed amount of time] between the issuance of a ban and its release. Instead, one may issue a ban and lift it immediately if the person placed under ban improves his behavior.<br>However, [if the court sees fit for this individual to remain under ban for a number of years, they may extend [the ban] according to his wickedness. Similarly, if it sees fit, the court is entitled to excommunicate a person at the outset or to excommunicate anyone who eats, drinks, or stands within four cubits of a person who has been ostracized. [This power is granted] to cause [the banned person] hardship and [thus,] create a fence around the Torah, so that it will not be violated by the sinners. Even though a Torah sage may place a person under a ban of ostracism [to preserve] his honor, it is not praiseworthy for a sage to accustom himself to this practice. Instead, he should turn his ears from the words of the common people and not pay attention to them, as Solomon said in his wisdom [Ecclesiastes 7:21]: “Also, do not pay heed to all the words that are spoken.”<br>This was the practice of the pious of the early generations. They would hear their shame and not answer. Furthermore, they would pardon and forgive the person who insulted them. The great sages would take pride in their pleasant deeds, relating that they never issued a ban of ostracism or excommunication [to protect] their honor. This is the path of the sages which is worthy of being followed.<br>When does the above apply? When [the person] spurned or embarrassed [the sage] in private. However, if one spurns or embarrasses a sage in public, it is forbidden for the sage to forgo his honor. Indeed, if he does so, he is punished, because the disrespect of the Torah is involved. Instead, he should seek vengeance and carry enmity over the matter like a snake until the offender requests to be pardoned. Then, he should forgive him.
