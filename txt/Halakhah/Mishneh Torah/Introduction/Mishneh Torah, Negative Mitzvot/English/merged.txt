For a man not to wear articles appropriate for women, as [Deuteronomy 22:5] states: "A man should not wear a woman's clothing." [This prohibition was instituted] because this is an idolatrous custom. Explicit statements to this effect are found in the texts describing their worship.
Not to tattoo our bodies like the worshipers of false gods, as [Leviticus 19:28] states: "Do not tattoo your flesh."
Not to wear <i>sha'atnez,</i> as do the priests of false gods, as [Deuteronomy 22:11] states: "Do not wear <i>sha'atnez</i>."

The prohibition against blessing [i.e., cursing] God's name, as [Exodus 22:27] states: "Do not curse God." [Leviticus 24:16] mentions the punishment: "One who curses the name of God shall surely die."

According to the oral tradition, we have learned that the verse refers to the <i>Chaggigah</i> sacrifice offered on the fourteenth of Nisan.

For not even a tenant or a hired worker employed by a priest to partake of <i>terumah,</i> as [Leviticus 22:10] states: "A tenant of a priest or [his] hired worker shall not eat the holy [food]."
For an uncircumcised person not to partake of <i>terumah</i> or other consecrated foods. This concept was derived from a <i>gezerah shavah</i> and is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah. [Nevertheless,] based on the oral tradition, the prohibition against an uncircumcised person partaking of consecrated foods is considered as a [prohibition of] the Torah itself and not a decree of the Sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>gezerah shavah is</i> one of the thirteen principles of Biblical exegesis in which an association is drawn between two verses based on a common word.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 2), the Rambam states that all of the 613 mitzvot are explicitly mentioned in the Torah and are not dependent on the exegesis of a verse according to the oral tradition. Therefore, he finds it necessary to explain that there is a specific oral tradition that this mitzvah is an exception to that rule.</i>
For a priest who is impure not to partake of <i>terumah,</i> as [Leviticus 22:4] states: "Any of your descendants... shall not eat from the consecrated foods."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Though this prooftext is quoted in the printed editions of the Mishneh Torah, it represents a misquotation of the verse, borrowing a phrase from Leviticus 21:17 and inserting it into Leviticus 22:4.</i>
For a <i>chalalah</i> not to partake of consecrated foods, neither <i>terumah,</i> nor the breast and the shankbone [given to the priest], as [Leviticus 22:12] states: "When a priest's daughter marries an unauthorized person, she shall not eat [from the sacred, elevated gifts]."
For a meal offering brought by a priest not to be eaten, as [Leviticus 6:16] states: "Any meal offering brought by a priest shall be consumed entirely [by fire]; it shall not be eaten."

Not to partake of consecrated animals that were disqualified [for use as sacrifices because] a blemish was intentionally inflicted upon them, as [Deuteronomy 14:3] states: "Do not eat of any abomination." According to the oral tradition, we have learned that the verse refers to consecrated animals that were disqualified for use because of a blemish inflicted upon them.
Not to eat grain [separated as] the second tithe outside of Jerusalem, as [Deuteronomy 12:17] states: "You may not eat within your gates the tithe from your grain."
Not to consume wine [separated as] the second tithe outside of Jerusalem, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] continues: "...your wine...."
Not to consume oil [separated as] the second tithe outside of Jerusalem, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] continues: "...and your oil...."
Not to eat an unblemished firstling animal outside of Jerusalem, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] states: "You may not eat [within your gates]... and the firstlings [of your cattle and flocks]...."
For the priests not to eat a sin offering or a guilt offering outside the Temple courtyard, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] continues: "...your cattle and your flocks." According to the oral tradition, the purpose of this phrase is only to forbid the consumption of the sin offerings and the guilt offerings outside the Temple courtyard. Anything that is eaten outside the place intended for it is covered by the [prohibition]: "You may not eat within your gates...."
Not to eat the meat of a burnt offering, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] states: "You may not [eat]...[the sacrifices] you have vowed [to bring]...," meaning to say: You may not eat [the sacrifices] you have vowed to give. This is a warning against a person's benefiting from the [unauthorized use] of consecrated articles which he is forbidden to use. If he derives such benefit, he transgresses.
Not to eat the meat of sacrifices of a lesser order of holiness before the sprinkling of their blood, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] states: "You may not [eat]... the [animals] you have pledged [to bring as sacrifices]..." - i.e., you are not allowed to eat from the sacrifices you have pledged until their blood has been sprinkled.
For an unauthorized person not to eat the meat of the sacrifices of the highest order of sanctity, as [Exodus 29:33] states: "An unauthorized person shall not partake of them, for they are holy."
For a priest not to partake of the first fruits <i>[Bikkurim]</i> before they are placed down in the Temple courtyard, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] states: "You may not [eat]... the elevated gifts [delivered by] hand." The [latter phrase] refers to the first fruits.

Not to eat the second tithe while in mourning, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] states: "I have not eaten from it while in mourning."
Not to use the proceeds [from the redemption of] the second tithe for anything aside from food and drink, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] states: "I have not used it for the dead." Anything that is not associated with the needs of a living body is referred to as "used for the dead."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Though the Rambam's statements are based on the <i>Sifre,</i> his interpretation of the verse appears to be original and not quoted from other sources.</i>
Not to eat <i>tevel. Tevel</i> refers to produce from which one is obligated to separate <i>terumah</i> and tithes from which God's <i>terumah</i> has not been separated, as [Leviticus 22:15] states: "And they shall not profane the sacred gifts which the children of Israel will separate for God." This implies that the produce which [the Jews] will ultimately separate for God should not be treated in a mundane manner and eaten while <i>tevel.</i>
Not to separate <i>terumah</i> before the first fruits, nor the first tithe before <i>terumah,</i> nor the second tithe before the first. Rather, [the agricultural gifts] must be given in order - first, the first fruits; afterwards, <i>terumah;</i> afterwards, the first tithe; and, afterwards, the second tithe - as [implied by Exodus 22:28]: "Do not delay your offerings of newly ripened produce and your agricultural offerings." [This means:] Do not delay bringing an offering that should be brought first.
Not to delay bringing sacrifices you have vowed to offer, or animals which you have pledged to bring as sacrifices, as [Deuteronomy 23:22] states: "[When you make a pledge to God,] do not delay paying it."

These 613 mitzvot were given to Moses on Mount Sinai together with their general principles, particular points, and details. These general principles, particular points, and details represent the Oral Law, which each court received from the previous court.
There are [also] other commandments that were instituted after the giving of the Torah. They were established by the Prophets and Sages and spread throughout Israel, for example, the reading of the <i>Megillah</i>, [lighting] a Chanukah candle, fasting on Tish'ah b'Av, [setting up] <i>eruvim,</i> and [washing one's] hands [in preparation for prayer and eating]. Each of these commandments also possesses explanatory aspects and details. All of this will be explained in this text.
We are obligated to accept and observe all these commandments which [the Rabbis] instituted, as [implied by Deuteronomy 17:11]: "Do not deviate from the instructions that they will give you, left or right." They are not considered to be additions to the commandments of the Torah. [If so,] what was the intention of the Torah's warning (Deuteronomy 13:11): "Do not add to it and do not detract from it"? That a prophet is not permitted to introduce a new measure and say that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded this mitzvah to us and that it should be added to the Torah's mitzvot, or [say that He commanded that we] eliminate one of the 613 mitzvot mentioned above.
However, if a court, together with the prophet of that age, adds a commandment as an ordinance, a lesson, or as a decree, this is not considered as an addition. He is not saying that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded us to make an <i>eruv</i> or read the <i>Megillah</i> at its [appointed] time. Were he to say so, he would be adding to the Torah.
Instead, we are saying that the prophets and the courts ordained and commanded that the <i>Megillah</i> be read at its [appointed] time in order to recall the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, the salvation He wrought for us, and His response to our cries, so that we will bless Him, extol Him, and inform the future generations of the truth of the Torah's promise (Deuteronomy 4:7): "What nation is so great that it has God [close to it....]". Similar principles apply with regard to all the other Rabbinic commandments, be they positive commandments or negative commandments.
A viúva não deve casar com outro homem que não seja o irmão do falecido, como está escrito: "Não será a mulher do falecido" (Devarim 25:5).
Não permitir que um homem que lançou um falso boato sobre sua esposa a repudie, como está escrito: "Não poderá repudiá-la todos os seus dias" (Devarim 22:19).
Não tomar uma mulher israelita para um eunuco, como está escrito: "Nenhum castrado entrará" (Devarim 23:2).
Não castrar nenhum macho, seja humano, animal, ou ave, como está escrito: "Em vossa terra, não fareis isso" (Vayikrá 22:24).
Não nomear um estrangeiro da comunidade de conversos como líder de Israel, como está escrito: "Não poderás colocar sobre ti um homem estrangeiro" (Devarim 17:15).
O rei não deve multiplicar cavalos para si, como está escrito: "O rei não multiplicará para si cavalos" (Devarim 17:16).
O rei não deve multiplicar para si mulheres, como está escrito: "O rei não multiplicará para si mulheres" (Devarim 17:17).
O rei não deve multiplicar para si ouro e prata, como está escrito: "E ouro e prata, não multiplicará para si" (Devarim 17:17).
A. Estas são as 613 mitzvot (mandamentos) que foram dadas a Moshe no Sinai, incluindo seus princípios, detalhes e minúcias; todas essas generalizações, detalhes, minúcias e explicações de cada mitzvá, são a Torá Shebe'al Peh (a Torá oral) que foi recebida de tribunal em tribunal.
B. E existem outras mitzvot que foram inovadas após a entrega da Torá, as quais foram estabelecidas pelos profetas e sábios e se espalharam por todo Israel—como a leitura da Meguilá (do livro de Ester), a vela de Chanucá, o jejum do 9º de Av, a purificação das mãos (netilat yadaim), e o eruv. E cada uma dessas mitzvot tem seus próprios significados e minúcias; e tudo será explicado neste compêndio.
C. Todas essas mitzvot que foram inovadas—devemos aceitá-las e observá-las, como está escrito: "Não te desvias, de tudo o que te disserem..." (Devarim 17:11); e não são um acréscimo às mitzvot da Torá. E sobre o que a Torá nos advertiu: "Não acrescentarás a ela, nem diminuirás dela" (Devarim 13:1)—isso significa que nenhum profeta tem permissão para inovar algo e dizer que o Santo, bendito seja, o comandou como um novo mandamento a ser acrescentado às 613 mitzvot da Torá ou para diminuir uma dessas mitzvot.
D. Mas, se o tribunal junto com um profeta, na época, estabelecerem uma mitzvá como uma lei de correção, ou como uma instrução, ou como um decreto—isso não é considerado um acréscimo: Pois não disseram que o Santo, bendito seja, os ordenou a fazer o eruv ou a ler a Meguilá na sua época. Se tivessem dito isso, estariam acrescentando à Torá.
E. Pelo contrário, o que dizemos é que os profetas, junto com o tribunal, instituíram e ordenaram a leitura da Meguilá na sua época, para recordar os louvores do Santo, bendito seja, e as salvação que Ele nos concedeu, e para nos aproximar de Sua misericórdia, para abençoá-Lo e louvá-Lo, e para comunicar às gerações futuras que é verdade o que Ele prometeu na Torá, "E que grande nação há, que tenha elohim tão próximos dela" (Devarim 4:7; Devarim 4:8). E da mesma forma, é com toda mitzvá e mitzvá que é de origem dos sábios, seja de ação ou de proibição.
