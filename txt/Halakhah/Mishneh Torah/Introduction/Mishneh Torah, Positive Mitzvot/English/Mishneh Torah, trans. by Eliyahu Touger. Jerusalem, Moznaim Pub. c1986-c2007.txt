Perhaps the intended prooftext is Leviticus 23:8: "And you shall offer a burnt offering for God for seven days."</i>

For an individual to offer a sacrifice if he is in doubt whether or not he transgressed a prohibition for which he would be liable for a sin offering, as [Leviticus 5:17-18] states: "If he does not know, he still bears responsibility...and he shall bring his guilt offering." This is referred to as "the conditional guilt offering."
For [the following individuals:] a person who unknowingly used sacred property, a person who sinned by stealing, one [who had relations with] a maidservant designated for another person, or one who denied possession of an entrusted object and took a [false] oath, to bring a guilt offering.

[This applies] when he brings a sacrifice [for atonement] and when he does not bring a sacrifice, as [Numbers 5:6] states: "And they shall confess the sins that they committed."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Note that in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah,</i> the Rambam defines this mitzvah as return to God and repentance, a more encompassing service, of which confession is only one facet.(See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 2:2.)</i>

This [verse states] the positive commandment for all these.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot,</i> the Rambam notes that the command to leave a forgotten sheaf in the field is derived, not from this verse, but from Deuteronomy 24:19, which states: "When you reap your harvest... and forget a sheaf in the field..., it shall be for the stranger..."</i>
