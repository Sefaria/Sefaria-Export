Perhaps the intended prooftext is Leviticus 23:8: "And you shall offer a burnt offering for God for seven days."</i>

For [the following individuals:] a person who unknowingly used sacred property, a person who sinned by stealing, one [who had relations with] a maidservant designated for another person, or one who denied possession of an entrusted object and took a [false] oath, to bring a guilt offering.

This [verse states] the positive commandment for all these.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot,</i> the Rambam notes that the command to leave a forgotten sheaf in the field is derived, not from this verse, but from Deuteronomy 24:19, which states: "When you reap your harvest... and forget a sheaf in the field..., it shall be for the stranger..."</i>
