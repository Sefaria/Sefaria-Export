Mishneh Torah, Rest on the Tenth of Tishrei



Chapter 1


Whenever the penalty for work done willfully on the Sabbath is stoning, the penalty for doing it willfully on <i>Yom Kippur</i> is <i>kareth;</i> whenever the penalty on the Sabbath is a sin-offering, the penalty on <i>Yom Kippur</i> is equally a sin-offering. Anything that must not be done on the Sabbath, though it is not actual work, must not be done on <i>Yom Kippur;</i> if one nevertheless performs it, he receives punishment for disobedience, the same as he would for a similar act on the Sabbath.— — In brief: The only difference between the Sabbath and <i>Yom Kippur</i> in this respect is that the punishment for deliberate work on the Sabbath is stoning, while on <i>Yom Kippur</i> it is <i>kareth</i>.

Another positive command concerning <i>Yom Kippur</i> requires us to abstain from eating or drinking on that day, as it is written: "You shall afflict yourselves" (Leviticus 16:29). According to tradition, self-affliction signifies fasting. Whoever fasts on <i>Yom Kippur</i> fulfills a positive command, and whoever eats or drinks on it breaks a positive command and transgresses a negative command, as it is written: "Whoever will not abstain and fast on that day shall be cut off" (Leviticus 23:29).— —

The same as the rabbinically forbidden occupations on <i>Yom Kippur</i> apply to both day and night, so the rabbinical interpretation of <i>affliction</i> applies to both day and night. One must add to <i>Yom Kippur</i> parts of the preceding and following weekdays, as it is written: "You shall abstain and fast from the sunset of the ninth day" (Leviticus 23:32), which means: you shall begin fasting and afflicting yourselves from the sunset of the ninth day bordering on the tenth day. So too, at the termination of <i>Yom Kippur</i>, one should prolong the fasting somewhat into the night of the eleventh day of <i>Tishri</i>, as it is written: "From sunset of the ninth day to sunset of the tenth day you shall keep your Sabbath."
If women continue eating and drinking until nightfall, because they fail to know the rule about adding part of the weekday to the holyday, we should not protest against their action, lest they come to do so willfully; for it is impossible to assign a policeman to each homestead in order to caution its womenfolk. Hence, leave them alone. It is better to let them act unwittingly rather than willfully. The same applies to all similar cases.

Chapter 2








If a patient who is seriously ill asks for food on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, he should be given to eat as he desires, until he says "enough," even though competent physicians say that he does not need any food. If the patient says that he does not require food, and the physician says that he does, he should be fed in accordance with the physician's order, provided that the physician is competent. If one physician says that the patient needs food and another says that he does not, he should be given food.— —

A boy of nine years — — should be trained to fast by the hours. For example, if he is used to eat at eight o'clock in the morning, he should be fed at nine; if he is used to eat at nine, he should be fed at ten; the number of hours is to be increased in accordance with the physical strength of the boy. A boy or a girl of eleven should fast the entire day, according to a rabbinical enactment, so as to be trained in the observance of religious duties.
