Mishneh Torah, Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah



Chapter 1

It is a positive mitzvah ordained by the Rabbis to read the Megillah at the appointed time. It is well-known that this was ordained by the Prophets.<br>Everyone is obligated in this reading: men, women, converts, and freed slaves. Children should also be trained to read it. Even the priests should neglect their service in the Temple and come to hear the reading of the Megillah.<br>Similarly, Torah study should be neglected to hear the reading of the Megillah. Surely, this applies to the other mitzvot of the Torah: the observance of all of them is superseded by the reading of the Megillah. There is nothing that takes priority over the reading of the Megillah except the burial of a <i>meit mitzvah</i> - a corpse that has no one to take care of it. A person who encounters such a corpse should bury it and then read the Megillah.
One can fulfill one's obligation by reading or by listening to another person's reading, provided one listens to a person who is obligated to hear the reading. For this reason, if the reader was a minor or mentally incompetent, one who hears his reading does not fulfill his obligation.
It is a mitzvah to read the entire Megillah and to read it both at night and during the day. The entire night is an appropriate time for the night reading, and the entire day is appropriate for the day reading.<br>Before the reading at night, one should recite three blessings. They are:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to read the Megillah.<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who wrought miracles for our ancestors in previous days at this season.<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has granted us life, sustained us, and enabled us to reach this occasion.<br>During the day, one should not recite the final blessing.<br>In places where it is customary to recite a blessing after the reading, the following blessing should be recited:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who wages our battles and executes judgment on our behalf, who avenges the vengeance wrought against us, who exacts retribution from our enemies on our behalf, and who acquits justly all our mortal enemies. Blessed are You, God, the Almighty, who exacts payment on behalf of His nation Israel from all their oppressors, the God of salvation.<br>
What is the appropriate time for the Megillah to be read? The Sages ordained many different times for its reading, as implied by Esther 9:31: "To confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times." The following are the days on which the Megillah is read:<br>Every city, whether in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> or in the diaspora, that was surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua bin Nun should read the Megillah on the fifteenth of Adar. This applies even when a wall does not surround the city at present. Such a city is called a כרך.<br>Every city that was not surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua bin Nun should read the Megillah on the fourteenth of Adar. This applies even when there is a wall surrounding the city at present. Such a city is called an עיר.
In the capital of Shushan, the Megillah is read on the fifteenth of Adar although it was not surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua bin Nun, because the miracle occurred within it and at that time, the Jews celebrated on that day, as Esther 9:18 states, "And they rested on the fifteenth."<br>Why was the matter made dependent on the time of Joshua bin Nun? To give honor to the cities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> that were in ruin at the time of the Purim miracle. Although they are in ruin at present, this would allow them to read the Megillah on the fifteenth as do the inhabitants of Shushan, since they were surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua. Thus the commemoration of the miracle would include a remembrance of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
The Sages ordained that the inhabitants of the villages who gather in the synagogues only on Mondays and Thursdays could read the Megillah earlier, on the day when they gather in the synagogues.<br>What is implied? If the fourteenth of Adar falls on either Monday or Thursday, the Megillah is read on that day. If it falls on a day other than Monday or Thursday, we read on an earlier date, on the Monday or Thursday that is closest to the fourteenth of Adar.
What is implied? If the fourteenth of Adar falls on Sunday, the Megillah is read on the previous Thursday, the eleventh of Adar. If the fourteenth falls on Tuesday, the Megillah is read earlier, on Monday, the thirteenth. If the fourteenth falls on Wednesday, the Megillah is read earlier, on Monday, the twelfth.<br>Whenever license is granted to read the Megillah before the fourteenth, it should not be read unless ten are present.
In a village where the Jews do not gather together to read the Torah on Mondays and Thursdays, the Megillah should be read only on the fourteenth of Adar. When a city does not have ten people who have no other occupation but to attend the synagogue for communal purposes, it is considered to be a village, and the Megillah is read earlier, on the day when people gather in the synagogue.<br>If a city lacks ten adult men, the very difficulty leads to its solution, and they are considered to be like the inhabitants of a large city and read the Megillah only on the fourteenth.
When does the above leniency - that it is possible to read the Megillah earlier, on the day people gather in the synagogue - apply? When Israel rules itself. In the present era, however, the Megillah is read only at its appropriate times, the fourteenth of Adar and the fifteenth. The inhabitants of villages and cities read on the fourteenth, and the inhabitants of walled cities read on the fifteenth.
The following rules apply when an inhabitant of an unwalled city travels to a walled city, or an inhabitant of a walled city travels to an unwalled city:<br>If his intent was to return home for the day of the Megillah reading, but he was prevented from returning, he should read the Megillah on the day when it is read in his home. If his intent was not to return home until after the day of the Megillah reading, he should read the Megillah together with the people in the place where he is visiting.<br>The following rule applies to all those homes adjacent to a walled city which are seen together with it: If there are not more than two thousand cubits between them, they are considered to be part of the walled city, and their inhabitants should read the Megillah on the fifteenth.
When a doubt exists and it is unknown whether a city had been surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua bin Nun or whether it was surrounded afterwards, its inhabitants should read the Megillah on the day and the night of both the fourteenth and the fifteenth of Adar. They should recite the blessing only when reading on the fourteenth, since this is the time when the Megillah is read in most places in the world.
When the Megillah was read in the first month of Adar and, afterwards, the court proclaimed a leap year, the Megillah should be read again in the second month of Adar at its appropriate time.
The Megillah should not be read on the Sabbath. This is a decree, enacted so that one should not take it in one's hands and bring it to a person who knows how to read it, thus carrying it four cubits in the public domain. Everyone is obligated to read the Megillah, but everyone is not capable of reading it. Thus, there is the possibility for such an error to occur.<br>For this reason, if the appropriate time for the Megillah to be read falls on the Sabbath, we read it earlier, on the day prior to the Sabbath. We discuss the laws of Purim on that Sabbath to commemorate the fact that it is Purim.
What is implied? When the fourteenth of Adar falls on the Sabbath, the inhabitants of the unwalled cities should read the Megillah earlier, on Friday. The inhabitants of the walled cities should read it at their appropriate time, on Sunday.<br>When the fifteenth falls on the Sabbath, the inhabitants of the walled cities read the Megillah earlier, on Friday the fourteenth. The inhabitants of the unwalled cities also read on that day, for this is the appropriate time for them to read. Thus in such an instance, everyone reads on the fourteenth.

Chapter 2

When a person reads the Megillah in improper sequence, he does not fulfill his obligation. If a person was reading, forgot a verse and read the following verse, went back and read the verse he forgot, and then read a third verse, he does not fulfill his obligation, because he read a verse in improper sequence. What should he do instead? He should begin from the second verse, the verse he forgot, and continue reading the Megillah in its proper order.
Should one encounter a congregation that has already read half of the Megillah, one should not say, "I will read the latter half together with this congregation, and then go back and read the first half," for this is reading in improper sequence. Instead, one should read the entire Megillah from beginning to end in order.<br>When a person reads a portion and pauses and then goes back and continues reading, since he read in order, he fulfills his obligation, even though the entire Megillah could have been read while he had paused.
A person who reads the Megillah by heart does not fulfill his obligation. A person who speaks a language other than Hebrew and hears the Megillah read in Hebrew written in the holy script fulfills his obligation, although he does not understand what is being read. Similarly, if the Megillah was written in Greek, a person who hears it, even one who speaks Hebrew, fulfills his obligation although he does not understand what is being read.
If, however, it was written in Aramaic or in another language of gentile origin, one who listens to this reading fulfills his obligation only when he understands that language and only when the Megillah is written in that language.<br>In contrast, if the Megillah was written in Hebrew and one read in Aramaic for a person who understood that tongue, one does not fulfill one's obligation, for one is reading by heart. And since the reader cannot fulfill his obligation, the person hearing it read by him also cannot.
A person who was reading the Megillah without the desired intent does not fulfill his obligation. What is implied? That he was writing a Megillah, explaining it, or checking it: If he had the intent to fulfill his obligation with this reading, his obligation is fulfilled. If he did not have this intent, he did not fulfill his obligation. Should one read while dozing off, he fulfills his obligation, since he is not sound asleep.
When does the statement that a person can fulfill his obligation by reading when writing a Megillah apply? When he intends to fulfill his obligation to read it by reading from the scroll which he is copying. If, however, he intends to fulfill his obligation by reading the scroll that he is writing at present, he does not fulfill his obligation, for one can fulfill one's obligation only by reading from a scroll that was completely written at the time of the reading.
A person who errs while reading the Megillah and reads in an inexact manner fulfills his obligation, for we are not required to read in a precise manner.<br>A person fulfills his obligation whether he reads it standing or sitting. This applies even when reading for a congregation. Nevertheless, at the outset, out of respect for the congregation, one should not read for the congregation while sitting.<br>If two, and even if ten, people read the Megillah in unison, both the readers and those who listen to the readers fulfill their obligation. An adult and a child can read the Megillah together, even for the community.
We should not read the Megillah for a congregation from a scroll that contains the other Sacred Writings. Should one read for the congregation from such a scroll, no one fulfills their obligation, unless the portions of parchment on which it is written are larger or smaller than those of the remainder for the scroll, so that it will be distinct.<br>An individual reading for himself, by contrast, may read from such a scroll even though the portion containing the Megillah is not larger or smaller than the remainder of the scroll, and thus fulfill his obligation.
A Megillah may be written only with ink on <i>g'vil</i> or on <i>k'laf</i>, like a Torah scroll. If it was written with gall-nut juice or vitriol it is acceptable, but if it was written with other tints it is not acceptable.<br>It must be written on ruled parchment like a Torah scroll. The parchment need not, however, be processed with the intent that it be used for the mitzvah. If it was written on paper or on an animal hide that was not processed or if it was written by a gentile or by a non-believer, it is not acceptable.
The following rules apply when the letters of a Megillah are rubbed out or torn: If a trace of the letters is discernible, the scroll is acceptable, even if most of the letters have been rubbed out. If no trace of the letters is discernible, the scroll is acceptable if the majority of its letters are intact. If not, it is not acceptable.<br>If the scribe left out certain letters or verses and the reader reads them by heart, he fulfills his obligation.
A Megillah must be sewn together - i.e., all the parchments on which it is written must be joined as a single scroll. It should be sewn only with animal sinews, as a Torah scroll is. If it is sewn with other thread, it is unacceptable.<br>It is not necessary, however, to sew the entire length of the parchment with animal sinews, as a Torah scroll is sewn. As long as one sews three stitches at one end of the parchment, three stitches in the middle, and three stitches at the other end, it is acceptable. This leniency is taken, because the Megillah is referred to as an "epistle" Esther 9:29.
The reader should read the names of Haman's ten sons and the word which follows, <i>asseret</i> Esther 9:7-10, in one breath, to show the entire people that they were all hung and slain together.<br>It is a universally accepted Jewish custom that as the reader of the Megillah reads, he spreads the text out as an epistle (to show the miracle). When he concludes, he goes back, rolls up the entire text, and recites the concluding blessing.
On these two days, the fourteenth and the fifteenth of Adar, it is forbidden to eulogize and to fast. This prohibition applies to all people in all places, to the inhabitants of the walled cities who celebrate only the fifteenth and to the inhabitants of the unwalled cities who celebrate only the fourteenth.<br>In a leap year, it is forbidden to eulogize and to fast on these two dates in the first Adar as well as in the second Adar. When the inhabitants of the villages read the Megillah earlier, on the Monday or Thursday before Purim, they are permitted to eulogize and to fast on the day they read the Megillah, and are forbidden to eulogize and to fast on these two dates, even though they do not read the Megillah on them.
It is a mitzvah for the inhabitants of the villages and unwalled cities to consider the fourteenth of Adar - and for the inhabitants of the walled cities to consider the fifteenth of Adar - as a day of happiness and festivity, when portions of food are sent to one's friends and presents are given to the poor.<br>It is permitted to work on these days. It is not, however, proper to do so. Our Sages declared, "Whoever works on Purim will never see a sign of blessing."<br>Should the inhabitants of the villages read the Megillah earlier, on a Monday or a Thursday, and give monetary gifts to the poor on the day on which they read, they fulfill their obligation. The rejoicing and festivities of the Purim holiday, by contrast, should be held only on the day of the fourteenth. If they are held earlier, the participants do not fulfill their obligation. A person who conducts the Purim feast at night does not fulfill his obligation.
What is the nature of our obligation for this feast? A person should eat meat and prepare as attractive a feast as his means permit. He should drink wine until he becomes intoxicated and falls asleep in a stupor.<br>Similarly, a person is obligated to send two portions of meat, two other cooked dishes, or two other foods to a friend, as implied by Esther 9:22, "sending portions of food one to another" - i.e., two portions to one friend. Whoever sends portions to many friends is praiseworthy. If one does not have the means to send presents of food to a friend, one should exchange one's meal with him, each one sending the other what they had prepared for the Purim feast and in this way fulfill the mitzvah of sending presents of food to one's friends.
One is obligated to distribute charity to the poor on the day of Purim. At the very least, to give each of two poor people one present, be it money, cooked dishes, or other foods, as implied by Esther 9:22 "gifts to the poor" - i.e., two gifts to two poor people.<br>We should not be discriminating in selecting the recipients of these Purim gifts. Instead, one should give to whomever stretches out his hand. Money given to be distributed on Purim should not be used for other charitable purposes.
It is preferable for a person to be more liberal with his donations to the poor than to be lavish in his preparation of the Purim feast or in sending portions to his friends. For there is no greater and more splendid happiness than to gladden the hearts of the poor, the orphans, the widows, and the converts.<br>One who brings happiness to the hearts of these unfortunate individuals resembles the Divine Presence, which Isaiah 57:15 describes as having the tendency "to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive those with broken hearts."
All the books of the Prophets and all the Holy Writings will be nullified in the Messianic era, with the exception of the Book of Esther. It will continue to exist, as will the five books of the Torah and the <i>halachot</i> of the Oral Law, which will never be nullified.<br>Although all memories of the difficulties endured by our people will be nullified, as Isaiah 65:16 states: "For the former difficulties will be forgotten and for they will be hidden from My eye," the celebration of the days of Purim will not be nullified, as Esther 9:28 states: "And these days of Purim will not pass from among the Jews, nor will their remembrance cease from their seed."

Chapter 3

In [the era of] the Second Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Chanukah miracle took place in the year 3596 (165 BCE). The Greek persecutions began several years beforehand.</i> the Greek kingdom<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">More particularly, the Seleucid kingdom of Syria, whose ruling hierarchy was of Greek origin.</i> issued decrees against the Jewish people, [attempting to] nullify their faith<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 2:4 relates that the Greeks would have the Jews "write on the horn of an ox that they have no portion in the God of Israel."</i> and refusing to allow them to observe the Torah and its commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Megillat Antiochus</i>, which relates that the Greeks prevented the Jews from observing the Sabbath and performing circumcision.</i> They extended their hands against their property<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In this era, the Greek rulers established gentile cities in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and deprived the Jewish population of its livelihood.</i> and their daughters;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 23a, states that before a Jewish virgin was married, she was required to have relations with a Greek officer.</i> they entered the Sanctuary, wrought havoc within,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Middot</i> 1:6, 2:3 and <i>Shekalim</i> 6:3, which speak of the Greeks breaking open portions of the <i>Soreg</i>, a divider on the Temple Mount, and destroying portions of the wall around the Temple Courtyard.</i> and made the sacraments impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As we find with regard to the oil for the Menorah, the Greeks did not destroy the oil; they made it impure.<br>Herein, there is a lesson regarding the nature of the conflict between the Greeks and the Jews. The Greeks were not anxious to stamp out Judaism entirely. They were prepared to accept Judaism as one of the cultures of the Mediterranean area, which they would incorporate into an all-encompassing collection of knowledge and values; i.e., the sacraments of Judaism would remain, but they would become impure, tainted by Greek culture.</i><br>The Jews suffered great difficulties from them, for they oppressed them greatly until the God of our ancestors had mercy upon them, delivered them from their hand, and saved them.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">By calling attention to the Divine origin of the Jews' victory before mentioning the Hasmoneans, the Rambam emphasizes the miraculous and spiritual nature of the miracle.</i> The sons of the Hasmoneans, the High Priests, overcame [them], slew them, and saved the Jews from their hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The valiant struggle of the Hasmoneans who were able to defeat the most powerful armies of the world with guerilla forces is recounted in many sources.</i><br>They appointed a king from the priests, and sovereignty returned to Israel for more than 200 years, until the destruction of the Second Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">There is a significance to these statements beyond the laws of Chanukah. There are many Rabbinic authorities who are highly critical of the Hasmoneans for assuming the kingship of the Jewish people. (See the Ramban's commentary on the Torah, <i>Parashat Vayichi</i>.) Although in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:7-8, the Rambam writes that King David's descendants have an eternal right to the monarchy in Jerusalem, his description here of the Hasmoneans as kings does not have the slightest intimation of criticism; if anything, the contrary is true.<br>Several laws regarding the nature of kingship are derived from the Hasmonean kings and others, even from the kings of Herod's dynasty, who ruled after them.</i>
When the Jews overcame their enemies and destroyed them, they entered the Sanctuary; this was on the twenty-fifth of Kislev.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, the wording of the Rambam appears to indicate that the victory of the Hasmoneans took place on the twenty-fifth of Kislev. Rabbenu Nissim and other authorities explain that the victory took place on the twenty-fourth, and it was on the twenty-fifth that the Jews rested from the war and entered the Sanctuary. Indeed, an allusion to this is found in the very name Chanukah, חנוכה, which is broken up into two words, חנו כה, "they camped on the twenty-fifth."</i> They could not find any pure oil in the Sanctuary, with the exception of a single cruse. It contained enough oil to burn for merely one day. They lit the arrangement of candles from it for eight days<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries raise the question: Why was the miracle of the cruse of oil necessary? With regard to communal offerings, in which category falls the kindling of the Menorah, we follow the rule that "the requirement for ritual purity is suspended," if it is impossible to bring the offering in purity (<i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 4:7-17). Thus, if the cruse of pure oil had burned out, the Jews could have used impure oil. Why did God perform a miracle when there was no absolute necessity?<br>Among the explanations for this is that God saw the dedication of the Jewish people as evidenced by their search for pure oil, and, in a greater sense, by their entire struggle against the Greeks. This commitment which extended beyond the limits of their intellect evoked a miracle from God that transcended the limits of nature.</i> until they could crush olives and produce pure oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This fact also provokes a question: Why did it take so long to produce pure olive oil? Although there is an obligation to use oil of the finest quality for the <i>Menorah</i> (see <i>Hilchot Issurei HaMizbe'ach</i> 6:1, 7-8-10), when there is no other alternative, inferior oil prepared for the <i>Menorah</i> is also acceptable. Seemingly, it would have been possible to produce oil from olives in the Jerusalem vicinity in less than eight days.</i>
Accordingly, the Sages of that generation<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 21b states that the celebration of the holiday was ordained in the year following the miracle.</i> ordained that these eight days, which begin from the twenty-fifth of Kislev, should be commemorated<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There are many who question why the holiday is celebrated for eight days, since the miracle was only for seven (for there was enough oil for the Menorah to burn for a single day). The Rambam's words seem to allude to a resolution of this difficulty. The miraculous lighting of the <i>Menorah</i> began on the twenty-fifth of Kislev and continued for eight days.<br>[Note, however, the <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 670:1), who explains that, according to the Rambam, the first day of the celebration was instituted in appreciation of the military victories, while the remaining seven came in recognition of the miracle of the <i>Menorah</i>.]</i> to be days of happiness<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">an acknowledgement of God's miracles in a material context in appreciation of the military victories.<br>As the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Purim</i>, Chapter 2, "happiness" is associated with feasting. In this context, the <i>Yam shel Shlomo, Bava Kama</i> 7:37, explains that according to the Rambam - in contrast to the rulings of the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 670:2) - the festive meals customarily served on Chanukah can be considered to be feasts associated with a mitzvah.</i> and praise [of God].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A spiritual acknowledgement of God in appreciation of the miracle of the <i>Menorah</i>. These two aspects of the celebration of the holiday reflect the different nature of the miracles mentioned in each of the first two halachot (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 10).</i> Candles should be lit in the evening at the entrance to the houses on each and every one of these eight nights to publicize and reveal the miracle.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Both factors, the kindling of the Chanukah candles at night - when their light could be seen - and their placement at the entrance to the house - where their light will be projected into the street - emphasize the principle of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle.</i><br>These days are called Chanukah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, the choice of this name is somewhat problematic: As mentioned above, there are authorities who associated the name with the expression, חנו כה, "they camped on the twenty-fifth." This certainly does not express the Rambam's view. <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i> associates Chanukah with <i>chanukat hamizbe'ach</i>, the rededication of the altar in the Temple, but there is no mention of this event by the Rambam here.</i> It is forbidden to eulogize and fast on them, as on the days of Purim.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 13, the prohibition to eulogize and fast applies only on the days of Chanukah themselves, and not on the preceding or succeeding days.<br>Significantly, unlike Purim, there is no prohibition against work on Chanukah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 670:1).</i> Lighting the candles on these days is a Rabbinic mitzvah, like the reading of the Megillah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This emphasizes the Rambam's perspective that the allusion to the obligation to read the Megillah in the Megillah itself does not change the status of this mitzvah. (See also the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 1.)</i>
Whoever is obligated to read the Megillah is also obligated to kindle the Chanukah lamp.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., all adult men and women; similarly, there is an obligation upon parents to train their children in the observance of this mitzvah.<br>Although Chanukah is a mitzvah that is dependent on a specific time, women are obligated, because "they were also included in the miracle." As mentioned in Halachah 1, the Greeks' decrees affected them and they also had a share in the military victory, for the Greek commander was slain by a woman, Yehudit.</i> On the first night, a person lighting [the lamp] recites three blessings. They are:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Although the mitzvah of kindling Chanukah lights was ordained by the Sages, it is proper to praise God "who commanded us," as explained in Chapter 1, Halachot 1 and 3.</i> to light the Chanukah lamp.<br>"...who wrought miracles for our ancestors...."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This blessing is also recited in commemoration of the Purim miracles (Chapter 1, Halachah 3).</i><br>"...who has granted us life, sustained us...."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This blessing is recited whenever one fulfills a mitzvah that is performed only from time to time (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:9).</i><br>When a person who did not recite a blessing [on his own Chanukah lamp] sees a lamp,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 676:3) interprets this as referring to a person who has not lit the Chanukah candles yet, is not intending to light them, and will not have them lit by others in his home. (See Chapter 4, Halachah 11.) Since he will not be fulfilling the mitzvah by himself, he should commemorate the miracle by reciting these blessings on candles lit by others.<br>Significantly, Rav Kapach's version of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> does not contain the phrase, "who did not recite a blessing." Based on a responsum of the Rambam, he develops a unique interpretation, explaining that one may recite these blessings several times each night if he did not have the intent to light or see additional Chanukah lamps.</i> he should recite the latter two blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since he did not kindle the lamp himself, it is improper for him to praise God for the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah.</i> On subsequent nights, a person who kindles the lamp should recite two blessings and one who sees a lamp should recite one, for the blessing <i>Shehecheyanu</i> is recited only on the first night.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">After the fulfillment of this mitzvah on the first night, it is no longer appropriate to recite this blessing.</i>
On each and every one of these eight days, the entire <i>Hallel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hallel</i> is a selection of celebrant psalms (Psalm 113-118). The Rambam mentions the entire <i>Hallel</i> as a contrast to the partial <i>Hallel</i> recited on Rosh Chodesh and the latter days of Pesach, which is described in Halachah 7.</i> is recited.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, the Rambam describes the laws of <i>Hallel</i> in these halachot instead of in the laws of prayer. This emphasizes that <i>Hallel</i> is an expression of praise for the miracles associated with the holiday, and, as apparent from the following halachah, an expression of holiday joy rather than a requirement of prayer.</i> Before [its recitation], one should recite the blessing "...who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to complete the <i>Hallel</i>." This applies whether the recitation is individual or communal.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the partial <i>Hallel</i>, there are differences between an individual recitation and a communal recitation, as explained in Halachah 7. No such differences apply with regard to the full <i>Hallel</i>, and there is an obligation incumbent on each individual to recite these psalms with a blessing.</i><br>Even though the reading of the <i>Hallel</i> is a mitzvah ordained by the Sages, one may recite the blessing [stating] "who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us," as one recites a blessing for the reading of the Megillah<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the commentary on the previous halachah, the difficulty is that the blessing implies that the mitzvah was given to us by God, and yet these mitzvot were ordained by the Sages. This difficulty is resolved by explaining that the Torah commands us to adhere to the rulings of the Sages. Therefore, by observing the Sages' command, we are fulfilling God's will.

(See <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i>.)<br>One might ask why the Rambam mentions the reading of the Megillah and the <i>eruv</i>, but not the kindling of the Chanukah lights mentioned in the previous halachah.

Nevertheless, the Rambam's view is accepted by most authorities.</i> [This principle invites a question:] Why is a blessing recited over the second day of a festival; its observance was ordained only because of doubt?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i>, Chapter 5. Originally, when the calendar was determined according to the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon, the inhabitants of the far-removed areas were in doubt regarding when the festivals should be observed. Hence, they began to observe two days. This practice was perpetuated even in the present age, despite the fact that we follow a fixed calendar.</i> [This was ordained] lest it be treated with disdain.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages felt that were the blessing not to be recited, the people would not regard these days as festivals.</i>
It is not the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on Chanukah alone that is a Rabbinic ordinance,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since Chanukah is a Rabbinic holiday, one might think that the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on those days is Rabbinic in origin, while the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on the festivals has its source in the Torah itself.

Because of this association with a Biblical verse, he considers the obligation to recite <i>Hallel</i> as different in status from other Rabbinic commandments. Indeed, the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> considers this obligation to be one of the 613 mitzvot. This runs contrary to the position the Rambam mentions in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 1), where he states that even those mitzvot ordained by the prophets are considered to be Rabbinic commandments.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the verse in Isaiah reflects a command to recite <i>Hallel</i> in appreciation whenever God redeems us from difficulties. (For this reason, it is customary in certain communities to recite <i>Hallel</i> on the anniversary of a miraculous deliverance.) The custom of reciting <i>Hallel</i> on festivals, however, was established afterwards.</i> - i.e., on all the days that the complete <i>Hallel</i> is recited, [the obligation to do so] is a Rabbinic ordinance.<br>There are eighteen days during the year when it is a mitzvah to recite the entire <i>Hallel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.

In places where the festivals are celebrated for two days, <i>Hallel</i> is recited on 21 days: On the nine days of Sukkot, the eight days of Chanukah, the [first] two days of Pesach, and the two days of Shavuot.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In order to emphasize that there is no difference between the first day of each holiday and the second, <i>Hallel</i> is recited on both days.</i><br>[In contrast,] the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh is a custom and not a mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arachin</i> 10b relates that although Rosh Chodesh is called <i>mo'ed</i> (a festival), since there is no prohibition against performing work, there is no obligation to recite <i>Hallel</i>.<br>The recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh is also dealt with in <i>Ta'anit</i> 28b. That passage relates:<br>Rav arrived in Babylon. He saw that they recited <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh and thought of stopping them. When, however, he saw that they skipped portions, he [allowed them to continue,] saying, "They are perpetuating a custom practiced by their ancestors."<br>Rav studied in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> at the time of the composition of the Mishnah and returned to Babylon shortly thereafter. We can thus conclude from this passage that at that time, it was not customary in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to read <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh, and that it was not until the center of Rabbinic authority shifted to Babylon that this custom became uniformly accepted throughout the Jewish people.</i> It is observed [only] communally. [To emphasize that it is a custom,] passages are skipped when it is read.

In the latter instance, since the <i>Hallel</i> is a lengthy prayer - in contrast to the performance of a simple action - it is proper to recite a blessing (<i>Tosafot, Ta'anit</i> 28b). Others differentiate between the communal recitation (see the following note) of the <i>Hallel</i>, where a blessing is required, and the recitation of these psalms by an individual, when it is not (Rabbenu Yonah, <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 422:2) quotes Rabbenu Yonah's view and that of the Rambam, stating that it is customary in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to follow the Rambam's ruling.

The Ashkenazim (Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i>) interpret "does not" as "need not" - i.e., the custom is an obligation on the community, which may be accepted by an individual if he desires.<br>In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) does not accept the Rambam's ruling, and states that a person praying alone should recite the <i>Hallel</i>.</i> If, however, he began its recitation, he should complete it, skipping the passages the community would skip as he reads it.<br>Similarly, on the other days of Pesach, [the <i>Hallel</i>] is read while skipping passages.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Although most halachic authorities equate the latter days of Pesach with Rosh Chodesh totally, the Ramban differs and explains that there is a binding obligation on every individual to recite <i>Hallel</i> throughout the Pesach holiday.

From that point onward, the <i>Hallel</i> is recited until its conclusion. (See also <i>Eliyahu Rabba</i> 422.)</i>
It is appropriate to recite <i>Hallel</i> throughout the entire day.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Hallel</i> is recited directly after the morning service, it is not an integral part of the prayer service and may be recited at other times.

The order of the psalms themselves, however, may be altered. This view, however, is not accepted by most authorities, and the prevailing practice is to follow their ruling.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:11, where the Rambam states that it is not absolutely necessary to read the different passages of the <i>Shema</i> in order. On the other hand, there the Rambam explains his decision, stating that the passages of the <i>Shema</i> are not found in this order in the Torah. In contrast, the psalms of <i>Hallel</i> are recited in the order they are found in the Bible.</i> If a person reads and pauses, reads and pauses, even if he pauses for a time long enough to complete the entire [<i>Hallel</i>], he fulfills his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 34b, we can conclude that the laws that apply to the reading of the Megillah also apply to the reading of <i>Hallel</i>.

The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, however, is more restrictive and allows interruptions only when there is a need.<br>In their analysis of <i>Berachot</i> 14a (the source for this halachah), Rabbenu Asher and other commentaries differ and compare the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. Thus, one may greet an honored person between the chapters and may respond to a greeting from anyone at that time. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 488:1) follows this ruling.</i> Within a [single] chapter, however, one may not make an interruption.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Here, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), following the principles mentioned above, states that a person may interrupt his recitation to greet his father or his teacher, or to respond to greetings from an honored person.</i> On the days when <i>Hallel</i> is read while skipping portions,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Eliyahu Rabba</i> explains that the Rambam's ruling depends on his previous decision that a blessing should not be recited on these days.

On all the days when the complete <i>Hallel</i> is recited,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion regarding the conclusion of this blessing.

In contrast, each of the verses from <i>od'cha</i> onward is an independent concept that is not repeated.</i> Each verse is read a second time.

Hence, since all the individuals mentioned by the Rambam (quoting <i>Sukkah</i> 3:10) are not obligated to say <i>Hallel</i>, an adult male cannot fulfill his obligation by listening to their recitation. By repeating the <i>Hallel</i> word for word, he does fulfill his obligation, since in this manner he recites the entire <i>Hallel</i>.<br>The Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that a person who must have one of the above read for him is worthy of a curse.

It is common custom in all of our cities in Spain that a single candle is lit for all the members of the household on the first night. We proceed to add a new candle on each and every night, until on the eighth night eight candles are lit. [This practice is followed] regardless of whether there are many members of the household or only one man [is lighting candles].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the custom mentioned by the Rambam. Since the Rambam maintains that the <i>mehadrin min hamehadrin</i> also observe the practice of the <i>mehadrin</i>, this custom seems inappropriate. It is not the custom of the <i>mehadrin min hamehadrin</i>, nor is it the minimum requirement of the law.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> justifies the custom, explaining that since each night additional light is added, there is a positive intent even though it does not follow the practice of the <i>mehadrin min hamehadrin</i>.<br>"IX The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 671:2) quotes the custom cited by the Rambam as halachah. The Ramah adds that in Ashkenazic communities the custom is to fulfill the mitzvah in the manner of <i>mehadrin min hamehadrin</i> - i.e., each member of the household lights candles, and each night an additional candle is added. It is significant that with regard to this mitzvah in particular, it is common custom throughout the Ashkenazic community, for everyone - even those who are not fully observant - to fulfill this mitzvah in "the most desirable manner."</i>
When a candleholder has two openings,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">and a wick is kindled in both of them</i> it can be counted for two individuals.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Although both wicks use the same oil, since they protrude from separate portions of the candelabrum, they are considered to be separate lights.<br>This law is applicable to the <i>mehadrin</i> (see Halachah 1), who light a candle for each individual (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 23b). Alternatively, this law is relevant for two people whose doorways are adjacent to each other or when two people live in the same house, but do not share in their household expenses (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 671:2 states that according to the Ashkenazic custom, in which each person lights his own candles, two people should not light candles using the same candleholder even on the first night. A passerby might see the two lights and instead of thinking they were lit by two different people, he might err and think that one person lit both candles because it is the second night of the holiday.<br>Since the purpose of lighting candles is <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle, the impression created in an onlooker's mind is significant. Therefore, two people should not light candles in this manner.</i><br>[The following rules apply when] one fills a bowl with oil and surrounds it with wicks: If one covers it with a utensil,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The flames from each of the lights will not merge together.

The Chanukah candles should not be kindled before sunset.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Most commentaries interpret the Rambam's intent as the time when the sun disappears from the horizon. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 672:1) interpret "sunset" in this context as referring to the time when there is no sunlight visible - i.e., the appearance of three stars. Many of the later authorities, however, accept the Rambam's ruling. (See the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 672.)<br>The candles should not be lit before sunset, since their purpose is to publicize the Chanukah miracles.

He must, however, place enough oil within them for them to continue burning for half an hour after nightfall.<br>On Friday night, we all rely on this opinion and kindle the Chanukah lights shortly before sunset.

The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 672:2) states that in the present age, since it is customary to light inside one's house (see Halachah 8 and commentary), the essential element of publicizing the Chanukah miracle is to involve one's own family in the candle lighting. Therefore, one fulfills the mitzvah as long as the members of one's household are awake.<br>The Ramah, nevertheless, counsels that at the outset, one should try to adhere to the stricter view. In light of these statements, the common practice of lighting the Chanukah candles well after nightfall should be examined.

Thus, one must light them in a manner that - barring any unexpected events - they will be able to burn for a half an hour - e.g., they must have a sufficient amount of oil to burn for that period and they must not be placed where they could be extinguished by the wind. Once a person has taken these precautions, however, he has no further obligation.<br>Note, however, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:27, which states that it is proper to relight the candles so that they will burn for the desired time.</i> If it remained burning until there are no longer passersby in the marketplace,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">there is no longer any purpose in having the candles burning.

All oils and all wicks are acceptable for use in the Chanukah lamps,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is a contrast to the Sabbath laws.

There is no reason for caution in this regard on Chanukah, as explained below. Hence, there is no difficulty in using such oil.<br>Although all oils are acceptable for the Chanukah candles, the Rabbis have suggested using olive oil, for this was the oil used to light the Menorah in the Temple (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 673:1, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:4).

Thus, just as it is forbidden to use the Menorah's light for any worldly purpose, so too, the light of the Chanukah candles is prohibited (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:8).</i> It is even forbidden to use their light to inspect or count coins.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 22a relates that this prohibition was instituted so that the mitzvot would be viewed with respect.

In Halachah 8, he mentions the lighting of candles within the home (and it is likely that work will be carried out within the home at that time). Therefore, it is in that halachah that he mentions the custom of lighting another candle (the <i>shamash</i>) next to the Chanukah candles, so that if a person carries out an activity near the candles, he will be using the light of that additional candle.<br>See also the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which questions whether it is permissible to use the Chanukah candles for a holy purpose - e.g., to study Torah by their light.</i>

I.e., although as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 4, the obligation to kindle Chanukah lamps is incumbent on each person, the mitzvah is that every Jewish dwelling should be illuminated.

The mitzvah of kindling Chanukah lamps is very dear. A person should be very careful in its observance to publicize the miracle and thus increase our praise of God and our expression of thanks for the miracles which He wrought on our behalf.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that since in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 7:7 (based on <i>Pesachim</i> 10:1), the Rambam states that even a person who derives his income from charity should not drink less than four cups of wine on Pesach, we can conclude that the same concept applies with regard to Chanukah. Indeed, as explained in the following halachah, kindling Chanukah candles receives priority over the recitation of <i>Kiddush</i>.<br>The concept of selling or pawning one's clothes to perform a mitzvah is mentioned in <i>Megillah</i> 27b with regard to the mitzvah of <i>Kiddush</i>.</i>

[Indeed, the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 263:3) mention this law in connection with the laws of the Sabbath as well.]<br>By structuring his text in this manner, however, the Rambam indicates that the priority of kindling Sabbath candles stems not from a particular law associated with the Sabbath, but rather from a general principle - the importance of peace - which relates to the entire Torah as a whole (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XV).</i> - or, alternatively, lighting a lamp for one's home or reciting <i>kiddush</i> - the lamp for one's home receives priority, since it generates peace within the home.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 23b associates the Sabbath candles with peace, explaining that they prevent the members of the household from stumbling over obstacles, and also allow them to avoid the discomfort of sitting in darkness.<br>Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:1, the Rambam mentions that the Sabbath candles contribute to the atmosphere of <i>oneg Shabbat</i>, Sabbath pleasure. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:5, he mentions them as being associated with activities carried out in honor of the Sabbath (<i>k'vod Shabbat</i>). In the laws of the Sabbath itself, the Rambam does not mention the connection between the Sabbath candles and peace within the home.<br>This relates to the concept mentioned previously, that the peace generated by the Sabbath candles relates to the Torah as a whole and not to the Sabbath in particular (<i>Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.</i>).</i><br>[Peace is of primary importance, as reflected by the mitzvah requiring] God's name to be blotted out<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 6, blotting out God's name is a severe matter and constitutes a Torah prohibition. Nevertheless, this prohibition is waived</i> to create peace between a husband and his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is referring to the process of testing a <i>sotah</i>, a woman suspected of committing adultery. A curse against her containing God's name is written on a scroll. The text is rubbed out in water, and the water is given to the woman to drink. If she indeed committed adultery, she will die. (See Numbers 5:11-31; <i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 3:8-10.)</i> Peace is great, for the entire Torah was given<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's choice of wording is extremely precise. The Torah does not exist for the world. On the contrary, <i>Shabbat</i> 88b relates that the Torah existed even before the world came into being. I.e., the Torah represents spiritual truths that transcend our material existence. Nevertheless, the Torah "was given," drawn down into the context of our material frame of reference for a purpose,</i> to bring about peace within the world, as [Proverbs 3:17] states: "Its ways are pleasant ways and all its paths are peace."<br>Blessed<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This concept shares an intrinsic connection to Chanukah (and is therefore chosen as the conclusion for <i>Hilchot Chanukah</i>), because the Chanukah candles are intended for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>. They project the light of Torah into the world at large and make the world conscious of its Godly purpose. The spreading of the awareness of Godliness is associated with peace, as reflected by the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:In that era (the Era of the Redemption), there will be... neither envy nor competition.... The occupation of the entire world will be solely to know God.... "For the world will be filled with the knowledge of God as the waters cover the ocean bed."May we merit the coming of that era in the immediate future.</i> be the Merciful One who grants assistance. This concludes the third book.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> also contains the line "And this concludes the first part [of the work]." We have omitted this line, for nowhere else is a division of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> into parts mentioned.</i>
