Mishneh Torah, Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah



Chapter 1

We are bidden by the sages to read the <i>Megillah</i> at its proper time. It is widely known that this reading was prescribed by the prophets. Everyone is required to hear its reading: men, women, proselytes, and emancipated slaves. Minors should be trained to read it.— —


On what date should it be read? The sages prescribed several dates for it, because it is written: "At their appointed times" (Esther 9:31). These are the dates of reading the <i>Megillah:</i> Every town in Eretz Yisrael or abroad that was surrounded by a wall since the time of Joshua the son of Nun should read it on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, even if it has no wall at the present. Such a town is referred to as a walled city. Every town that was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua, even if it has a wall now, should read the <i>Megillah</i> on the fourteenth of <i>Adar</i>. Such a town is referred to as an open city.
Although the castle-city of Shushan was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua the son of Nun, the <i>Megillah</i> is read there on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, because it was there that the miracle occurred, as it is written: "They rested on the fifteenth" (Esther 9:18). This was made to depend on the days of Joshua in deference to Eretz Yisrael which was in ruins at that time. The inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael were to be considered residents of walled cities so as to read the <i>Megillah</i> at the same time as the residents of Shushan. Although Eretz Yisrael is still desolate, its residents are to read the <i>Megillah</i> on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i> in localities that used to be surrounded by defense walls during the period of Joshua. Eretz Yisrael is thus remembered in connection with the miracle of <i>Purim</i>.







The <i>Megillah</i> must not be read on the Sabbath. This is a precautionary measure, lest someone might take the <i>Megillah</i> to a skilled reader, transporting it four cubits or more through a public domain; for, though everyone is required to read the <i>Megillah</i>, not everyone is a skilled reader. For this reason, if the date for the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> falls on the Sabbath, it should be read prior to the Sabbath, while on the Sabbath itself the rules concerning <i>Purim</i> should be thoroughly discussed as a reminder that the day is <i>Purim</i>.
If, for example, the fourteenth falls on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of open towns should read the <i>Megillah</i> on the preceding Friday, while the inhabitants of walled cities should read it on Sunday, their normal time. If the fifteen occurs on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of fortified cities should read it earlier, on Friday, which is the fourteenth, while the inhabitants of open towns should read it on the same day, which is the normal time for them. In such a case, all will be reading the <i>Megillah</i> on the fourteenth.

Chapter 2



If a man read the <i>Megillah</i> by heart, he has not fulfilled his duty. If a speaker of a foreign tongue heard the <i>Megillah</i> read from a copy written in the Hebrew language and in Hebrew script, he has fulfilled his duty, even though he did not know what they said. Similarly, if the <i>Megillah</i> is written in Greek, and he heard it read, he has discharged his duty, even though he knows no Greek, and even if the listener is familiar with Hebrew.
If the <i>Megillah</i> is written in Aramaic or in some other foreign tongue, except Greek, only a person who is familiar with that tongue fulfills his duty by hearing it read.— —
If a man read the <i>Megillah</i> without due intention, he has not discharged his duty. If, for example, while copying the <i>Megillah</i>, or expounding it, or proof-reading it, he intended to fulfill his duty with this reading, he has discharged his obligation; if he did not so intend, he has not fulfilled his duty.— —







On these two days, namely the fourteenth and the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, lamentation and fasting are forbidden to anyone anywhere: to residents of walled cities who observe the fifteenth day only, and to residents of open towns who observe the fourteenth day only. Lamentation and fasting are forbidden on these two days of the first <i>Adar</i> and the second <i>Adar</i>.— —
Residents of villages and open towns are bidden to make the fourteenth day of <i>Adar</i>, and residents of walled cities the fifteenth, a day for rejoicing and feasting and sending presents to one another and gifts to the poor. Work is permitted; nevertheless it is improper to work on <i>Purim</i>. The sages have declared that anyone who works on <i>Purim</i> will never see a sign of success in that work.— —

One is required to distribute charity to the poor on <i>Purim</i>.— — The applicants for <i>Purim</i> money should not be scrutinized; it should be given to anyone who holds out his hand. <i>Purim</i> money must not be diverted to any other charity.
One should rather spend more money on gifts to the poor than on his <i>Purim</i> banquet and presents to his friends. No joy is greater and more glorious than the joy of gladdening the hearts of the poor, the orphans, the widows, and the strangers. He who gladdens the heart of these unhappy people imitates God, as it is written: "I am … to revive the spirit of the humble, and to put heart into the crushed" (Isaiah 57:15).
All Prophetic Books and the Sacred Writings will cease [to be recited in public] during the messianic era except the Book of Esther. It will continue to exist just as the Five Books of the Torah and the laws of the Oral Torah that will never cease. Although ancient troubles will be remembered no longer, as it is written: "The troubles of the past are forgotten and hidden from my eyes" (Isaiah 65:16), the days of <i>Purim</i> will not be abolished, as it is written: "These days of <i>Purim</i> shall never be repealed among the Jews, and the memory of them shall never cease from their descendants" (Esther 9:28).

Chapter 3

During the period of the second Temple, when the Greek kings were in power, they proclaimed decrees against the Jewish people, abrogating their religion and forbidding them to study the Torah or to perform the divine precepts. They laid their hands on their wealth and their daughters; they entered the Temple and broke through it, defiling the things that were pure. The people of Israel were sorely distressed by their enemies, who oppressed them ruthlessly until the God of our fathers took pity, saved and rescued them from the hands of the tyrants. The Hasmonean great priests won victories, defeating the Syrian Greeks and saving Israel from their power. They set up a king from among the priests and Israel's kingdom was restored for a period of more than two centuries, until the destruction of the second Temple.
When, on the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i>, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil.
Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i> should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called <i>Hanukkah</i>, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of <i>Purim</i>. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of <i>Hanukkah</i> is a religious duty imposed by the sages, like the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> on <i>Purim</i>.

Chapter 4












The precept of lighting the <i>Hanukkah</i> lamp is exceedingly precious, and one should carefully observe it in order to acclaim the miracle, ever praising and thanking God for the miracles which he has performed for us. Even if one has nothing to eat except what he gets from charity, he should borrow, or sell his garment, to buy oil and lamps and light them.

If a [poor] person must choose between Sabbath lights and <i>Hanukkah</i> lights, or between Sabbath lights and wine for <i>Kiddush</i>, the lighting of his home takes priority, so as to sustain peace in the house, since even the divine name was erased [in the oath of purgation—Numbers 5:12-31] to make peace between [a jealous] husband and his wife. Great is peace, since the entire Torah has been given to create peace in the world, as it is written: "Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace" (Proverbs 3:17).
