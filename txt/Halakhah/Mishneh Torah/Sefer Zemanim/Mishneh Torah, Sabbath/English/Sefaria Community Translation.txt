Mishneh Torah, Sabbath



Chapter 1

---
---
And any place where it is stated that one who does this thing is exempt (<i>patur</i>), [it means] that he is exempt from excision, from stoning and from a sacrifice; but it is [still] forbidden to do this thing on Shabbat, the prohibition being rabbinic (literally, from the words of the scribes). And it is a distancing from forbidden work [forbidden by the Torah itself]. And one who does it volitionally is struck with lashes of rebellion. Likewise, any place where it is stated, “We do not do such and such,” or “It is forbidden to do such and such on Shabbat”; one who does it volitionally is struck with lashes of rebellion.
---
Things that are permissible to do on Shabbat, but it is possible that while doing it, he will do forbidden work through them and it is also possible that the will not do so; if he does not have intention to do that particular work, it is permissible. How is this? A man may drag a bed, a chair or a bench and that which is similar to them on Shabbat, so long as he does not intend to dig a ditch in the ground at the time that he drags them. Hence if they dug a ditch into the ground, he need not be concerned, since he did not have intention [for it]. Likewise, a man may walk on top of grass on Shabbat, so long as he does not intend to uproot it. Hence if they are uprooted, he need not be concerned. And he may wash his hands with “fruit dust” and that which is similar to it, so long as he does not intend to remove the hair [on his hands]. Hence if they fall out, he need not be concerned. It is likewise permissible to enter a small breach on Shabbat even though he removes small pieces [of the wall]. And likewise with anything that he does not intend like this – it is permissible.
But if he did an act and forbidden work is done through it such that it is certain that it would be done from that act, he is liable [for it] even if he did not intend [to do the work]. For it is well-known that it is impossible that this work would not be done [through his act]. How is this? If one needs the head of a chicken for an infant to play with and he cuts off its head on Shabbat – even though his end purpose is not solely to kill the chicken – he is liable, since it is well-known that it is impossible to cut off the head of a living being and that it should live. Rather, death comes as a result of [his action]. And likewise with anything that is similar to this.
Anyone who does forbidden work on Shabbat even though he does not need the work itself is [nevertheless] liable for it. How is this? If he extinguishes a lamp because he needs the oil or the wick so that it not to be consumed, or so that it not be burned or that it should not crack the clay of the lamp – he is liable. For extinguishing is forbidden work and he intended to extinguish [it], even though he did not need the extinguishing itself, and he only extinguished it for the sake of the oil or for the sake of the clay or for the sake of the wick. Likewise, one who transports a thorn four ells in the public domain or extinguishes a coal so that the public is not hurt by them is liable. As even though he does not need the extinguishing itself or the transporting itself but rather [just wants] to remove the danger, he is liable. And likewise anything that is similar to this.
Anyone who intends to do forbidden work, but a different forbidden work that he did not intend is done [instead]; he is exempt for it, as he did not fulfill his thought. How is this? When he threw a stone or an arrow at his fellow or at an animal to kill them, and it went and uprooted a tree in its trajectory but it did not kill [the target], he is exempt. And it is an a fortiori case if he intends to do a lighter prohibition and he does a stringent prohibition. For example, if he intends to throw within a <i>karmelit</i> (a rabbinically defined public domain) and the stone reaches a public domain, he is exempt. And likewise, anything that is similar to this. If he intended to do something permissible and does something else – such as if he intends to cut detached [vegetation], but he cuts attached [vegetation] – he is not liable at all. And likewise anything that is similar to this. 
One who intended to pluck black figs but plucked [green] figs, or intended to first pluck figs and then grapes but the matter was switched and he plucked grapes first and then figs, is exempt. Even though he plucked all that he thought, since he did not pluck [them] in the order that he thought, he is exempt – as he did it without intention. For the Torah only prohibits thought out work (<i>melakhet machshevet</i>). 
When there are two lit lamps or two extinguished lamps in front of him and he intended to extinguish the one but extinguished [the other], or to light this one but he lit [the other], he is liable – as he did [the category] of the work that the thought to do. Behold what this resembles: One who intended to pluck this fig and he plucked [another]; or one who intended to kill this one and killed [another]. For you see that the forbidden work that he thought to do was done.
But if he intended to light [one] first and to then extinguish the [other one] after it, but the matter was switched and he first extinguished [the one] and then lit [the other] after it, he is exempt. [But] when he extinguished this one and lit [the other] one in one breath, he is liable. As even though he did not have the lighting precede, he surely did not delay it, but rather both of them were as one and he is therefore liable. And likewise anything that is similar to this. And anyone who does forbidden work while unaware (of his actions) and did not intend it is exempt.
Anyone who intends to do forbidden work, but more than his intention is done, is liable. [If] less than his intention [is done], he is exempt. How is this? If he intended to transport a load behind him and it came to be in front of him, he is liable. For he intended an inferior safekeeping [of the load] and it became a superior safekeeping. But if he intended to transport [it] in front of him and it came to be behind him, he is exempt. For he intended to transport it with a superior safekeeping and he transported it with an inferior safekeeping. And likewise anything that is similar to this.
When he is bound with a sash and he placed a load between his flesh and his cloak; whether this load, the way of which is to be transported in this way, comes to be in front of him or it comes to be behind him, he is liable. As it is its way [of carrying in this manner], that it shifts.
Anyone who intends to do forbidden work on Shabbat, begins it and does a [requisite] amount is liable – even if he does not finish all of the work that he intended to do. How is this? If he intended to write a letter or a deed on Shabbat, we do not say that he is not liable until he fulfills his intent and writes the whole bill or the whole letter. Rather, he is liable from when he writes two letters (of the Hebrew alphabet). Likewise if he intended to weave a whole garment, he is liable from when he weaves two threads. And even though his intention is to finish the garment, since he did the [requisite] amount with intention, he is liable. And likewise anything that is similar to this.
Any forbidden work that an individual can do by himself, but it is done by two in partnership – whether this one does part of it and that one part [of it], such as when one lifts up an object in this domain and the other puts it down in another domain; or whether the two of them did it together from beginning to end, such as when the two of them grabbed a quill and wrote or grabbed a loaf (of bread) and transported it from [one] domain to [another] domain – they are surely exempt.
But if neither of them is able to do it by himself unless they are combined, such as two that grabbed a beam and transported it to the public domain – since there is not enough strength in either of them to do it by himself and they did [the work] in partnership from beginning to end – they are both liable. And there is one [requisite] amount for both of them (i.e. as if they were one person). [But] if one of them had enough strength to transport it by himself, [yet] the two of them transported it [together], this first one who was able [to do it by himself] is liable, and the second one is [only considered] a helper – and a helper is not liable at all. And likewise anything that is similar to this.
All that damage are exempt. How is this? If he injured his fellow or an animal in a destructive way, and likewise if he tore clothing or burned them or broke vessels in a destructive way, he is surely exempt. When he dug a hole but only needs the dirt, this is damaging and he is [thus] exempt. Since his intention was to damage, even though he did forbidden work, he is exempt.
Anyone who damages in order to improve is liable. How is this? If he destroys [something] in order to build in its place, or erased in order to write in the place that he erased or dug a hole in order to build foundations in it, and likewise anything that is similar to this, he is liable. And their [requisite] amount is like the [requisite] amount of the one that improves [corresponding to that particular damage].
Anyone who does forbidden work on Shabbat, part of it inadvertently and part of it volitionally – whether he was volitional and in the end became inadvertent or he was inadvertent and in the end became volitional – is exempt. [But when] he would do the entire [requisite] amount of the forbidden work from beginning to end volitionally, he would then be liable for excision. And if it would be with witnesses and a warning, he [would be] liable for stoning. And [if] he would do the entire [requisite] amount of the forbidden work inadvertently from beginning to end, he would then be liable for a set sin-offering. 

Chapter 2















A woman who sat on the birthing chair and died - we bring a knife even from the public domain and cut open her womb and extract the fetus for it is possible that it still is alive. Safek nefashot (the possibility of saving life) pushes aside Shabbat even in this case where there is no presumption of life. 

Chapter 3



Chapter 4



Chapter 5

The kindling of a lamp on Shabbat is not optional that if one wants, one kindles and if one does not want, one does not kindle. And it is not a commandment that we are not obligated to pursue until one has done it, for example an eruv for courtyards or lifting (i.e. washing) the hands before eating; rather, it is an obligation. And both men and women are equally obligated that a lamp be kindled in their houses on Shabbat. Even if one does not have anything he will [be able to] eat, he begs at the doors [of neighbors] and takes oil and kindles the lamp since this is [included] in the rule of enjoyment on Shabbat. And one is obligated to bless before the kindling: "Blessed are You LORD our God, King of the universe who makes us holy with His commandments and commands us to kindle a Shabbat lamp" in the way that one blesses over all things which one is obligated [to do] by the words of the Sages.
It is permitted to use a Shabbat lamp. And this is [in the case] that the thing [one is doing] does not need much devotion. But if it is a thing that needs to be precise with regard to seeing, it is forbidden to use the light of the lamp for distinguishing - it is a decree lest one tilt [the lamp].
The one who kindles need to kindle while it is still day, before the sunset. And women are commanded regarding this matter more than men since they are found in the house, and they busy themselves with the labor of the house. And even so, a man needs to take care and check them on this and say to the members of the household on the eve of Shabbat before it gets dark, "Kindle the lamp!" If it is doubtful [whether] darkness has fallen and [whether] Shabbat has entered or [whether it has] not, one does not kindle.
From the setting of the sun until three medium stars appear, this is the time that is called "<i>bein ha-shamashot</i> in every place. And it is doubtful whether it is day or it is night. And we rule strictly regarding it in every case. And therefore, we do not light during it. And the one who does creative work <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> on the eve of the Sabbath or on the going out of the Sabbath unintentionally is obligated in a Chatat offering in every case. And these stars are not the big ones that appear during the day, nor the small ones that do not appear other than during the night, but rather the medium ones. And from the appearance of these three medium stars, behold this is certainly night.

Chapter 6

It is forbidden to say to a non-Jew to do labor for us on Shabbat despite that he was not commanded regarding Shabbat and despite that he said to him [to do the labor] before Shabbat and despite that there is no need for this labor other than [until] after Shabbat. And this matter is forbidden according to the words of the Rabbis so that Shabbat will not be light in their eyes and they will come to do [labor] themselves.

Chapter 7





The Subcategory is a Melachah that resembles one of these primary categories [of prohibited Melachah]. What is the case? A person who cuts a vegetable into small [pieces] to cook it, is liable, for this act is in the category of Grinding. Because, when a person grinds, he takes one [large] entity, and divides it into many parts. Anyone who does an act that resembles this is [transgressing] the subcategory of [the Melachah of] Grinding. Similarly, one who takes a strip of metal and rubs at it to get its powder, as goldsmiths do, this is [transgressing] the subcategory of [the Melachah of] Grinding.

Chapter 8















One who grinds [the size of] a dried fig is liable. One who crushes spice or herbs in a mortar is transgressing [the Melachah] of grinding and is held liable. One who cuts a vegetable that has been detached [from the ground] Transgresses the subcategory of [Melachah] of Grinding. So too, one who saws wood in order to benefit from its sawdust, or, one who files a piece of metal is liable [for transgressing Grinding] as soon as he filed any amount. One who chops wood is not liable [for Grinding] until he make small pieces of it, enough to cook an fig size amount of egg.

Chapter 9



Chapter 10



Chapter 11



Chapter 12








Going out and coming in from domain to domain is a creative labor from among the fundamental creative labors. And even though this matter is with the entire body of Torah was said from the mouth of Moses from Sinai [i.e. orally], behold, it [also] says in the Torah: "Man or woman shall not do any further creative labor for the sacred donations, and the people ceased from bringing" (Exodus 36:6). From this you learn that bringing is called a creative labor. And similarly they learn from the oral teaching that the one who transfers an object in the public domain from the beginning of four [cubits] to the end of four, he is like the one  brings out from domain to domain and is liable.
The one who brings [something] out from domain to domain is not liable until he brings a useful amount out from the private domain to the public domain or from the public domain to the private domain and removes [it] from this domain and places [it] in a second domain. But if he removed and did not place or placed and did not remove or he brought out less than the amount, he is exempt. And similarly, the one who moves [something] from the beginning of the four [cubits] to the end of of the four [cubits] in a public domain is not liable until he removes the amount from this side and places it on this side.
The one who throws from domain to domain or who reaches [from one domain to another], behold this is a derivative [creative labor] of bringing out and he is liable. And similarly, the one who throws or reaches with his hand from the beginning of the four [cubits] to the end of the four [cubits], behold this is a derivative of bringing out and he is liable. And the one who throws backhandedly [i.e. in an unusual way] is exempt.

Chapter 13



Chapter 14

1 ---
2 Even vessels, such as a boat, a wooden closet, a beehive or that which is similar to them – if they have four square [handbreadths] by the height of ten [handbreadths] or more – are surely full-fledged private domains.
3 The width of the walls of a private domain is [considered] like a private domain – it creates a separation for others, does it not all the more so create a separation for itself? The airspace of a private domain is like a private domain up until the firmament. But the airspace of a public domain in only like a public domain up until ten handbreadths. However the airspace of the public domain above ten is an exempt space.
4 ---
5 The airspace of a <i>carmelit</i> is like a <i>carmelit</i> up until ten handbreadths. But above ten handbreadths, the airspace of the <i>carmelit</i> is surely an exempt space. Hence the airspace over the water in the seas and the rivers is like the airspace of a <i>carmelit</i> up to ten handbreadths and an exempt space above ten. But all the full depths of the waters are surely [considered] like thick ground.
6 A pit in a <i>carmelit</i> is surely like a <i>carmelit</i>, even [if] it is a hundred ells deep – so long as it does not [encompass] four [by four handbreadths]. A public domain that is roofed over or that it not sixteen ells wide is surely like a <i>carmelit</i>. A bench between the pillars that are standing in the public domain is surely like a <i>carmelit</i>. And the sides of a public domain are [also] like a <i>carmelit</i>. But between the pillars is a public domain, since the public treads between them.
7 --- Even thorns and thistles or dung in the public domain that are three [handbreadths] high but their width is not four by four are surely exempt spaces. And likewise a ditch that is not four by four [handbreadths] and its depth is from three to the abyss. Likewise, a surrounded place that is not four by four – even if its length was a thousand <i>mil</i>, but its width was four less a barley seed – and its height was three and above – it is surely a public space. Likewise, the airspace of a public space and the airspace of a <i>carmelit</i> – above ten – is surely an exempt space.
8 A place in a public domain that is exactly nine handbreadths tall – not more and not less – is surely like a public domain. And we do not concern ourselves with the measure of its length or the measure of its width – whether it is broad or thin – since the public puts down their loads upon it. But if it was more or less than nine: If it has four by four [handbreadths] or more, it is surely a <i>carmelit</i>. But if it does not have four by four [handbreadths], it is an exempt space. 
9 A roof that is within ten handbreadths [from the ground, and] adjacent to a public domain: Since the public puts down their loads upon it, the roof is [considered like a public domain and] forbidden to carry upon – until a fixed ladder is made for it to render it permissible. A pillar in a public domain that is ten [handbreadths] tall and four wide is surely a private domain. [If] one inserted a minimal peg into it – even if it is not three [handbreadths] high – since it is fitting to hang [items] on it, it surely reduces [the pillar] and it becomes a <i>carmelit</i>. And we only measure [the pillar] from the peg and upwards. And even if he filled it completely [with] pegs, it [still] surely reduces its height, for we hang [things] upon the pegs and use them.
10 Holes [in walls, adjacent] to the private domain are like the private domain. But holes [in walls, adjacent] to the public domain are not like the public domain, but are rather [defined] according to their measurements. How is this? A hole on the side of the public domain: If it has four by four [handbreadths] and it is ten high, it is surely a private domain. But if it is not ten high, it is surely a <i>carmelit</i>. However, if it does not have four by four [handbreadths], it is surely an exempt space. And that is when it is [at least] three high, as anything less than three is like the ground.
11 --- But if he moved or extended or threw beyond four ells, he is liable in a public domain, but exempt in a <i>carmelit</i>. For the prohibition of the <i>carmelit</i> is only [rabbinic], on account of its being similar to a public domain, lest it be confused with a public domain. Hence if he did not need the carrying itself – such as one who moves a thorn in a <i>carmelit</i> so that the public not be hurt by it – it is surely permissible. [This is so] even if he moved it several ells. And likewise anything that is similar to this.  
12 ---
13 ---
14 One who removes [something] from a private domain to [another] private domain or from a public domain to [another] public domain and there was a <i>carmelit</i> in between is exempt. And likewise one who extends or throws from one to the other and there was a <i>carmelit</i> in between is exempt. One who removes an object from a public domain to a <i>carmelit</i> and puts it down there and [then] proceeds to pick it up from the <i>carmelit</i> and brings it into a private domain; or removed it from a private domain to a <i>carmelit</i> and puts it down there and [then] proceeds and lifts it up from the <i>carmelit</i> and takes it out to a public domain – he is surely exempt.
15 One who removes [something] from a private domain to [another] private domain or from a public domain to [another] public domain and passed on his walk through an exempt space that was in between is liable. And it is not necessary to say [this] about one who throws, when the object passed through an exempt space – as he is not considered as one who rested there. [If] he was standing in an exempt place and he took an object from the private domain or from a person standing there and he put it down in a public domain or in the hand of a person standing there, he is exempt. Likewise, if he brought [something] in from a public domain to a private domain, but he stood in an exempt space, he is exempt.
16 A pillar in the public domain that is ten [handbreadths] high and four wide but does not have [this width] at its base – and [this] narrow end of it is three [handbreadths] tall – is [nevertheless] surely a private domain. So if he threw [something] from the public domain and it landed upon it, he is liable. A mound that slopes ten handbreadths [of height] within four ells is surely a private domain. So if he threw [something] from the public domain and it landed upon it, he is liable. 
17 [If] one inserted a reed into [the ground of] a private domain – even if it a hundred ells high – and threw [something] from the public domain and it landed upon it, he is liable – as a private domain rises to the firmament. [In the case of] a tree that stands in a private domain but its branches stretch to a public domain, and one threw [something] and it landed on the branches, he is exempt – as the branches do not follow the trunk [in the determination of their location]. 
18 [If] one inserted a reed into [the ground of] a public domain and there was a basket on top of it and he threw [something] from the public domain and it landed upon it, he is exempt – as a public domain only rises ten [handbreadths]. One who throws an object four ells in a public domain and it lands on the wall – such as [if] he threw animal fat or dough and it cleaved to the wall: If it cleaved above ten handbreadths, it is like throwing in the air – as above ten handbreadths in a public domain is an exempt space. [But if] it cleaved below ten handbreadths, it is like throwing on the ground, so he is liable. [If] he threw above ten and it landed in a minimal hole, he is exempt. 
19 [If] one threw a reed or a spear [that was more than ten handbreadths long] from a private domain to a public domain [and it landed vertically on its point], he is exempt. For part of it is in an exempt space. [If] he threw a vessel from a private domain into a public domain but that vessel was big, such that it consisted of four by four over a height of ten, he is exempt – since this vessel is [itself,] fully a public domain. And it comes out that he is like one who removes [something] from a private domain to a private domain. 
20 [In the case of] a pit of nine [handbreadths] in a public domain, [if] he removed a layer from its bottom and made it into ten, he is exempt – even though the removal of the object and the making of the partition [required to make it a private domain] come together. For the wall was not ten at the beginning. [If] the pit was ten and he cast a layer [of dirt] and reduced it from being ten, he is exempt. For the landing of the item and the removal of the partition come together.
21 [In the case of] one who throws a board and it lands upon the top of pegs in a public domain and [the board thereby] becomes a private domain, he is exempt – even if there was a vessel on top of the board. For the making of the partition and the landing of the vessel came together.
22 [In the case of] a pit that was ten [handbreadths] deep and eight wide in a public domain, [if] one threw a mat from the public domain and divided the pit into two through [the middle of] its width, he is exempt. For the partitions were nullified with the landing of the [mat], such that each [part] of it was less than four by four.
23 [In the case of a pit in the public domain that was ten [handbreadths] deep and four wide [and] full of water, [if] he threw an object and it landed upon the water, he is liable – since the water does not nullify the partitions. [If] it was full of produce, he is exempt – for the produce reduced [the pit’s] measurements.
24 [In the case of] a swamp that passes through a public domain and the public walks through it: If its depth is not ten handbreadths, it is surely like a public domain. [This is the case] whether its width was even four ells or whether its width was only four handbreadths, such that most of the people skip over it and do not walk through it – since its depth is not ten, it is surely a public domain. But if its depth is ten or more, it is like a <i>carmelit</i>, like the other [bodies of] water. And that is when its width is four handbreadths or more than that – as a <i>carmelit</i> is not less than four.  

Chapter 15

1 [In the case of] one standing in a public domain, he may carry within the entire [adjacent] private domain. And [if] he is standing in the private domain, he may carry within the public domain so long as he does not move it more than four ells. But if he does move it further, he is exempt - as he is standing in a different domain. Likewise, one standing in a private domain, may open [a lock] in a public domain; in a public domain, may open [a lock] in a private domain. We may force a beast, that is mostly outside but its head is inside, to eat from the trough. But not a camel, until its head and most of it is inside - since it has a long neck.
2 One should not stand in a private domain and drink in a public domain; in a public domain and drink in a private domain - unless he brings his head and most of himself into the [domain] in which he is drinking. To what are these words applicable? When he drinks with fine vessels which he needs. [It is] a decree lest he take them out. But if the vessels were not fine, such that he does not need them; or the well was in a <i>karmelit</i> - even if the vessels were fine - he may bring only his head in there and drink where he is. [He may do so,] even though he has not put his head and most of himself there.
3 [In the case of] a man standing in a public domain, he may collect water that is flowing from a gutter or from a wall in the air, so long as he does not touch the pipe or the wall and take in [the water] on top of them. But if he did touch [them], if the place that he touched was above ten [handbreadths and] less than three [handbreadths] from the roof, it is surely forbidden - as it comes out that he is removing [it] from the roof which is a private domain. Likewise if there were four [handbreadths] by four [handbreadths] in the gutter - whether the gutter was within ten [handbreadths] or above ten [handbreadths] - and he took in water from it, it is surely forbidden. And why is he not liable? Because the water did not rest [before he took it], but is continually flowing.
4 [In the case of] a ledge in front of a window that protrudes into the airspace above a public domain: If it is above ten [handbreadths], it is permissible to make use of it, as a public domain only includes ten handbreadths. Hence it is permissible to make use of the whole wall [above] the bottom ten handbreadths.
5 To what are these words applicable? When there was one ledge protruding into the airspace. But if there were two ledges protruding one below the other, even though they are both above ten [handbreadths] - if there is an area of four [handbreadths] by four [handbreadths] in the upper ledge in front of the window - it is forbidden to use it, because it is its own domain and the ledge below it is a different domain. So they forbid one another [from being used], as two domains may not be used as one domain.
6 [In a case when] there is not four [handbreadths] in the top one nor four [handbreadths] in the bottom one, one may use both of them; and likewise with the entire wall until the bottom ten handbreadths. [If] there were four [handbreadths] in the bottom one, but not four [handbreadths] in the top one, he may only use the top one exclusively in front of the window. But it is forbidden to use the rest of the ledge on either side of the window because of the one beneath it which creates its own domain. 
7 [In] every case that it is permitted to use a ledge that protrudes into the airspace of the public domain; when one uses it, he may only bring in or take out clay or glass vessels or that which is similar to them - such that if they fall into the public domain, they would break. But other vessels and foods are forbidden, lest they fall into the public domain, and he fetch them.
8 [In the case of] two houses on two sides of the public domain, [if] one threw from this one to that one above ten [handbreadths], he is exempt (it is permissible). And that is when both are his or there is an <i>eruv</i> between them. And it is even permitted to throw clothes and metal vessels (that do not break). But if this one was higher than that one and they were not even, it is forbidden to throw clothing and that which is similar to it, lest if fall and he fetch it. But he may throw clay vessels and that which is similar to them.
9 [In the case of] a well in a public domain and a window above it, the well and its wall combine to [create a height] of ten [handbreadths] (thereby making the well into a private domain); so we may fill [water] from it on Shabbat. To what are these words applicable? When [the window] was close to the wall within four handbreadths, such that a person cannot pass through there. But if it was distant, we may not fill [water] from it, unless its wall was ten [handbreadths] tall; such that it comes out that when the bucket came out from the wall, it went out to an exempt space (the air over the public domain).
10 [In the case of] a dumping ground ten handbreadths tall in a public domain with a window over it, we may dump water onto it [from the window] on Shabbat. To what are these words applicable? To a public dumping ground, such that its way is not to be cleared. But we do not dump onto a private dumping ground [in a public domain], lest it be cleared and it will come out that they are dumping [directly] into the public domain [and not onto the private domain that was formed by the height of the dumping ground].
11 [In the case of] a conduit of water that runs through a courtyard: If it is ten handbreadths tall and four handbreadths wide or more - up to ten ells - we only fill [water] from it on Shabbat if they made a partition ten handbreadths tall for it at its entrance and at its exit. But if it does not have a height of ten or a width of of four, we may fill from it without [such] a partition.
12 [If] its width was more then ten ells - even if its height was less than ten [handbreadths] - we do not fill from it until one makes a partition for it. For any more than ten [ells] is a breach and negates the partitions [of the courtyard]. And what about [the permissibility of] carrying in the whole courtyard? If there remains at the edge of the breach a board from here and a board from there of the smallest amount, or a board four handbreadths wide on one side, it is permissible to carry in the whole courtyard; and the only prohibition is exclusively to fill from the conduit. But if no board remained at all, it is forbidden to carry in the whole courtyard; as the courtyard is breached to the ocean, which is a <i>carmelit</i>. 
13 And how do we place the partition into the water? If it is above the water, a handbreadth of the partition needs to be submerged into the water. And if the partition is completely submerged in the water, a handbreadth from it needs to rise out above the water, so that the water in the courtyard be separated. Even though the partition does not reach the ground [at the bottom], it is permissible since it has ten handbreadths. And they only permitted [such] a suspended partition exclusively in the water. For the prohibition to carry in the water is from the words [of the Sages], and they [are the ones] that were lenient about [such] a partition that is only to make a marker.
14 [In the case of] a conduit of water passing between two courtyards with windows open to it: If it it does not have like the [requisite] measure [to make it a separate domain], we may bring down a pail from the windows and fill from it on Shabbat. To what are these words applicable? When it is not three handbreadths removed from the wall. But if it  is three handbreadths removed from the wall, we do not fill from it unless boards jut out from the walls from here and from there. For [then] it comes out that it is as if the conduit passes through the courtyard. 
15 [In the case of] a balcony above the water with a window over the water: We may not fill from it on Shabbat unless they made a partition ten handbreadths tall over the water opposite the window of the balcony, or there be a partition descending from the balcony opposite the water. [If the latter,] we see it as if it descended and touched the water. And in the same way that we fill from the one for which they made a partition, so too do we dump [from the window] to the [water] - as behold they are [only] dumping into a <i>karmelit</i>.
16 [In the case of] a courtyard smaller than four ells by four ells, we may not dump water into it on Shabbat, because it quickly goes out into the public domain. Therefore one needs to make a cavity that holds two <i>seah</i> in the courtyard or in the public domain at the side of the courtyard, so that the water will accumulate there. And one must [also] build a dome on top of the pit on the outside, so that they not see this pit in the public domain. And a courtyard and a veranda combine to [constitute] four ells. And how [big] is a place that holds two <i>seah</i>? Half an ell by half an ell over a height of three-fifths of an ell. 
17 [If] the pit was less than two <i>seah</i>, we may dump into it [up to] its fill. [If] it holds two <i>seah</i>, we dump even sixty <i>seah</i> of water into it - even though the water will [flood it] and spread from the cavity outwards. To what are these words applicable? To the rainy season, when the courtyards are in disrepair and regular gutters are flowing [into the public domain]; such that onlookers will not say that [the owner of the courtyard] is using the public domain, and that the water is coming into the public domain from the force of his [actions]. But during the dry season, we only dump  two <i>seah</i> if it held two <i>seah</i>; [and if it held] less than two <i>seah</i>, we do not dump into it at all.
18 [In the case of] a drainage ditch into which we dump water and it goes out into the public domain; and likewise a gutter into the opening of which we dump water and it flows onto the wall and falls into the public domain: Even if the length of the wall or the underground path [of the ditch] is a hundred ells, it is forbidden to dump into the opening of the ditch or into the opening of the gutter because the water goes out from the force of his [actions] into the public domain. Rather, one may dump [water] outside of the ditch, and it drops into the ditch [on its own]. 
19 To what are these words applicable? To the dry season. But in the rainy season, one may dump and [dump] again and not withhold [from doing so]. For regular gutters are flowing [at this time] and a man [does not mind] if the water is absorbed in its place (his courtyard, as it is full of water regardless). [If] he was dumping into the opening of the ditch and the waters go out to a <i>karmelit</i>, it is surely permissible - even in the dry season - as they did not make a decree about the force of his [actions] in a <i>karmelit</i>. Hence it is permissible to dump [water] onto the walls of a ship and it falls into the sea.
20 A man may not fill water from the sea when he is in a ship unless he made a space of four [handbreadths] by four [handbreadths] protruding from the ship over the sea. To what are these words applicable? When he was within ten [handbreadths from the water]. But if he was above ten from the sea, he may put out a ledge of the smallest size and fill - as behold, he fills [water by pulling it] through an exempt space. And he only needs the ledge as a marker. 
21 [In the case of] one reading a scroll in a <i>karmelit</i> and some of the scroll unraveled into the public domain and some of it was [still] in his hand: If it unraveled outside of four ells [in the public domain], he turns it over on the writing (face down) and leaves it. [This is] a decree, lest all of it slip from his hand and he move it four ells. [But if] it unraveled within four ells, he rolls it towards him Likewise, if it unravels into a private domain, he rolls it towards him. [If] he was reading in a private domain and it unraveled into a public domain: If it came to rest there, he turns it over on the writing. But if it did not rest, but was rather suspended in the airspace of the public domain and did not reach the ground, he rolls it towards him.
22 [In the case of] one who moves a thorn in order that the public not be injured: If he was in the public domain, he moves it repeatedly less than four ells. But if he was in a <i>karmelit</i>, he moves it according to its [usual] way, even a hundred ells. Likewise, [in the case of] a dead body that became putrid and very humiliated and the neighbors could not stand it, we may move it from a private domain to a <i>karmelit</i>. [In the case of] one who goes down to bathe in the sea: When he emerges, he must dry himself, lest he move the water that is upon him four ells in a <i>karmelit</i>.

Chapter 16

1 [In the case of] a place that was enclosed not for residence but its use is rather for the space, such as gardens or orchards or, for example if one encloses a piece of land to guard it or similar to these: If the height of the partitions is ten handbreadths or more, it is surely a private domain that brings liability to the one who transports or throws or extends from it to a a public domain, or from a public domain to within it. And we are only allowed to carry throughout it if its [area] is a <i>beit seatayim</i> or less. But if its [area] is more than a <i>beit seatayim</i>, it is forbidden to carry more than four ells, like a <i>karmelit</i>.
2 Likewise, [in the case of] a column ten handbreadths tall and up to a <i>beit seatayim</i> [large], we may carry upon the whole thing. [But if] it was [larger] than a <i>beit seatayim</i>, we may only carry upon it within four ells. In the case of a boulder in the sea: If it was less than ten, we may carry from it into the sea, and from the sea into it, as it is all a <i>karmelit</i>. [If] it was ten tall: If its [size] was from four handbreadths to a <i>beit seatayim</i> - since it is permissible to carry on all of it, we may not carry from within it to the sea nor from the sea to within it. If it was more than a <i>beit seatayim</i>, even though it is a private domain - since it is forbidden to carry more than four ells, like a <i>karmelit</i>, it is surely permissible to carry from within it to the sea and from the sea to within it. For this is something not common, so they did not decree about it. 
3 How much is <i>beit seah</i>? Fifty ells by fifty ells (2500 square ells). It comes out that a <i>beit seatayim</i> (an area of two <i>seah</i>) is a place that is multiplied to have 5ooo [square] ells. And any place that has this measure - whether it was a square, which is seventy ells and a fraction by seventy ells and a fraction or it was a circle or any other form - is surely called a <i>beit seatayim</i>. 
4 [In the case of] a place that was enclosed not for residence that has [an area of] a <i>beit seatayim</i>: If its length was twice its width - so that it would be a hundred by fifty, like the courtyard of the Tabernacle - it is permissible to carry in the whole thing. But if its length was more than twice it width [by] even one ell, we may only carry within four ells - as they only [derived the measure of] <i>beit seatayim</i> for the usage of the space to be like other courtyards from the courtyard of the Tabernacle. 
5 [In the case of] a place that was enclosed not for the sake of residence: If one opened up a breach over ten ells with a height of ten handbradths, and he [then] enclosed it for residence to ten [handbreadths of height], it is permissible to carry in the whole thing. And even [if] he breached an ell and enclosed it for residence and breached [another] ell and enclosed it for residence [and so forth], until he completed it to [be] more than ten [ells], it is permissible to carry in the whole thing - even though it is several <i>mil</i>. 
6 [In the case of] a place [the area of which is] more than a <i>beit seatayim</i> that was enclosed for residence: If most of it was sown, it is like a garden; and it is forbidden to carry in the whole thing. If its lesser part was sown: If [up to] a <i>beit seatayim</i> of it was sown, it is permissible to carry in the whole thing. But if the place that was sown was more than a <i>beit seatayim</i>, it is forbidden to carry in the whole thing. [If, however,] he planted trees in most of it, it is like a courtyard, and it it is permissible to carry in the whole thing. [If] it became full of water - even if it was very deep: If it was fitting to use, it is like saplings and it is permitted to carry in the whole thing. But if it is not fitting for use, we may only carry within four ells.
7 [In the case of] a place that was enclosed not for the sake of residence that has [an area of] three <i>seah </i> and they roofed the area of a <i>seah </i>, the roof makes it permissible [to carry in the whole area], as the edge of the roof [acts as if it] descends and seals [the roofed area, thereby making the area without the roof small enough to permit carrying there as well. If such a large enclosure] was completely open to a courtyard, but the courtyard was [only] open across from it, the courtyard remains permissible, and the enclosure remains forbidden - since the airspace of the courtyard does not render it permissible.
8 [If] it was larger than a <i>beit seatayim</i>, and one wants to reduce [its size] with trees, it is not [considered] a reduction. [If] he built a pillar next to the wall ten [handbreadths] tall and three or more wide, it is surely a reduction. [But] less than three is not a reduction. For anything less than three is [considered] as if it is joined together. Likewise if he goes a distance of three from the wall and makes a [new] partition, it is a reduction. [But if it] less than three, he has not done anything.
9 [If] one plastered the wall with mud - even though it cannot stand on its own - it is surely a reduction. [In the case of a mesa: If] he went a distance of three [handbreadths] from the [edge of the] mesa, it is effective. [If] he made a partition at the edge of the mesa, it is not effective. For [if] one makes a partition on top of a partition [and the mesa wall is already considered a partition], it is not effective. [If] the bottom partition becomes submerged, whereas the top one remains - given that the top one was made for residence and it is the only one visible, it is surely effective; so it is permissible to carry in the whole thing.
10 [In the case of] a yard behind houses larger than a <i>beit seatayim</i>, we may only carry within four [ells] - and even if there was an entrance of the house opening into it. But if he opened an entrance into it, and enclosed [the yard] afterwards, it is surely encircled for residence; so it is permissible to carry in the whole thing.
11 [In the case of] a yard open to the city on one side and open to a path leading to the river on the other side, one can make a post for it on the side of the city and it would [then] be permissible to carry within the whole thing, from within it to the city and from the city to within it.
12 [In the case of] an individual who is spending Shabbat in a glen, and he made make a partition around it: If its area is up to a <i>beit seatayim</i>, he may carry in the whole thing. But if it was more than a <i>beit seatayim</i>, he may not carry within it more than four ells. Likewise if there were two [there]. But three Israelites and up that were spending Shabbat in a glen are surely [considered] a caravan, so they can carry for all of their needs - even [over] several <i>mil</i>. And that is when there is not a <i>beit seatayim</i> free of vessels within the partition [with which] they enclosed [the area]. But if there remained a <i>beit seatayim</i> free of vessels and they did not need [this free space], they are forbidden from carrying more than four ells in the whole [area enclosed by the] partition. And a minor does not [count] for [the requisite number of Israelites that make] a caravan.
13 [If] three enclose [an area] according to their needs and establish [it as] the place of [their] Shabbat residence but one of them dies afterwards [on Shabbat], they are surely permitted to carry in the whole thing. [If] two establish a place of Shabbat residence that is more than a <i>beit seatayim</i> and a third comes afterwards to [join] them [on Shabbat], they are forbidden from carrying more than four ells - as they were before this one came. For the establishment of Shabbat residence determines [the number present], not the [actual] residents.
14 [In a case of] three places enclosed not for the sake of residence - one next to each other - [wherein] the two outer ones are wide and the middle one is narrow, such that it comes out that the two outer ones have boards from this [side] and that [side]; and there was an individual in this one, an individual in that one and an individual in the [third] one, they become like a caravan and we give them all of their needs [in terms of carrying. But if] the middle one was wide and the two outer ones narrow, such that it comes out that the middle one is with boards in both directions, it is surely divided from the two outer ones. Hence if an individual establishes his Shabbat residence in this one, an individual establishes his Shabbt residence in that one and an individual establishes his residence in the [third] one, we do not give them all of their needs. Rather, each and every one has [up to] a <i>beit seatayim</i> in his place. [If, however,] there was an individual in this one, an individual in that one, but two in the middle one; or two in this one, two in that one and one in the middle one, we give them all of their needs. 
15 Any partition unable to withstand a common wind is not [considered] a partition. And [so too] a partition that is not made for [resting items upon it] is not a partition. And a partition that is only made for modesty is [also] not a partition. And a partition that does not have a height of ten handbreadths or more is not a full-fledged partition. An embankment of five [handbreadths] and a partition of five combine [to be considered a partition].
16 Any partition in which the breach is more than what is standing is not [considered] a partition. But if the breach is the same as what is standing, it is surely a partition. And that is only when there is not, among the breaches, a breach that is more than ten ells. But ten ells is surely like an entrance. [However] if this breach has the outline of an entrance (two sides and a top, as in paragraph 19 below), it does not spoil the partition - even if it is more than ten. And that is when the breach is not more than what is standing.
17 To what are these words applicable? When the breaches are from three handbreadths and up. However if each one of the breaches was less than three, it is permissible - even though the breach is more than what is standing. For anything less than three is like it is joined together. 
How is this? Behold, [if] one enclosed [an area] with poles and there is not three handbreadths between one pole and another; or if one enclosed [it] with ropes and there is not three between one rope and another - that is surely a full-fledged partition, even though it is only vertical without the horizontal, or horizontal without the vertical.  But the height of the poles must be ten; or if one enclosed with ropes, the height from the ground to the top rope must be ten - as a partition cannot be less than ten. And all of these measurements are a law given to Moses at Sinai.
19 An outline of an opening, discussed in every place, is even a reed or that which is similar to it from this [side] and a reed from that [side] and a reed on top of them. The height of both of the posts is ten or more handbreadths. [If] the reed or what is similar to it on top of them does not touch the posts - but there is rather several ells between them - since the height of the posts is ten, it is surely an outline of an opening. And the outline of an opening that they discussed needs to be sturdy [enough] to hold a door - even if the door is [only] from straw.
20 [In the case of] an entrance the outline of which is an arch: If the length of the base (the sides before they arch) of the arch is ten handbreadths, it is surely the outline of an entrance. But the opening of an entrance that one made on the side is nothing - as it is not the way of entrances to be in a corner, but rather in the middle [of a partition]. 
21 We may make partitions with everything; whether with vessels, with foods, with a person, even with a beast and other types of animals or fowl - and that is when they are bound, so that they do not move. 
22 A partition erected on its own is [considered] a partition. And [also] a partition formed on Shabbat is surely a partition. And if it was formed inadvertently, it is permissible to carry within it [even] that Shabbat - and that is when it was formed without the knowledge of the one carrying. But if one had the intention that this partition would be formed on Shabbat, so as to carry within it - even though the one who formed it, formed it inadvertently - it is forbidden to carry within it that Shabbat. Likewise, if it was formed volitionally - even though it was not intended by this one to carry within it - it is surely forbidden to carry within it. 
23 It is permissible [for a person] to form a partition of people on Shabbat, such that one stand next to the other - so long as the ones standing do not know that [the first] one positioned them [in such a way] to have them form a partition. But the one who wants to use the partition may not position them. Rather another one may position them without his knowledge.
24 [In the case of] a tree that hovers over the ground: If its branches are three handbreadths from the ground, one may fill in straw and hay and that which is similar to them between its boughs and leaves and tie them to the ground until it is [able to] withstand a common wind and not move - and he may [then] carry under the entire thing. But if it had [an area of] more than a <i>beit seatayim</i>, we may only carry under it within four ells. For under [this tree] is a place that was enclosed not for residence. 

Chapter 17

1 An alley that has three walls is called a closed alley. But an alley that only has two walls that are across from each other - and the people enter from this direction and exit in the one across from it - is called an open alley. 
2 How do we permit [carrying in] a closed alley? One makes a post for it or a beam on top of it in the fourth direction, and that is sufficient for it. And that beam or that post is considered as if it closes the fourth direction and makes it into a private domain, such that it would be permissible to carry in the whole thing. For the law of the Torah is that it is permissible to carry within three partitions alone; and the fourth direction is [only] from the words of the scribes (rabbinic). So therefore, it is sufficient with a post or a beam. 
3 And how do we permit an open alley? One makes the outline of an entrance from [this open] side, and a post or a beam on [the opposing open] side. And the status of a bent alley is like an open one.
4 An alley that is flat within it but sloped to the public domain, or flat to the public domain but sloped within it, does not require a post nor a beam - for it is surely separated from the public domain.
5 An alley one side of which ends onto the sea and one side of which ends onto a public dumping ground does not require anything [to permit it]. For a public dumping ground is not given to being cleared and we do not concern ourselves lest the sea raise up a sand embankment. 
6 [In the case of] an open alley which ends onto the middle of a public yard: If it is not across from the entrance of the yard, it is surely closed and does not require anything on the fourth side. But if it ends onto the sides of the yard, it is forbidden. And if it was [the yard] of an individual, it is prohibited even onto the middle. [For] sometimes, [an individual] builds on one side, and it comes out that [the alley] ends onto [what, as a result of the building, has become] the side of the yard.
7 An alley is only made permissible with a [single] post or a beam if it has houses and courtyards opening into it, it be longer than four ells and its length be more than its width. But an alley the length of which is like its width is surely [considered] a courtyard; so it is only made permissible with two posts in both directions - each post being of the smallest [width] - or with a board four [handbreadths wide] from one direction. 
8 A courtyard the length of which is more than its width is surely like an alley; so it is permitted with a [single] post or a beam. But an alley into which houses and courtyards do not open, such as if there is only one house or one courtyard on it; and likewise an alley the length of which is not [minimally] four ells - is only made permissible with two posts or a board of four [handbreadths] and a bit.
9 An alley that does not have a width of three handbreadths does not need a post or beam to make it permissible to carry in the whole thing. As anything less than three [handbreadths] is like it is joined [together]. Even though it is permitted to carry in an entire alley that is made permissible with a beam, one who throws from it to a public domain or from a public domain into it is exempt. For a beam is made as a marker (so it does not make the alley into a full-fledged private domain). But if it is made permissible with a post, one who throws from it to a public domain or from a public domain into it is liable. For a post is surely like a partition in the fourth direction (making it into a full-fledged private domain).
10 How can we render fit [the area] between two walls, with people walking between them, in the public domain? One makes doors on this [side] and doors on that [side]. And afterwards a private domain is made between them. And one need not lock the doors at night, but they have to be fit to be locked. [Hence] if they were submerged in the dirt, he must clear them and fix them to be locked. But the outline of an entrance, a post or a beam are not effective to render a public domain fit [to change its status and permit carrying].
11 It is permissible to carry in an alley under the beam or between the posts. To what are these words applicable? When it is adjacent to a public domain. But if it is adjacent to a <i>karmelit</i>, it is forbidden to carry under the beam or between the posts until one makes another post within the opening. For 'a type has found its own type and is awakened' (meaning that since the area under the beam or between the posts and the <i>karmelit</i> are both areas undefined by the Torah, the former takes on the identity of the latter).
12 We may make posts with anything, even with something living, and even with that from which it is prohibited to benefit. [Hence] an actual idol or tree-god (<i>asherah</i>) that one made into a post is fit, since its [required] thickness is the smallest amount (such that the requirement to destroy it does not impinge upon any need for a horizontal dimension). The height of the post must be ten handbreadths, [but] its width and thickness is the smallest amount.
13 We may make a beam from anything, but not from an <i>asherah</i>, since the width of a beam has a [requisite] measure. And any [requisite] amount is forbidden [to come] from an <i>asherah</i>, whereas the width of a beam is no less than a handbreadth - [though] its thickness is the smallest amount. But it must be sturdy [enough] to hold an <i>ariach</i> which is half a brick of three handbreadths by three handbreadths. And that which holds up the beam must be sturdy [enough] to hold the beam and a half brick. 
14 How [large] may the entrance of the alley be in order for a post or a beam to be sufficient to render it fit? Its height may not be less than ten handbreadths nor more than twenty ells and its width than ten ells. To what are these words applicable? When it did not have the outline of an entrance. But if it had the outline of an entrance, it is permissible - even if it was higher then a hundred ells or less than ten [handbreadths] or its width was a hundred ells.
15 Likewise if the beam of the alley had a relief or a drawing that all would look upon, it is fit even though it is above twenty ells. For a beam is made as a marker; and if it was above twenty, it would not be noticeable. But if there was a relief or a drawing on it, [people] would look upon it - and it would [thereby] come out to be a marker [nevertheless].
16 An alley the height from the ground to the bottom of the beam of which is twenty ells, but the thickness of the beam is above twenty, is fit [to allow carrying within it. If] it was higher than twenty and one comes to reduce [this] with a beam that he places below, its width must be a handbreadth, like the beam [above]. If its height was less than ten [handbreadths], he may hollow out an area of four by four ells [in the ground] and go downwards enough to complete the ten. 
17 [In a case when] a breach was made in [the alley's] side towards its head: If a board of four handbreadths remains standing at the head [of the wall that has been breached], it is permissible [to carry]. And that is when the breach is no more than ten [ells]. But if a board of four does not remain, it is forbidden unless the breach was less than three [handbreadths]. As anything less than three is like it is joined [together]. 
18 [In a case when] the alley is completely breached to a courtyard and the courtyard is breached opposite [the alley] to the public domain, it is surely forbidden because it is an open alley. But the courtyard is permissible. For a courtyard in which the public treads and enter on this [side] and exit on that [side] is surely a full-fledged private domain.
19 [In the case of] an alley that has paths on this side and paths on the other side that are found to be open to the public domain: Even though they are not opposite each other, each one is surely an open alley. How can we render [such an alley] fit? One makes the outline of an entrance for each and every one of the paths on one side, and likewise at the large entrance [at the front of the alley]; and he makes a post or a beam for each and every one of the paths on the other side.
20 [In the case of an] alley one side of which is long and one side of which is short, one places the beam across from [the end of] the short [side. If] one places a post in the middle of an alley: It is permissible to carry in the inner [section] which is from the post inwards; but the outer half - which is from the post outwards - is forbidden. 
21 [In a case of] an alley that is twenty ells wide, one may make a board ten handbreadths high [going back into the alley] a distance of four ells, which is the requisite size of an alley, and place it in the middle; and it comes out to be like two alleys the entrance of each of which is ten ells. Or he can go a distance of two ells from [one end] and put up a board of three ells and go a distance of two ells from [the other end] and put up a board of three ells; and it comes out that the entrance of the alley is ten ells, whereas the sides are surely as if sealed. For what is standing [at the ends] (the three ells) is greater than what is breached (the two ells). 
22 A post that extends from the wall of the alley is fit. And a post that was put up for itself (and not to render the alley permissible) is fit if they relied upon it before Shabbat. And a post that appears as a post inside, but does not appear as a post outside; or it appeared as a post outside, but appears flat inside and as if there was no post there - is surely considered to have the status of a post. A post that is raised three handbreadths from the ground or distanced three from the wall does not do anything (is invalid). But [if] less than three, it is fit. As anything less than three is like it is joined [together]. A very wide post - whether its width was less than half the width of the alley or whether its width was half the width of the alley - is fit and considered to have the status of a post. But if it was more than half of the width of the alley, it is considered to have the status of 'more [of the wall] is standing than breached' (and the alley is permissible for that reason).
23 [In the case of] a beam over which one draped a mat, [the mat] surely nullifies it, since it is no [longer] recognizable. Hence if the mat was removed three or more handbreadths from the ground, it is not a partition. [If] one planted two pegs into the [ends of the] alley walls outwards and placed a beam on top of them, he has not done anything. For the beam has to be on top of the alley, not near it.
24 [In the case of] a beam that protrudes from [one] wall, but does not touch the second wall; and likewise two beams - one protruding from this wall and the other protruding from that wall - that do not touch each other: If [the gap] is less than three [handbreadths], he need not bring another beam. If [the gap] between them was three, he needs to bring another beam.
25 Likewise [in a case of] two matching beams [but] there is not enough in this one to hold an <i>ariach</i> and there is not enough in that one to hold an <i>ariach</i>: If there is enough in both of them [together] to hold an <i>ariach</i>, there is no need to bring another beam. [If] one was above and one was below, we look at the top one as if it was below and the bottom one is if it was above (such that they be even) - so long as the top one is not above twenty [ells] and the bottom one is not below ten [handbreadths]; and there not be three handbreadths between them when we see it such that the higher one was lowered and the lower one raised to be even until one was across from the other.
26 [If] a beam was bent, we look at it as if it was straight; round, we look at it as if it were square. And if there were three handbreadths in its circumference, there is a handbreadth in it width. [If] a beam was within an alley but it bent outside of the alley, or it bent above twenty [ells] or below ten [handbreadths], we look at the whole [beam] as if the bend was removed and [only] its two ends remained - if there was not three [handbreadths] between this [end] and that, he need not bring another beam; but if not, he needs to bring another beam.
27 [In the case of] a well [around] which one made eight boards from the four corners - two boards connected in each corner - they are surely a partition. And even though the breach is larger than what is standing in each and every direction; because the four corners are standing, it is surely permissible to fill [water] from the well and give a beast to drink. And how much is the height of each of these boards? Ten handbreadths. And its width? Six handbreadths. And between every board [in one corner] and board [in the next corner]? Like the fill of two teams of four cattle each, one entering and one exiting. The measure of this width is no larger than thirteen ells and a third. 
28 [In a case] in which in the place of one of the corners or [even] in each corner of these four, there is a large stone, a tree, a mound with an incline of ten [handbreadths] within four ells, or a bundle of reeds - we look to all of it as if it were divided; and so long as there is one ell on this [side] and one ell on that [side] at a height of ten [handbreadths], it is considered to have the status of a corner that has two boards. [In a case of] five reeds and there is not three [handbreadths] between [any of them], but there is [a total] of six handbreadths on this [side] and six handbreadths on [that] side - they are considered to have the status of a corner that has two boards. 
29 It is permissible to make these four corners close to the well, so long as the head and most of a cow would [fit] inside the boards when it drinks. And even though one [might] not be holding the head of the animal together with the vessel which holds the water (such that he may follow the animal outside of the boards with the vessel) - since the head and most of it is inside, it is permissible even for a camel. [But if] they were closer than this, it is forbidden to water even a goat that is totally inside from it. And it is permissible to make them a little further. But this is so long as one adds straight boards that we place in each and every direction, so that there not be more than thirteen ells and a third between a board and its fellow. 
30 They only allowed these boards in the Land of Israel for the livestock of the festival pilgrims. And it is [limited] to a living public spring. But in other lands, a man must go down to the well and drink, or make a partition with a height of ten handbreadths surrounding the well - and [then] he may stand within it and draw [water] and drink. But if the well was very broad, such that one cannot go down to it, he may surely draw and drink between the boards (the above leniency of the boards would then also apply).
31 Likewise, we may not draw from a public pit of water or a private well (spring) - even in the Land of Israel - unless they made a partition ten handbreadths tall around it.
32 [In the case of] one who fills [water] for his animal between the boards, he may place it in a vessel in front of [the animal]. But if there was a manger - the head of which protrudes between the boards and it was ten [handbreadths] tall and four wide - he may not fill [water] and place it in front of it; lest the manger get ruined and he take the pail out to the manger, and from the manger to the floor of the public domain. Rather he fills and pours it [on the ground] and [the animal] drinks on its own.
33 One who throws from a public domain to between the boards is liable. Since there is a full-fledged partition with a height of ten [handbreadths] and more than four by four [handbreadths] and the square is recognizable and visible, everything between them becomes a private domain. And [this is so] even if it was in a glen without a well between them - since there is a board from here and a board from there in every direction. And even [if] the public was treading and passing through the boards, the partitions are not nullified. And they are surely like courtyards, such that the public treads in them - and [yet] one who throws into it is liable. And it is permissible to give an animal to drink between them if there is a well between them. 
34 [In the case of] a courtyard the head of which protrudes between the boards, it is permissible to carry from within it to [the area] between the boards, and from between the boards to within it. [But] if there were two courtyards, they are forbidden until they make an <i>eruv</i> (which renders it all into one domain). [If ]the water dried up on Shabbat, it is forbidden to carry between the boards; as they are only considered a partition to carry within it on account of the water. If water arrived there on Shabbat, it is permissible to carry between them - as any partition formed on Shabbat is [still] called a partition. It is forbidden to carry in an alley, the beam of which or the post of which was taken away on Shabbat - even [when] it is open to a <i>karmelit</i>.
35 It is permitted to carry throughout a veranda in a glen - even though it [only] has three partitions and a roof. For we see it as if the edge of the roof descends and seals the fourth direction. And one who throws from a public domain into it is exempt - just as one who throws into a closed lane that has a roof. [In the case of] a house or courtyard the corner of which is breached across ten ells, it is surely forbidden to carry in all of it. Even though any breach up to ten ells is like an entrance [and so, permissible], we do not make an entrance in a corner. But if there was a beam above there - over the length of the breach - we see it as if it descended and sealed it; so it is permitted to carry in the whole thing. And this is so long as [the beam] is not diagonal. 
36 The fingerbreadth that we measure with in every place is the width of the thumb of the hand. And a handbreadth is four fingerbreadths. And every ell mentioned in every place - whether regarding Shabbat or regarding a sukkah or forbidden mixtures - is an ell of six handbreadths. Sometimes we measure with an ell of six handbreadths pushing against each other; and sometimes we measure with an ell of six handbreadths that are expansive and spaced out. And this and that are to be stringent. How is that? The depth of an alley is four expansive ells, but its height is twenty narrow ells; the width of a breach is ten narrow ells. And it is similar to [these examples] concerning a sukkah and forbidden mixtures.

Chapter 18

1 One who transports something from a private domain to a public domain or from a public domain to a private domain is only liable when he transports a [requisite] amount that is useful for something. And these are the [requisite] amounts for transporting: [Regarding] one who transports human food, it is like a dried fig-bulk. And [different foods] combine with one another. And that is when there is a dried fig-bulk from the food itself, besides the peels, the pits, the stems, the bran and the coarse bran. 
2 Enough wine for the quarter of a <i>reviit</i>; but if it congealed, it is a <i>kazayit</i> (the bulk of a large olive). Enough milk of a pure animal [in order for a person to take one] swallow; enough milk of an impure one to treat one eye. Enough woman's milk or egg white to put into a bandage. Enough oil to rub the small toe of a one-day old infant. Enough dew to pound a salve. Enough salve to have it pounded in water. And enough water to wash the surface of a mortar. Enough honey to put on the top of a sore. Enough blood or any other liquid or any waste water to be a <i>reviit</i>. 
3 Straw from grain is like the mouthful of a cow. Straw from legumes is like the mouthful of a camel. But if one selected legume straw to feed it to a cow, it is like the mouthful of a cow - for eating under duress is [still] considered eating. An ear of grain  is like the mouthful of a goat. Grass is like the mouthful of a goat. [Regarding] garlic leaves and onion leaves: If they are fresh, it is like a fig-bulk, because they are human foods; but [if] dry, it is like the mouthful of a lamb. And [two substances] do not combine together for the stricter [amount] among them; but they combine for the lenient among them. How is this? If one selected straw of grain and of legumes: If there is like the mouthful of a cow between the two of them, he is exempt; like the mouthful of a camel, he is liable. And likewise all that is similar to it concerning Shabbat.
4 [Regarding] one who transports wood, it is enough to cook a fig-bulk of a beaten egg in oil on a pan. [Regarding] one who transports a reed, it is enough to make a quill that reaches the tops of his fingers. But if it was thick or crushed, its measure is like wood.
5 [Regarding] one who transports a spice, it is enough to spice an egg; and they combine together. Pepper is a minimal amount. Tar is a minimal amount. A substance with a good smell is a minimal amount. A substance with a bad smell is a minimal amount. Good purple dye is a minimal amount. A virgin rosebud is one. Types of hard metals, such as bronze and iron, are a minimal amount. Of ashes of the altar, stones of the altar, worm-eaten scrolls or their handkerchiefs, it is a minimal amount, since they are [all] stored in <i>genizah</i>. A coal is a minimal amount; but one who transports a flame is exempt.
6 [Regarding] one who transports garden seeds that are not eaten by humans, their measure is less than  a fig-bulk. Of cucumber seeds, it is two; and of squash seeds, it is two. Of Egyptian beans, it is two. [Regarding] one who transports bran, it is enough to place on the tip of a goldsmith's crucible. [Regarding] one who transports coarse bran: If it is to eat, its measure is like a fig-bulk; for an animal, its amount is like the mouthful of a goat; to dye, it is enough to dye a small garment. The berries of shrubs and carobs: Before they become sweet, it is like a fig-bulk; but from when they become sweet, it is like the mouthful of a goat. But arum, mustard, lupine and all other pickled plants is like a fig-bulk - whether they have become sweet or whether they have not become sweet. 
7 [Regarding] one who transports [date] pits: If it is to eat, it is five; if it is for fuel, it is surely like wood; if it is for adding; it is two; and if it is for planting it is two. [Regarding] one who transports hyssop: [If it is for] an animal, it is like the mouthful of a goat; for wood, it is like the amount for wood; and for sprinkling, it is like the [requisite] measure for sprinkling. 
8 [Regarding] one who transports nutshells, pomegranate peels, safflower, madder and other dyes, it is enough to dye a small garment like a hairnet that girls place on their head. Likewise, [regarding] one who transports forty day old urine, Alexandrian natron, lye, cimolian earth, potash and all other detergents, it is enough to dye a small garment like a hairnet. [If] one transported soaked herbs, it is enough to dye a sample for the shuttle with them. 
9 [Regarding] one who transports ink upon a quill, its measure is enough to write two letters from it. But if he transported the ink by itself or in an inkstand, it needs to be more than this in order that there be enough that would sit on the quill to write two letters. [If] there was enough in the inkstand for one letter and on the quill for one letter, or in the ink by itself for one letter and on the quill for one letter - this is surely a doubt. [If] one transported [the ink of] two letters and wrote them as he was walking, he is [still] liable - their writing is their being put down. [If] he transported one letter and wrote it, and went back to transport a second letter and wrote it, he is exempt - as he is already missing the first letter [in this act]. 
10 [Regarding] one who transports blue eye shadow - whether for medication or for ornamentation - it is enough to apply to one eye. But in a place where it is their way only to apply it to both eyes for ornamentation and he transported it for ornamentation, it is not until he transports enough to apply to both eyes. Tar and sulfur is in order to make a hole. Wax is in order to place over a small hole. Glue is in order to put on top of a board. Fat is enough to smear under a <i>sela</i>-coin sized pancake.
11 [Regarding] one who transports earth, it is enough to make the seal of a letter. Manure or fine sand is enough to fertilize a leek. Coarse sand is enough to to mix with a full spoon of plaster. Clay is enough to make the tip of a goldsmith's crucible. Hair is enough [with which] to mix mud to make the tip of a goldsmith's crucible. Lime is enough to spread on the finger of the smallest of girls. Dust or ashes is enough to cover the blood of a small bird. A pebble of stone is enough to throw at an animal and it will feel [it] - and that is the weight of ten <i>zuz</i>. Pottery is enough to hold a <i>reviit</i>.
12 [Regarding] one who transports a rope, it is enough to make the handle of a box. Reed grass is enough to make a loop for [hanging] a sifter or a sieve. Palm fronds is enough to make a handle for an Egyptian basket. Palm bast is enough to place on the opening of a small funnel [as a filter] for wine. Soft fabrics is enough to make a ball [the size of] a nut. A bone is enough to make a large spoon. Glass is enough with which to scrape (sharpen) the top of a bobbin or until it can split two threads at the same time.
13 One who transports two threads from a horse's tail or from a cow's tail is liable. [If] one transported one hard one from a pig, he is liable. The shoots of a palm - and they are the fibers of the tree - are two. The hard branches of a palm - and they are the scales of the branches - is one. Of cotton, coarse silk, the wool of camels, rabbits or animals or anything else that that is spun - it is enough to spin a thread of four handbreadths. [Regarding] one who transports some clothing, some sackcloth or some leather - their measure for transporting is the same as their measure for impurity: A garment three handbreadths by three; sackcloth four by four; and leather five by five.
14 [Regarding] one who transports leather that has not been processed at all and is still soft, its measure is enough to guard a small weight, the weight of which is a shekel-coin. [If] it was salted but not yet processed in flour or gallnuts, its measure is enough to make a charm. [If] it was processed with flour but not yet processed with gallnuts, its measure is enough to write a divorce bill upon it. When its processing is finished, its measure is five by five.
15 [Regarding] one who transports processed parchment (which can be used for tefillin), it is enough to write the section of Shema (the smallest section in the tefillin) upon it, until "and upon your gates." <i>Dukhsustus</i> is enough to write [the text of] a mezuzah upon it (as one may not use it for tefillin). Paper is enough to write two letters in a tax collectors' receipt - which are bigger than our letters. One who transports a tax collector's receipt is liable, even if he has already shown it to the tax collector and passed him; as it is surely a proof forever. [Regarding] one who transports a paid deed or worn out paper, it is enough to wrap a small flask of perfume. But if there is enough in its white part to write two letters of a tax collector's receipt, he is liable [even with a smaller piece].
16 One who transports a beast, an animal or a bird is liable, even though they are alive. But a living person is not [considered] a load. However if one was tied up or sick, the one who carries him is liable. And a woman can help her child walk when he [is able] to pick up one [foot] and put down the [other].
17 One who transports an infant with a purse suspended around his neck is liable on account of the purse. As the purse is not ancillary to the child. But if he transports an adult, he is exempt - even if he is dressed with his vessels, and his rings are on his hand. As it is all ancillary to him. [If, however,] his vessels were folded upon his shoulder, one who carries him is liable.
18 [Regrading] one who transports a live locust, it is a minimal amount; a dead one is like a fig-bulk. A bird of the vineyard (a type of locust) is a minimal amount - whether alive or dead - since they are stored for medication. Likewise with anything similar to it. The measure for transporting a corpse, an [animal] carcass and a creeping animal is like the measure for their impurity: A dead body and a carcass are a <i>kezayit</i>; a creeping animal is like a lentil-bulk.
19 [If] there was exactly a <i>kezayit</i> there, and he transported half a <i>kezayit</i>, he is liable. For his actions were useful in that he reduced the amount [left over] from [having the requisite size] to transmit impurity. But if he transported half a <i>kezayit</i> from a <i>kezayit</i> and a half, he is exempt. And likewise anything that is similar to this with the other impurities.
20 To what are these words applicable, that he is only liable for transporting its [requisite] amount? When he transported without specification. But one who transports to sow, for medication, to show a sample of it or anything that is similar to it is liable with a minimal amount. 
21 [In a case of] one who stores something for seeding or medication or for a sample and forgot why he stored it, and [then] transported it without specification - he is liable with a minimal amount. For [it is considered like] he transported it with his original intention. But other people are only liable with its [requisite] amount. [If, however,] the one who transported it already threw [it] into the storeroom - even if its place [there] is recognizable - his original thought is nullified. Hence if he went and brought it back in, he is not liable until he brings it in according to its [requisite] amount.
22 [Regarding] something which is not the way of people to store and is not fitting to be stored - such as menstrual blood - if one stored it and transported it, he is liable. But other people are exempt for it. For we are only liable for the transport of something fit to store and the likes of which is [actually] stored.
23 One who transports half the [requisite] amount is exempt. Likewise anyone who does half the amount of any one of the forbidden types of work is exempt. [If] he transported half the amount and placed it down and went back and transported the other half, he is liable. But if he already lifted up the first half before he placed the second half down, it is as if it was burned up; so he is exempt. [If] he transported half the amount and placed it down and [then] transported the other half and passed it within three [handbreadths] over the first, he is liable. For one who passes [something] over is as if he places it down on something. But if he threw it, he is not liable until it rests upon something there.
24 One who transported half the amount and went back and transported [another] half of the amount to the same domain in one forgetful spell is liable. [But in a case wherein] it was to two domains: If there is a domain for which he would be liable in between them, he is exempt. [However, if] there was a <i>karmelit</i> between them, they are [considered to be] like one domain; so he is a liable for a sin-offering.
25 One who transports less than a [requisite] amount but it swells before he puts it down and becomes [such an] amount; and likewise one who transports a [requisite] amount but it shrinks before he puts it down and becomes less than [such] an amount, is exempt.
26 One who transports a fig-bulk to eat and it shrunk before [it] was put down, but he [reconsidered] about it to sow it or to use it medicinally - which does not require a [requisite] amount - he is surely liable in accordance with his thought at the time that [it] was put down. One who transports less than a fig-bulk to sow but before he put it down, [reconsidered] about it to eat [it], is exempt. However, if it swelled before [it] was put down and it became like a fig-bulk before he reconsidered about it to eat [it], he is liable. For even if he did not [reconsider], he would have been liable for his [original] thought of transporting.
27 [In the case of] one who transports a fig-bulk and it shrinks but then swells before [it] is put down, it is certainly a doubt whether [the prohibition] was overridden or not overridden. [If] one threw a <i>kazayit</i> of foods into an impure house and this <i>kazayit</i> complemented the foods that were there - and the whole thing [thus] became [the requisite amount of] a <i>kabeitsah</i> - there is certainly a doubt whether he is liable for the <i>kazayit</i> on account of completing the amount with regard to impurity or he is not liable.
28 One who transports less than a [requisite] amount is exempt, even if he transports it in a vessel. For the vessel is ancillary to it, since his intention was not to transport the vessel but rather to transport what is in it - and it surely did not have the [requisite] amount. Hence if one transported a living man - who was not tied up - in a bed, he is also exempt for the bed. For the bed is ancillary to  [the man]. And likewise anything that is similar to this. One who transports a peddler's box - even though there are many types of things in it; and even if he transported [these things] in his palm - is only liable once. It is one case of transporting. 

Chapter 19

1 We may not go out (to a public domain) with any vessels of war on Shabbat. But if one did go out with them: If the vessels were in the way of clothing - such as armor or a helmet or boots upon his feet - he is certainly exempt. But if he went out with vessels that were not in the way of clothing - such as a spear, a sword, a targe or a (triangular) shield - he is certainly liable.
2 We may not go out with a spiked shoe, which was spiked to strengthen it. And even on holidays did they decree that we should not go out with it. But it is permissible to go out with a belt that has pieces of gold and silver affixed to it - as do kings. For it is an ornament; and anything that is an ornament is permissible. And that is when it is not loose, lest it fall in the public domain and he come to carry it [back]. 
3 A ring with a seal upon it is a man's ornament, and not a woman's ornament. But one without a seal upon it is a woman's ornament, and not a man's ornament. Hence a woman that went out with a ring that has a seal upon it and a man who went out with a ring that does not have a seal upon it are liable. But why are they liable? They surely transported them not in the ways of the ones that transport them - as it is the way of a man to only transport a ring on his finger which is fit for him, and likewise of a woman to only transport upon her finger a ring that is fit for her! Because sometimes the man gives his ring to his wife to store it at home and she places it on her finger at the time that she carries it. Likewise, a woman gives her ring to her husband to fix it with a craftsman and he places it on his finger at the time that he carries it to the store. And it [thus] comes out that they transported them according to the way that they [themselves] transport them. And hence they are liable.
4 A woman may not go out with a ring that does not have a seal upon it - even thou it is her ornament - lest she take it off in a public domain to show it to her friends in the way that women always do. But if she went out, she is exempt. However a man is permitted to go out with a ring that has a seal upon it - as it is an ornament and it is not his way to show [it]. But all of the people have become accustomed to not go out with a ring at all (on Shabbat).
5 A woman that went out with a perforated needle on Shabbat is liable, but a man is exempt. And a man that went out with an unperforated needle on Shabbat is liable, but a woman is exempt - as it is an ornament for her, and it is only prohibited [as] a decree lest she show [it] to her friends. This is the general rule: Anyone that goes out with something that is not an ornament for him nor in the way of clothing, and transported it in the way that the thing is transported, is liable. And anyone who goes out with something that is an ornament for him but was loose and it is possible that it would quickly fall such that he would carry in a public domain; and likewise a woman that went out with jewelry the way of which is to remove them and show them - they are certainly exempt (though it is forbidden to do so). And everything that is an ornament and does not fall and it is not its way to be shown is permissible to be taken out. Hence we may go out on Shabbat with a bracelet that we place on the forearm or [an anklet] on the calf that is clinging to the flesh and does not slip off. And likewise anything that is similar to this.  
6 A woman may neither go out with strings of wool, nor with strings of flax, nor with strips tied to her on her head, lest she removes it at the time of immersing and [so] carry it in a public domain. Nor with a headplate that rests between her eyes, nor with 'jaws of gold' that descend from the headplate to her jaws, when they are not sewn together. Nor with a crown of gold that is resting on her head nor with chains that girls go out with so that they will not take large steps, such that they will not spoil their hymen. All these are forbidden to go out with on Shabbat, lest they fall and she carry them in her hand.
7 A woman may neither go out with a <i>katla</i> on her neck, nor with noserings, nor with a flask of perfume that is fixed to her forearm. Nor with a small round purse into which we put fragrant oil - and that is called a <i>kovelet</i>. Nor with a wig of hair that lays upon her head in order that she appear to have much hair. And not with a wool cap that surrounds her [head] in front of her. Nor with a tooth that rests in her mouth in place of a tooth that fell. Nor with a gold tooth that rests over a black or red tooth among her teeth. But a silver tooth is permitted, as it is not recognizable. All these are forbidden to go out with on Shabbat, lest they fall and she carry them in her hand, or she remove and show [it] to her friends.
8 Anything that the Sages forbade to take out to a public domain is forbidden to take out in a courtyard without an <i>eruv</i> except for a cap and a wig of hair. [The latter] are permissible to go out with in a courtyard without an <i>eruv</i> in order that she not repulse her husband. And one who goes out with a flask of perfume that has no perfume at all is liable.
9 A woman may go out with strings of hair tied to her on her head, since water goes through them and they do not divide (between her and the water) - so she does not remove them if she [requires] immersion, such that we should make a decree lest she carry them in a public domain - whether the strings were hers or her friend's or an animal's. And an older woman should not go out with that of a young woman, as it is an enhancement for her - lest she remove and show them to her friends. But a young woman may go out with the strings of an older woman. And [a woman] may go out with anything woven on her head.
10 A woman may go out with strings [around] her neck, as they neither choke her nor divide (between her and the water). But if they were colored, they are forbidden - lest she show them to her friends. And a woman may go out with a tiara; as only an important woman would go out with it, and it is not the way [of such a woman] to remove and show [it]. And she may go out with a headplate and with 'jaws of gold' when they are sewn into the hair net that is on her head so that they do not fall. Likewise anything that is similar to these.  
 11 A woman may go out with padding in her ear, and that is so long as it is tied to her ear; and with padding in her shoe, and that is so long as it is tied to her shoe; and with padding that she affixed for her menses - even though it is not tied. And [the latter is permissible] even if she made a handle for it; as if it falls, she will not carry it due to its being disgusting.
12 And she may go out with pepper or a grain of salt or with anything that she puts into her mouth because of bad breath. But she should not put them [in her mouth] on Shabbat at the outset. Women may go out with twigs in their ears (that keep holes for earrings open) and with veils [around] their necks or on their clothes or with a shawl that is fastened. And she may fasten [it] at the outset on Shabbat with a stone or a nut and go out. But she may not make a ruse and fasten it with a nut to take it out for her young child. Likewise, she should not fasten with a coin at the outset, as it is forbidden to move it. But if she fastened [it with it before Shabbat], she may go out with it.
13 One may go out with a twig in his teeth or in his shoe to the public domain. But if it falls out, he should not replace [it]. And with padding or a sponge over a wound, so long as he does not tie a string or a cord over it. For a string and a cord have [a distinct] importance to him and are not useful for the wound. And he may go out with a garlic peel or an onion peel upon a wound or a dressing on top of a wound, and he may tie it and untie it on Shabbat. And with a bandage or an emollient or a plaster on top of a wound; and with a coin on top of a callus, and with a locust's egg, a fox's tooth and the nail of one crucified (which were understood to have medicinal properties). And with anything that we drape for healing - and that is when the physicians say it is useful. 
14 A woman my go out with a preservation stone or the counterweight of a preservation stone - that has been examined and weighed - (both of which are meant to prevent a miscarriage). And not only a pregnant woman, but even other women – lest she become pregnant and have a miscarriage. And we may go out with an expert charm. And which is an expert charm? One that has healed three people or was made by someone who has healed three people with other charms. But if one went out with a charm that is not expert, he is exempt – since he took it out by way of clothing. And likewise one who went out [adorned] with tefillin is exempt. 
15 One who has a wound on his foot may go out with a shoe on his [other] healthy foot. But if he does not have a wound on his foot, he may not go out with a single shoe. And an infant may not go out with a large sandal, but he may go out with a large cloak. And a woman may not go out with a loose sandal, nor with a new shoe with which she did not go out for an hour while still day (before Shabbat). And one missing a leg may not go out with his stub. We do not go out with wooden shoes on Shabbat, because they are not the way of clothing. But if they go out [with any of these], they are exempt. 
16 One may go out with a toupee or combed wool that are on the heads of people with scabs. When? When he has dyed them (in oil) and tied them; or if one went out them for an hour while still day (before Shabbat). But if he has not done a [preparatory] act to them and has not gone out with them before Shabbat, it is forbidden to go out with them.  
17 We may go out with thick sackcloth, with drapes, with a thick sagum and with a <i>chamilah</i> on account of the rain; but not with a box, a container or a mat on account of the rain. If they were soft and thin, it is permissible to take out a pillow or a bedspread resting upon one’s head in the way of clothing on Shabbat. But if they were hard, they are like a load and [so] forbidden.  
18 We may go out with bells that are woven into clothing. And a slave may go out with a clay seal upon his neck but not with a metal seal, lest it fall and he carry it. One who wraps himself with a <i>tallit</i> and folds it on both sides into his hand or upon his shoulder: If he intended to gather its corners so that it not tear or get dirty, it is forbidden; but if he gathered them to enhance his appearance through [this] - as is the custom of people [so] dressed - it is permissible. 
19 One who goes out with a <i>tallit</i> (completely) folded on his shoulder is liable. But he may go out with a kerchief on his shoulder, even though there is no string tied to his finger (so that it not fall). However it is forbidden to go out with any kerchief that does not cover one's head and most of him. If [one had] a short scarf that is not wide, he must tie its two ends below the shoulders; and it comes out to be like a belt, so it is permissible to go out with it.  
20 It is permissible to wrap oneself in a <i>tallit</i> that has loose ends on its edges – even though they are long strings and even though they [do not add to] the beauty of the <i>tallit</i> - because they are nullified with relation to the <i>tallit</i> and he is not concerned whether they be there or not be there. Hence one who goes out with a <i>tallit</i> that is not properly adorned with <i>tsitsit</i> (ritual fringes) is liable, on account of their having [a distinct] importance to him – and his mind is upon them until he completes their lack and they are turned into <i>tsitsit</i>. But it is permissible to go out with a <i>tallit</i> that is properly adorned with <i>tsitsit</i> - whether by day or by night (even though the commandment of <i>tsitsit</i> only applies to the day and not to the night). For finished <i>tsitsit</i> are not a load, but are surely the beauty of the garment and its ornamentation - like the wool stripe and that which is similar to it. As if the strings of the <i>tsitsit</i> of a <i>tallit</i> that is properly adorned with <i>tsitsit</i> were a load, even one who would go out with them during Shabbat day would be liable – as no positive commandment that does not have [a penalty of] excision] overrides Shabbat. 
21 A tailor should not go out with a needle pinned to his clothing on Shabbat; nor a carpenter with a twig (used in his trade) in his ear, nor a weaver with a sample in his ear, nor a comber with a cord [around] his ear, nor a moneychanger with a dinar-coin on his neck, nor a dyer with a sample in his ear. But if he went out, he is exempt  – even though it is the way of his craft – on account of his not transporting it in the way of those that transport [it]. 
22 A <i>zav</i> (someone suffering from an unusual genital emission) who went out with his receptacle is liable; as the way of this receptacle is to only be transported in this way. And [this is the case] even though he does not need it for the carrying (which is the forbidden type of work here) itself, but rather so that his clothes not get soiled; as one is liable for a type of work in which he does not need the work itself. 
23 [In the case of] one who finds <i>tefillin</i> on Shabbat in the public domain, [what should] he do? He should wear them in their way - he places the arm <i>tefillin</i> on his arm and the head <i>tefillin</i> on his head, enters the house and removes them. And he should repeat [this] and wear a second pair and remove them [and so forth], until he brings them all into [his house]. But if there were many, such that there was not enough [time] left in the day to bring them all in, in the way way of clothing; he should surely [wait] over them [until] dark and bring them in at the conclusion of Shabbat. However if it was during the time of [an anti-Jewish] decree such that he is afraid to sit and watch them until the evening because of the Kuthites (gentiles), he covers them in their place, leaves them and goes on.
24 [If] he was afraid to [wait] over them [until] dark because of robbers, he should take them all together and move them repeatedly less than four ells; or give them to his fellow within four ells, and his fellow to his fellow - until it reaches the outer courtyard [of the habitation]. To what are these words applicable? When they had their straps in them and they were tied with tefillin knots; as [in that case] they were certainly tefillin. But if they do not have their straps tied to them, we are not responsible for them.
25 One who finds a Torah scroll should sit and guard it and [wait] over them [until] dark. But in [a situation] of danger, he leaves it and goes on. However if there was rain falling (when there is no danger), he wraps himself with the parchment and then covers it [with another garment] and enters [his home] with it.

Chapter 20



Chapter 21

In the Torah, it states (Exodus 23:12, et. al.), "you shall rest." [Hence] one is obligated to rest even from things that are not constructive labor (<i>melakha</i>). And there are many things that were forbidden by the Sages and deemed a <i>shevut</i> (a restriction decreed by the Sages regarding Shabbat). Some of them are things forbidden because they are similar to constructive labors, and some of them are things forbidden as a decree lest one go from them to [doing] that which is forbidden [and would result in the punishment] of stoning. And these are them:
Anyone who levels indentations [in the ground], behold this one is liable because of plowing. Therefore, it is forbidden to defecate in a clear field on the Sabbath [as] a decree lest he level indentations. The one who clears the storehouse on the Sabbath because he needs it for a matter of commandment, for example, he brings in guests or he establishes a place to study, he does not complete [the cleaning] of the entire storehouse lest he come to level indentations. Mud that is on his feet, he wipes on the wall or on a beam, but not on the ground lest he will come to level indentations. One may not spit ion the ground and trample it with his foot lest he level indentations. But it is permitted to tread on the spit that is on the ground and walk innocently.  
Women who play with walnuts and almonds, and things similar to them are forbidden to play with them on the Sabbath lest they will come to level indentations. And it is forbidden to sweep the ground lest one level indentations unless it was paved with stones. And it is permitted to spray water on the ground and there is no concern lest one level indentations in that behold there is no intention for such. We do not rub oil on the ground even if it was paved with stones, and we do not blow on it, and we do not wash it even on holy days of Festivals, and all the more so on the Sabbath, so that one will not act in the way the one acts on an ordinary day and come to level indentations at a time that he acts such in a place that is not paved.



Fruits that fell on the Sabbath - it is forbidden to eat them until the going out of the Sabbath - this is a decree lest one pluck [fruit]. A myrtle that is attached - one is permitted to smell it since it has no benefit other than to smell it, and behold its smell is found [even while attached]. But an citron [etrog] or an apple, and anything appropriate for eating is forbidden to smell it while attached [as] a decree lest one cut it off to eat it.

We may not ride on the back of an animal on Shabbat. It is a decree, lest one will cut off a twig to [prod] it. And we may not suspend [things] on an animal and one may not climb an animal while it is still day [before Shabbat] in order to sit upon it on Shabbat. And we may not lean against the side of an animal. [But leaning on something that is leaning against] the sides of an animal is permissible. One who climbed a tree on Shabbat inadvertently is allowed to come down. [If he did so] knowingly, he is forbidden to come down. And concerning an animal; even [if he climbed on it] knowingly, he should come down because of [the prohibition of] causing pain to animals. And so [too], we may discharge the load from on the back of an animal on Shabbat because of causing pain to animals.








One who cuts a vegetable into [very] fine pieces in order to cook them has transgressed a subcategory of Grinding and is liable. Therefore, it is forbidden to shred hay or carob before animals, whether large animals or small animals, because it appears as if one is [transgressing] Grinding. However, one may cut gourds before an animal, or an animal carcass before dogs, because there is no [prohibition] of grinding regarding fruit. One may untie bundles of straw before an animal or spread, by hand, small sheaves, but not large sheaves, because of the effort it entails.

Chapter 22


Why did the Sages forbid entering a bathhouse on Shabbat? Because of the attendants who would heat hot water on Shabbat and say it had been heated before Shabbat. Therefore they decreed that a person may not enter the bathhouse on Shabbat even sweat. And they decreed that one may not wash all of one's body in hot water, not even in hot water that was heated on the [prior to] Shabbat; but one's face and one's hands, and one's feet are permitted. Regarding what case are we talking? About hot water heated by fire- a decree because of the bathhouse. But the hot waters of Tiberias, and similar, in it, it is permitted to wash one's whole body in them. And it is forbidden to wash in hot water that is in caves, because the caverns have steam, and one will come to sweat, and do it was considered to be like a bathhouse.

Chapter 23



Chapter 24

There are things that are forbidden on the Sabbath even though they are not similar to creative labor and they do not bring [one] [to doing] creative labor. And because of what were [they] forbidden? Because it was said "If because of the Sabbath you refrain your feet from acting on your concerns on My holy day" (Isaiah 58:13) and it was said, "And you shall honor it, [refraining] from doing your ways, from finding your desires and from speaking about a matter" (Isaiah 58:13). Therefore it is forbidden for a person to go [after] one's concerns on the Sabbath, and even to speak about them. For example, if one would speak with one's business partner [about] what he will sell the following day or what he will buy or how he will build this house or regarding which merchandise will go to a certain person's place. All of this and similar cases are forbidden, as it says: "speaking about a matter" - speaking is forbidden; thinking is permitted.








All the things that are forbidden because of <i>sh'vut</i>: it was not decreed regarding them <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> [i.e. between sunset and twilight], but rather it is during the actual day that they are forbidden, but <i>bein ha-shamashot </i> they are permitted, and [this case] is when there is a matter of commandment or an urgent matter. How? It is permitted for him <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> to climb a tree or to swim in the water to bring a <i>lulav</i> or a <i>shofar</i>. And similarly bringing down from a tree or bringing out from a semi-public domain an <i>eruv</i> that one made. And similarly if one is troubled, hurried, or in need of a thing that is a matter of <i>sh'vut</i>, <i>bein ha-shamashot</i>, behold it is permitted. But if there was not an urgent matter and there was no matter of a commandment there, it is forbidden. Therefore, we do not tithe what is certain [i.e. know to be untithed] <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> even though the separation of tithes on the Sabbath is forbidden because of <i>sh'vut</i>. But we tithe <i>d'mai</i> [i.e. produce that we are unsure if it has been tithed].

The Sages forbade the carrying of some things on the Sabbath in the way that one does it on an ordinary day. And because of what did this prohibition come to pass? And they said: just as the Prophets warned us  and commanded us that your walking on the Sabbath should not be like your walking on an ordinary day and the conversation of the Sabbath like the conversation of an ordinary day, as was said  "and speak of a matter", <i>kal v'chomer</i> [i.e. an a fortiori argument] that  there should not be any carrying  on the Sabbath like the carrying on an ordinary day so that it will not be like an ordinary day in one's eyes and one will come to lift and repair items [moving them] from corner to corner or house to house or move stones away, and similar cases, in that behold one is idle and sits in one's house and loosk for something to busy oneself with. And we would find that he did not rest and had nullified the meaning of what was said "so that one will rest" (Exodus 23:12).

Chapter 25









Any item that one is careful regarding it lest it should decrease in is value, for example, things set aside as merchandise and particularly expensive items that one is careful regarding them lest they deteriorate, it is forbidden to carry them on the Sabbath. And this is what is called <i>"muktzah</i> because of a monetary loss." For example: the large file, a pin of the plow, a butcher's knife, a knife of a leatherworker, the carpenter's spade, a spice-dealer's mallet, or similar cases.
Any item that has been set aside because it is forbidden, it is forbidden to carry it. For example, a lamp that they lit regarding the Sabbath and the <i>menorah</i> that has the lamp upon it, and the table that has money on it, even though the lamp went out or the money fell, it is forbidden to carry them, in that anything that was forbidden to carry <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> [between sunset and twilight], it is forbidden to carry it during the entire Sabbath even though the thing that caused the prohibition has gone.

Chapter 26



Chapter 27

The one who goes outside the boundary of the city on the Sabbath is lashed, as it is said, "one shall not go out from one's place on the seventh day" (Exodus 16:29). This "place" is the boundary of the city. And the Torah dod not give the amount [of distance] for this boundary, but the Sages had a tradition that this boundary was 12 <i>mil</i> outside, equal to the Israelites camp. And thus Moses our teacher said to them: do not go outside the camp. And from the words of the [Rabbis], a person shall not go outside the city other than 2000 cubits, but outside of 2000 cubits is forbidden, in that 2000 cubits is the pasture land of the city....
You find from what was learned that a person is permitted on the Sabbath to walk the entire city, even if it was [as big as] Nineveh, whether it was surrounded by a wall or not surrounded by a wall. And similarly, it is permitted to walk outside the city 2000 cubits in every direction, square, like a square tablet such that one benefits from the corners. And if one went outside 2000 cubits, we lash him with lashes of rebellion until 12 <i>mil</i>. But if he went out and distanced [himself] from the city more than 12 <i>mil</i>, even one cubit, he is lashed from the [law of] the Torah.

Chapter 28



Chapter 29

It is biblically mandated positive commandment to sanctify the Sabbath with speech, as it is written (Exodus 20, 7): "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." i.e. Remember through remembrance of praise and through Kiddush. And it must be remembered when it begins and when it ends. When it begins - with Kiddush, and when it ends - with Havdala...
And this is the language of sanctifying the day (Kiddush). Blessed are You, HaShem, our God, Eternal Sovereign, Who sanctified us through the commandments, and desired us, and has given us the Holy Sabbath through love and desire as an inheritance, a memorial for the works of creation.  First of all holy occasions, a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt, for You chose us and set us as different than all peoples, and You gave us through love and desire Your Holy Sabbath as an inheritance.  Blessed are You, HaShem, Who Sanctifies the Sabbath.
..
The essential time to make <i>Kiddush</i> is in the evening. If you did not make <i>Kiddush</i> in the evening whether accidentally or on purpose, you make <i>Kiddush</i> at any point in the day time. Similarly, if you did not make <i>Havdalah</i> at night you may make <i>Havdalah</i> the next day or at any point before the end of Tuesday. However, <i>Havdalah</i> with a candle is only made when <i>Havdalah</i> is made on a Saturday night.
It is forbidden for a person to eat or drink wine from the time when the day became sanctified until he sanctifies the day [with <i>Kiddush</i>]. And similarly from when the day goes out, it is forbidden for him to begin to eat and drink and to do creative labor or to taste anything a until he separates [makes <i>Havdalah</i>] And to drink water is permitted. If he forgot or it passed and he ate or drank before he sanctified or before he separated, behold this one sanctifies or separates after he eats.
It is from the words of the Sages to sanctify over the wine and to separate over the wine. And even though one separated during the Prayer [i.e. Amidah], one needs to separate over the cup. And after one separates [during the Prayer] and one says "between holy and ordinary", it is permitted for one to do creative labor, even though one has not separated over the cup. And one blesses of the wine first, and after that sanctifies. And one does not wash one's hands until one sanctifies.

<i>Kiddush</i> is only done in the place of a meal. How? One does not make <i>Kiddush</i> in one house and eat in another house. However, if one made <i>Kiddush</i> in one corner, one can eat in another corner. And why do we make <i>Kiddush</i> in the synagogue? Because of the guests, who eat and drink there.





One may only make <i>Kiddush</i> on wine that is suitable to have been offered on the altar. Therefore, if honey or leaven was mixed with the wine, even if only a mustard seed sized was mixed with a barrel full of wine, one can not make <i>Kiddush</i> on that mixture. That is how we instruct people to act in all of the West. However, there are are those that do permit the use of wine mixtures for <i>Kiddush</i>. They are of the opinion that the suitability of wine mixtures is not based on wine that can be offered on the altar. Rather, the only prohibited wines are those that have a bad odor or were left uncovered or were cooked. On any one of those wines you can not make <i>Kiddush</i>.



Just as we sanctify on the night of the Sabbath and separate upon the going out of the Sabbath, so too we sanctify on the nights of holy days of Festivals and separate upon their going out and upon the going out of the Day of Atonement, in that all of them are sabbaths of the LORD. And we separate upon the going out of holy days of Festivals into ordinary days of the Festival and upon the going out of the Sabbath into holy days of Festivals, but we do not separate upon the going out of Yom Tov into the Sabbath.










And why do we bless over the spices at the going out of the Sabbath? Because the soul is saddened at the going out of the Sabbath, we gladden it and settle it down with a good smell.

Chapter 30

Four concepts were said regarding Sabbath, two from the Torah, and two from the words of the Sages and explicated through the Prophets. From the Torah: "Remember" (Exodus 20:8) and "Observe" (Deuteronomy 5:12). And explicated through the Prophets: Honor and delight, as it is said, "And call the sabbath a delight, And the holy of the LORD honourable" (Isaiah 58:13).
What is honor? It is what the Sages said that it is a mitzvah to wash one's face, hands, and feet in hot water on the eve of Shabbat for the sake of honor for Shabbat. One should wrap Tzitzit, and sit respectfully, waiting for Shabbat to commence just as one does he goes out to greet a king. And the early Sages would gather their students on the eve of Shabbat and wrap themselves and say, "Come, let us go out and greet Shabbat, the king."
Honoring the Sabbath includes wearing clean clothing. One's Sabbath rainment should be distinct from that of the week. If he has no additional set of clothing, he should loosen his garment so that his style of dress is not like that of the week. Ezra established that the people would wash their clothes on Thursday, to honor the [coming] Sabbath.
It is prohibited to set a meal and drink on the eve of the Sabbath, because of honor for the Sabbath. And it is permitted to eat and drink [outside of a meal context] until it gets dark. And even so, because of honor for the Sabbath, a person should inhibit himself from setting a meal from [the time allowed to say the afternoon prayer] Mincha and on, so that he can enter the Sabbath with an appetite to eat.
A person should order his table on the day before Sabbath, and even if he only needs an olive's amount, and similarly, he should order his table post-Sabbath, and even if he only needs an olive's amount, so as to honor it as it enters and as it leaves. And he must fix up his house during the day, due to the honor of the Sabbath. And there should be a candle lit, the table set for eating, and the bed spread, for all of these are for the honor of Sabbath.
Even if one is a very important person, not accustomed to buying things from the market or getting involved in housework, one is required to do things that are necessary for Sabbath with one's body, for this is its honor. Among the original sages were one who would split wood for cooking, one who would cook or cure meat, trim wicks, or light candles, and some who would go out and buy things needed for Sabbath, for eating and drinking, even though he wasn't accustomed to such. And anyone who increases implementation of this concept is praiseworthy.
What is "enjoyment"? This is what the Sages said that one should prepare a fatty cooked dish and spiced drinks for the Shabbat, according to ones financial ability. Anyone who increases in his Shabbat expenditures and in preparing many good foods is worthy of praise. If one is unable to afford (these expenditures), even if one only makes fried vegetables or something similar in honor of the Shabbat, this is considered fulfillment of  enjoyment of the Shabbat. One is not obligated to pain himeself or to ask from others in order to increase his Shabbat meal. The early Sages said "make your Shabbat like a weekday and do not come to rely on people".
One who is affluent and wealthy and for whom every day is like the Sabbath needs to differ his Sabbath diet from his weekday diet. And if it's impossible to change it, he should change the time of his meals: if he usually [has meals] early [in the day], he should [eat] later, and if he usually [eats] late, he should [make the meal] earlier.
A person is obligated to eat three meals on Shabbat: one in the evening; one in the morning; and one in the afternoon.  And he must be careful with these 3 meals to not lessen from them at all.  And even a poor person who is supported by charity must eat three meals.  And if he is sick from an abundance of eating or he is constantly fasting he is exempt from three meals.  And it is required to establish each meal of the three on wine and to break [bread] on two loaves.  And so too on holidays.
Eating meat and drinking wine is considered delight (oneg), as long as he can afford it. It is not permissible though to sit down for a meal on wine on Shabbat and festivals at the time of communal learning. This then was the custom of the early righteous ones. They would pray the morning and additional service in the synagogue, then go to their home and eat the second meal, and then return to the study house to read [Torah] and repeat [Mishnah] and pray the afternoon service, and afterwards sit down for a meal on wine and eat and drink until Shabbat has ended.
It is forbidden for a person to walk on  the eve of the Sabbath (i.e. Friday] more than  three <i>parasot</i> from the beginning of the day so that he arrives at his house while there is till much daytime and he can prepare his festive meal, in that behold the people of the household would not know that he is coming that day in order to prepare for him. And there should be  no need to say [such] if he was being a guest at the place of others since he would embarrass them  because they will not have prepared for him the appropriate thing for guests. 
It is forbidden to fast and to sound trumpets and to supplicate and to beg for mercy on Shabbat. Even for such [grave] troubles that the community would [ordinarily] fast and cry out because of them; on the Sabbath and festivals we do not fast and sound trumpets, aside from a city that is surrounded by non-Jews or a river, or a ship that is shipwrecked. In these [cases] we sound trumpets on the Shabbat to [encourage others to] aid them and we supplicate and ask for mercy for them.
We do not besiege cities of worshipers of stars and constellations less than three days before the Sabbath in order to settle down the minds of the men of war and they will not be frightened or distracted on the Sabbath. We do not set sail on a boat less than three days before the Sabbath in order to settle down one's mind before the Sabbath and one is not suffering too much. And for a matter of a commandment one may set sail on the sea even on the eve of the Sabbath [i.e. Friday]. And he interrupts [his journey] with it on the Sabbath, and if it does not rest... From Tyre to Sidon and similar cases,  even for an optional matter it is permitted to set sail on the eve of the Sabbath. And in a place where it is customary not to set sail on the eve of a Sabbath in general, we do not set sail.
Marital relations are included in the obligation of enjoyment of the Shabbat. Therefore Torah scholars fulfill their marital obligations once a week, on the Shabbat. It is permissible to have marital relations with a virgin, even in the first instance, and there is no transgression of (the Shabbat laws) of "injuring" or "pain" to her.
