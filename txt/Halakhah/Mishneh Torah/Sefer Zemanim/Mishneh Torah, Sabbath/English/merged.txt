Mishneh Torah, Sabbath



Chapter 1

Resting from labor<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Within the context of the Sabbath laws, labor does not refer to strenuous work, but rather to the performance of one of the thirty nine labors that were necessary for the construction of the Temple or a labor which is analogous to them. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 1.)<br>The Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah is significant. Our Rabbis have offered two definitions of the mitzvah of resting on the Sabbath: In his commentary on <i>Yevamot</i> 6a, the Rashba states that the mitzvah is negative in nature: one refrains from performing prohibited labors. In contrast, in his commentary on Leviticus 23:24, the Ramban explains that the mitzvah possesses a positive dimension: to spend the day in a restful frame of mind, abstaining from all activities - even those that are not forbidden labors - which would disrupt this tranquility.<br>From the Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah, it would appear that he follows the first view. From his statements in Chapter 21, Halachah 1, however, it would appear that he accepts the second perspective. (See also <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>.)</i> on the seventh day fulfills a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 154) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 85) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Exodus 23:12] states, "And you shall rest on the seventh day."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 9), the Rambam mentions that the commandment to rest on the Sabbath is mentioned 12 times in the Torah. <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> and others question why the Rambam cites this proof-text in particular.</i> Anyone who performs a labor on this day negates the observance of a positive commandment and also transgresses a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Many of the mitzvot involve a positive and a negative commandment which share a single objective.</i> for [<i>ibid.</i> 20:10] states, "Do not perform any labor [on<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i> Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 320) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch </i>(Mitzvah 32) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> it]."<br>What are the liabilities incurred by a person who performs labor [on this day]? If he does so willingly,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., without being forced by others</i> as a conscious act of defiance,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">and not inadvertently.<br>The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1510) notes that the Rambam uses the expression "willingly, as a conscious act of defiance" with regard to the transgressions of idolatry (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 3:1), the Sabbath laws, and the laws of Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 1:1). With regard to all other transgressions punishable by כרת, the Rambam merely states "as a conscious act of defiance."<br>The Radbaz explains that it is possible that the Rambam mentioned the concept of "willingly" with regard to these three transgressions because they are the first cases of כרת mentioned in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. After mentioning the concept on these three occasions, he does not think further repetition is necessary.</i> he is liable for <i>karet</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">כרת means "cut off." <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 28a relates that a person liable for כרת would die prematurely, before reaching the age of fifty. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1) emphasizes that being "cut off in this world" is not the sum total of Divine retribution for such a transgression. In addition, the person's soul is also cut off and prevented from reaching the world to come.</i> if witnesses who administer a warning are present,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 12:1-2, punishment is not administered for the violation of a transgression unless the transgressor is made aware of the punishment he could receive for his deed.</i> he should be stoned [to death].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 15:35. This is the most severe form of execution.</i> If he performs [labor] without being conscious of the transgression,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">accidentally, performing a forbidden labor or doing so without awareness of the transgression involved</i> he is liable to bring a sin offering of a fixed nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam uses this term to differentiate the sin offering required from a קרבן עולה ויורד - a guilt offering - which differs depending on the financial status of the person bringing it. See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:4.</i>
Whenever the expression, "one who performs this is liable" is used within the context of the Sabbath laws, the intent is that he is liable for <i>karet</i>, and if witnesses are present and administer a warning, he is liable to be stoned to death. If he performs such an activity without being aware of the transgression, he is liable for a sin offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is explaining that by performing a forbidden act on the Sabbath, a person incurs liability. The nature of this liability depends on his intent and on whether witnesses are present. These factors are common, however, to all the laws of the Sabbath. Therefore, in the future, all that is necessary to say is that "the person is liable," and based on the principles stated here, we can determine what his liability is.</i>
Whenever the expression, "one who performs this is not liable" is used, the intent is that he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, for [execution by] stoning, or for bringing a [sin] offering. It is, however, forbidden to perform this act on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 3a makes a similar statement of principle, but states that there are three exceptions to this rule. When discussing these exceptions, the Rambam deviates from the terminology used in the Talmud and states that these three acts are "permitted."</i><br>In such an instance, the prohibition is Rabbinic<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation reflects the usual interpretation of the Hebrew expression מדברי סופרים. There are commentaries (e.g., the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:1) who cite the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 2) and explain that this expression can refer to a prohibition of the Torah which is derived through the accepted traditions of Biblical exegesis. In this instance, however, the Rambam's intent is clear; the term refers to prohibitions that the Rabbis instituted on their own initiative as safeguards.</i> in origin and was instituted as a safeguard against [the performance of] labor. A person who performs such an act is given "stripes for defiance."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam discusses this punishment in <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 18:6, explaining that the person is flogged to the extent of the court's discretion (in contrast to the number of lashes received for the violation of a Torah command, which is fixed at 39). Other authorities offer different interpretations.</i>Similarly, whenever the expressions "this should not be performed..." or "it is forbidden to do this on the Sabbath" are used, a person who performs such an act as a conscious act of rebellion<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shoshanat Ha'amakim</i> states that this expression implies that a person must be given a warning before such a punishment is administered.</i> is given "stripes for defiance."
Whenever the expression, "it is permissible to do this" is used, the intent is that, at the outset, one may perform this act.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there is no prohibition whatsoever for performing the act in question.</i> Similarly, whenever the expressions, "one is under no obligation" or "one is not liable at all" are used, one does not receive any punishment at all [for performing such an act.]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This expression implies that, at the outset, it is improper to perform such an act. Nevertheless, doing so does not warrant punishment (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>
It is permissible to perform an act that is permitted on the Sabbath, despite the fact that it is possible - but it is not an absolute certainty<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, it is certain that the forbidden labor will be performed, it is prohibited to perform the permitted act, as explained in the following halachah.</i> - that, [as a result of one's actions], a forbidden labor<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Avraham, the Rambam's son (<i>Birkat Avraham</i> 9), explains that by using the term "forbidden labor" in this and the following halachah, the Rambam implies that there is a difficulty only if a prohibition from the Torah is involved. If merely a Rabbinic prohibition is concerned, it is permitted without question. This question is also discussed by the <i>Mishneh L'Melech</i>.</i> will be performed, provided one does not have the intent to perform that labor.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's decision is the subject of a difference of opinion between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. (See <i>Beitzah</i> 23b and other sources.) Rabbi Shimon maintains that although a forbidden labor results from a person's activity, since he did not desire that this labor be performed, he is not held liable. Rabbi Yehudah, in contrast, holds the person liable, for his actions brought about the performance of a forbidden labor.<br>The commentaries explain Rabbi Shimon's opinion based on the principle (<i>Chaggigah</i> 10b) that "The Torah prohibited purposeful labor [on the Sabbath]." A deed is forbidden only when it is associated with a purposeful intent. (See also the notes on Halachah 7.)<br>The concept discussed in this halachah, אינו מתכוין, differs from an ordinary example of a labor performed unintentionally. When we speak of a labor performed unintentionally (בשוגג), the person had no thought whatsoever of performing a forbidden activity. In the case of אינו מתכוין, by contrast, the person performs an act consciously with the knowledge that there is a possibility that it may lead to a forbidden act. Nevertheless, since there is no certainty that the transgression will be committed, he is not held liable.<br>Although this principle is applicable to the Sabbath laws in particular, the difference of opinion between these two sages on this issue is relevant, not only to the Sabbath laws, but to all other prohibitions in the Torah as well.<br>Based on <i>Pesachim</i> 25b-26b, it appears that one is allowed to perform an activity that may result in the incidental performance of a forbidden labor even when one has an alternative manner of accomplishing one's objective, which does not involve any risk of a forbidden labor being performed. See <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 10:16.</i><br>What is implied? A person may drag a bed, a chair, a bench<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Our text follows the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, which quotes the text of <i>Shabbat</i> 22b. The original manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> substitute מגדל, "cabinet," instead of ספסל, "bench."</i> and the like [on the ground] on the Sabbath, provided he does not intend to gouge out a groove in the earth while dragging them. Therefore, even if he did gouge out [a groove] in the ground [while dragging them], it is of no consequence, for he did not have this intent in mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Digging a groove is forbidden because it is included in the category of forbidden labor, plowing. Nevertheless, since one did not intend to perform this labor, the fact that it was performed is of no consequence. Similarly, all the subsequent activities mentioned by the Rambam involve the performance of a forbidden labor without the intent to do so.</i><br>Similarly, a person may tread on grass on the Sabbath, as long as his intent is not to uproot it. Thus, should it be uprooted, that is of no consequence. Also, a person may rub powdered herbs and the like over his hands, provided he does not intend to remove his hair.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 22, Halachah 13.</i> Therefore, if the hair is removed, it is of no consequence. Based on the same rationale, one may enter a narrow opening on the Sabbath even though, [while doing so,] one causes pieces of the wall to fall. Similarly, it is permissible to perform any act with similar repercussions, provided that one does not have the intent of doing so.
[In contrast,] when one performs a deed that results in the performance of a forbidden labor, and it is a certainty that this deed will cause [that labor] to be performed, one is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 2, the use of this term implies that the prohibition has its source in the Torah itself (the Rambam's son, Rabbenu Avraham). Although some authorities have explained that since the person had no intent for the labor itself, the prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature, from the Rambam's perspective it appears that since he knows that the labor will be performed, it is considered as if he performed it intentionally.</i> even though one did not intend [to perform the forbidden labor].<br>What is implied? A person needs a fowl's head to serve as a toy for a child, and therefore cuts off the [fowl's] head on the Sabbath; although his ultimate purpose is not merely to slaughter the chicken,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The addition of the word "merely" implies that the person has a desire to slaughter the fowl. Albeit, his desire may not be to kill the fowl for food, but even for use as a toy it is preferable that the fowl be dead than alive.<br>This leads to another concept. The <i>Aruch</i> states that a person is not held liable when he performs an act that will inevitably bring about the commission of a forbidden labor, if he is displeased with the fact that the labor was committed (פסיק רישא דלא ניחא ליה). In his notes on Chapter 10, Halachah 17, Rabbenu Chayim Soloveitchik states that the Rambam also subscribes to this opinion.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 320:18) gives an example of this situation: The plug of a barrel of wine was closed with flax. Although some wine will inevitably be squeezed out when the barrel is unplugged - and squeezing is a forbidden labor - since the wine that is squeezed out will be lost, there is no prohibition.<br>This opinion is not, however, accepted by all authorities.<i> Tosafot</i> and Rabbenu Asher in their glosses on <i>Shabbat</i> 103a differ and maintain that, since it is inevitable that a forbidden labor will be performed, such an act is forbidden by Rabbinic decree. From the wording of the <i>Shulchan Aruch's</i> statements, it would appear that it is preferable to follow the more stringent view, but that the more lenient perspective has become popularly accepted.</i> he is liable. It is obvious that it is impossible for the head of a living being to be cut off and for that being to survive. Instead, the [fowl's] death came about because of [this activity]. [Therefore, he is liable.] The same applies in other similar situations.
Anyone who performs a [forbidden] labor - even if he has no need for the actual labor he performed - is liable for his deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This also represents a difference of opinion between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, as evident from <i>Shabbat</i> 29b-30a, 73b, and other sources.<br>As in the laws mentioned in Halachah 7, the source of their difference of opinion is Rabbi Shimon's principle, "the Torah prohibited purposeful labor [on the Sabbath]." To explain: The prohibition against labor on the Sabbath is derived from the labors performed to construct the Sanctuary (see the commentary on Chapter 7, Law 1), and with regard to the construction of the Sanctuary, the Torah uses the expression, מלאכת מחשבת, "contemplative work." Accordingly, Rabbi Shimon maintains that the Torah's prohibition against labor is related to thought. Only when one's actions are purposeful can they be forbidden.<br>For this reason, Rabbi Shimon maintains - as explained in Halachah 5 - that when a person performs a forbidden labor without the intention to do so (אינו מתכוין), he is not liable. Although a forbidden activity results from his conduct, since his thought was not involved in the matter, his work does not resemble the labor that was necessary to construct the Sanctuary. Hence, one is not held liable for such labor on the Sabbath.<br>In the situation at hand, a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה, the person performing the forbidden labor is doing so intentionally. Nevertheless, since his intent is not the same as that ordinarily associated - or according to some authorities, associated at the time of the construction of the Sanctuary - with this labor, he is not held liable. (See the comments of Rabbenu Avraham, the Rambam's son, quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.)<br>Rabbi Yehudah differs on both issues, maintaining that since the performance of a forbidden labor results from this person's conscious activity, he is held liable. The Rambam (following the opinion of Shemuel, <i>Zevachim</i> 92a) accepts Rabbi Shimon's view with regard to אינו מתכוין, but follows Rabbi Yehudah's view with regard to a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה.<br>The difference between these opinions can be explained based on the interpretation of the command תשבות, "rest," on which basis we observe the Sabbath laws. We find another difference of opinion between Rabbi Yehudah and the other Sages (<i>Pesachim</i> 27a) concerning a word with a similar root. With regard to the command (Exodus 12:15 , תשביתו שאור, "destroy leaven," Rabbi Yehudah maintains that leaven must be burned. The other Sages (including Rabbi Shimon) maintain that leaven may be destroyed be other means.<br>What is the difference between them? Rabbi Yehudah maintains that the destruction of leaven must be utter and complete as possible, while the Sages maintain that all that is necessary is to negate its usefulness (potential for purposeful use). Similarly, in the present instance, Rabbi Yehudah explains that all semblances of labor are forbidden on the Sabbath. In contrast, Rabbi Shimon maintains that only purposeful labor is forbidden; only when both the activity and the intent for which it is performed are analogous to the activities performed to construct the Sanctuary is a transgression committed. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 7, p. 190-191.)<br>Shemuel and the Rambam take an intermediate position. They agree with Rabbi Shimon that an activity must be coupled with a purposeful intent, but maintain that since a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה is an intentional act, it is forbidden as such a combination.<br>It must be noted that the Rambam's view is not accepted by all authorities. The Ra'avad, <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Zevachim, ibid.</i>) and subsequent Ashkenazic authorities state that Rabbi Shimon's opinion is accepted in both these instances. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 278:1, 334:12) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> decision. Nevertheless, even the authorities who accept Rabbi Shimon's view maintain that, if there is no danger to the community involved, a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה is forbidden according to Rabbinic decree.</i><br>What is implied? A person extinguished a lamp because he needed [to save] the oil or the wick from being destroyed or from burning or so that the earthenware reservoir of the lamp [that holds the oil] would not break. Since he had the intent of extinguishing the lamp, even though he did not do so for the [usual] purpose of extinguishing,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his intent in extinguishing the lamp was not to produce coals to use for kindling an even flame, the purpose for which extinguishing was performed in constructing the Sanctuary.</i> but merely for the sake of the oil, the wick or the earthenware, he is liable.<br>Similarly, a person who moves a thorn four cubits in the public domain or extinguishes a coal so that many people will not be injured by it, is liable. Although the [usual] purpose [served] by extinguishing [the coal] or moving [the thorn] is not important to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when constructing the Sanctuary, articles were transported because they were desired, and coals were extinguished to use for kindling an even flame.</i> and his intent was merely to prevent injury, he is liable. The same applies in other similar situations.
Whenever a person intends to perform a forbidden labor, but instead [through his actions] causes the performance of another forbidden labor for which he had no intent, he is not liable, because his intent was not carried out.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Although the instance stated by the Rambam is not found in the Talmud, it is a logical extension of the principle stated in <i>Keritot</i> 19b and <i>Shabbat</i> 97b (and expressed in the following halachah), "The Torah prohibited purposeful labor [on the Sabbath]." Since the labor ultimately performed was not the one originally intended, this is not considered to be "purposeful work."</i><br>What is implied? A person threw a stone or shot an arrow at a colleague or at an animal with the intent of slaying them. Should [the object that he propelled] uproot a tree in its progress and not kill [the intended victim], he is free of liability.<br>How much more so does this principle apply if one had the intent of performing a lesser transgression and one performed a more serious one. For example, a person intended to throw [a stone] into a<i> carmelit,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Chapter 14, Halachah 4, a <i>carmelit</i> is a domain in which the Sages applied the prohibitions against transporting and throwing articles which apply in the public domain by virtue of Torah law. Thus, the person had the intent of violating merely a Rabbinic law.</i> and instead, the stone passed into the public domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> draws attention to Chapter 13, Halachah 21, which states that even when a person intended to throw an object four cubits in the public domain and instead the object traveled eight cubits, he is not held liable, because he did not accomplish his intent. Hence, he explains that the intent is not that the public domain is beyond the<i> carmelit</i> and the object did not rest in the <i>carmelit</i> as intended, but rather continued to the public domain.<br>Instead, the Rambam is referring to an instance where a person is standing in a private domain with both a public domain and a <i>carmelit</i> before him. Although he intended to throw the object into the <i>carmelit</i>, it traveled into the public domain.</i> He is not held liable. The same applies in other similar circumstances.<br>Should a person have the intent of performing a permitted act and instead perform another act [which is forbidden], he is not held liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 7:11. This halachah represents a progressive sequence. In the first instance mentioned, the forbidden activity the person intended to perform was not performed at all. In the second instance, he intended to perform the forbidden activity - removing an object from his property - but his intent was not to transgress a Torah prohibition. In this third instance, the person had the intent of performing the activity that he performed for the sake of the result that activity produced. Nevertheless, since he desired to perform this activity with a permitted entity and that aspect of the desire was not fulfilled, he is not held liable (Rav Kapach).</i> For example, should he intend to cut produce that was not attached to the ground, and instead cut produce attached to the ground,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> offers two different interpretations of the Rambam's words: one that the person cut a different plant from the one he intended to cut, and one that he thought the plant he intended to cut had been detached from the earth, and discovered that it was attached. Although, both interpretations are halachically acceptable, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> favors the second one. The <i>Kovetz</i> and other authorities, however, favor the first.</i> he is not held liable. The same applies in other similar situations.
Should a person intend<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah develops the theme stated in the previous halachah, giving a further example of a case where a person is not held liable for a forbidden activity he performed, because of the principle, "The Torah prohibited purposeful labor [on the Sabbath]."</i> to pick black figs and pick white figs instead<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The difference in the color of the figs causes them to be regarded as two different types of fruit. This is significant, as is obvious from the contrast to the following halachah.</i> - or should he intend first to pick figs and then to pick grapes, but instead picked grapes and then figs - he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad takes issue with this point, arguing that since the person picking the fruit accomplished his objective, he should be held liable. It is insignificant that the order in which he picked them differed from that which he originally intended.<br>It can be explained, based on <i>Keritot</i> 19b, that the Rambam's understanding is that for a person to be held liable, not only must he accomplish his ultimate intent, but also, while he is performing the labor, his actions must be controlled by his thoughts.<br>Commenting on the difference of opinion between the Rambam and the Ra'avad, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that there is no difference regarding practical halachah at present. The only difference will be in the Era of the Redemption, at which time there will be a question whether it is necessary for such a person to bring a sin offering or not, and in that era, "the righteous instructor (<i>Mashiach</i>) will come" and render a decision.</i> He in fact picked everything that he desired, but because he did not pick them in the order that he intended, he is not held liable, since he did not act according to his intent. It is "purposeful labor" that the Torah forbade.
When a person had two candles before him and both of them were either burning or extinguished, and he desired to kindle or extinguish one, but instead he kindled or extinguished the other, he is liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text of <i>Keritot</i> 20a according to the Rambam and others. Our text of <i>Keritot</i> differs and frees a person of liability in such an instance. On this basis, the Ra'avad and others challenge the Rambam's position.</i> for he performed the [forbidden] labor that he intended to perform.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the previous halachah, this is speaking about an instance where the person does not derive any advantage from kindling or extinguishing either candle; he merely wants to kindle or extinguish a candle. The same effect results from kindling or extinguishing one as the other. Hence he is liable, for he performed a forbidden labor, and he is considered to have performed it willfully. Were there to be an advantage to kindling or extinguishing one of the two candles, the situation would resemble that described in Halachah 11.</i><br>To what can the matter be compared? To a person who intended to pick one fig and picked another instead, or to a person who desired to kill one [living being]<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The intent does not appear to be that he desired to kill a person, for it is highly unlikely that there would be no difference killing one person or the other. Rather, the Rambam appears to be referring to the killing of an insect or an animal, an act that is also forbidden on the Sabbath.</i> and killed another instead. [He is liable,] because the [forbidden] labor which he intended to do was performed.
One is, however, freed of liability [in the following instance: There were two candles before a person, one lit and one extinguished.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed additions are made on the basis of <i>Keritot</i> 20a.</i>] The person intended to kindle the [one that was extinguished] first and to extinguish the second candle afterwards. Nevertheless, the order [of his actions] became reversed, and instead, he extinguished the candle first and kindled the second candle afterwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As in Halachah 9, the fact that the person did not perform the tasks in the order in which he originally intended indicates that, at the time he performed them, he was not in control of his deeds. Hence, this is not considered to be "purposeful work." In this instance as well, the Ra'avad differs and holds the person liable.<br>The new concept this halachah teaches is that even when the tasks which the person intended to perform involve two separate labors (as opposed to Halachah 9 when only a single forbidden labor is involved), he is held liable only when he performs the tasks in the order he originally intended.</i><br>If he extinguished one and kindled the other in a single breath, he is liable. Although he did not kindle the first candle before [extinguishing the other], he did not delay [its lighting], and performed both activities simultaneously. Therefore, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since the order in which the person desired to perform the activity was not reversed, his actions are "purposeful work."</i> The same applies in other similar circumstances.<br>Whenever a person performs a [forbidden] labor casually, without specific intention, he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Keritot</i> 19b, differentiates between this type of behavior, referred to as מתעסק, and an inadvertent transgression of a commandment (שוגג) as follows: When a person transgresses בשוגג, he willfully performs the forbidden activity, but is unaware of the prohibition involved. In all the situations described as מתעסק, the person may be aware of the prohibition, but is not consciously controlling his behavior.</i>
Whenever a person intended to perform a forbidden labor and performed it more effectively than he had originally intended, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Although he accepts the Rambam's premise, the Ra'avad objects to the wording the Rambam chose, explaining that there is an instance - a person who desired to write the name שמעון and instead, wrote the name שם - where a person does not fulfill his intention and is still liable.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that in that instance, the person also had the intent to write the letters of the name שם and is therefore held liable, as implied by Halachah 14. By putting the focus on intent, the Rambam emphasizes that the leniency stated in this halachah is also an outgrowth of the principle that "The Torah prohibited purposeful work."</i> If [he performs it] less effectively than he had originally intended, he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, the expression "he is not liable," means that a person should not be punished - nor is he liable to bring a sin offering - for his deed. Nevertheless, performing such a deed constitutes the violation of a Rabbinic prohibition. As mentioned, this concept is applicable throughout this chapter, and indeed throughout the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as a whole.</i><br>What is implied? A person intended to carry a burden suspended behind him and instead, it swung in front of him. He is liable, for he intended to protect it in a less effective manner, and it was ultimately protected in a more effective manner. If, however, he intended to carry a burden suspended before him, and instead it swung behind him, he is not liable, for he intended to protect it in a more effective manner and, it was ultimately protected in a less effective manner.
[A person who transfers an article from one domain to another is held liable in the following situation]: He was wearing a belt<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 10:4. Rashi and others offer alternate definitions of the term.</i> and he placed a burden that is commonly transferred in this manner between his body and his garment. Whether the burden hung in front of him or it had shifted behind him [at the time he transferred it], he is held liable, since it is likely to shift position.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The intent here is that since it is usual for the article to shift position in such an instance, this is considered to be part of the person's original intent.<br>Although this law is more specific than most mentioned in this chapter, it is still worthy of mention, because it illustrates how a person's intention can be general in nature and include several different possible ways in which a forbidden labor could be performed.</i>
Whenever a person desired to perform a [forbidden] labor on the Sabbath, began the performance of that labor, and performed an amount of work sufficient to incur liability,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Here the Rambam introduces a new concept, שיעור, the amount of work sufficient to incur liability. When the Torah forbade the performance of labor on the Sabbath, it also specified that a person is not held liable unless his activities are sufficient to bring about a significant result. Thus, a particular שיעור was established for every specific labor.<br>A similar concept applies with regard to other prohibitions. For example, with regard to most forbidden foods one is not held liable unless one eats an amount equivalent to the size of an olive.<br>[<i>Yoma</i> 74 discusses whether a person who performs a forbidden activity, but does so involving less than a שיעור, is considered to have violated a prohibition from the Torah (although he is not liable for punishment or a sin offering) or whether he is considered to have violated merely a Rabbinic commandment.]</i> he is held liable, even if he did not complete the task he desired to perform.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">One might think that since the person did not complete his intended objective, his activity is not considered "purposeful labor." The Rambam explains, however, that since the work the person did complete was performed "purposefully," and since he completed a significant amount of work (a שיעור), he is held liable.</i><br>For example, a person desired to write a note or a contract on the Sabbath. We do not say that he is not liable until he completes his desire and writes the entire note or contract. Instead, as soon as he writes two letters, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 11, Halachah 9.</i><br>Similarly, a person who desires to weave an entire garment is held liable after weaving two strands.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 9, Halachah 18.</i> Although he intended to complete [the entire garment], he is held liable because he intentionally performed the amount of work sufficient to incur liability. The same applies in all similar situations.
Whenever two people share in the performance of a [forbidden] labor that one of them could have performed by himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">A situation in which a forbidden labor requires the efforts of more than one individual is discussed in the following halachah.</i> they are [both] free of liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 3a derives this from the exegesis of Leviticus 4:27, explaining that that verse teaches that one is liable only "when one performs the entire labor and not a portion of it; when one person performs the labor and not two."<br>See also Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 93a and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 316:7 explain that a person is not liable for performing a labor in this manner, because this is not the ordinary manner in which the labor is performed.</i><br>This applies whether one performed part of the [forbidden] labor and the other performed the remainder - e.g., one removed an article from one domain and the other placed it down in the other domain - or they both performed the [forbidden] labor together from the beginning to the end. For example, they both held a pen and wrote, or they both held a loaf of bread and transferred it from one domain to another.
When, however, a single individual cannot perform [the forbidden labor] alone and must be joined by others, [all the individuals involved are held liable].<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Akiva Eiger writes that the same applies when a forbidden labor is performed by three or more individuals and the performance of the forbidden labor requires the efforts of all the individuals involved. Nevertheless, if three individuals perform a forbidden labor and it requires only the efforts of two, none of the individuals is held liable, for no one is capable of performing the task alone.</i> For example, two people held a beam and transferred it to the public domain. Since neither one of them had the strength to perform this task alone,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Shabbat</i> 93a emphasizes that the matter is not dependent on strength alone. Even when a person has sufficient strength to carry an object alone, but requires a second person's assistance because of the object's bulk, neither is liable. In practice, the transfer of the object requires both their efforts.</i> and they performed it together from the beginning to the end, they are both held liable. The minimum amount of work for which they are held liable is the same as for a single individual who performs such a task.<br>[The following decision applies when] one of them has sufficient strength to transfer the beam alone, but the other is unable to transfer it alone. If they join together and transfer the beam, the one who is capable [of moving it himself] is held liable. The second one is considered [merely] as offering assistance, and a person who offers assistance [in this fashion] is not liable at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This principle is also applied in other contexts aside from the laws of the Sabbath. (See <i>Hilchot Tum'at Mishkav UMoshav</i> 7:6 and <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 5:18. See also the commentary to the Moznaim edition of <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 1:11.)</i> The same applies in other similar situations.
Whenever [a forbidden labor is performed] in a destructive manner, one is not held liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned previously, the prohibition against labor on the Sabbath was derived from a comparison to the labors performed in the construction of the Sanctuary. In that instance, all the labors had a positive intent.<br>(The Rambam's statements imply that performing a forbidden labor with a destructive intent is not forbidden by the Torah at all, but is merely a Rabbinic prohibition. There are opinions which differ, and maintain that although the Torah did not hold one liable in such an instance, the act is forbidden by the Torah itself.)</i> What is implied? A person who injures a colleague or an animal with a destructive intent,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">However, see Chapter 8, Halachah 8, which states that if a person injures another person as an expression of anger, he is liable, for in his own mind his activity is constructive; he is releasing pent up emotion.</i> one who rips or burns garments, or one who breaks utensils with a destructive intent is not held liable.<br>A person who dug a pit solely because he needed the earth inside it is considered as having performed a [forbidden] labor with a destructive intent, and is therefore free of liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and others note that this activity is only destructive when the pit is dug within a home. Digging a pit for the sake of its earth in a field, by contrast, is not considered a destructive act. It is, however, a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה (see Halachah 7), for the digger has no desire for the pit, the object of the work. As mentioned, other authorities free a person in such an instance; the Rambam, however, would normally hold one liable.</i> Although he performed a [forbidden] labor, he is not held liable because he had a destructive intent.
Whenever a person carries out a destructive activity for the sake of ultimately performing a constructive activity, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, several of the 39 categories of labor forbidden on the Sabbath - e.g., tearing, erasing, and demolishing - involve activities that are essentially destructive in nature. Nevertheless, when one performs these activities for an ultimate constructive intent, one is held liable.</i> For example, a person who demolishes [a structure] in order to build [another] in its place,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note the contrast between the Rambam's wording in this halachah and in Chapter 10, Halachah 15, where he omits the expression, "in its place." Accordingly, the commentaries question whether one is liable for demolishing a building for the sake of building another, when the other building will not be built in the place of the first. (See the gloss of the <i>Or Sameach</i> on Chapter 10, Halachah 12.)</i> one who erased for the sake of writing [something else] in the place of the erasure, or one who dug a pit in order to place the foundations of a structure within. The same applies in other similar situations.<br>The minimum measure of the destructive activity for which he is held liable is equal to that of the correspondent positive activity.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">For example, the minimum measure (שיעור) for which one is liable for the constructive act of writing is two letters. Therefore, one is liable for erasing two letters. Moreover, as stated in Chapter 11, Halachah 9, a person is liable when he erases one letter which is large enough for two to be written in its place.</i>
Whenever a person performs a [forbidden] labor on the Sabbath, partially with intent and partially unintentionally,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The definition of "unintentionally" (בשוגג) is that one is unaware that the activity is forbidden, or one is unaware that the day is the Sabbath. Thus, the situation described by the Rambam would involve, for example, writing one letter knowing that it is the Sabbath and that it is forbidden to do so, and writing a second letter having forgotten either of these factors.</i> he is not liable. [This law applies] regardless of whether one began the performance of the [forbidden] labor intentionally and completed it unintentionally, or one began the [forbidden] labor unintentionally and completed it intentionally.<br>One is liable for <i>karet</i> only when one performs the entire minimum measure of a [forbidden] labor intentionally from the beginning to the end. [In such a circumstance,] were witnesses who administered a warning to be present, one would be liable for execution by stoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 1.</i> Conversely, one is liable to bring a sin offering of a fixed nature<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 1.</i> when one performs the entire minimum measure of a [forbidden] labor unintentionally from the beginning to the end.

Chapter 2

The [laws of] the Sabbath are suspended<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam uses the expression דחויה, which, as evident from<i> Pesachim</i> 77a and <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 4:15, implies that although a prohibition is not enforced, it has not been lifted entirely. In contrast, the term הותרה would imply that no trace of the prohibition remains.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and other authorities question the implications and the appropriateness of the Rambam's choice of terms. [In a responsum (Vol. 1, 689), the Rashba illustrates the difference between these terms. A person was in need of meat on the Sabbath and there was non-kosher meat available. If the Sabbath laws are דחויה, it would be proper to eat the non-kosher meat. If the Sabbath laws are הותרה, it would be preferable to slaughter a kosher animal on the sick person's behalf. The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 328:14) states that, in such a situation, one should slaughter a kosher animal, implying that the laws are הותרה. (Note, however, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 328:16 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 328:39.)]<br>See the <i>Avnei Nezer, Orach Chayim</i>, Responsa 455, which explains the concept of הותרה as meaning that, with regard to this person, it is as if the laws of the Sabbath were never commanded. (See also <i>Chiddushim UVeurim BaShas</i>, Vol. 3, which explains that although the Rambam stated that a threat to Jewish life overrides the observance of all the mitzvot of the Torah in <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah,</i> Chapter 5, he emphasizes this concept with regard to the Sabbath laws for the following reason. The other prohibitions are דחויה in the face of a threat to life, while the Sabbath laws are הותרה.</i> in the face of a danger to life,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 85b uses the expression, "Violate one Sabbath on his behalf, so that he will be able to observe many Sabbaths [in the future]."

See Halachah 18.</i> as are [the obligations of] the other mitzvot. Therefore, we may perform - according to the directives of a professional physician<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 328:10), which cites an opinion that states that we may rely on the evaluation of experienced God-fearing individuals, even if they are not physicians.</i> of that locale<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Kapach explains that, with this expression, the Rambam implies that we may rely on a local physician and need not seek the advice of a greater expert who lives further away.</i> - everything that is necessary for the benefit of a sick person whose life is in danger.<br>When there is a doubt whether or not the Sabbath laws must be violated on a person's behalf, one should violate the Sabbath laws on his behalf, for the Sabbath laws are suspended even when there is merely a question of danger to a person's life. [The same principles apply] when one physician says the Sabbath laws should be violated on a person's behalf and another physician states that this is not necessary.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:8, which gives further details regarding a difference of opinion between physicians.</i>
[The following laws apply when physicians] determine on the Sabbath that a person needs [a treatment to be administered] for eight days. We do not say that we should wait until the evening so that it will not be necessary to violate two Sabbaths on his behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 328:13 states that this applies even if there is no danger that the person will die immediately. Since there is a danger that he may die later if the treatment is not administered at this time, the Sabbath laws may be violated.</i> Instead, the treatment is begun immediately, on the Sabbath, and even one hundred Sabbaths may be violated on his behalf.<br>As long as a person is dangerously [ill] - or even if there is a question whether or not he is dangerously [ill] - and requires treatment, [the Sabbath] should be violated [on his behalf]. A lamp may be lit on his behalf and extinguished on his behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 2:5, specifies that the leniency to extinguish a lamp is granted only when it is impossible to move it - or, alternatively, the sick person - to another place or veil the lamp's light.</i> [Animals] may be slaughtered on his behalf, [food] baked and cooked on his behalf, and water heated for him, whether to drink or to use for bathing.<br>The general principle for a person who is dangerously ill is that the Sabbath should be considered as a weekday regarding all his needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">There is a question among the Rabbis if this statement is to be interpreted literally or not. As mentioned in the commentary on the previous halachah, there is a difference of opinion if the Sabbath laws are דחויה or הותרה in the face of a danger to life. According to the opinion that they are merely דחויה, an attempt should be made to minimize the violation of the Sabbath laws if doing so does not constitute a threat to the person's life. (See <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, ibid.</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 328:14.)</i>
When such treatment is administered, it should not be administered by gentiles,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gentiles are not obligated to observe the Sabbath, and thus having them administer the treatment would not involve the violation of a Torah commandment. Nevertheless, they should not be entrusted with the care of the sick for the reason stated by the Rambam.</i> by children,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since they are below the age of Bar or Bat Mitzvah, according to the Torah itself the observance of the mitzvot is not incumbent upon them, and only a Rabbinic prohibition is involved.</i> by servants, or by women,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Although women and servants are obligated to observe the Sabbath laws, since in many areas of Torah and mitzvot, their obligations are less than men, having them violate the Sabbath laws in this instance could cause the Sabbath to be regarded flippantly, as explained in the next note.</i> so that they will not view the Sabbath flippantly.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's choice of wording, based on <i>Yoma</i> 84b, has raised several questions among the commentaries. The most literal interpretation is given by the <i>Merkevat HaMishneh</i>, who explains that when people see that the Sabbath laws are violated by the gentiles for Jews or by women or children, they may get the impression that the observance of these laws is not very crucial, and leniencies may be taken on other occasions - even when there is no valid reason. If, however, it is Torah Sages who violate the laws, the common people will realize that it is only the seriousness of the situation that allowed for this leniency.<br>Among the other interpretations given why the laws should not be violated by women and children, is that this might cause them to violate the Sabbath laws in the future (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>Significantly, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 328:12) explains that the reason the treatment should not be administered by gentiles is the possibility for delay. Accordingly, if there is no delay involved and one can be sure that the same quality of treatment will be given, it is preferable that the treatment be administered by gentiles.<br>The commentaries explain that the difference between his opinion and that of the Rambam (quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>) depends on the question discussed above: Are the Sabbath laws הותרה or merely דחויה in the face of a danger to life.<br>[See also <i>Chiddushim UVeurim BaShas</i>, Vol. 3, which states that the Rambam's wording here indicates that he sees the violation of the Sabbath laws in such situations as an expression of reverence and regard for the Sabbath.]</i> Instead, the treatment should be administered by the leaders of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This also is based on the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Yoma, ibid.</i> Others (see <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 328:12) understand the phrase גדולי ישראל in that passage as meaning simply "adult males."</i> and the wise.<br>It is forbidden to hesitate before transgressing the Sabbath [laws] on behalf of a person who is dangerously ill,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 8:5) states, "A person who [administers treatment] quickly is praiseworthy, and one who raises questions is considered as if he shed blood.</i> as [reflected in the interpretation in the phrase of Leviticus 18:5,] "which a person shall perform to live through them," as "['to live through them'] and not to die through them."<br>This teaches that the judgments of the Torah do not [bring] vengeance to the world, but rather bring mercy, kindness, and peace to the world.

When a person's eyes are ailing - i.e., when he has a secretion from either one or both of them, when tears flow from them due to great pain, when blood flows from them, or when they are affected by fever,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, the Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state קדח, "piercing pain" (the commentary of Rabbenu Chanan'el on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 28b), rather than קדחת, "fever."</i> or by other afflictions of this like - he is considered among those individuals who are dangerously ill.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah, loc. cit.,</i> explains that there is a connection between the eyes and the heart, and such a person is therefore considered to be dangerously ill.</i> The Sabbath may be violated on his behalf, and anything necessary for his treatment may be performed for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">From the wording of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 328:9), it appears that once an eye ailment is nearly healed, we may not violate the Sabbath laws to treat it.

When a person swallows a leech, water may be heated for him on the Sabbath, and any medical treatment that is necessary may be administered, since his life is in danger.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam allows the performance of any activity even when there is a Rabbinic prohibition involved. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differs, and explains that according to the Rambam, any activity forbidden by the Rabbis may not be performed despite the fact that a person is bedridden by illness.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) does not follow either of the interpretations of the Rambam's view, but instead suggests following the opinion of the Ramban, who permits the performance of any activity forbidden by the Rabbis, provided that it is performed in an abnormal manner. Furthermore, if there is a danger to a specific limb, the Rabbinic prohibitions are waived, and such activities may be performed in the normal manner. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 328:19 is even more lenient and allows one to perform activities that are forbidden by the Torah itself, provided one performs them in an uncharacteristic manner.</i> they may be treated even by Jews. For this reason, it is permitted to perform [physical activities for the benefit of the sick]; for example, one may lift [the tendons of] the ears, lift up cartilage around the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">There are times when the cartilage around the heart becomes compressed against the body and it must be lifted up in order to facilitate breathing (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 29a).</i> restore broken bones to their places, or perform other activities of this like.
When a woman in the process of childbirth squats to give birth,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the description of the techniques of midwifery used in Talmudic and post-Talmudic times. Others translate the term as a woman being bent over with labor pains. Compare to Halachah 13, which mentions the possibility of performing forbidden labors on a woman's behalf from the time "when there is a show of blood." See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 330:3), which mentions both these terms and also refers to the condition when a woman is overcome by labor pains to the point where she must be carried by her friends. Any one of these three conditions constitutes a danger to life for which the Sabbath laws may be broken.</i> her life is considered in danger and the Sabbath laws may be violated on her behalf. A midwife may be called from a distant place<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 18:3) states that this leniency applies even when she lives beyond the Sabbath limits (see Chapter 27).

In his commentary on that text, the Ramban explains that this principle applies regarding all instances when the Sabbath laws are violated because of a danger to life. If it is possible to reduce the extent to which they are violated, one should do so.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> postulates that the Rambam would not require such stringencies at all times. Were that the case, the Rambam would have stated this principle earlier. Instead, this is a specific ruling applicable with regard to a woman in childbirth. Greater stringency is applied in this instance, because although there is a threat to the woman's life, the probability of a woman's actually dying is very low. (It can be explained that the difference of opinion between the Ramban and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> revolves around the question whether the Sabbath laws are דחויה or הותרה in the face of a danger to life, as explained in the notes on Halachot 1 and 2.)</i> If this not possible, it may be brought in the ordinary manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Sefer HaChasidim</i>, which states that it is preferable that a woman prepare everything necessary for childbirth from the ninth month onward, so that if she gives birth on the Sabbath, only a minimal amount of forbidden labor will have to be performed.</i>
We should not help an idolatress<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The term "idolatress" is used here to refer to a gentile who actually worships idols. In contrast, the term <i>ger toshav</i> refers to a gentile who accepts the seven universal laws commanded to Noah and his descendants. (See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1-2 and <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 10:6.)<br>In <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 10:2, the Rambam writes that it is forbidden to offer medical treatment to an idolater even for a fee. Accordingly, this halachah extends that principle to include a woman in childbirth. The question is raised, however, concerning the majority of the gentiles in the present age. Although the Rambam considers Christianity as idol worship, many authorities do not. According to the latter opinions, although these gentiles are not idolaters, they have not gone through the formal process of acceptance of the seven laws commanded to Noach and cannot therefore be considered as <i>gerim toshavim</i>.<br>Many authorities (see the commentary on the Moznaim edition of<i> Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>) maintain that it is permitted to treat such people during the week. On the Sabbath, however, one may not perform forbidden labors on their behalf. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah </i>330:8, which speaks very critically about physicians who violate the Sabbath laws on behalf of gentiles.) According to these authorities, one would be allowed to treat these gentiles on the Sabbath provided that there was not any forbidden labor involved. Note, however, Rav Kapach, who quotes Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> that state "gentile" instead of "idolatress."</i> give birth on the Sabbath, even if payment is offered.

When a woman dies while in labor on the Sabbath, a knife should be brought - even if it must be carried through the public domain - and the woman's womb cut open and the fetus removed, for it is possible that it will still be alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 330:5) states that it is no longer customary to follow this practice even during the week.

[All] activities necessary to save a life should be performed on the Sabbath; there is no necessity to receive license from the court. The more zealous one is [in this regard], the more praiseworthy.<br>What is implied?<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 328:13) rephrases the concepts stated in this halachah slightly, connecting the praise given a person for being zealous in saving a life with the situation concerning catching fish described afterwards. According to the<i> Shulchan Aruch</i>, this situation teaches us that a person is considered praiseworthy for saving a life on the Sabbath even if he accrues personal benefit through his actions - for example, in the case at hand, in addition to saving a life, the person also receives a catch of fish.</i> If one sees that a child has fallen into the sea, one may spread out a net and hoist him up, although one catches fish together with him. If a person hears that a child fell into the sea and spreads out a net to hoist him up, but raises up only fish, he is absolutely free of liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam adds the term "absolutely" to indicate that it is desirable to spread out and raise one's nets to try to save the child (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). Significantly, the Jerusalem Talmud,<i> Shabbat</i> 13:6, states that the person is not held liable even if he intended to catch the fish together with the child.</i><br>If he intended to raise up fish and [in fact] lifted up both fish and a child, he is not held liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Or Sameach</i> writes that he is given "stripes for rebelliousness" (the punishment usually given for the violation of a Rabbinic ordinance), since he intended to perform a forbidden activity. See a parallel ruling, <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 12:18.<br>Significantly, when mentioning this instance in <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 2:15, the Rambam states that the person acted בשוגג when catching the fish - i.e., he was unaware that it was the Sabbath or was unaware that it is forbidden to fish on the Sabbath.</i> Since he lifted up a child together with the fish, he is not held liable even when he did not hear that the child had fallen into the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">This reflects the Rambam's decision regarding a difference of opinion between the Sages in <i>Menachot</i> 64a.

The question of whether such a person is considered alive has been raised today within the context of many contemporary medical issues. Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Igros Moshe, Yoreh De'ah</i>, Vol. II, Responsum 174) and other authorities of the present age have ruled that breath is still the fundamental determinant whether or not a person is alive.</i><br>Although it is discovered that people on the upper level of a landslide have died, one should not assume that those on the lower levels have died.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes the contradiction and suggests amending the text of <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> in light of our halachah. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, however, explains that this clause of our halachah speaks of a <i>milchemet reshut</i>, a war which we are not obligated to wage, while <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> speaks of a <i>milchemet mitzvah</i>, a war which we are obligated to wage.</i> We may wage war with them on any day, even on the Sabbath, until we conquer [the city], even if the war is voluntary in nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Melachim</i> describes a voluntary war, a <i>milchemet reshut</i>, as a war fought "to expand the borders of Israel or magnify [the king's] greatness and reputation."

Chapter 3

It is permissible to begin the performance of a [forbidden] labor on Friday, even though the labor is completed on its own accord on the Sabbath itself,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 252:1) emphasizes that this leniency applies even when one is certain that the forbidden labor will continue on its own accord on the Sabbath, as mentioned in the examples cited by the Rambam in the following halachah.<br>Having outlined the general principles governing the Sabbath laws in the first chapter, and the situations when leniency can be permitted because of a danger to life in the second chapter, the Rambam begins his discussion of the Sabbath laws themselves. He starts with an explanation of activities that are begun before the Sabbath actually commences.<br>[Significantly, although the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i>, Chapter 1) starts with a different concept, it also mentions many of the laws quoted by the Rambam towards the beginning of its treatment of the Sabbath laws.]</i> for the prohibition against work applies only on the Sabbath itself. Moreover, when a task is carried out on its own accord on the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 18a explains that these laws reflect a difference of opinion between the School of Hillel and the School of Shammai. The School of Shammai maintains that just as a person is required to have his servants and livestock rest on the Sabbath, so, too, is he required to have his utensils rest. They may not be used for work on the Sabbath. The School of Hillel does not accept this thesis, and their opinion is adopted as halachah. (See Chapter 6, Halachah 16.)</i> we are permitted to derive benefit from what was completed on the Sabbath.
What is implied?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam exemplifies the principle mentioned in the previous halachah, describing forbidden labors that are initiated by a person before the commencement of the Sabbath and continue without additional input from the person on the Sabbath. These examples are taken from the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:5-9) and the explanation of these <i>mishnayot</i> in the Talmud.</i> We may open an irrigation channel to a garden on Friday, causing it to continue to fill throughout [the Sabbath] day. We may place [burning] incense under garments, causing them to continue to be made fragrant throughout the entire Sabbath.

Similarly, we may light a candle or a fire [before] evening so that it continues to burn throughout the entire Sabbath.
A pot may be placed over a fire, or meat may be placed in an oven or over coals [on Friday], so that they continue to cook throughout the Sabbath [with the intent] that they be eaten on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is explaining that according to the Torah itself, leaving food over a fire to cook would resemble all the activities mentioned in the previous halachah. For although cooking is a forbidden labor, the cooking would continue without any further activity. Nevertheless, as is explained in the subsequent halachot, our Sages enacted certain restrictions because they were afraid that a person might stir the fire to cause the food to cook faster.</i> With regard to this matter, however, there are certain restrictions that were enacted lest one stir the coals on the Sabbath.
What is implied? When food has not been cooked to the extent that it is ready to serve, water has not been boiled, or food has been cooked to the extent that it is ready to serve,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's view is also shared by Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and other Sephardic authorities and is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 253:1). Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 37b) and the Ashkenazic authorities who followed him are more lenient and maintain that when half (or according to others, a third - see Chapter 9, Halachah 5 and notes) of the cooking process has been completed, food may be left on a fire even when its taste is improved by continued cooking. The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that it is customary to follow this view.</i> but the longer it cooks the better it tastes,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Even according to the Rambam, if continued cooking will impair the taste of a food or if food was not cooked at all, we are allowed to leave it on a flame, for it is unlikely that the person will continue to stir the flames to make it cook more, as will be explained in Halachah 8.</i> it may not be left over a fire on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The contemporary Rabbinic authorities explain that these rules also apply to electric and gas ranges.

Hence, a decree was not [enacted forbidding food to be left on the fire] lest he stir the coals.
When does the above apply? With regard to a range<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">We have used a contemporary translation for the word <i>kirah</i>. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:3), the Rambam describes a <i>kirah</i> as "a place built into the ground with openings for two pots.

With regard to an oven,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Nissim states that the ovens of his time were constructed differently from those of the Talmudic era. Their heat is not as intense, and they are governed by the rules that apply to a range. This leniency is also accepted by the Ramah. Although the construction of ovens has changed further in contemporary times, most authorities continue to accept his ruling with regard to household ovens. (With regard to commercial ovens, there is a difference of opinion.)</i> in contrast, even if one removed the coals,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The reasons why restrictions are mentioned even in such an instance are explained in the following halachah.</i> covered them with ash, or used straw or stubble as fuel,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">There are authorities (see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 253:22) who maintain that the Rambam would allow food to be left in an oven if it was fueled with straw and stubble and the fire was removed. Although the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 253:1) do not make such a distinction, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> explains that there is room for leniency.</i> we are not allowed to leave food in it or on it. Similarly, one should not put food close to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The food may not be placed at any point where the heat is warm enough to scald a child's hand. In terms of modern measure, the Rabbis define this term as 107.8 degrees Farenheit.</i><br>[This applies to] food that was not cooked to completion or was completely cooked, but will benefit from continued cooking. Since [an oven] is very hot, a person will not divert his attention [from the fire]. Hence, we suspect that he will stir the small fire that remains, even if it is straw or stubble, or even if it is covered.
Why did [the Sages] forbid leaving food in the oven even if the fire was removed? Because a person can remove only the majority of the coals and their most intense [heat]. It is impossible to remove the entire fire so that not even a spark remains. Since [an oven's] heat is very warm, we suspect that he will stir [the fire] so that the sparks that remain in the oven will burn more.
A <i>kopach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:3), the Rambam explains that a <i>kopach</i> is "built over the fire with a place for one pot.

It transpired, however, that many people were intentionally leaving food to cook, and if admonished would excuse themselves by claiming that they forgot. Accordingly, the Sages placed restrictions on those who forgot as well, forbidding them to partake of the food until Saturday night. (See the exception to this rule mentioned in the notes on Halachah 18.)<br>There is a question whether it is necessary to wait until the food has time to cook on Saturday night or not. From the Rambam's wording, it appears that this is unnecessary. Rabbenu Asher, however, rules that it is necessary to wait. His view is accepted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 253:12.

Although they are permitted to be left on a fire, once they are removed it is forbidden to return them. Surely this prohibition applies to foods that have not been cooked completely and, according to the Rambam, are forbidden to be left on a fire.

Therefore, if the cooking process of a food has not been completed, it may not be returned to a cooking surface even when that surface is covered (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 253:2). Even when the food has already been completely cooked, there is a Rabbinic prohibition against cooking it further, as the Rambam writes in Chapter 9, Halachah 3.<br>Other authorities (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Sefer HaMaor</i>) mention that it is forbidden to return food to a cooking surface, because of the impression it might create.

A person should not fill a pot with peas or beans or a jug with water and place them in an oven on Friday before nightfall and leave them [to cook].

That halachah pertains to foods that require substantial time to cook - hence, the person cooking will divert his attention and not stir the coals. In contrast, the entities mentioned in this halachah do not require substantial time to cook, and there is the possibility that one will stir the coals.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 254:8) quotes the Rambam's words almost verbatim, and this interpretation is accepted by the later authorities. Nevertheless, Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 18b) and many authorities differ in their interpretation of this passage, noting that <i>Beitzah</i> 25b states that these beans must be cooked seven times before they are prepared to eat.<br>See also the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 254), which juxtaposes the Rambam's position with Rashi's, explaining that the Rambam is talking about an instance when the beans have already been cooked six times. Hence, only a slight amount of further cooking is necessary. Rav Kapach substantiates this interpretation, explaining that beans with a similar name are still eaten in Yemen today. After having been cooked several times, these beans cook very fast.</i> Therefore, the person will continue to pay attention to them, for he intends to partake of them immediately.

[The following rules apply when] meat was placed in an oven before nightfall and left [to roast<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Previously, the Rambam had been speaking of meat that was cooked in a pot or roasted in a pan.

At times, the opening was sealed closed to allow for faster and more effective cooking. According to the Rambam (and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>), the above clauses of the halachah deal with meat that is roasted with the oven open. Rabbenu Asher (in his gloss on <i>Shabbat </i>18b) interprets these laws as applying when the oven is closed, but not sealed. According to his view, if the oven is open, there is always reason to suspect that one will stir the coals. The <i>Tur</i> and the Ramah follow this interpretation.</i><br>If, however, one sealed the opening of the oven closed with clay, [roasting even the latter meats] is permitted, for if one opens the oven to stir [the coals], the wind will enter and cause the meat to harden and spoil. The oven will cool [suddenly] and the meat will spoil.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The latter phrase is lacking in the authoritative Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and appears redundant.<br>Because opening the oven will cause the meat to spoil, we do not suspect that one will do so to stir the coals.</i>
Similarly, whenever something would be spoiled by the wind, we do not decree [against its being heated], because someone might open [the oven] and stir [coals]. For this reason, we may place strands of flax into an oven [to bleach] before nightfall, for if one opens the oven, they will spoil.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 2, this law follows the principles of the School of Hillel.

If one placed an entire kid<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">When the body of an animal or fowl is intact, the meat is not exposed to the heat of the fire on both sides.

Ben D'rosai was a notorious criminal who was constantly being chased and would eat his food before it had been completely cooked in his haste to avoid detection. As mentioned in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, according to the Rambam it must be half-cooked on both sides. According to Rashi, it is sufficient that it is one-third cooked.<br>Rav Moshe Cohen of Lunil questions why the Rambam differentiates between roasting - where he allows food that is partially cooked to continue cooking - and cooking in a pot - where he requires the food to be completely cooked and that further cooking will not benefit it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) explains that cooking in a pot requires more time and there is a greater possibility that one will stir the coals. See also the <i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i>.</i> [If they are roasted to this extent before the commencement of the Sabbath], it is permissible to leave them on the fire on the Sabbath to be roasted further.<br>[The rationale is] that [increased heat] will impair their taste. Since they are being cooked over a fire, if one stirs [the coals] they will char.<br>For this reason, we are allowed to leave incense under clothes before nightfall [to perfume them]. For if one stirs the coals, the incense will burn and the clothes will be [damaged by] the smoke.
From the above, we can conclude that all the prohibitions mentioned in this context were not enacted because [the cooking] was completed on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">With this statement, the Rambam refers to the principles he had mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. There it was explained that the halachah follows the School of Hillel, which allows us to benefit from forbidden labors that are completed on the Sabbath on their own accord. Nevertheless, there are certain restrictions instituted against leaving food to cook, lest one stir the coals, as explained.</i> Instead, they are Rabbinic decrees [enacted] lest one stir the coals. Accordingly, wool should not be placed into a vat [to dye] unless it was removed from the fire, lest one stir the coals. Similarly, the vat should be sealed close with clay, lest one stir [the dye] after nightfall.
We should not place bread in an oven [directly] before nightfall, nor should we place a cake on coals unless [there is time] for the surface attached to the oven or [the side of the cake<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed additions are made on the basis of the interpretation of the <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i>, 254.</i>] facing the fire to crust.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In the Talmudic period, bread was baked by attaching a loaf to the side of the oven. This surface would crust first. Nevertheless, this is sufficient for the bread to be considered to be baked before the commencement of the Sabbath.<br>It must be emphasized that this ruling represents a reversal of opinion for the Rambam. In his Commentary on the Mishnah,<i> Shabbat </i>1:10, he rules that the outer surface must crust before the Sabbath. (The latter ruling also conforms to his thesis regarding cooked food: that it must be completely cooked before the commencement of the Sabbath.) It must be emphasized that the version of this halachah found in the authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> are in accordance with the ruling in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 254:5) follows the more lenient ruling.</i> [Should this be done,] it is permissible to leave it to continue baking afterwards, for if one stirs [the coals], one will spoil the bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., cause it to burn.</i><br>[The following rules apply when one places bread in an oven] before nightfall and there is not sufficient time for its surface to crust before nightfall. If one did so with a deliberate intent to violate [the above ruling], it is forbidden to partake of the bread until Saturday night, after sufficient time for it to bake has passed.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This resembles the ruling of Halachah 9 regarding food that was left to cook over a fire.</i>If one did so unknowingly, it is permitted to remove bread<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Not only is the person who baked the bread allowed to remove it himself, he may invite others to remove bread as well, as stated in Chapter 22, Halachah 1.</i> for the three Sabbath meals.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Here the ruling is far more lenient than the ruling in Halachah 9 regarding food. The commentaries (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 254:8 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 254:33) explain that the fundamental element of all meals is bread, and if the person does not have bread he will not be able to fulfill the mitzvah of eating three Sabbath meals. From this, one can postulate that if a person has no food other than that which has been left on a fire on the Sabbath, he is allowed to partake of that food so that he will not be required to fast on the Sabbath.</i> When one removes the bread, one should not remove it using a baker's peel as one does during the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Since the removal of bread is forbidden, it should be done in an abnormal manner. The commentaries question whether one is required to remove the bread in an abnormal manner only when it was placed in the oven later than the desired time, or whether this is necessary even when the bread was permitted to be left baking.<br>From the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> notes on Chapter 5, Halachah 19, and from the simple interpretation of Chapter 22, Halachah 1, it would appear that one is always required to remove the bread in an abnormal manner. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Nissim maintains that this stringency applies only when one placed the bread in the oven after the desired time. If one placed the bread inside earlier, there is no necessity to deviate from one's ordinary practice. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 254:36 accepts this ruling when there is no way that one can remove the bread in an abnormal way.<br>It must be emphasized that the above discussion applies only to the ovens of the Talmudic period. At present, our ovens are constructed in a different manner, and the loaves of bread are not stuck to the sides of the oven. Accordingly, any bread that is required for the Sabbath itself can be removed in an ordinary manner. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 254:9 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 254:42-43.)</i> Instead, one should use a knife or other similar utensil.
A person may make a fire from any substance he desires,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">As is mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachot 5-8, there are certain substances that may not be used as wicks or fuel for a candle on the Sabbath. These restrictions apply only with regard to a candle, for it is a single light. (See Chapter 5, Halachah 7.) In contrast, greater leniency can be shown with regard to a fire. (See Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 21a and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 255:1.)</i> regardless of whether] he kindles it on the ground or in a torch holder. When he lights it before nightfall, he may use its light, or warm himself from it on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 275:6, which states that even in such a situation, one should not sit very close to the fire, lest one tend to it.</i><br>He must, however, kindle the majority of the fire before nightfall to the extent that the flame rises up on its own accord.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., without the assistance of other fuels, blowing with a bellows, or kindling wood (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 1:11).</i> If he did not kindle the majority of the fire, it is forbidden for him to benefit from it on the Sabbath, lest he stir or move the wood so the flame rises up.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">This prohibition continues to apply even if the fire catches afterwards to the extent that there is no need to worry that a person will stir the coals. Since it was lit in a forbidden manner, one is forbidden to benefit from it (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 255:2 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 255:5).</i> If he [desires to] burn a single piece of wood, he must kindle the majority of its thickness and the majority of its circumference before nightfall.
When does the above apply?

If a fire was made of reeds or of seeds, it is not necessary for the majority of it to be kindled before the Sabbath. Instead, since it caught fire before [the commencement] of the Sabbath, its use is permitted, for the fire will spread quickly through [these substances], and there is no necessity for one to stir it.<br>Therefore, if the reeds were bound together or the seeds were placed in palm baskets, the same laws applying to wood apply, and the flames must be powerful enough to rise up on their own accord before [the commencement] of the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's rulings follow Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's interpretation of <i>Shabbat</i> 20a.

When a fire is fueled with tar, sulfur, oily substances, wax, straw, or stubble, it is not required that the majority be kindled before the commencement of the Sabbath, because these substances catch fire quickly.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, there is no reason to suspect that one will stir the fire.</i>

Chapter 4

There are substances which, if food is covered with them to preserve its heat,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam (following the order of the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i>, Chapters 3 and 4) continues to explain the possibilities for serving hot food on the Sabbath. In the previous chapter, he spoke about leaving food in an oven or on a range. In this chapter, he describes the possibilities of insulating food with other substances to preserve its heat. Among the other reasons for mentioning these laws in this place is that the activities mentioned must be performed before the commencement of the Sabbath.</i> will raise its temperature and contribute to its being cooked as fire does<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam explains the rationale for this prohibition in the following halachah.</i> - e.g., <i>gefet</i>, manure, salt, lime, sand; nor may we use grape skins, unprocessed wool,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 4:1).

Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> m49a) states the converse, and this appears to be the opinion of other authorities.<br>Significantly, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam does not mention the word "even." Similarly, his grandson, Rav Yitzchak HaNagid, writes in a responsum that the inclusion of this word in some manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> was a scribal error.</i> when this is due to their natural moistness. These entities are referred to as substances that increase heat.<br>There are substances which, if food is covered with them to preserve its heat, will [accomplish that objective alone].

[The Torah's definition of the Sabbath] laws would allow one to cover food with substances that raise its temperature before nightfall, and thus the food would be covered and its heat preserved on the Sabbath, for it is permitted to leave food cooking on a fire on the Sabbath.<br>The Sages, however, enacted a decree forbidding covering food with substances that raise its temperature before nightfall,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 257:1) states that if one violates this prohibition and covers food with these substances, it is forbidden to partake of the food until Saturday night.

If one would then cover it again on the Sabbath, one would be covering food with a substance that increases its heat on the Sabbath, and this is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 4:1), the Rambam explains that covering the food with these substances does not violate the prohibition against cooking. The prohibition against cooking involves only cooking with fire and heat that results from fire (see Chapter 9, Halachah 2), but not cooking substances with other sources of heat.<br>The Rabbis, nevertheless, forbade such an act, because it resembles cooking. Furthermore, as a safeguard to insure that this prohibition is not violated, the Sages also forbade covering food before the commencement of the Sabbath with substances that increase its heat.<br>The Rambam's interpretation is based on Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's version of <i>Shabbat</i> 34a,b. The Ra'avad, Rashi, <i>Tosafot</i>, and many others follow a different version of that passage, which explains that the reason it was forbidden to cover food with these substances is a safeguard against a person covering food with a mixture of ash and coals. (See the following halachah.) This view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 257:1).</i><br>Accordingly, it is permitted to cover food with substances that increase its temperature <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The time between sunset and the appearance of three stars. The status of this time is a question of doubt: is it considered part of the day or the night? (See Chapter 5, Halachah 4.)<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> finds this law one of the more difficult aspects of the Rambam's explanation of this halachah, for there is no other instance where the laws that apply <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> are more lenient than those that apply before sunset.</i> since at that time most pots have already boiled, and they [have cooled, so that] they cease boiling. Since they have already ceased boiling, it is unlikely that they will boil again.
Similarly, [the Torah's definition of the Sabbath] laws would allow one to cover food with substances that do not raise its temperature on the Sabbath itself. The Sages, however, enacted a decree forbidding this, lest a person cover food with a mixture of ash and coals that has sparks of fire, and stir the coals.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in note 9, the Rambam's interpretation is based on Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's version of <i>Shabbat</i> 34a,b, while other authorities have a different version of that passage. According to those authorities, there is no comparison between these substances, which do not raise the temperature of food, and a mixture of ash and coals. Nevertheless, our Sages forbade covering food with such substances to preserve its temperature on the Sabbath, because they suspected that a person may find the food he desires to cover cold, and put it on the fire to warm.<br>(It must be noted that according to the Rambam's interpretation, a mixture of ash and coals is considered somewhat analogous to substances that do not raise the temperature of food. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> considers this one of the major difficulties with the Rambam's interpretation. Rav Kapach justifies the Rambam's position with a reference to <i>Beitzah</i> 8a, which appears to indicate that such a mixture is not hot.)</i> [As a safeguard against this,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 4:1), the Rambam notes that this explanation appears to contradict one of the principles of Rabbinic law. Our Sages taught (<i>Shabbat</i> 11b), אין גוזרין גזירה לגזירה, "We do not enact a decree to safeguard the observance of a decree that is itself a safeguard." The prohibition against covering the food with a mixture of ash and coals is itself a Rabbinic decree enacted lest one stir the coals. To uphold this decree, the Sages forbade covering food even with substances that will not increase its temperature.<br>In resolution of this difficulty, the Rambam implies that the principle mentioned above applies only when the two decrees are enacted in different times. When the two decrees are enacted simultaneously, there is no such difficulty (see <i>Beitzah</i> 3a).

The person who lights the Sabbath lamp should light it while it is still day, before sunset.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the Rambam does not mention the obligation to add from the weekday to the Sabbath. Note the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i>, ch. 1) which states that although the Rambam maintains that we are obligated to make such an addition on Yom Kippur, he does not require such an addition to be made on the Sabbath. The wording of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 261:2) indicates that it does not consider the obligation to much such an addition on the Sabbath as an absolute requirement. Nevertheless, the later Ashkenazic authorities consider it as such.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:3) also mentions that it is customary to light candles before sunset when the sun is seen in the treetops.</i><br>Women have a greater obligation in this regard than men,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i>, ch. 17, associates the woman's responsibility to light the Sabbath lamp with the fact that, through the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, Chavah, the first woman, extinguished the light of the world. <i>Shabbat</i> 32a associates the lighting of the Sabbath candles with the woman's responsibility to insure the shining of (Proverbs 20:27  "the lamp of G‑d, the soul of man."</i> for they are normally at home and are involved in the household tasks.

The time from sunset until the appearance of three middle-sized stars is universally referred to as <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">There are three basic positions regarding the duration of <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>. <i>Shabbat</i> 34b relates that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset. The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a. One defines <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.<br>There are two different opinions concerning the duration of the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 3:2), maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, is that it takes 18 minutes to walk this distance.<br>The Rambam as well as many other <i>Rishonim</i> base their determination of <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> on <i>Shabbat</i> 34b. Thus in practice, the appearance of the stars is determined as 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that this is the duration of <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset on Saturday night in order to be certain.<br>According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. Rabbenu Tam strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Responsum 24), mentions only the position of the Vilna Gaon and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and Rabbenu Tam on the other.</i> There is a doubt whether this time is considered as part of the day or as part of the night.

When such three medium-sized stars are seen, it is surely night.
The wick used for the Sabbath lights should not be made from a substance that causes the light to flicker - e.g., wool, goat's hair, silk, cedar fiber, uncarded flax, palm bast, various types of soft trees,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The definition of the last five substances is dependent on the Rambam's interpretation of the mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 2:1.

Hence, it is prohibited to use them alone. In contrast, when other fuels are mixed with these substances, they prevent them from hardening and therefore, such a mixture may be used for the Sabbath lights.</i> [Other] fuels that may not be used [as fuel for a Sabbath lamp] may not be used even when they are mixed with fuels that may be used, since they are not drawn [after the wick].<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam implies that even when these fuels are mixed with acceptable fuels they do not burn well.

What shall the Medians do, for they have nothing but nut oil? What shall the Alexandrians do, for they have nothing but radish oil?"<br>The Sages accepted Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri's view and accepted the possibility of using other oils. It is not merely after the fact that they are acceptable, but <i>ab initio</i>, they may be used.

Nullifying the potential to use a utensil is tantamount to breaking it and is, hence, forbidden on the Sabbath.<br>In this instance, it would no longer be permitted to use the container placed under the lamp for the following reason: As explained in Chapter 25, Halachah 17, when an article that is not forbidden to be moved is used as a container for an article that is forbidden, the container becomes forbidden. Accordingly, since the oil is <i>muktzeh </i>as explained in the previous halachah, it causes the container used to collect it to become forbidden as well.

Chapter 6

It is forbidden for us to tell<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Machshirin</i> 2:5-6), which states that it is forbidden even to hint to a gentile that one desires that he perform a forbidden labor on one's behalf. This ruling is accepted by the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 307:22). Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 307:7 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 307:76 allow one to make an indirect hint in certain situations.</i> a gentile to perform work on the Sabbath on our behalf, although they are not commanded [to observe] the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">On the contrary, a gentile who observes the Sabbath is liable for death (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 58b, <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 10:9).</i> [This applies] even when the instructions were conveyed to them before the Sabbath and we do not require [the products of] their work until after the Sabbath.<br>The above is forbidden as a Rabbinical prohibition to prevent the people from regarding the Sabbath lightly, lest they perform [forbidden] labor themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 307:1-2) mention another reason for the prohibition against conveying such instructions on the Sabbath itself, so that one should not talk about mundane matters on the Sabbath.<br>[On the basis of this rationale, we can understand the lenient opinions mentioned in note 1. Since the prohibition against instructing a gentile to perform work stems from the prohibition against speaking of mundane matters, there is room for leniency if the instruction is conveyed without speech.]<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 243:1 also mentions an opinion that maintains that a gentile performing a labor on behalf of a Jew on the Sabbath is considered as the Jews's agent. Hence, the Jew is held responsible for the work.</i>
[The following rules<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Examples of the principles mentioned in this halachah are given in Halachot 3-8.</i> apply] when a gentile performs a [forbidden] labor on the Sabbath on his own accord:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even without receiving specific instructions from a Jew.</i> If he performed it on behalf of a Jew, it is forbidden to benefit from that labor<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The entire Jewish people, not only the person for whom the forbidden labor was performed, are prohibited from benefiting from it (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Shulchan Aruch</i> 325:10).</i> until one waits the amount of time necessary to perform the labor on Saturday night.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 8.</i><br>[The latter leniency is granted] provided the matter is not public notice - i.e., everyone knows that a particular task is being performed for a person on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's mention of this principle is significant. In the interpretation of <i>Shabbat</i> 24:3 - the Mishnah that serves as the basis for Halachah 8 - there are authorities (e.g., Rabbenu Nissim) who explain that the prohibition against benefiting from forbidden labors performed by a gentile in public on the Sabbath applies only in the specific context mentioned in that Mishnah: a grave, coffin, or flutes for mourning a deceased person.<br>A prohibition was instituted in these instances alone, for it is improper that a person's final resting be associated with the performance of labor on the Sabbath. In contrast, when a Sabbath prohibition is performed on behalf of a living person, one may benefit from it after the Sabbath.<br>From the Rambam's statements in this halachah, it is obvious that he does not allow such leniency. Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 325:21 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 325:73, which explain that if the situation requires it, Rabbenu Nissim's opinion can be relied on.</i><br>If [the gentile] performed [the labor] for his own sake alone,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">With this addition, the Rambam implies that if the gentile performs the forbidden labor for his own sake and with the intention that it also benefit a Jew, it is forbidden. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 276:2.)</i> it is permitted to benefit from it on the Sabbath.
What is implied? If a gentile kindled a candle [for his own benefit], a Jew is also permitted to perform activity by its light.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:1) states that one may also benefit from a lamp kindled by a gentile on behalf of a person who is ill.</i> If [the gentile] kindled the light on behalf of the Jew, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that if a gentile lights a lamp or a fire in a Jew's house on his own accord, the Jew is not required to leave his home. Although he should try not to benefit from the light, the fact that he receives benefit against his will is not of significance.</i><br>Similarly, if a gentile made a ramp to descend from a ship [himself], a Jew may descend after him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 122a gives a classic example of this halachah. Rabban Gamliel and several other Sages descended from a ship on a ramp made by a gentile on the Sabbath.</i> If he made it for the Jew, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast between this pair of examples and the following pair, as explained in the following halachah.</i> If he filled a trench with water to allow his animal to drink, a Jew may have his own animal drink afterwards. If he did so for the sake of the Jew, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i> 325:10) states that this prohibition applies only when one is drawing from a well in a private domain into the public domain, for this involves the transgression of a Torah prohibition. More leniency is allowed when water is drawn from a well in a private domain to a <i>carmelit</i>, for then merely a Rabbinic prohibition is involved. In such an instance, anyone other than the person for whom the water was drawn may benefit from it.<br>The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions a more lenient perspective, which states that whenever it is possible for a Jew to accomplish an objective without performing a forbidden labor, he may benefit from a forbidden labor that a gentile performed for the Jew's sake, which made the objective easier to accomplish. For example, since a Jew could have descended to a well to drink water, he is allowed to drink water that a gentile brought from the well for him.</i><br>If a [gentile] gathered grass to feed his animal, a Jew may bring his animal to eat from it<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i> 325:11) explain that one may not give this grass to the animal or even lead him directly toward it, because the grass is <i>muktzeh</i>.</i> provided that the gentile does not know this Jew.

In contrast, when a matter concerns a situation where there is no concept of increasing or decreasing [one's efforts for the sake of the Jew] - e.g., a light or a ramp<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Once a lamp is lit or a ramp is laid down, many people can benefit from it.

Hence, it is permitted for other Jews to benefit from it afterwards.</i> If the majority are gentiles, it is permitted to benefit from the light. If the proportions are equal, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries use this situation to exemplify the following principle: It is prohibited to benefit from the performance of a forbidden labor when it was performed for the sake of both a gentile and a Jew. (Note the Rambam's use of the expression "for his own sake alone" in Halachah 2).<br>Other commentaries (see Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 122a) offer different explanations for this ruling.</i>.<br>If a fire broke out on the Sabbath and a gentile comes to extinguish it, we may not tell him, "Extinguish it,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Although the situation may arouse fear, we are still forbidden to instruct a gentile specifically to perform a forbidden labor.</i>" nor [must we tell him,] "Do not extinguish it,"<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Furthermore, as stated in Chapter 12, Halachah 7, one may say, "The person who extinguishes the fire will not suffer a loss," encouraging the gentile to do so.<br>From this law, <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 122a) explains that a Jew is not obligated to prevent a gentile from carrying out a forbidden activity that benefits the Jew's property, if the gentile does so on his own initiative. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 325:13) accepts this principle, provided that the gentile does not do this on a continuous basis.</i> for his resting is not our responsibility.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">With this expression, the Rambam (quoting <i>Shabbat</i> 16:6) contrasts a gentile with one's children - even minors - and one's servants - even gentiles - for whom one is responsible that they rest on the Sabbath, as mentioned in Exodus 20:10.</i> The same applies in all similar situations.
[The following principles apply when] gentiles make a coffin, dig a grave, or bring flutes to play mourning dirges on behalf of a deceased person:<br>If this was done discreetly, one must wait until that activity could have been carried out on Saturday night, and then the person may be buried using the above. If, however, the grave was located in a public square, the coffin was placed upon it, and all those who pass by say, "This activity that the gentiles are performing on the Sabbath is for the sake of so and so," that Jew may never be buried using the above, for this is a matter of public knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Even though a Jew did not instruct a gentile to perform any of these activities, since they were performed on behalf of a Jew in public, they may never be used on his behalf.</i><br>Another Jew, however, may be buried using the above, provided that the people wait the amount of time necessary for these activities to have been performed [after the Sabbath has concluded].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to requiring one to wait when the product of the gentile's efforts is to be used for the sake of an individual other than the one for which they were originally intended. He explains that in Halachah 8, the Rambam states that this requirement was instituted, lest the person who benefits from the gentile's efforts instruct him to perform a forbidden labor. Needless to say, this does not apply in the situation under discussion, a burial.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 325:14) follows the Rambam's ruling. Although the rationale suggested by the Ra'avad is justifiable in this instance, the Rabbis did not accept it, in order to maintain a uniform policy regarding forbidden labor performed by a gentile on the Sabbath.</i> The same applies in all similar situations.
[The following rules apply when] a gentile brings flutes on the Sabbath to mourn a deceased person: Even though he brought them from just outside the wall,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 23:4), the Rambam explains that if the flutes were brought from outside the city, they were brought from a public domain to a private domain. Hence, a transgression was involved, and it is necessary to wait for the time to pass that it would take to bring them after the conclusion of the Sabbath. We must, however, wait longer than the minimal amount of time it takes to bring them from outside the wall inside the wall, because of the suspicion mentioned by the Rambam. See also <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov 2:10.</i><br>Significantly, Rashi (Shabbat 151a) and others interpret this Mishnah as relating to the prohibition against bringing objects from beyond the Sabbath boundary.

Seemingly, he would accept the same rationale with regard to the Sabbath.</i> for which [the Sages] forbade using [the products of forbidden labor] until the time to perform the labor passes on Saturday night: If one permitted the use of [the products of forbidden labor] immediately [on Saturday night], a person might tell a gentile to perform a [forbidden] labor on his behalf, so that [after the conclusion of the Sabbath], it will be immediately available for him. Since, however, [the products of forbidden labor] are forbidden until the time it takes for the labor to have been performed passes, he will not instruct a gentile to perform this task. It does not bring him any benefit at all, for on Saturday evening he must wait the time it takes for the labor to have been performed on the Sabbath.
A Jew is permitted to instruct a gentile to perform an activity that is not a [forbidden] labor<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam derives this principle from <i>Eruvin</i> 67b, which mentions that one is permitted to instruct a gentile to bring hot water to wash a child after circumcision, provided he does not have to pass through the public domain.

Although <i>Tosafot, Gittin</i> 8b, differs, the Rambam's opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Orach</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 307:5) as well as the later Ashkenazic authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 307:12, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 307:23).<br>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 276:2) states that there are authorities who allow one to instruct a gentile to perform a forbidden labor on the Sabbath so that a mitzvah can be performed.

Since the activity in question is merely a Rabbinic prohibition, and the prohibition against instructing a gentile to perform a forbidden activity on the Sabbath is Rabbinic in origin, the two Rabbinic prohibitions should not be associated.</i>[This leniency applies] provided that this is necessary because of a minor infirmity,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the situations mentioned in Chapter 2, here the Rambam is not speaking of a situation where the person is dangerously ill or even when there is a danger threatening one of the limbs of his body.

When a person contracts a gentile for a task and sets the price, the gentile [is considered] as acting in his own interests.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since the gentile contractor has established a set price for his work, it does not matter when he performs the labor involved.

If he does so on premises belonging to a Jew, it is forbidden for him to work on the Sabbath even when the price is set beforehand.

Therefore, this is forbidden.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i> 244:5) accepts the Rambam's view. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 244:5 emphasizes, however, that this ruling may be accepted only when the employer does not mind if the gentile does not work at any specific time. If he requires him to work a set number of hours, this is not acceptable.<br>(To explain the concept in contemporary terms: An employee who receives a weekly salary for a specific time commitment is not covered by this leniency. In contrast, an outside professional who is hired on a retainer basis is, for he is not bound by a time commitment to the employer.)<br>The <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. II, Responsum 38) explains the difference between the Rambam's and the Ra'avad's view as follows: In the case of a contractor, the gentile is the one who benefits from his working on the Sabbath. Although he is not obligated to work then, by doing so he earns a fee that he would not have received otherwise.<br>In contrast, when an employee is paid on a retainer basis, he receives no benefit from working on the Sabbath, for he receives the same wage regardless.

Therefore, [the following rules apply when] a person hires a gentile to build a courtyard or a wall or to harvest his field, or [hires him to work] at building his courtyard or planting a vineyard for him for a year or two:<br>If the project is located in a city<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., either the city in which the Jew contracting the gentile lives or another city populated by Jews.</i> or within its Sabbath limits, it is forbidden for the Jew to allow them to work on the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 244:3), which states that if a gentile builds a house for a Jew on the Sabbath, it is proper not to enter it.</i> because of [the impression this might create in the mind of] an observer who is unaware that they were hired on a contractual basis. If the project is located beyond the Sabbath limits, it is permitted, for there are no Jews who will see the laborers at work on the Sabbath.
Similarly, it is permitted for a Jew to hire out his vineyard or his field to a gentile, although the latter will sow and plant them on the Sabbath, since an observer will know that they have been hired out or given [to the gentile] under a sharecropping agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Since these arrangements are commonplace, an observer will not think that the gentile was employed as a hired worker.</i><br>[In contrast,] when an enterprise<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 243:1) gives as examples a bathhouse or an oven.

If during the week both work together, the fact that the gentile works on the Sabbath does not cause the profits of that day to be forbidden for the Jew. The gentile knows that the Jew will not work on the Sabbath, nor will he work any more during the week. Therefore, the activity the gentile is performing is motivated by his own benefit. The fact that he gives a share to the Jew as well is of no consequence. The Ramah accepts this ruling (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 245:1).</i><br>If, however, such conditions were not made at the outset, when [the two] come to divide the profits, the gentile should take all the profits of the Sabbath for himself alone, and then the remainder should be divided [equally].<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 22a does not make a final ruling in this situation, and the Rambam follows the more stringent position.

The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that after the fact, one may rely on this ruling. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 245:2 rules more stringently and states that one may rely on Rabbenu Asher's opinion only in the case of a major loss.</i> The [gentile] need not give [the Jew] anything extra for the Sabbath unless a stipulation to that effect was made at the outset.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 245:3) describes the procedure to follow when a Jew and gentile partner did not make such an agreement at the beginning of the partnership, and the Jew desires to do so afterwards.</i> The same principles apply if [a Jew and a gentile] hired a field under a partnership arrangement.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 245:1 differentiates between a field that requires work seven days a week and certain business establishments that do not require active effort on the part of their owner.

Nevertheless, these restrictions are punitive in nature, instituted so that one would not perform either of these forbidden activities.

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 318:7 mentions opinions that allow one to rely on <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion in a situation of necessity. This leniency is not, however, accepted by all authorities.<br>In regard to deriving benefit from the performance of an activity on the Sabbath which was forbidden by the Sages, see also Chapter 23, Halachah 8.</i> The same principles apply in other similar situations.
When produce was taken outside a city's Sabbath limits and then brought back without the knowledge of the prohibition involved, one may partake of it on the Sabbath, since nothing was done to the fruits themselves, and their state did not change.

Significantly, the Rambam also quotes Rav Pappa's opinion in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 5:10. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, however, supports the Rambam's ruling, explaining that the laws of the Sabbath are more stringent than those of the festivals in this context. (See also the distinction between the Sabbath and holidays made by the <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>.)<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also mentions an opinion of the Rashba which is more stringent than both the Rambam and the Ra'avad.</i>

Each of these days may not be considered as an individual entity as above.<br>Alternatively, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 306:18 explains that "Pay me for the ten days" can be interpreted as referring to a situation in which a worker accepted a monthly contract and left the job after working ten days. Since he worked on a monthly basis, he is entitled to payment for all ten days he worked, including the Sabbath. This, however, is a delicate manner, and the exact wording of the contract between an employer and employee should be checked with a Rabbinic authority to prevent any problems from arising in this regard.<br>It must be emphasized that the same principles also apply with regard to the rental of homes, or money lent at interest to a gentile. One may not receive payment for the Sabbath individually. Instead, one must receive payment on a weekly, monthly, or annual basis. Thus, problems may arise if interest is compounded daily and the Sabbath is included as one of the days. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 306:9.)</i>

The Rambam clarifies the definition of what constitutes a primary category and what constitutes a derivative in Halachot 2-6.<br>See <i>Yereim</i> (249) who notes that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) derives the existence of thirty nine categories of work from the exegesis of Exodus 38:2. There is a question if this difference in sources creates a difference in law as well. See also the preface to <i>Eglei Tal,</i> which questions whether the definition of the categories of forbidden labor are taken from the activities necessary for the offering of the sacrifices in the Sanctuary, or merely the activities necessary for construction of the Sanctuary. (In this context, see Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 73a, which states that the forbidden labor of baking was not practiced in the Sanctuary although one of the offerings was the showbread which was baked each week.)</i><br>The sum of all the primary categories of [forbidden] labor are forty minus one.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question why the Rambam (and his source, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2, use this expression, rather than merely stating "thirty-nine." Some draw attention to the parallel found in the Mishnah's description of the number of lashes given a transgressor (<i>Makkot</i> 3:10). Others explain that this expression indicates that there is a fortieth activity - the spiritual service of prayer and study - which must be performed on the Sabbath day.</i> They include:<br>1) plowing,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This and the ten labors that follow are described as <i>sidura d'pat</i>, the manner in which bread is baked.

Others follow who collect these sheaves into larger bundles. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 5.)<br>According to one opinion in <i>Shabbat</i> 96b, there is an explicit reference to the prohibition of this labor on the Sabbath. Numbers, ch. 15, relates that a person was executed for collecting wood on the Sabbath. As the Rambam states Chapter 21, Halachah 11, this labor includes only the collection of produce. Gathering other substances - e.g., salt - is not included.

In the weaving process, it refers to the following practice: Weaving involves passing the threads of the woof over and under each of the consecutive threads of the warp. In order to facilitate this process, two frames are made, each possessing many threads with a loop (referred to as a "heddle") in the middle of these threads. The threads of the warp are passed through these loops, one from one frame, and the next from the other, consecutively. When this is completed, the weaver lifts the two frames alternately. As he raises one up, he passes the woof through. In this manner, he is able to thread the woof through the entire warp at one time.

All of these [forbidden] labors and all analogous activities are referred to as primary categories of labor. What is meant by an "analogous activity"? Plowing, digging, or making a groove [in the ground] are all considered to be primary categories of work. For each one involves digging in the ground and they all reflect a single activity.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In this and the following two halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how other activities that are analogous to the thirty-nine mentioned in the previous halachah are not considered as solely derivatives of the primary category of labor; they have the same status as the primary categories themselves. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) and in Halachah 9 of this chapter, he uses the term - "labors corresponding to a single category of labor" to describe such activities. This phrase is also used by the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:1 (although interpreted differently by other authorities).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes Rav Moshe Kohen as objecting to the Rambam's statements, for the Mishnah specifically states that there are thirty-nine such categories of forbidden labor, while according to the Rambam there would be far more. He thus considers all these other activities as derivatives.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> does not see such a difficulty, explaining that, as the Rambam illustrates in the examples he cites in this and the following halachot, the activity being performed is basically the same as the primary category of labor. Thus it is not proper for such an activity to be called a derivative. Similarly, since these activities are identical in nature to the existing categories, it is not proper to consider them as being an additional category with regard to the total sum.<br><i>Kalkalat Shabbat</i> adds that the activities that the Rambam mentions as analogous to the primary categories of labor are not counted as additional categories because they were not necessary for the construction of the Sanctuary.</i>
Similarly, one who sows seeds, plants trees, extends trees,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">One of the methods of agriculture common in the Talmudic period was to plant vines - and in certain instances, trees - by taking a branch from an existing vine or tree and, without severing it from its source, burying it in the ground.

He also explains this concept in his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sh'vi'it</i> 4:5, "One cuts off [branches] at a specific place to improve the tree."<br>The <i>Eglei Tal</i> and others note that the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Shemitah</i> 1:3, based on <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 3a) considers pruning merely a derivative of planting with regard to the concept of forbidden labor in the Sabbatical year, while in the present context it is considered in the same status as planting itself.<br>The <i>Eglei Tal</i> resolves this difficulty on the basis of the principle that with regard to the Sabbath, it is, "thoughtful work," that the Torah forbade. This principle does not apply with regard to the prohibitions against working the land in the Sabbatical year.<br>Accordingly, since the activities of planting and pruning are very different, pruning is considered only a derivative with regard to the Sabbatical year. With regard to the Sabbath labors, however, intent is of fundamental importance. Since the intent of both activities is the same - to enable the plant to grow - they are both given equal status.</i> All of these [activities] are considered a single primary category of [forbidden] labor, [for] they share a commonality, since all these activities have a single intent:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">With this statement, the Rambam explains the difference between the sets of activities mentioned in the previous halachah, and those mentioned in this halachah. Plowing, digging, and making a groove are very similar activities, but they differ in their objectives. The activities mentioned in this halachah, by contrast, do not resemble each other; nevertheless, they share the same intent.</i> to cause [a plant] to grow.
Similarly, a person who reaps grain or legumes, one who harvests grapes, dates, olives, or figs: All these [activities] are considered a single primary category of [forbidden] labor, [for] they share a commonality, since all these activities have a single intent:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The activities mentioned in this halachah differ from those mentioned in the previous halachah in that each of the activities in this halachah involves a different type of produce. Hence, it is necessary to emphasize that they are all considered in the same status.</i> to remove produce from [the plant] on which it grows. [The same principle applies] with regard to other forbidden categories of labor.
A derivative is a labor that resembles one of these categories of [forbidden] labor.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2), the Rambam explains that a derivative is an activity that produces a result similar to that produced by one of the forbidden labors, but differs both in the intent and the nature of the activity.</i> What is implied? A person who cuts a vegetable into small pieces to cook is liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 21, Halachah 18. As mentioned in the notes on that halachah, for the activity to be forbidden as a derivative of grinding, one must have the intent to cook it.</i> for this activity resembles grinding. When a person grinds, he takes one [large] entity, and divides it into smaller parts. Anyone who performs an activity that resembles this is [performing] a derivative of the labor of grinding. Similarly, a person who takes a strip of metal and pulverizes it to use the powder<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 15.</i> acts as goldsmiths do;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase emphasizes that to be liable, one's intent in pulverizing the metal must be for a useful purpose. If one's intent is merely destructive in nature, one is not liable.</i> he is [performing] a derivative of the labor of grinding.
Similarly, one who takes milk and inserts a [piece of intestine] in it so that it curdles is liable for [performing] a derivative of separating,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2), which states that with regard to both this activity and making cheese, one is liable for performing a derivative of kneading.</i> for he separates the curds from the whey.<br>If one made cheese from it, one is liable for [performing a derivative of building]. Whenever one collects separate entities and bonds them together so that they form a single mass, [the activity] resembles building.<br>Similarly, each of the primary categories of [forbidden] labor [mentioned above] possesses derivatives,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that one of the determinants of a primary category of forbidden labor is that it has derivatives. Perhaps it is to emphasize this point that the Rambam mentions derivatives for each of the thirty-nine categories of labor in the succeeding chapters. Even when the derivatives are not explicitly mentioned in the Talmud, he uses logic to define activities that fall in these categories. (See <i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i>.)</i> which are determined according to the principles explained above. From the nature of the [forbidden] labor performed on the Sabbath, one can determine in which category of [forbidden] labor it should be included, or which [forbidden] labor it is a derivative of.
A person who willingly, as a conscious act of defiance, performs an activity that constitutes one of the primary categories of [forbidden] labor or one of the derivatives [of these categories] is liable for <i>karet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is restating the principles stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 1, in terms of the concepts of primary categories of forbidden labor and their derivatives.</i> If witnesses come, he should be stoned [to death].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 1, a person is executed for the performance of a forbidden labor only if witnesses warn him of the nature of the prohibition beforehand.</i> If [he performs such an activity] without being conscious of the transgression, he must bring a sin offering of a fixed nature.<br>If so, what is the difference between the primary categories of [forbidden] labor and the derivatives?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's question is: Since one incurs the same liabilities regardless of whether one performs an activity that itself constitutes a forbidden category of labor or merely a derivative, of what importance is the definition of such categories?</i> There is no difference except with regard to sacrifices. When a person, without being conscious of the transgression involved, performs many activities, each of which constitutes a different primary category [of forbidden labor] in one period of lack of awareness,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A person is obligated to bring a sin offering if he was unaware that the forbidden labor he performed involved a transgression, despite the fact that he performed it several times. Even if the period in which he is not conscious of the transgression lasts several weeks, he is obligated for only a single offering for each category of forbidden labor. (See <i>Shabbat</i> 7:1 and <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i>, Chapter 7.)</i> he is obligated to bring a sin offering for every such category<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since each category of forbidden labor involves a different subject of which he was unaware, he is required to bring a different sin offering for it.</i> [of forbidden labor].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the above- mentioned sources, a person is liable for the above only when he knows the day on which the Sabbath should be observed and is aware of the prohibition against work, but does not know of the prohibition involved in the performance of a (or several) forbidden labor(s). If, however, a person forgets the day on which the Sabbath should be observed, he is required to bring merely a single sin offering for each Sabbath he violated, regardless of how many forbidden labors he performed that day. Furthermore, a person who was totally unaware of the prohibition against working on the Sabbath is required to bring only one sin offering. This single sacrifice atones for all the Sabbaths that he did not observe.</i><br>If he performs an activity that constitutes a primary category [of forbidden labor] and its derivatives in one period of lack of awareness, he is obligated to bring merely one sin offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For it is the lack of knowledge of a single category of labor that is involved. All of the violations stem from the lack of awareness of a single matter. The same ruling applies if one performs several derivatives of the same category of labor (<i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 7:5). If, however, one performed derivatives of two different categories of labor, one is required to bring two sin offerings (<i>loc. cit.:6</i>).</i>
What is implied? If a person plows, sows, and reaps on the Sabbath in a single period of lack of awareness, he is required to bring three sin offerings. Even if he performs all thirty-nine [forbidden] labors without knowing of the prohibition involved - e.g., he forgot that it is forbidden to perform these labors on the Sabbath - he is obligated to bring one sin offering for each and every [forbidden] labor.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In his gloss to <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 7:3, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes a responsum from the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham, which focuses on the following question: If the person is unaware of the entire concept of forbidden labor, how can we say that he is aware of the concept of Sabbath in general?

If, however, one causes external bleeding, one is liable.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 316:8) accepts the opinion of the other authorities. This decision depends on the difference of opinion mentioned in note 31 as to the category of forbidden labor of which causing bleeding is a derivative. As mentioned, the Rambam considers this activity a derivative of the labor of threshing, and threshing involves removing a substance from a hard shell. Since the hides of the other crawling animals are not tough, causing them to bleed cannot be considered a derivative of this labor. According to the opinion that bleeding is a derivative of slaughtering, however, one is liable for making any animal bleed, regardless of the nature of its hide (<i>Ziv HaMishneh</i>).<br>The question whether one may kill creeping animals that are dangerous is discussed in Chapter 10, Halachah 25 and notes.</i><br>One who wounds an animal, beast, fowl, or one of the above-mentioned eight creeping animals is liable whether he caused an open wound from which they bled or he made a bruise that caused internal bleeding.

According to the Rashba, one may filter even cloudy wine with a handkerchief or other strainer of this nature, since this is not the normal manner in which this activity is performed.<br>According to the Rambam, although one would not be liable for straining the wine in this manner, it would still be forbidden by Rabbinic decree. The only filtering that is permitted is filtering wine that is already fit to be drunk, so that it will become crystal clear. One might ask: Of what value is such an act? The answer is that precisely because most people would not consider this activity of value, and only the most spoiled individuals would require it, is it permitted. (According to the Rashba, such beverages may even be filtered with an ordinary filter.) Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 319:10) mentions the Rambam's view, the Rashba's ruling is favored.</i><br>We may pour water over wine dregs<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The dregs were placed in a strainer on Friday, and one desires to pour the water over them on the Sabbath day (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro, <i>Shabbat</i> 20:2).</i> so they will become clear.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">To remove any residue of wine that might be left in the dregs (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> [Similarly,] we may place a raw egg in a mustard strainer so that it becomes clear.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The intent is to mix the egg with mustard lying at the bottom of the strainer that has already been strained before the Sabbath (<i>Shabbat</i> 134a). In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 20:2), the Rambam states that when raw eggs are mixed with coarse foods, they cause the lighter matter to rise above the heavier, coarse matter. Thus, by mixing the egg with the mustard, one will cause it to undergo a further process of refinement. Nevertheless, this is not included in the forbidden labor of separating.<br>It must be noted that the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 319) explains that the problem in question in this instance is that the egg yolk will pass through the strainer, while the albumen will not. Nevertheless, this is not considered a derivative of the forbidden labor of separating. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 319:15) follows this interpretation.</i><br>When one has mixed mustard on Friday, one may stir it by hand or with a utensil to make it fit to drink [on the Sabbath].<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Since the mustard is already strained and is fit to be used, there is no difficulty in stirring it further. (See also Chapter 22, Halachah 12.)</i> Similarly, while wine is in the process of fermentation, one may pour out a barrel of wine together with the dregs over handkerchiefs, for the dregs have not been finely separated from the wine and they are still considered a single mixture.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 139b, explains that this straining process will not be very effective. Hence, it is permitted. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 319:14 focuses on the Rambam's words and explains that since the wine and the dregs are considered a single mixture, the forbidden labor of separation does not apply. The concept of separation applies when the desired entity and the dregs are distinct, and this is not true until the wine has completed the fermentation process.</i> The same applies to mustard and all similar substances.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although it is forbidden to strain mustard using a strainer on the Sabbath, one may strain it through a handkerchief (<i>Or Sameach</i>).</i>

When the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 321:12) quotes this law, it omits the above term, leading to the conclusion that one is liable even for cutting vegetables that one desires to eat raw. For this reason, in his gloss the Ramah clarifies that one is liable only when one cuts the vegetables and then stores them for later use, if one partakes of them immediately, one is not liable.</i><br>Similarly, a person who saws wood in order to benefit from the sawdust, and similarly, one who files a piece of metal is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 5.</i>for filing even the slightest amount.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Because any amount of the dust he desires will be useful for him.

As mentioned in the notes to Chapter 21, Halachot 33-34, this opinion is not accepted by all authorities.<br>There is another difference of opinion among the Sages and later Rabbis pertinent to this matter. Rabbi Yosse bar Yehudah (<i>Shabbat</i> 155b) mentions that kneading involves actually mixing the dough with one's hands. Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi differs and maintains that one is liable for kneading as soon as one pours water into flour.

Depending on the nature of the dye used, however, there is a difference in the amount of cooking necessary to dye the cloth.<br>Rav Kapach accepts the principle stated by the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, but notes that the minimum measure for dyeing is specifically stated by the Rambam in Halachah 14 of this chapter as "enough to dye a thread four handbreadths long."</i>

A wart is considered a blemish that makes an animal unfit for sacrifice and a priest unfit for service (see <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 7:10), and by removing the wart one becomes fit for service.

The Talmud mentions cooking only, because that is the subject of the discussion. Rav Kapach offers a unique explanation, stating that the Rambam is not speaking about instances when water is dyed through cooking, but when two liquids of different colors are mixed to cause a new tint.<br>There are authorities [<i>Ginat Veradim</i> (Section 3, Chapter 9) and <i>HaElef Lecha Shlomo</i>] who accept the Rambam's ruling and on this basis state that one should not make tea or coffee on the Sabbath, for one is coloring the water.

A person who makes two heddles is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew בתי נירין is generally translated as "houses of string." In the weaving process, it refers to the following practice: Weaving involves passing the threads of the woof over and under each of the consecutive threads of the warp. In order to facilitate this process, two frames are made, each possessing many threads with a loop (referred to as a "heddle") in the middle of these threads. The threads of the warp are passed through these loops, one from one frame, and next from the other consecutively. (See also Rav Kapach's commentary, which explains that <i>nir</i> in Arabic means woof. Thus בתי נירין would mean "houses for the woof" - i.e., holes through which the woof thread is passed.)<br>When this is completed, the weaver lifts the two frames alternately. As he raises one up, he passes the woof through. In this manner, he is able to thread the woof through the entire warp at one time. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2 and <i>Keilim</i> 21:1.)</i><br>A person who makes a sifter, a strainer, a basket, a hairnet, or one who weaves a rope bed [performs] a derivative [of the forbidden labor] of making heddles;<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">All these objects are made by weaving materials other than thread. It is questionable why the Rambam considers them as derivatives of this category of forbidden labor and not the labor of weaving.</i> when he makes two frames of any one of the above, he is liable. Similarly, a person who makes two frames of any object that is made frame by frame like the above is liable.
Weavers generally stretch out the threads [of the warp] to the desired length and width of the fabric. Two people hold [the beams to which the ends of the threads are connected], one from one side and one from the other side. A person beats the threads with a rod and aligns them so that they lie one next to the other, [all of the] warp threads without the woof.<br>Extending the threads as the weavers do is called mounting the warp. A person who [extends these threads] so they are taut is called one who sets the warp. Bending [the loom] and inserting the woof between the warp [threads] is called weaving.
The person who mounts the warp is liable. This is one of the [39] primary categories of [forbidden] labor. The person who beats the threads until they separate and then aligns them performs a derivative of mounting the warp.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah presents a unique question with regard to the authenticity of the different versions of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2). The popular version of the text cites <i>Shabbat</i> 75b, which relates that the number of categories of forbidden labor, "forty minus one," is repeated at the conclusion of the Mishnah to negate the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who maintains that beating the threads of the warp and straightening them (see Halachah 19) should be considered as categories of forbidden labor. Instead, they are derivatives of the labors of mounting the warp and weaving.<br>In his version of the Commentary on the Mishnah, which is based on authoritative manuscripts, Rav Kapach states that these two activities are derivatives of מכה בפטיש , "completing a task." (See Chapter 10, Halachah 16.) According to this version of the text, originally the Rambam relied on another source and later, when authoring the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, he changed his opinion based on the Talmud.</i> What is the minimum measure for which one is liable? Preparing a fabric that is two fingerbreadths wide.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 13:4 states that a person is liable for weaving the fullness of a <i>sit</i>. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam differentiates between "the width of a <i>sit</i>" as defined in Halachah 7, and "the fullness of a <i>sit</i>." The latter term refers to the distance between the thumb and the index finger when open, but not stretched. This is two fingerbreadths. [Note Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 105b) who offers a different interpretation.]</i><br>Similarly, a person is liable for weaving two threads [of a fabric] two fingerbreadths wide. [The above applies] whether one began the weaving [of a garment] or whether one wove two additional threads on a garment that had already been begun by another weaver. If one wove only a single thread, but completed the garment by doing so, one is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Since one completes the garment with this thread, one's actions are significant despite being slight.</i><br>If one weaves two threads a width of three frames at the end of a fabric, one is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, although the weaving does not have the width normally required, since it is significant (for it makes a hem), one is held liable.</i> To what can this be compared?

Braiding hair that is still attached to a person's head is forbidden by the Rabbis. (See Chapter 22, Halachah 26.)</i> The measure for which one is liable is making a braid two fingerbreadths long.
One who is בוצע two threads is liable. בוצע refers to the separation of woven fabric.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's definition of this activity. He offers a definition similar to that of Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 73a, stating that בוצע resembles פוצע and refers to cutting off the remaining unwoven threads after the weaving process is completed.</i> One is liable for [the labor of] בוצע whether one removes the woof from the warp or the warp from woof.<br>[The above applies provided that] one is not acting with a destructive [intent], but rather with the intent to improve [the garment]. For example, there are people who mend [tears in] very light garments. First, they undo the weave. Afterwards, they mend the garment, and then reweave the threads that they undid.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">When a garment is mended in this fashion, the mending is hard to detect, because it is rewoven.</i> [In this manner,] they join two garments or two tears together.<br>A person who undoes a braid for the sake of fixing it [performs] a derivative [of the labor] of בוצע.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned previously, every category of labor has a derivative.

A person who ties a knot which is intended to remain permanently and which can be tied [only] by craftsmen<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A knot that requires professional expertise and cannot be tied by an untrained person.</i> is liable.

They maintain that tying a knot with the intention that it remain permanently causes one to be liable if the knot is strong enough to remain, even though tying the knot does not require professional expertise.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 317:1) follows the Rambam's perspective. The Ramah, however, rules according to the view of Rashi and Rabbenu Asher.</i><br>One who ties a knot that is intended to remain permanently, but does not require a craftsmen [to tie it], is not liable. A knot that will not remain permanently and does not require a craftsman may be tied with no compunctions.
How is [the intermediate category] defined? If one of a person's sandal straps tore and he tied it, a rope tore and one tied it, one tied a rope to a bucket, or one tied the bridle of an animal, the person is not liable.

A woman may tie the opening of her cloak although it has two openings.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This law - and most of the subsequent clauses of this halachah - are based on <i>Shabbat</i> 15:2.

Since a woman could remove the garment by untying only one strap and slipping it over her head, there is reason to think that one of the knots would be considered as permanent, and therefore forbidden to be tied on the Sabbath.

Hence, it is probable that one will untie it after using it (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, based on <i>Shabbat</i> 113a).<br>Even though the Rambam would maintain that tying an ordinary rope to a bucket does not make one liable according to Torah law, there is still reason for this additional decree.</i> One may tie a rope before an animal or tie it to an animal's foot so that it will not go out, although this involves two knots.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The animal's owner closed the stall by tying a rope before it, tying it to both ends of the entrance (or, according to other commentaries, by tying two ropes).

And as the Rambam states, since the intention is not to leave the animal tied permanently, there is no reason for even a Rabbinic prohibition. Nevertheless, since it is forbidden to use a rope on the Sabbath unless it was designated for use beforehand, one may not bring a rope from home. If one tied the rope to the animal or to the feeding trough before the commencement of the Sabbath, however, it is obvious that one intended to use it on the Sabbath.</i> one may bring it and tie it to both the cow and the feeding trough.<br>[The rationale for these laws is that] all [the above] knots do not require professional expertise, nor are they intended to remain.

Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 74b) rules more stringently, holding one liable even when one does not have the intent of retying the knot immediately.

(Rashi cannot hold one liable for tearing, since he differs with the Rambam and maintains that a person who performs a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה is not liable.)<br>The latter interpretation is reflected in the statements of Rabbenu Avraham, the Rambam's son, quoted in the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>, which explain that after a garment was completed, the neck was sewed up with temporary stitches to show that it was never worn. When the purchaser desired to put on the garment, these stitches were undone. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 317:3).</i>

It appears that he relies on his statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 13, "Whenever one performs a labor that does not have a permanent effect on the Sabbath, one is not liable." (See the notes on that halachah.)</i><br>Similarly, a person who fashions an earthenware utensil - e.g., an oven or a jug - before they are fired [in a kiln] is liable for performing a derivative [of the forbidden labor] of building.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beitzah</i> 22a relates a difference of opinion between the School of Hillel and the School of Shammai. The School of Shammai maintains that one is liable for performing a derivative of the forbidden labor of building when fashioning a utensil, while the School of Hillel rejects this thesis: "There is no [concept of] building with regard to utensils."<br>There is, however, a difference of opinion between the Rabbis about the interpretation of this statement. Rashi understands the statement simply. Fashioning a utensil can never be a derivative of building. One is liable for making a utensil, but one's liability stems from the forbidden labor of מכה בפטיש, completing a utensil. This view is shared by Rav Hai Gaon, Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi (according to Rabbenu Nissim), and others.<br>As obvious from this halachah, the Rambam differs and maintains that one is liable for building when fashioning a utensil. The leniency mentioned by the School of Hillel refers only to putting together a utensil that is made up of several component parts. [This is, however, forbidden by Rabbinic decree, because it resembles building (Chapter 22, Halachah 26).] Fashioning a new utensil, by contrast, is surely considered a derivative of building.<br>This latter opinion is shared by <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 74b), the Ramban, the Rashba, and others. It is also accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 314:1).</i><br>Similarly, one who makes cheese performs a derivative [of the forbidden labor] of building.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7, Halachah 6.</i> One is not liable until one makes an amount of cheese equivalent to the size of a dried fig.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Although one is liable for building even the slightest amount, with regard to this derivative the minimum measure for which one is liable is the size of a dried fig - the minimum measure associated with the labors related to food.

A person who makes even the slightest hole in a chicken coop to let light in is liable for building.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Note that in Halachah 16, the Rambam states that one who makes a hole in a building is liable for performing a derivative of the forbidden labor of מכה בפטיש.

Alternatively, in this halachah, the Rambam mentions making a hole of any size, while in Chapter 23, he mentions making an opening, implying that it is of a larger size, and only then is one liable for מכה בפטיש (<i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>).</i><br>A person who returns a door of a well, a cistern, or a wing of a building [to its place] is liable for building.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">These doors serve as part of the floor of the building.

Among the explanations given for the Rambam's position is that in removing the pus one does not complete the task involved, for an opening sufficient to be useful for another purpose has not been made (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). Similarly, <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> explains that in removing the pus, the person thinks only of relieving his pain and does not have any intent of making an opening. Thus the situation differs from the examples stated in Chapter 1, where the person performed the forbidden activity intentionally.<br>See also the commentary of Rav Chayim Soloveichik who explains that this decision is not dependent on the principle of מלאכה ש אינה צריכה לגופה, but rather on the concept of אינו מתכווין (see Chapter 1, Halachot 5-6) that a person who performs an activity which unintentionally causes a forbidden labor to be performed is not liable.<br>Although the Rambam agrees that when it is certain that one's actions will result in the performance of a forbidden labor, one is liable, the latter principle does not apply when one does not appreciate the results of the performance of the forbidden labor (פםיק רישא דלא ניחא ליה).

Hence, it is necessary to differentiate between the eight species mentioned in the Torah (which are generally trapped for their hides) and other crawling animals when that is not necessarily the case.</i> When a species is usually trapped, a person who traps any one of them - whether for a purpose, or without a purpose, even merely for the sake of sport - is liable, since he intended to trap and actually did so.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling depends on the principle stated by the Rambam immediately afterwards, that one is held liable for performing a [forbidden] labor when he has no need for the actual labor he performed.</i> A person is liable for performing a [forbidden] labor even if he has no need for the actual labor he performed.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">This subject, referred to as a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה in Hebrew, is discussed at length in Chapter 1, Halachah 7.

Unless he approaches stealthily, the animal will be startled and flee. In contrast, those mentioned in Halachah 24 will not be able to escape capture.</i>

What prohibition is there in releasing an animal from a trap? He answers that perhaps the intent is that the person is liable for violating the Rabbinic prohibition that deems an animal as <i>muktzeh</i>. Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 316:11 which states that one may release an animal or a fowl from a trap, provided one does not touch them.</i> A person who traps a beast or a fowl that is in his domain - e.g., ducks, chickens, or doves from a cote - is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 2:5, where the Rambam states that chickens and ducks are considered as within a person's grasp.

Because of that difference, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> considers the mention of doves in this halachah as a printing error.

The concept of trapping is relevant only when one traps an object of value. Therefore even Rabbi Yehudah frees one of liability when trapping an animal whose species is not usually trapped.<br>Similarly, in the instance at hand, since one has no concern for the object one is trapping, merely for one's personal welfare, the entire concept of trapping does not apply.

The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 306:11) quotes the <i>Or Zarua,</i> who states that one is liable for writing only when one writes in the Assyrian script (i.e., the Hebrew script used for Torah scrolls) or in the classic Greek script. Note, however, the <i>Noda BiY'hudah (Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. II, Responsum 32) and the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 306, who refute the <i>Or Zarua's</i> opinion and state that it is not accepted by others.

He begins the halachah with the statement that a person is liable for kindling a fire, "provided he needs the ash that it creates." This refers to a fire kindled for no purpose other than the production of ash.<br>Afterwards, the Rambam begins to describe when a person is liable for kindling fires that are used for constructive activity. e.g., to generate warmth or to cook.

He maintains, however, that a person who performs these actvities is liable, the liability stemming from other categories of forbidden labors;<br>c) That of Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 42a, 134a), which holds a person liable for kindling metal, but exempts him for extinguishing. (See also the <i>Sefer Yereim</i>, which explains that, in the construction of the Sanctuary, the heating of metal and its refinement was necessary for the goldsmiths and silversmiths.)<br>Rav Kapach explains the Rambam's position, emphasizing that there is a difference between iron and other metals. All other metals are made more pliable when heated. In contrast, as iron is made into steel, it becomes harder when heated and then placed into water. Therefore, just as the labors of kindling and extinguishing are associated with making charcoal - a new entity - so, too, it is these categories of labor that relate to the process of making steel.

When a fire fueled with wood is extinguished, a new entity - charcoal - is produced. Hence, one is liable for performing a forbidden labor. In contrast, when a glowing piece of metal is extinguished, no change is made in the metal itself unless the metal was heated with the intent of purifying it.<br>It must be noted that there are authorities who preceded the Rambam - Rav Yehudai Gaon, Rav Hai Gaon, and Rabbenu Chanan'el - who hold a person liable for extinguishing a glowing piece of metal. As mentioned in the notes on the previous halachah, most of the authorities in the Rambam's era, and surely those in the subsequent eras, exempt a person for such an activity.<br>It also must be noted that different rulings apply with regard to extinguishing an electric light or heater. In this instance, there are recent authorities who maintain that one is surely liable for kindling and extinguishing glowing metal.

Accordingly, he states that in the present time, it is permissible to extinguish a fire that has begun to blaze in a city.<br>In his time, it was common for the commotion caused by a fire to serve as an invitation for the gentiles to raid the Jewish quarters of the city, rampaging, pillaging, and creating havoc. In such a situation, it was very possible that Jewish lives would be threatened. Hence, he maintains that it is preferable for the fire to be extinguished than for such a situation to be created. Furthermore, in the cramped conditions of the ghettos, it was highly possible that the lives of the children, the elderly, and the disabled would be threatened by a fire.<br>Nevertheless, even the Ramah did not grant wholesale leniency on this matter and stated that, in practice, the ruling must be determined on the basis of our appreciation of whether there is a threat to life according to the circumstances at hand. Contemporary authorities add that because of the threat of electrical fires, gas explosions, and the like, a fire constitutes a real danger and should not be allowed to spread.</i>

In contrast, an oil lamp that contains oil may not be moved in this manner.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, however, explains that the Rambam's ruling can be accepted even with regard to an oil lamp which contains oil. The <i>Aruch</i> states that a person is not held liable when he performs an act that will inevitably bring about the commission of a forbidden labor, if he is displeased with the fact that the labor was committed (פסיק רישא דלא ניחא ליה). To apply that concept to the present situation, although spilling the oil from the lamp is considered as extinguishing the lamp, since th person did not intentionally desire to spill it and he regrets the loss of the oil, he should not be held liable. The commentaries also point to several other rulings that indicate that the Rambam accepts this principle.</i> If he [intentionally] placed it down [before] nightfall, it is forbidden to move [the board]<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is a slight extension of the actual text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, which states לטלטלו, concluding with a masculine suffix that seemingly refers to the candle, rather than the board. Nevertheless, as the commentaries point out, it is self-evident that the candle is forbidden to be moved. The new concept brought out by this law is that since the candle was intentionally left on the board before the commencement of the Sabbath, as explained in Chapter 25, Halachah 17, the board is considered a base for a forbidden object and is also <i>muktzeh</i>, forbidden to be moved (<i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>).</i> even after the candle is extinguished.
If a fire broke out on the Sabbath and a gentile comes to extinguish it, we may not tell him, "Extinguish it," nor [must we tell him,] "Do not extinguish it," for his resting is not our responsibility.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Chapter 6, our Sages forbade a Jew to instruct a gentile to perform a forbidden labor on the Jew's behalf on the Sabbath. We are not, however, obligated to prevent the gentile from performing a forbidden labor for his own sake. Thus, we cannot tell him to extinguish the fire, nor are we required to tell him to refrain from doing so. Indeed, this portion of the halachah is quoted in Halachah 4 of that chapter.</i><br>In contrast, should a child desire to extinguish [the fire], he should not be allowed if he is acting on his father's behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:10 states, "Do not perform any work, neither you, your son, your daughter,..." implying that a father is responsible for seeing that his children rest on the Sabbath. For this reason, any forbidden labor that will benefit his father may not be performed by a child (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> If he is acting on his own initiative, the court is not obligated to restrain him.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The expression "the court" refers to the communal authorities of the Jewish people. In a larger sense, it refers to the community as a whole.<br>From Chapter 24, Halachah 11, it would appear that the Jewish court is required to restrain a child from performing any violation of the Sabbath laws that originates in the Torah itself. This contradicts the Rambam's statements here and in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:27. Among the resolutions of this difficulty is that in the halachah cited, the Rambam is speaking about an activity that will benefit the child's father. See the notes on that halachah.</i><br>In the instance of a fire, [our Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 121a, <i>Ketubot</i> 70b.</i>] permitted a person to say, "Anyone who extinguishes the fire will not suffer a loss."<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as long as one does not instruct a gentile to extinguish the fire, one may indirectly encourage him to do so. Since the gentile has not been promised anything specific, he is considered to be working on his own behalf.</i>
Transferring<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah.</i> The translation of the standard printed version of the text would be "Bringing articles or removing articles from...." Whether one is bringing an article in or removing it, one is transferring it. See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:1).<br>The wording of the manuscripts avoids the difficulties mentioned by the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> and others that arise from <i>Shabbat</i> 96b.</i> objects from one domain to another is one of the categories of labor [forbidden on the Sabbath].<br>Although this [prohibition], as all other elements of the body of Torah law, was communicated orally by Moses [as he received them] from Sinai, it is also [alluded to within] the Torah itself. [Exodus 36:6] relates: "[Moses ordered that an announcement be made:] 'No man or woman should do any further work concerning the donations to the Sanctuary.' And the people stopped bringing [their gifts]." From this, one can infer that bringing [an article from one domain to another] is [also] referred to as "labor."<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Shabbat</i> 2a, explain that this verse is necessary because, in contrast to the other activities classified as forbidden labors, transferring articles is "an inferior labor" - i.e., we would not ordinarily conceive of it as being forbidden. (See also the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 1:1, which states that transferring articles does not appear to be an activity fit to be considered a forbidden labor.)<br><i>Eruvin</i> 17b derives the prohibition against the transfer of articles from one domain to another from the exegesis of Exodus 16:29. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Eruvin, loc. cit.; Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>) explain that both verses are necessary: one to teach that bringing an article in from the public domain to a private domain is forbidden, and the other to teach the converse, that it is forbidden to take an article out from the private domain to the public domain.<br>The Rambam (particularly according to the version of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> we have quoted) appears to view the concept of transferring as one activity which is prohibited on the basis of the oral tradition. Nevertheless, unlike the other categories of forbidden labor, in this instance there are allusions within the Torah itself. To make this point, he quotes the most obvious allusion, leaving the one in <i>Eruvin</i> for the scholars.</i><br>Similarly, we have learned according to the oral tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 96b.</i> that a person who carries an article from the beginning [of a square<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed additions are based on Halachot 15 and 18.</i>] four cubits long to the end [of that square] is comparable to a person who transfers an article from one domain to another and is liable.

A person who transfers an article in the ordinary fashion in which the article is transferred is liable, whether he transferred it [by carrying it] in his right hand, in his left hand,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 11, Halachah 14, usually a right-handed person is not liable if he performs a labor with his left hand.

This is the normal manner in which these articles are transferred, and this is thus equivalent to a person carrying an article on his shoulder or in his hand.<br>If, however, the person placed a light article - e.g., a garment, a book, or a knife - on his head and transferred them without holding them in his hand,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> states that in this instance, even if one holds the article in one's hands, one is not liable, since this is not the ordinary way in which an article is transferred.</i> he is not liable.

See <i>Shabbat</i> 92a regarding the practice of the inhabitants of Hotzel, a city in Babylon (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i><br>A person who carries an article from the beginning [of a square] four cubits long to the end [of that square] in the public domain is liable, even when he lifts it above his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, the Rambam states in Chapter 14, Halachah 7 that the space ten handbreadths above the ground in a public domain is a <i>makom patur</i>, a place where one is not liable for carrying.

Nevertheless, since the article does not come to rest in the <i>makom patur</i>, one is held liable (<i>Shabbat</i> 8b,9a).<br>The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's interpretation of that Talmudic passage and offers an alternative, which is accepted by the Rashba and <i>Tosafot</i>. The Rambam's interpretation is also offered by Rashi. (Alternatively, it is possible to explain that the Rambam's intent is that this is an ordinary, and not an abnormal, manner of carrying.</i>
It is permissible for a person to move objects in the public within a square four cubits by four cubits adjacent to the place where he is standing. He is allowed to move articles [freely] throughout this square.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected in Chapter 6, Halachah 22, and Chapter 20, Halachah 7, the Rambam does not place any restrictions on carrying within a square of four cubits in the public domain.<br>In contrast, the Ra'avad maintains that the leniency to carry within a square four cubits by four cubits in the public domain was granted a person only in abnormal situations - e.g., when one established this portion of the public domain as the place where he would spend the Sabbath or when he left the Sabbath limits. Under ordinary circumstances, one is not permitted to carry in the public domain at all. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 349:1) accepts the Rambam's ruling.</i><br>These cubits are measured according to the size of the person's arm.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the distance from his elbow to the tip of his middle finger. This measure is adapted to each individual instead of establishing a single uniform figure to allow every individual the opportunity of moving articles from his head to his feet when he is lying down (<i>Eiruvin</i> 48a). This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> If, however, his arms are dwarf-sized,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">But his body is of ordinary size (Rashi, <i>Eiruvin</i> 48a, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 349:1).</i> he is granted four cubits according to the size of an average person's arms.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, a cubit is 48 centimeters; according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>, it is 57.7 centimeters</i><br>According to the oral tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 48a, <i>Mechilta, Beshalach</i> 5, and other sources.</i> this is the interpretation of the Torah's statement [Exodus 16:29]: "Every person should remain in his place," that every person should not move an article outside this square, only within it. [This square] represents the length of a human body when one extends one's hands and feet; only within it is one allowed to move objects.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> draws attention to a difference of opinion among the Sages, <i>Eruvin</i> 48a, regarding the extent to which one is allowed to carry in the public domain. Although the prevailing view is that one is allowed to carry in a square four cubits long, there are interpretations that state that one may carry four cubits in any direction. This means that although one may not carry an object eight cubits, one may carry an object four cubits on one side and four cubits on the other side.<br>The view that the Rambam appears to accept, however, maintains that one may carry only in a single square four cubits long. (See also Chapter 27, Halachah 11.)</i>
When two people [are standing near each other] and a portion of the four cubits [in which one may carry] extends into the four cubits [in which the other may carry],<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they are less than eight cubits apart. There was no Rabbinic prohibition instituted lest one carry beyond the permitted space.</i> they may both bring [food] and eat in the center, provided one does not take something from [the area which is solely] his and bring it into [the area which is solely] his colleague's.<br>If three people [are standing near each other] and the middle individual's [space] is enclosed within their space,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the individuals on the extremes are standing between eight cubits and twelve cubits from each other.

Based on the above, it is permitted for a person to lift up an article from the public domain and give it to a colleague who is near him, within his four cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes on the previous halachah, the transfer must take place within the four cubits, the colleague may be standing slightly further removed.</i> The colleague may give it to another colleague standing at his side [who may pass it further]. Even if the article changes hands hundreds of times or is transferred several <i>millim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mil</i> is approximately a kilometer in contemporary measure.</i> on the Sabbath, this is permissible,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, noting that this leniency was mentioned in <i>Eruvin</i> 95b only with regard to an extreme situation - i.e., an instance where <i>tefillin</i> or other sacred articles might be desecrated. He contends that it should not be extended beyond that context.<br>Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 349:3) quotes the Rambam's ruling, some of the later authorities (see <i>Turei Zahav</i> 349:1) raise questions about this leniency.</i> because each individual moved it only within the four cubits [granted] him.
Since each person is allowed to carry within a square four cubits by four cubits, he is permitted to carry along the diagonal of this square which is five and three-fifths cubits long.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is not speaking in exact figures; the actual length of the diagonal is a fraction larger.</i> Accordingly, a person who carries or throws an article in the public domain is not liable unless he moves it beyond five and three-fifths cubits [from its original place].<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions that there were earlier authorities who maintain that one is liable for moving an article a measure of four cubits. Nevertheless, all the later authorities accept the law stated by the Rambam.</i><br>Whenever we have mentioned [the phrases], "from the beginning [of a square] four cubits long to the end [of that square]" or "one who carries an object four cubits is liable," the intent was [the distance] from the beginning of the diagonal of a four cubit [square] until its end. If a person carries an object for a shorter distance, he is not liable.
Thus, there are three [levels of responsibility that apply when] a person lifts up an object from one place in the public domain and places it down in another place in the public domain: If there are less than four cubits between these two places, the act is permitted.<br>If there are more than four cubits but less than five and three-fifths cubits between the two places, [the act is forbidden, but the person] is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Eruvin</i> 98b, Rashi, <i>Tosafot</i>, and Rabbenu Asher (see also the gloss of the Ra'avad) do not accept the Rambam's ruling and place no restrictions on carrying within five and three-fifths cubits. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 349:2) mentions the Rambam's view, it accepts the decision of the other authorities. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 349:2, however, states that at the outset, the Rambam's view should be followed.</i> If there are more than five and three-fifths cubits, the person is liable, because he moved an article beyond the diagonal of a square [four cubits long].

Chapter 13

A person who transfers an object from one domain into another<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> draws attention to the fact that there are authorities who hold a person liable if he places an object down on a place in a private domain that is smaller than four handbreadths by four handbreadths. (See the notes on Chapter 14, Halachah 17.)</i> or one who carries an object beyond four cubits in the public domain is not liable unless he lifts the object up from a place that is [at least] four handbreadths by four handbreadths, and places it down in a place that is [at least] four handbreadths by four handbreadths.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:1), the Rambam explains the rationale for this law: An object of significant size will not remain at rest if put down in such a small place. Therefore, one is not liable for placing down any objects there.<br>An object that is positioned on a person, animal, or utensil located in a place four handbreadths by four handbreadths is considered as if it has been placed down on a place that size.</i>
A person's hand is considered equivalent to a place four handbreadths by four handbreadths in size.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This concept is also explained in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:1): The adroitness and dexterity of a human hand makes it fit to hold even very large articles that are placed in it. Therefore, an object placed in a person's hand is considered as if it were placed on the ground on which he was standing.</i> Therefore, a person who removes an object from another person's hand in one domain and places it in the hand of a third person in a second domain is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> cites the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:1) as stating that a person is not liable for placing an object in the hand of another person standing in the public domain unless the latter's hand is held below ten handbreadths high. Nevertheless, as Chapter 12, Halachah 14, appears to indicate, the Rambam does not necessarily make such a distinction.</i><br>Similarly, a person is liable if he was standing in one of these two domains and stretched his hand into the other, removed an article from there or from the hand of a person standing there, and then returned his hand. [This applies] even though he did not place down the article in the domain in which he is standing.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It must be emphasized that a person's hand is considered as equivalent to a place four handbreadths by four handbreadths in size only when that hand is located in the same domain as he is. When, however, a person is standing in the public domain and his hand is extended into a private domain, an object placed in his hand is not considered to have been put down in the private domain. See Chapter 15, Halachah 1.</i> Since it is in his hand, it is considered as if it were placed on the ground.

As mentioned above,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 12, Halachah 9.</i> a person who transfers [an object] from one domain to another is not liable unless he removes the object from its place and places it down [in a new place]. When, however, one removes [an object], but does not place it down or places it down without lifting it up, one is not liable.<br>Therefore, when a person standing in one of two domains extends his hand into another domain while holding an object, and another person takes it from him, or if another person places an article in his hand and he retracts his hand, neither is liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is the contents of the first <i>Mishnah</i> of the tractate of <i>Shabbat</i>.</i> neither the person who removed the article nor the one who placed it down.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this decision is that a person is liable only when he both begins and completes a forbidden labor himself. There is no liability when one person begins a forbidden labor and it is completed by another. <i>Shabbat</i> 93a derives this concept from the exegesis of Leviticus 4:27, "when one performs one...," as implying that "a person who completes its performance, and not one who performs only a portion [of the forbidden labor]." (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 1:1, and also Chapter 1, Halachah 15.)</i>

The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that the leniency mentioned there applies only when one throws an object, and not when one moves it from domain to domain by hand.</i> and one is liable.
When one person is standing in either of these two domains and a colleague extends his hand from the second domain, takes an object from the person standing in the first domain and brings it in, or [the colleague] takes an object from his [domain] and places it in the hand of the person who is standing, the person who is standing [is not liable at all].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is also based on the opening <i>mishnah</i> of the tractate of <i>Shabbat</i>. Although the person standing is not liable at all with regard to the Sabbath laws, he transgresses the prohibition (Leviticus 19:14 , "Do not place a stumbling block in the path of the blind." See <i>Tosafot, Shabbat</i> 3a, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 347.</i> He did absolutely nothing; it was [his colleague who] placed the object in his hand or took it from his hand. The colleague is therefore liable, for he removed the object [from its original place] and put it down [in a new place].
When a person is standing in either of these two domains and a colleague puts an object in his hand or [loads it] on his back, and the [first] person goes out to another domain [carrying] this object, he becomes liable [when] he stands [still]. Removing his body while bearing the object is considered as removing the object from that domain, and standing while carrying the object is considered as placing the object down on the ground where he is standing. Therefore, if he went out holding the object in his hand or [carrying] it on his back and did not stand [still] in the second domain, but rather returned to the first domain while he was still holding the object, he is not liable. [This applies] even if he goes in and out [carrying the object] for the entire day until its conclusion. Although he removed [the object from its original place], he did not put it down [in a new place].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">There appears to be a slight difference between the Rambam's interpretation of the source for this law, <i>Shabbat</i> 5b, and that of Rashi.

For this reason, a person who is carrying a burden on his shoulders and running is not liable until he stands, even if he runs the entire day. He must, however, be running. If he is walking slowly, it is tantamount to having removed the article and having placed it down. [Hence,] this is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">By using the term "forbidden" rather than "liable," the Rambam emphasizes that the prohibition is Rabbinic in nature. Since this does not represent a departure from one's ordinary conduct, there is the possibility that one will stop, and thus perform an activity for which one is liable. Hence, the Rabbis forbade such conduct (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 153b, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 266:11). Others explain that the Sages issued this prohibition because this leniency might cause the person to carry on a future occasion, or because others might carry after they saw him do so.</i> For this reason, a person who was carrying an article on his shoulders when the Sabbath commences should run with it until he reaches his home and then throw it inside in an abnormal manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) emphasizes that there are two difficulties involved in the person's conduct: a) carrying the object four cubits in the public domain, and b) taking the object from the public domain to his home, a private domain (for most likely, the person stopped at least momentarily before entering).<br>Since the person began carrying the object before the commencement of the Sabbath, he has not removed the article from its place (<i>akirah</i>) in a forbidden manner. Hence, carrying the object four cubits in the public domain does not constitute a difficulty. In contrast, transferring the object from the public domain into one's home is problematic. Nevertheless, since this transfer is carried out in an abnormal manner, one is not liable.<br><i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions this law with regard to a person carrying a package. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:12) questions whether the same leniency applies when a person is carrying a wallet or another small article of that nature. The commentaries explain that since a person does not usually run when carrying a burden, the fact that he runs is a sufficient departure from the norm to remind him that stopping is forbidden. In contrast, since it is not a departure from the norm for a person to run while carrying a wallet, the Rabbis forbade doing so.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 266:13 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 266:34 state that in their time, when according to most authorities there is no concept of a public domain, one may follow the lenient view. There is some question, however, if this applies at present.<br>(See also the notes on Chapter 20, Halachot 6-7. See also the comments of the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 266:29, which states that preferably one should have even a package carried by a gentile or an animal, or one should walk with it less than four cubits at a time.)</i>
When a person removes an article from its place in the public domain and walks, [carrying] it less than four cubits and stands, [he is not liable].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Chapter 12, Halachah 15, one is allowed to carry within one's four cubits.</i> [Moreover, even if he continues this pattern[ the entire day, carrying the article less than four cubits, stopping, and then proceeding further, he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam uses the past tense, implying that this ruling applies only after the fact, בדעיבד.

[The following rules apply when] a pole, spear, or the like is lying on the ground: If a person lifts up one end without lifting the other from the ground, and then thrusts the pole forward, [he is not liable]. [Moreover, even if he continues this pattern,] picking up the second end which had remained in contact with the earth [while leaving the other end in contact with the earth], and thrusting it forward, and continuing to do so until the object moved several <i>millim</i>, he is not liable.

When a person removes an article from one corner [of a private domain] with the intent of placing it down in another corner [of the same domain], the removal of the article in such a manner is permitted. Should he then change his mind and take the article out to another domain, he is not liable.<br>[The rationale is that] the removal [of the article from its original place] was not [performed] with that intent.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 5b) explains that since the person did not perform the <i>akirah</i> with the intent of transferring the article to the public domain, he is not considered to have performed the forbidden labor as a purposeful act.

Although he did perform the transfer and the <i>hanachah</i> intentionally, since he did not have such a thought when performing the <i>akirah</i>, the entire action is considered to have been performed unintentionally.<br>According to the Rambam, however, the rationale appears to be that since the entire labor was not performed in a forbidden manner, one is not held liable.</i> Thus, the placement of the article was [performed in a forbidden manner], but not its removal.<br>Similarly, a person is not liable if he removes an article [from its original position] and places it on the back of a colleague who is walking, but removes it from his colleague's back when<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., before.</i> the latter desires to stand.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Were the person carrying the object to have stood still, he would have performed a forbidden <i>hanachah,</i> as mentioned in Halachah 8.

Taking the article from a person in this manner is not considered a continuation of the first transfer of the article, but rather an independent act.

[The following rules apply when] a person throws an object and it comes to rest in the hands of a colleague: If the colleague stood in his place and received the object, the person who threw it is liable, for he both removed [the object from its original place] and caused it to come to rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Throwing the object into his hands is equivalent to placing it there.

A person who throws an article from one private domain to another private domain is not liable, even if the article passes through the space of a public domain that separates them from each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Although Rabbi Akiva maintains that an object that passes through the space above a domain is considered as if it came to rest in that domain, his opinion is not accepted by the majority of the Sages.

A person is, however, liable if he carries<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Shabbat</i> 97b-98a, the source for this halachah, states this concept with regard to a person who throws an article, the Rambam alters the wording and mentions "a person who carries...." He did not make this change to exclude one who throws an article, but rather to emphasize that a person who carries an article in this manner is also liable.<br>The commentaries offer several reasons why this emphasis is necessary. Among them: A person who throws an article does not have it in his power to return it. Hence, it is logical to assume that the area in the two public domains can be combined. In contrast, a person carrying an article can change his mind at any time. Therefore, it would have been possible to think that his entrance into the second public domain is an independent act. Hence, it is necessary for the Rambam to mention carrying (<i>Or Sameach</i>).<br>Alternatively, the Rambam's choice of wording was intended to differentiate between the instance described here, and the circumstances described in Chapter 18, Halachah 24 (<i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>).</i> an object more than four cubits [in the public domain as he proceeds from] one public domain to another [although he passes through a private domain in the interim].<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., the person was standing two cubits from the end of one public domain.

Hence, he is liable. See the diagram on the opposite page.</i> The rationale is that the total of four cubits [can be reached by] combining [the area traversed in] both public domains, because the object did not come to rest in the domain between them.

This is problematic: Since logically a person would not be held liable in such an instance, and the obligation stems only from the parallel to the service of the Levites, why is it extended beyond the parameters of their service? Since they would pass the boards more than ten handbreadths above the ground, why is one liable when passing an article at a lower height?

In this process, the boards for the walls of the sanctuary were carried on four wagons. They would line up in pairs on either side of the Sanctuary. The boards would be lifted from the ground to the front wagon and then passed from one wagon to the other above the space of the public domain.

[The Sages] punished him [and decreed] that his hand must remain extended until nightfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the conclusion of the Sabbath. The Rashba in his notes on <i>Shabbat</i> 3a states that this restriction applies only when a person extended his hand to transfer the article before the commencement of the Sabbath. If he extended his hand outward after the commencement of the Sabbath, he is allowed to return it, lest he drop the article into the public domain, and in doing so perform a forbidden labor.<br>(According to the Rambam, he would not be liable in such an instance. Even if he dropped the article, it would not have been placed down in the place he originally intended. Hence, he would be exempt, as stated in Halachah 15.)<br>Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions the Rashba's view, it rules according to the Rambam. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 348:1 quotes solely the Rambam's view.

When a person intended to throw an article eight cubits in the public domain, but the article came to rest [just] beyond four cubits, he is liable, because the minimum measure of the forbidden labor was performed and the person's intent was completed.

According to their perspective, the thrower is liable only when it makes no difference to him where the article lands. If his intent was for it to travel eight cubits, he is not liable.<br>See the <i>Avnei Nezer</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 254), which explains the theoretical difference between this view and the Rambam's ruling.</i> In contrast, if a person intended to throw an article [just beyond] four [cubits] and the article came to rest at a distance of eight cubits, he is not liable, because the article came to rest in a place where he did not expect it to pass and certainly not to come to rest. Accordingly, if a person threw an object with the intent that it come to rest wherever it [landed], he is liable.
When a person throws an article [within] four cubits and it rolls beyond that distance, he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 11:3), the Rambam explains that the person is not liable because he did not intend to throw the article beyond the permitted distance.<br>The Rashba offers a different explanation of this <i>Mishnah</i>, that the article came to rest momentarily within four cubits and then rolled beyond that distance. Since the Rambam does not mention the object coming to rest at all in this clause, he does not follow this interpretation.<br>The Rambam would surely agree that one is not liable in the situation described by the Rashba. It is a matter of question, however, whether the Rashba would agree that the person is not liable in the situation described by the Rambam.</i> [The following rules apply] if a person throws an article beyond four cubits and it rolls back within four cubits: If it came to rest on an object beyond four cubits and afterwards rolled back within four cubits, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Since the object came to rest, albeit momentarily, it is considered as if his intent were completed.</i> If it did not come to rest at all [beyond four cubits], he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Because there is no forbidden <i>hanachah</i>.</i>

Chapter 14

There are four domains<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">An ancient commentary on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from Egypt emphasizes that the word רשות, translated as "domain," means "authority." Thus, in the context of space, a "private domain" would refer to a place that is controlled by a single authority, and a "public domain" to a place that is not controlled by such an authority. See <i>Hilchot Eiruvin</i> 1:4-5.</i> [referred to by our Sages with regard to transferring objects on the Sabbath]: a private domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:1), the Rambam describes a private domain as "a place that is not traversed by many people."</i> a public domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam describes a public domain as "a place traversed by many people."</i> a <i>carmelit</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains the meaning of this term: ארמלית is the Aramaic for "widow" and the prefix כ means "like." Thus, the term means "like a widow" - i.e., neither an unmarried maiden nor a married woman. Similarly, since a <i>carmelit</i> is not a place traversed by many people (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 345:14), it is not classified as a public domain. Nevertheless, it is not set off from the public sufficiently to meet the criteria of a private domain.<br>(Others, based on the Jerusalem Talmud, define <i>carmelit</i> as having its root in the word <i>carmel</i>, which means "partially ripe grain." The intent is also similar, an intermediate state. Note also the interpretation of Rashi mentioned below.)<br>The restrictions against carrying in a <i>carmelit</i> are Rabbinic in origin. According to the Torah, all the places defined as a <i>carmelit</i> are considered as a <i>makom patur</i> (or in certain unique instances, a private domain).</i> and a <i>makom patur</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This term literally means "a place with no liability." It refers to a place that is neither a public domain, nor a private domain. The forbidden labor of transferring objects was derived from the Sanctuary and involved carrying from the private domain to the public domain or vice versa. Accordingly, one is not held liable for carrying to, from, or within any place that does not meet the criteria of these categories.</i><br>What constitutes a public domain?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, the Rambam does not mention that a public domain must have 600,000 people passing through it. Rashi (<i>Eruvin</i> 6a) mentions this opinion, and it was accepted by the Ashkenazic authorities after him. The rationale for this ruling is that all the forbidden labors - and particularly, the labor of transferring - are derived from the construction of the Sanctuary. The public domain in that time was the encampment of the Jewish people in which 600,000 lived.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 345:7) mentions this view, but does not accept it. Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 345:11 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 345:23 write that it has already become public custom to accept the view that there is no possibility of a public domain in the present age. These texts do suggest that a God-fearing person should act stringently and should not rely on this leniency.<br>(It also must be noted that in many major cities today - e.g., New York, London, Paris - there are 600,000 people walking through a particular area. Hence, in a metropolis of this size, there are definitely places which could be categorized as public domains.)</i> Deserts,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This statement has raised many questions among the commentaries based on <i>Shabbat</i> 6b, which appears to imply that a desert was considered a public domain only when the Jews were encamped there. At the present time, a desert is considered as a <i>carmelit</i> and not as a public domain (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> attempts to resolve these difficulties by quoting a responsum of the Rambam's son, Rabbenu Avraham. Rabbenu Avraham explains that the deserts his father refers to are those wastelands that are frequently used as caravan routes. These are traversed by many merchants and are not under the control of any authority. Hence, these can surely be referred to as a public domain.<br>When defining a public domain and a <i>carmelit</i> in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 345:7, 14), Rabbi Yosef Karo does not mention a desert at all. (See also the <i>Bayit Chadash</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 345.)</i> forests,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to this particular as well, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> raises a question, noting that many authorities consider forests a <i>carmelit</i>. Indeed, Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 3b) interprets the meaning of the term <i>carmelit</i> as referring to a "wood."<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also attempts to resolve this objection, explaining that the intent is a forest with paths that many people enter to collect wood. Thus, it refers to a place used by the public and not under the authority of a single owner.</i> marketplaces, and the thoroughfares leading to them, provided that the thoroughfares are sixteen cubits wide<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 99a derives the necessity for the thoroughfares to be sixteen cubits wide from the way in which the boards of the Sanctuary were transferred. There were two wagons that traveled side by side, each five cubits wide. There were five cubits between them and a half a cubit on either side for a Levite to stand (Rashi). The same passage also specifies that these thoroughfares must be at least sixteen cubits in length.<br><b>Michah diagram</b></i> and are not covered by a roof.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 5a also derives this concept from the encampment of the Jews in the desert. There, the public domain was not covered by a roof. Therefore, even if an area meets the other criteria of a public domain, it is not considered to be in this category if it has a roof.

This ruling was rendered, because it is possible to place a board on the walls and place articles upon it. Furthermore, the width of the walls can be added to the width of the private domain to reach a total of four cubits (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 345:7)</i> If the [walls] create a distinction [from the public domain] for another [area - i.e., the space they contain], surely they create a distinction for themselves.<br>The space above a private domain until [the highest point] in the heavens is considered a private domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 17.</i> The space ten handbreadths above the public domain, [by contrast,] is considered a <i>makom patur</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 18.

A storage vat in a <i>carmelit</i> is considered a <i>carmelit</i> even if it is 100 cubits deep, if it is not four [handbreadths by four handbreadths in area].<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The text of the Rambam's wording in this halachah and its interpretation are a subject of debate among the commentaries. Some texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> read "A storage vat in a <i>carmelit</i> is considered a <i>carmelit</i> even if it is 100 cubits deep and four [handbreadths by four handbreadths]." (Note Rav Kapach's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah,</i> which follows the latter version with a slight emendation, "even if it is 100 cubits deep and 100 cubits wide.")<br>The essence of the issue is as follows: Were the vat to be more than four handbreadths by four handbreadths, it would be appropriate to consider it to be a private domain, since it meets all the criteria mentioned in Halachah 1. (Rav Kapach, however, maintains that in this instance, because the vat is filled with water and located in a <i>carmelit</i>, the fact that it meets the criteria of a private domain is insignificant.)<br>On the other hand, the Rashba and other authorities object to the Rambam's ruling as stated in our text. Since this vat can be considered an independent entity, seemingly, it would be more appropriate that it be considered a <i>makom patur</i> and not a <i>carmelit</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the decision quoted in our text, explaining that since a <i>carmelit</i> is itself a <i>makom patur</i> according to Torah law, it is impossible for a <i>makom patur</i> to be established within it. Instead, the entire area is considered a single <i>carmelit</i>. Note a similar concept in Chapter 17, Halachah 11.

Thus, in the above instance, the article the person is carrying is considered to have been placed down in the <i>makom patur</i>.

If he is standing in another domain, he is not liable. As mentioned in the notes to that halachah, most other authorities do not accept the Rambam's basic principle. Needless to say, even according to the Rambam, transferring an article in this manner is forbidden.<br>Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 346:2, which states that if the person transfers the article immediately, without resting his hand at all in the <i>makom patur</i>, he is liable.</i> Similarly, if one brought an article from a public domain to a private domain [via a] <i>makom patur</i> and stood in the latter domain, one is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling applies only when one stands to rest.

A pillar that is located in the public domain [is considered] a private domain [in the following situation]: It is ten [handbreadths] high and [possesses an upper surface] of four [handbreadths by four handbreadths] in area, but a lower surface that is not four [handbreadths by four handbreadths].

Were the smaller surface to be less than three handbreadths above the ground, there would be no difficulty in such a statement, because of the principle of <i>l'vud.</i> The new concept taught by this ruling, which is based on <i>Shabbat</i> 101a, is <i>gud acheit mechitzata</i>, "pull down and extend the partition downward" - i.e., the circumference of the pillar is considered to extend to the ground, and thus the entire pillar is considered as being ten handbreadths high.<br>The above explanation follows the standard published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah,</i> which have the support of some early texts. It parallels Rashi's understanding of the above Talmudic passage. <i>Tosafot</i> and the Rashba, however, interpret that passage differently and maintain that there is a proviso that must be met in regard to the principle <i>gud acheit mechitzata</i>: It is accepted only when young goats are not able to pass under the partition in question. Therefore, in this instance, since the narrow portion of the base is small, it would appear that young goats would be able to pass under the open portion. Accordingly, they offer a different interpretation, stating that this ruling is applicable only when the lower surface of the pillar is less than three handbreadths above the ground.<br>There are many manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> whose text indicates that the Rambam subscribes to this latter view. Furthermore, this perspective parallels the Rambam's rulings in <i>Hilchot Sukkot</i> 4:4. This view is quoted as halachah by the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 345:1. It must be emphasized, however, that the halachot that follow and their interpretation appear - although not conclusively so - to indicate that the Rambam subscribes to the principle of <i>gud acheit</i> in other contexts similar to the situation described here.</i> [Therefore,] if a person throws an article from the public domain and it lands on [this pillar], he is liable.<br>
When a person throws an article from the public domain and it lands upon a reed<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The mention of a "reed" by <i>Shabbat</i> 7a, the source for this halachah, is very significant, because a reed is narrow. In Chapter 13, Halachah 1, the Rambam states that a person is not liable for transferring an article unless he places it down on a surface that is at least four handbreadths by four handbreadths. A reed is obviously not that size.<br>Based on that passage, Rashi, the Ramban, and the Rashba maintain that the above principle applies only in the public domain and not within a private domain. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and others interpret the Rambam as accepting this principle as well. Accordingly, they question why he did not state this exception in Chapter 13, when laying down the general principles regarding this forbidden labor.<br>The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> offers an alternative to this explanation, noting that <i>Shabbat</i> 102b holds one liable for throwing an article into the mouth of a dog or into the mouth of a furnace even though they are less than four handbreadths by four handbreadths. Why? Since this was the person's desire, this intent causes the place to be considered as if it were the required size.

Nevertheless, this is possible only based on the principle <i>gud acheit mechitzata</i>, "pull down and extend the partition downward" - i.e., that the edges of the basket would be considered as extending to the ground.<br>This principle is not applicable in the present instance.

Chapter 15

A person standing in a public domain may move [articles] throughout a private domain. Similarly, a person standing in a private domain may move [articles] within a public domain, provided he does not transfer them beyond four cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In both these instances, there is not even a Rabbinic prohibition against moving the articles. As mentioned in the notes on the following halachah, Rashi and the Rashba state that this leniency applies only with regard to articles the person does not require in the domain in which he is standing. If he needs them, the Rabbis decreed that they may not be moved, lest the person forget and bring the articles into the domain where he is standing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 350:1) appears to favor the view of these authorities.</i> If he transfers an article [beyond that distance], he is not liable, because he is located in a different domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's decision, noting that <i>Eruvin</i> 99a would appear to hold a person liable in such a situation. The difficulty with the Rambam's statements is compounded by the fact that the passage cited above associates the law in question with the following decision, "A person who carries an article from the beginning [of a square] four cubits long to the end [of that square] in the public domain is liable, even when he lifts it above his head." Since the Rambam holds one liable in the latter instance (see Chapter 12, Halachah 14), it would seem that he would hold one liable with regard to the law under discussion. The Ra'avad's arguments are so powerful that the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> suggests amending the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> accordingly.<br>The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1527) notes the Ra'avad's question, and states that he checked all the ancient manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> available to him, and they all state that the person is not liable. Therefore, he explains that a person is not liable for transfering an article unless he is standing in one of the domains involved in the transfer. This concept is derived from the transfer of the articles in the construction of the Sanctuary. In this instance, the people were not standing in a domain other than those involved in the transfer. Based on this foundation, he offers an interpretation - albeit a slightly strained one - for the passage in <i>Eruvin</i>.</i><br>Similarly, a person standing in a private domain may open [a door with a key<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following law refer to situations where the key is located in the domain where the door is located.</i>] in a public domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions the possibility of placing the key in the door as a forbidden transfer. In the present day, almost every keyhole would be considered to be a <i>makom patur</i>.</i> [One standing] in a public domain may open [a door with a key] in a private domain.<br>One may force feed an animal whose head is inside [a stall, although] the major portion of its body is outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we are not worried that perhaps the animal will withdraw its neck and the person will carry the food outside the stall.

A person should not stand in a private domain and [extend his head into] the public domain to drink, nor [should he stand] in a public domain and [extend his head into] a private domain to drink, unless he brings his head and the majority of his body into the domain in which he is drinking.<br>When do the above [restrictions] apply?

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that although the Rambam's ruling appears most appropriate within the context of the Talmudic passage, in practice the more stringent ruling should be followed. As mentioned, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also rules accordingly.</i> [In this instance, our Sages instituted a] decree, lest he transfer [the drinking vessels].

[The following rules apply when] a projection extends [from the wall of a building] near a window: If the projection is above ten handbreadths high, its use is permitted,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to place articles upon it, transferring them from the building.

When, however, there are two projections extending from the wall, one below the other,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that according to the Rambam, these restrictions apply even when the two projections are not directly above each other.</i> even though they are both more than ten handbreadths high,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains, the difficulty is that people from different properties cannot both use a third property which adjoins them - for example (<i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 3:16), a wall that is four handbreadths wide that separates between two different properties. In particular, there are two conceptions of the Rambam's statements:<br>a) that of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 353:2), which explains that the two projections extend from two windows belonging to two different individuals who have not made an <i>eruv</i>.

(Although the public domain extends only to ten handbreadths, the people in the public domain have the right to use projections and holes in the wall that are above that height.) When there is only one projection, they refrain from using it, because it will be used by the inhabitants of the house. When, however, there are two projections, the passersby feel free to use the lower one. This in turn causes there to be certain restrictions with regard to the use of both projections on the Sabbath. See the diagram on the opposite page.<br>Although the <i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i> and others explain that the Ritba's interpretation is more appropriate to the wording chosen by the Rambam, our notes will follow the approach of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, for it is accepted by the subsequent halachic authorities. It also must be noted that Rashi's version of the text of <i>Eruvin</i> 98b differs from that of the Rambam. Accordingly, he and the subsequent Ashkenazic authorities have a different conception of these rulings.</i> [different rules apply]: If the upper projection near the window is four [handbreadths] by four [handbreadths] in area, its use is forbidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Note that <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 353:3 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 353:11 explain that this refers to articles that were kept inside the house.

[The following rules apply to] a water conduit that passes through a courtyard: If it is ten [handbreadths] high and between four [handbreadths] and ten cubits wide, we may not draw water from it on the Sabbath, unless one erects a partition [in the water] ten handbreadths high at its entrance [to the courtyard] and its exit.<br>If it is not ten [handbreadths] high or is less than four [handbreadths] wide, we may draw water from it without [erecting] a partition.

Significantly, this question is asked in this halachah and not in the previous one. In the previous halachah, although the conduit itself was considered a separate domain, since the opening was less than ten handbreadths, it is considered as an entrance and the enclosure is not nullified. This halachah, however, mentions an opening of more than ten cubits, an aperture which ordinarily nullifies an enclosure.</i> If there is even a small portion [of the wall] remaining on both sides of the opening, or if a portion [of the wall] four handbreadths in size remains on one side of the opening, it is permitted to carry in the entire courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Several explanations have been offered for the Rambam's ruling. Among them: the small portion of the wall which remains juts out over the water. Therefore, the opening to the courtyard is less than ten cubits (Rabbenu Yonason, commenting on Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi). The portions of the wall which remain on either side are considered like poles. As stated in Chapter 17, Halachah 7, it is permitted to carry in a courtyard with poles on either edges of the entrance to the fourth side (an ancient commentary on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from Egypt). See also the <i>Or Sameach</i>.</i> It is forbidden only to draw water from the conduit.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For the reasons mentioned above, the wall of the courtyard is an acceptable divider, and thus the courtyard as a whole is still considered to be a private domain. Nevertheless, since the wall was not made for the purpose of distinguishing the water that is outside the courtyard from that which is within the courtyard, a separate partition is required for that purpose (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> If, however, no portion of the wall remains, it is forbidden to carry in the entire courtyard, for it has been opened up to the sea,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">When there are no portions jutting out over the water (according to the first interpretation in note 49) or when the entire wall is destroyed (according to the second), the courtyard is considered as enclosed on three sides alone and it is forbidden to carry within.</i> which is a <i>carmelit</i>.
How must the partitions be erected in the water? If [the majority of the partition] is above the water, at least a handbreadth of the partition must descend into the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For the entire intent of this partition is to make a distinct separation between the water in the courtyard and the water in the public domain outside of it. [See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishneh (<i>Eruvin</i> 8:6). See also <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 3:21-22 where the Rambam mentions a similar requirement.]</i> If the partition as a whole descends into the water, at least a handbreadth must rise above the water level. [In this manner,] the water in the courtyard will be distinct, [from the water in the conduit on either side of the courtyard].<br>Although the partition does not reach the ground [in the conduit], since it is ten handbreadths high, it is permitted. The use of a partition that remains hanging was allowed only with regard to water.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, a partition must descend within three handbreadths of the ground.</i> Since the prohibition against carrying this water is Rabbinic in origin,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For, as mentioned above, the courtyard is a private domain, and carrying within it is permitted. Furthermore, even the water conduit is considered as a private domain according to the Torah itself and its designation as a <i>carmelit</i> is Rabbinic in origin.</i> [the Sages] were lenient regarding [the nature of] the partition [required], for its purpose is only to create a distinction.
[The following rules apply] when a conduit of water passes between several courtyards and there are openings [from the courtyards] to it:<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the conduit mentioned in the previous halachot, this conduit does not pass through the courtyards, but merely by their side.

[The following rules govern] a balcony<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 8:8), the Rambam explains that just as it is customary to erect balconies over the public domain, it is also customary to erect balconies over bodies of water.</i> that extends over a body of water with an aperture<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 355:1) states that the aperture must be four handbreadths by four handbreadths.</i> [in its floor] that opens to the water: We may not draw water from it on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since the body of water is considered to be a <i>carmelit</i>.

Accordingly, we are allowed to draw water through it, because the portion of the body of water beneath it is considered to be an extension of the private domain [the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>)].</i> Alternatively, we may construct a partition descending from the balcony to the water.

The current of the water will cause the water that has been poured to flow beyond the periphery of the aperture and into the portion of the body of water that is a <i>carmelit</i>. Nevertheless, since the person does not perform this transfer himself, there is no restriction.</i> [The rationale is:] One is pouring into a <i>carmelit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Since the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin, the construction of such a partition is sufficient (<i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>).</i>
We must not pour water into a courtyard that is less than four cubits by four cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's wording is intended to negate an opinion mentioned in <i>Eruvin</i> 88a, which states that even if a courtyard is not four handbreadths by four handbreadths, if its total area is 16 square handbreadths (e.g., it is is eight cubits by two), the restrictions mentioned in this halachah do not apply. Significantly, the Rashba accepts the more lenient view and, in this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 357:1) follows his ruling.</i> on the Sabbath, because [the water] will flow into the public domain rapidly.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Pouring the water into the courtyard does not violate a Torah prohibition, because the courtyard itself is an extension of the home. Although the water flows into the public domain, this is due to the forces of gravity and inertia. Thus, the person's pouring of the water is considered as merely a cause; it is not considered as if he poured the water into the public domain directly. Nevertheless, the Rabbis forbade pouring the water in this manner.</i><br>Therefore, it is necessary to dig a pit that contains two <i>seah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>seah</i> is approxinmately 8.25 liters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 14.4 liters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>. The Sages chose this measure because they considered this to be the average quantity of water used by a person every day (the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 8:9).</i> in the courtyard or in the public domain next to the courtyard, so that the water will collect there. [If the pit is within the public domain], one must build a domed covering<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which differs and mentions a covering of boards, which most likely is flat.</i> over this pit from the outside so that the pit will not be seen in the public domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>op. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains that the covering will cause the pit to be separated from the public domain. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 357:1 and the <i>Be'ur Halachah,</i> which explain that because of its dome-like cover, people will not walk over it easily. Hence, since its opening faces the private domain, it is considered to be a hole adjacent to the private domain or a <i>makom patur</i>.) Note the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 357) who explains that the reason for the cover is to prevent people's suspicions from being aroused.</i><br>The courtyard and the patio adjoining it are combined [when calculating] the four cubits. How large is a pit that contains two <i>seah</i>? [A pit] half a cubit by a half a cubit in area and three fifths of a cubit high.
If the pit cannot contain two seah, we may pour [no more than] its contents into it. If it can contain two seah, we may pour [any amount of] water into it, even 60 seah, despite the fact that the water will overflow and spill from the pit outward.<br>When does the above apply? In the rainy season, at which time the courtyards are muddied and many drainpipes spread water. Thus, onlookers will not say that this person is making use of the courtyard and the water is flowing into the courtyard because of his power. In the summer, by contrast, if [the pit] can contain two seah, only that amount may be poured into it. If it cannot contain two seah, no water at all may be poured into it.
[The following rules apply] to a drain through which water is poured and the water flows under the ground into the public domain, and to a gutter when water is poured over its mouth and the water flows down a wall and descends to the public domain: Even if the wall is 100 cubits long or the stretch of ground under which [the water] passes is 100 cubits long, it is forbidden to pour into the mouth of this drain or this gutter, for because of one's power, the water flows into the public domain. Instead, one should pour outside the drain, [allowing the water to] flow into the drain on its own accord.<br>
When does the above apply? In the summer. In the winter, by contrast, one may pour [water as mentioned above], and indeed, do so repeatedly, without inhibition. At that time, the gutters are flowing [with water], and a person desires that the water will be absorbed in its place.<br>The protrusion extending above the sea<br>[In contrast,] it is permitted for a person to pour water over a drain which flows into the carmelit, even in the summer. No decrees were enacted against [the effect of] a person's power in a carmelit. For this reason, it is permitted to pour [water] down the side of a ship and have it descend to the sea.
A person who is standing in a ship should not draw water from the sea unless he builds a protrusion, four [handbreadths] by four [handbreadths], extending from the ship above the sea.<br>When does the above apply? When [the deck of the ship] is within ten [handbreadths of the water level]. If, however, [the deck] is more than ten [handbreadths above the water level], he may draw water after erecting a protrusion of the smallest size. [The rationale for this leniency is that] he is drawing water through a makom patur, and the protrusion is necessary only to make a distinction.
[The following rules apply when] a person was reading a scroll in a carmelit, a portion of the scroll rolled into the public domain, and a portion remained in his hand: If it rolled more than four cubits, he should turn it face down and leave it. This is a decree, enacted lest [the scroll] drop from his hand and he carry it [more than] four cubits. If it rolled less than four cubits, he should roll it back toward himself. Similarly, if it rolled into a private domain, he should roll it back towards himself.<br>[The following rules apply when] a person was reading in a private domain and the scroll rolled into a public domain]: If it came to rest, he should turn the scroll face down. If it did not come to rest, but rather remained suspended in the air above the public domain and did not reach the earth, he may roll it back to himself.
A person who moves thorns so that the public at large will not be injured [should adhere to the following guidelines]: If [the thorns] were in the public domain, he should move them less than four cubits at a time. If they were located in a carmelit, he may move them even 100 cubits in a normal manner.<br>Similarly, if a corpse [began to decompose,] emit foul odors, and become extremely abhorrent to the extent that the neighbors cannot bear to remain [in the same place], it may be taken from a private domain to a carmelit.<br>After a person descends to bathe in the sea, he should dry himself when he ascends, lest he carry the water that is on him more than four cubits in a carmelit.

Chapter 16

[The following rules pertain to] a place that is enclosed for purposes other than habitation, and is used as an open space - e.g., gardens and orchards, an open area that is enclosed to protect it, or the like: If the walls surrounding it are ten handbreadths or more high, it is considered to be a private domain with regard to a person's being liable for transferring, throwing, or passing an object from it to the public domain, or from the public domain to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The majority of this chapter is devoted to an explanation of the laws pertaining to a <i>karpef,</i> a large area that is enclosed by four walls, but these walls were not constructed for the purpose of habitation.<br>Since this area is enclosed by four walls, it is considered a private domain according to Torah law. Therefore, one is liable for transferring articles to and from it. Nevertheless, as the Rambam continues, the Rabbis imposed certain restrictions on carrying within this space for the reasons mentioned below. We are, however, allowed to carry within an area enclosed for the purpose of habitation regardless of how large it is (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 2:5).</i><br>We are not allowed to carry within it, unless its area is equivalent to that necessary to sow two <i>seah</i> [of grain]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The size of this space is defined in Halachah 3.</i> or less. If its area is larger than the space necessary to sow two <i>seah</i>, we may not carry more than four cubits within it, as in a <i>carmelit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is a large space in which there are no inhabitants, it appears to resemble a public domain or a <i>carmelit</i>. Accordingly, the Sages placed certain restrictions on carrying within it, lest one err and carry in the public domain as well (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 358:1).</i>
Similarly, if a surface is elevated more than ten handbreadths high<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A surface four handbreadths by four handbreadths that is elevated ten handbreadths above the ground is considered to be a private domain.</i> and whose area is equivalent to the space necessary to sow two <i>seah</i> or less, we may carry on the entire surface. If its area exceeds the space necessary to sow two <i>seah</i>, we may carry only within a space of four cubits upon it.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although it is a private domain according to Torah law, our Sages forbade carrying upon it for the reasons explained in the previous halachah.</i><br>When a rock in the sea is less than ten handbreadths high, we may carry from it to the sea, and from the sea to it, for the entire area is a <i>carmelit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Although one is allowed to carry from one <i>carmelit</i> to another, one may not carry more than a total of four cubits.</i> If [the rock] is ten handbreadths high, [different rules apply].

[This restriction is a safeguard, instituted,] because we are permitted to carry on the entire [rock].<br>If its area exceeds the space necessary to sow two <i>seah</i>, although it is a private domain and yet it is forbidden to carry more than four cubits upon it as in a <i>carmelit</i>, it is permitted to carry from it to the sea and from the sea to it. This is an atypical situation. Hence, the Sages did not [include] it [in their] decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Although our Sages generally forbade transferring an article from a private domain to a <i>carmelit</i>, since this is a very unusual circumstance they did not include it in their decree.</i>
How large is an area in which a <i>seah</i> [of grain can be sown]? Fifty cubits by fifty cubits. Thus, the area in which two <i>seah</i> [of grain can be sown] is 5000 square cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 23b identifies the area in which two <i>seah</i> of grain can be sown with the courtyard of the Sanctuary in the desert, which was 100 cubits by 50 cubits.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> explains the significance of this concept. All of the prohibitions against labor on the Sabbath are derived from the Sanctuary. The courtyard of the Sanctuary was a large area which was enclosed for purposes other than habitation. Nevertheless, it was permitted to carry within it. Therefore, when the Sages prohibited carrying in large areas that were enclosed for purposes other than habitation, they used the size of the courtyard of the Sanctuary as the lower limit.</i><br>This measure<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Here we see a contrast to the measures of four handbreadths by four handbreadths or four cubits by four cubits, where the intent is a square or a larger area in which such a square could be inscribed.</i> applies whether the area is a square of 70 cubits and a fraction by 70 cubits and a fraction,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 2:5), the Rambam states that the square is approximately 70 cubits and five sevenths of a cubit by 70 cubits and five sevenths of a cubit, but that there is no perfect square root for the number 5000.</i>or it is a circle, or it is of another shape.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is obvious from the connection to the courtyard of the Sanctuary, which, as mentioned, was a rectangle and not a square.</i> [If its area equals the sum mentioned,] it is considered as "the area in which two <i>seah</i> [of grain can be sown]."
[The following rules apply when] an area that is enclosed for purposes other than habitation and is large enough for two <i>seah</i> [of grain to be sown within is rectangular in shape]: If its length is twice its width - for example, it is 100 by 50, as was the courtyard of the Sanctuary - carrying is permitted within it.<br>If, however, [it is more elongated] and its length exceeds twice its width by even one handbreadth,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Rambam's explanation of the difference in opinion between Rabbi Yosse and Rabbi Eliezer, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 2:5). On the basis of this explanation, it would appear that his conception of the Mishnah is closer to that of <i>Tosafot, Eruvin</i> 23b than to that of Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> we are permitted to carry only four cubits within it.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">As in a <i>carmelit</i>.</i> [This restriction is imposed because the permission to carry as one may carry] in other courtyards [within] an open space large enough for two <i>seah</i> [of grain to be sown within], is derived from the courtyard of the Sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, when such an open area does not resemble the courtyard of the Sanctuary, the leniency does not apply.</i>
[The status of] a place that was originally enclosed for purposes other than habitation [may be changed in the following manner]. A person tears down [a portion of the wall, creating] an open space that is more than ten cubits long and ten handbreadths high<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Once this extent of a wall has been broken down, it is considered as if the entire wall is no longer of significance as indicated in Halachah 16.</i> and then re-encloses that space for the purpose of habitation.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">When one re-encloses the wall, it is considered as if the entire enclosure has been made for the purpose of habitation. Therefore, the area is considered to be an ordinary private domain, and one is allowed to carry within without restriction.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's statements on the basis of those of Rashi, <i>Eruvin</i> 24a, which state that the intent to use the enclosure for habitation is not sufficient. There must be a house that opens up to the enclosure.<br>The <i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i> states that, according to the Rambam, "habitation" does not necessarily mean "human habitation." Therefore, the intent could be to use the enclosure as a corral for animals or the like. Rav Kapach cites the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 2:5), from which it appears that as long as there is a storage vat in the enclosure, it is considered as "enclosed for the purpose of habitation," although it does not contain a house or lead to a house.<br>Thus according to the Rambam, "everything depends on the person's intention." If he encloses the area for the sake of habitation, he is allowed to carry freely within it. Why is this leniency granted? Because the prohibition against carrying within such an area is Rabbinic in origin, and the Sages enforced this stringency only when a person's intent was not for the sake of habitation, for then the enclosure resembles a public domain. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 358:2), however, follows Rashi's view, that a house is required within the enclosure or the enclosure must lead to a home.</i> [After this has been done,] one may carry within the entire enclosure.<br>Moreover, even if one [did not complete the entire process at once, but rather] tore down a single cubit and re-enclosed that space for the purpose of habitation, tore down another single cubit and re-enclosed that space for the purpose of habitation<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since the entire enclosure was never opened up for ten cubits at one time, one might assume that the original enclosure was never nullified. Nevertheless, since ultimately a span of ten cubits was constructed, the enclosure is considered as פנים חדשות, "a new entity" (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 358:8). Note a parallel ruling in <i>Hilchot Kellim</i> 6:2.</i> - [when one continues this process until] one re-encloses a space greater than ten cubits one may carry within the entire enclosure, even though it is several <i>millim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mil</i> is approximately a kilometer in contemporary measure.</i> in size.
When [produce] is sown in the majority of an area that is larger than the space [necessary to sow] two <i>seah</i> [of grain] that was enclosed for the sake of habitation, the area is considered to be a garden,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Although the area was enclosed for the purpose of habitation originally, since it is large and the person sowed produce within the majority of its space, it is clear that he considers it to be a commercial field or garden. It is not common for people to dwell in such a place (Rashi, <i>Eruvin</i> 23b).</i> and it is forbidden to carry within it in its totality.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one may carry only within a square of four cubits even in the portion of the enclosure where the produce was not sown, because there is no barrier enclosing the area on the side that faces the portion where the produce has been sown (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). Alternatively, the portion in which the produce was not sown is considered to be a secondary part of the entire field in which it is forbidden to carry (Rashi, <i>Eruvin</i> 24a).</i><br>[The following rules apply when produce] is sown merely within a minor portion [of the enclosure]: If the portion [where the produce] was sown is equal<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, if produce was sown in a smaller portion of the enclosure, the same leniency applies.

If it is shallower than that, there are no restrictions on carrying within the enclosure. Although <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> differs with this interpretation, the Rashba's ruling is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 358:11).</i> [the following rules apply]: If [the water] is fit to be used [by humans],<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Eruvin, loc. cit.</i>) states that the water must be fit to drink. The Rashba and other Sephardic authorities state that it is sufficient that the water be fit for laundry and the like. This appears to be the Rambam's view. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) quotes Rashi's view, <i>Sha'ar HaTziyun</i> 358:81 states that one may rely on the Rashba's ruling.</i> [the water] is considered to be like trees,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For, indeed, it is an advantage to have a source of water near one's home.

[The following rule applies when a roof is constructed<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that according to the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Eruvin</i> 25a, this refers to a roof that is open on all sides, which the watchmen in a garden construct for shade.

Nevertheless, since according to the Torah itself, it is permitted to carry within this enclosure, leniency is allowed.

The enclosure is not considered part of the courtyard, nor is the courtyard considered part of the enclosure, and the laws that originally applied to both areas continue to apply.<br>According to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, this clause is not a continuation of the first clause of this halachah, but rather a separate concept in its own right. Rav Kapach, however, notes that both the Talmud (<i>Eruvin, loc. cit.</i>) and the Rambam link this and the previous clause together. On this basis, he follows the interpretation of Rabbenu Chanan'el, which states that the unroofed area of the enclosure was originally not larger than the space for two <i>seah</i> of grain to be sown within it. Therefore, we were permitted to carry within it. When, however, the wall connecting it to the courtyard was torn down, the open space was increased and became larger than the space for two <i>seah</i> of grain to be sown within it. Hence, it became forbidden to carry within it.</i> [The rationale is:] The open space of the courtyard does not cause [carrying] to be permitted [within the enclosure].<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we do not say that the enclosure becomes considered as an extension of the courtyard.</i>
When [the area of an enclosure] is greater than the space necessary [to sow] two <i>seah</i> [of grain], and one attempts to reduce its size<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">So that one will be able to carry within it.</i> by planting trees, its [size is not considered to have been] reduced.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is common to plant trees in such enclosures, even when the trees are ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths by four handbreadths in area (at which point they are considered to be a separate domain in certain contexts), they do not reduce the size of the enclosure (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i> in the name of the Rashba).</i><br>If one builds a pillar ten [handbreadths] high and three or more [handbreadths] wide at the side of the wall,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi interprets <i>Eruvin</i> 25a, the source for this halachah, as referring to a pillar of this size, whether it is in the middle of the enclosure or next to the wall.

If it is less than 5000 square cubits, one may carry within. It must be noted that, with regard to this clause as well, Rashi interprets the Talmudic passage differently, explaining that the new partition is erected to enclose the area for the purpose of habitation. His interpretation is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6).</i> If [the partition] is less than three [handbreadths from the wall], it is of no consequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the principle of <i>l'vud</i>.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions this ruling on the basis of the first clause of the following halachah, which states, "If one applies cement to the wall, one reduces [the size of the enclosure]."

If one applies cement to the wall, one reduces [the size of the enclosure],<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if the entire space taken up by the cement that is added to the wall is sufficient to reduce the size of the enclosure to less than 5000 square cubits, one may carry within the enclosure.</i> although [the cement] is not substantial enough to stand as a separate entity.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, the Ra'avad differs with the Rambam.

Any partition whose open portion exceeds its closed portion is not considered to be a partition.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if a wall includes open spaces, the area that is open may not exceed the area that is enclosed. As mentioned in the following halachah, this refers to open spaces that are larger than three handbreadths wide. As the Rambam states in Halachah 18, this refers to spaces in the horizontal as well as the vertical portion of the wall.</i> If, however, the open portion is equivalent to its closed portion, it is permitted [to carry within the enclosure], provided none of the open portions is larger than ten cubits wide.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when there is an open space larger than ten cubits wide, the entire partition is nullified.</i> [The rationale for this leniency is that an open space] ten cubits [or less] is considered to be an entrance.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">As long as the opening is ten cubits wide or less, there is no need to enclose it with a frame of an entrance.

According to the Rambam, although the frame of an entrance enables an opening larger than ten cubits to be accepted, the opening is still considered an open space. Accordingly, if the total amount of open space on any one side of a partition exceeds the closed space, the partition is unacceptable, even though portions of the open space possess a frame of an entrance.<br>Many authorities (e.g., the Rashba and <i>Tosafot, Eruvin</i> 11a) differ and maintain that once a frame of an entrance is constructed, the space below it is deemed closed and should be considered as such when calculating whether the enclosed portion of a partition exceeds its open area. The opinion of these authorities is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 362:10). Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 362:19 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 362:59 state that it is proper to be stringent and follow the Rambam's ruling.<br>Rabbenu Asher cites the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Eruvin 1:9) and Kilayim</i> 4:2 as the source for the Rambam's ruling. (See also <i>Hilchot Shofar V'Sukkah V'Lulav</i> 4:12, where the Rambam accepts a more lenient view regarding the walls of a sukkah. Note also the glosses of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> there.)<br>See also the commentary of Rav Kapach, who advances an interpretation of the Rambam's statements here and in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 1:8) that maintains that the Rambam follows the view advanced by the Rashba. Even those who reject this interpretation in most instances are forced to accept it with regard to the third side of an alley, as stated in Chapter 17, Halachah 3. (Note also Chapter 17, Halachah 27.)<br>The difference between the Rambam's ruling and that of the other authorities is particularly relevant in contemporary communities that permit carrying because of an <i>eruv</i>. Most of these communities are enclosed, not by a proper wall, but by a series of "frames of an entrance" constructed using telephone poles and the like. According to the Rambam, these enclosures are not acceptable. Indeed, this is one of the reasons why the carefully observant refrain from carrying in these communities.</i>
When does the above apply? When the open spaces are three handbreadths or wider. If, however, the open spaces are each less than three handbreadths,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">More precisely, the same ruling applies if some of the spaces are wider than three handbreadths, as long as the size of the total of the open spaces wider than three handbreadths does not exceed the remainder of the partition.</i> the partition is acceptable although the total open space exceeds the space which is enclosed. For whenever there is an opening of less than three handbreadths, the portions separated in this manner are considered as parts of a solid partition.
What does the above imply? For example, a person makes an enclosure with reeds - as long as there is less than three handbreadths between one reed and the next, the partition is fully acceptable. Similarly, if one makes a partition with ropes, as long as there is less than three handbreadths between one rope and the next [the partition is fully acceptable]. [The above applies] even when the [reeds or ropes] run vertically but not horizontally,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam continues, a partition of reeds will generally be constructed by implanting them upright in the ground, one near the other.

Even if it is several cubits above them,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">In his gloss on this halachah, Rabbi Akiva Eiger explains that this is acceptable because of the principle <i>gud asik</i> - i.e., the posts at the side are considered to be extended until they reach the crossbar. Based on this rationale, it follows that the two posts need not be of the same height. Even if one is higher than the other, they may still be considered as part of the same frame of an entrance. (Note also the application of this principle in <i>Hilchot Sukkah</i> 4:2.)</i> since the posts at the side are ten [handbreadths] high, [the structure] is considered to be a frame of an entrance.<br>The frame of an entrance mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), this refers to the posts on the side.

As mentioned in Halachah 19, the requirement for a frame of an entrance is for the lintel to be above the door posts and not projecting from their sides (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> is not significant, for it is not common for entrances to be constructed at the corner [of a wall],<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Note Chapter 17, Halachah 35, which mentions another law based on this same principle.</i> but rather in its center.

Hence, that person is prohibited from carrying within.

(See <i>Or Sameach</i>.)<br>Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which states that if a partition had been standing before the Sabbath, it was removed on the Sabbath and then reconstructed on the Sabbath, it is permitted to carry within the enclosure.

A lane with three walls is called a closed lane.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In Talmudic times, it was not customary that homes open to streets, as is the practice today. Instead, several homes would open up to a single courtyard. These courtyards would open up to paths or lanes that led to the public marketplaces and the thoroughfares of the towns. Sometimes, these paths or lanes would end in a <i>cul-de- sac,</i> and on other occasions they would lead from one thoroughfare to another.</i> In contrast, a lane that has only two walls, one opposite the other, and thus passersby enter from one end and leave from the other, is referred to as an open lane.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a lane leading from one marketplace or thoroughfare to another. Needless to say, the lane must be less than sixteen cubits wide. If it is sixteen cubits wide, it would be deemed as a public domain according to the Rambam, as mentioned in Chapter 14, Halachah 1.</i>
What must be done to allow people to carry within a closed lane?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This question applies within a city that is not surrounded by an <i>eruv</i>. As the Rambam explains in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 1:2), a lane with three walls is considered to be a <i>carmelit</i>. Thus according to the Torah itself, such an area is regarded as a <i>makom patur,</i> and one is permitted to carry within it. The Rabbis nevertheless forbade carrying within such an area, unless a person constructed either of the following structures: a <i>lechi</i> - a pole constructed at one of the corners of the fourth side - or a <i>korah</i> - a beam constructed across the entrance. (See also the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>.)</i> We should erect one pole<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The dimensions required for a pole and a beam are mentioned in Halachot 12 and 13. When a pole is constructed at the corner of the fourth side of the lane, the lane is considered to be enclosed and thus is viewed as a private domain. (See Halachah 9 of this chapter and Chapter 14, Halachah 1.)</i> at the fourth side or extend a beam above it;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in Halachah 9, extending a beam over the lane is a Rabbinic measure that makes a distinction between such a lane and a lane that is not enclosed at all. Because of this distinction, the Rabbinic prohibition against carrying in such a lane is lifted.</i> this is sufficient.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This refers merely to the process of enclosing the area in question. In addition, as mentioned in <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 1:1-2, it is necessary for the people who share the lane to join together in an <i>eruv</i>, each contributing a certain measure of food.</i> The beam or the pole is considered to have enclosed the fourth side, making it [equivalent to] a private domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's definition of a lane follows the conception of Rabbenu Chanan'el in his commentary on <i>Eruvin</i> 12a. Most other <i>Rishonim</i> [including Rashi (<i>Eruvin, loc. cit.</i>), <i>Tosafot</i>, the Rashba, and the Ra'avad] differ, and maintain that as long as a lane has three walls (or two walls and a pole on the third side), it is considered a private domain according to the Torah. (See <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 363:1.)<br>The difference between the Rambam's view and that of these other authorities does not concern the license to carry, for all agree that it is forbidden to carry within the lane until a pole or a beam is constructed at the fourth side. Instead, the difference involves transferring an article into such a lane with three walls from the public domain. According to the Rambam, one is not liable from such a transfer, while according to the other authorities, one is.</i><br>Thus, carrying is permitted within it.<br>According to Torah law, one is permitted to carry [within an area enclosed] by three partitions.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, according to the Rambam, one may carry in this lane, because any enclosure with three walls or less is deemed as a <i>carmelit</i>. According to the Torah, there is no restriction against carrying in such a domain.</i> [The requirement to enclose the] fourth side is Rabbinic [in origin]. Therefore, it is sufficient to erect a pole or a beam.
What must be done to allow people to carry within an open lane? A frame of an entrance must be erected at one side and either a pole or a beam must be erected at the other side.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling follows that of Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi in his <i>Halachot</i>. Nevertheless, there are many authorities who differ and maintain that this ruling applies only when the lane opens to a <i>carmelit</i> on at least one side. If it opens up to a public domain on both sides, it is not sufficient to erect a frame of an entrance, and a proper gate must be erected (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). The Rambam's ruling is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 364:1).</i><br>An L-shaped<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the gloss and drawings of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>.</i> lane is governed by the same rules as an open lane.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam rules that all that is necessary is a frame of an entrance at one opening of the lane, and a pole or a beam at the other end. Nothing is necessary at the bend of the lane. This follows the opinion of Rav (<i>Eruvin</i> 6a, 8b).<br>Rashi and Rabbenu Asher, however, interpret Rav's ruling differently and require that a frame of an entrance be constructed at the lane's bend, and a pole or a beam be constructed at both the lane's openings. They explain that this is necessary because, unless the frame of an entrance is constructed at the bend, a person who does not walk through the entire lane will not be aware of the pole or the beam at the other entrance to the lane. This is the view accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:3).</i>
When a lane is level, but descends on an incline to the public domain, or if its entrance to the public domain is level but it itself descends on an incline,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Shabbat</i> 100a and the <i>Tosefta, Shabbat</i> 11:4, the Ra'avad and the Rashba define this as referring to an incline of ten handbreadths within four cubits. If the incline is gentler than that, this leniency does not apply. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 363:36) accepts this definition.</i> it does not require either a pole or a beam, for it is clearly distinct from the public domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Torah, one is allowed to carry within the lane, and the prohibition is merely Rabbinic in origin. Thus, since the steep incline makes the lane distinct from the public domain (and distinct from other lanes), there is no need for any further measures to permit carrying.<br>From the wording chosen by the Rambam, however, it appears that he does not consider the incline as a wall enclosing the lane (see the Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim, loc. cit.</i>), but rather as a distinguishing factor similar to a beam. Accordingly, a person who transfers an article into this lane from the public domain would not be held liable.</i>
When one side of a lane ends at the sea and the other side ends at a public garbage dump, there is no need for [further measures to enable carrying to be permitted].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a lane that has walls on either side. Thus, it is considered as if the lane had barriers on all four sides. For the garbage dump can be assumed to be ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide. Thus, it is considered to be an added wall, and the sea itself can be assumed to be ten handbreadths deep. Therefore, it is also considered to be a wall (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 363:118).</i><br>[Leniency is granted,] because a public garbage dump is unlikely to be removed,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This law does not apply regarding a private garbage dump, because the possibility exists that such a dump will be removed at any time.</i> and we do not suspect that the sea will wash up mud and rocks [which will dry out and create a surface level with that of the lane].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the commentary of Rabbenu Chanan'el and Rashi on <i>Eruvin</i> 8a. Although both these authorities agree on the definition of the word שרטון, they quote different versions of that Talmudic passage. Rabbenu Chanan'el follows the version quoted here by the Rambam, which states that "we do not suspect that the sea will wash up a שרטון." The version of the passage quoted by Rashi (and printed in our texts of the Talmud today) states, "we suspect that the sea will wash up a שרטון."<br>Significantly, this difference in approach to this passage has been preserved. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 363:29) follows the ruling of the Rambam, while subsequent Ashkenazic authorities and the Ramah follow that of Rashi which forbids carrying in such a lane. According to this view, it is impossible to enclose it with an <i>eruv</i>.</i>
[The following rules apply to] an open lane that ends in the middle of a yard<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See the definition of the term רחבה in Chapter 16, Halachah 10.</i> belonging to many different people: If [the end of the lane] is not opposite the entrance to the yard,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Were the lane to end directly opposite the entrance from the yard to the public domain, a more stringent ruling would be applied and it would be necessary to construct a frame of an entrance. See Halachot 3 and 18.</i> it is considered to be closed and does not require any further measures at the side of the yard. If, however, it ends at the sides of the yard, it is forbidden [to carry within the lane].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that were the lane to end at the side of the yard, it would resemble an L-shaped lane. Hence, the laws mentioned in Halachah 3 would apply. When, however, the lane does not end at the side of the yard, it has no resemblance to an L-shaped lane. Therefore, the entrance to the yard is itself considered a distinguishing factor. (Note, however, Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 365:3, which require that the people whose homes open up to the lane and the yard join together in an <i>eruv</i>.)<br>Significantly, according to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, the word "forbidden" used by the Rambam, appears to mean "requires an <i>eruv</i>." This would concur with the Ra'avad's interpretation of <i>Eruvin</i> 7b which states that if the people whose homes open to the yard join in an <i>eruv</i> together with the people whose homes open to the lane, it is permitted to carry in the lane even if it ends in the side of the yard.<br>Note, however, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) which mentions that an <i>eruv</i> can never be effective for such a lane. See the explanation of this ruling in the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 365:23.</i><br>Moreover, if the yard belongs to a single individual, it is forbidden [to carry within the lane] even if the lane leads into the middle of the yard. [The rationale for this prohibition is that] at times, [the owner] may build on one of the sides of the yard. [After these improvements have been made,] it is possible that the lane will end at the side of the yard.
Permission [to carry within] a lane because a pole or a beam was erected is granted only when [the following conditions are met]:<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The fundamental principle behind these conditions is that an enclosure that is used by a private person will afford greater privacy than an enclosure used by many people.

There is no need to construct the frame of an entrance as in a courtyard.<br>The Rambam's ruling (with several additions) is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 363:26). In his gloss, the Ramah adds that it has become customary to enclose all lanes with the frame of an entrance - i.e., two poles, and a cord above them.</i>
When the length<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The length of a courtyard refers to the space from its entrance to the opposite wall (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).

If, however, there is only one house opening up to it, although it contains several courtyards, or one courtyard although it contains several houses, it is not sufficient.<br>Rashi (<i>Eruvin</i> 12b), however, offers a different interpretation, explaining that to be considered a lane, an enclosure must have two courtyards open up to it, and each of the courtyards must have two houses open up to it. This view is accepted by the Rashba and by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 363:26).</i> do not open into a lane - e.g., only one house or one courtyard does - and similarly, [when] a lane is not four cubits long, permission [to carry within is granted] only [when one erects] two poles<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which states that when a lane is less than four cubits long, the frame of an entrance is required to enclose it.

How is it possible to [make it permissible for people to carry] between two walls of the public domain through which people [frequently] pass?

(See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 364:6.)</i> causing the space between them to be considered to be a private domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The definition of a public domain is taken from the encampment of the Jewish people in the desert, and there the public domain did not have gates (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 364:7). The gates enclose the domain on all four sides. Hence, even though many people walk through it, it is still considered as "private."</i><br>[In practice,] the gates need not be locked at night, but they must be fit to lock.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Eruvin</i> 6a-b, many <i>Rishonim</i> differ with the Rambam on this point and maintain that not only must the gates be fit to be closed at night, they must actually be closed, in order for carrying to be permitted in a public domain. Gates that can be closed, but are not actually closed, are effective only in an open lane. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 364:2) mentions the Rambam's view, the more stringent opinion is favored.<br>It must be emphasized that from Chapter 14, Halachah 1, and <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 1:1, it appears that the Rambam also requires doors that are actually closed.

Therefore, if one erected poles on each corner of a square and connected them with a string above, one creates a private domain. Nevertheless, the Rabbis forbade carrying within an area fit to be considered a public domain unless it has a proper gate at its entrance. The Rambam, however, could not accept this ruling, because as stated in Chapter 16, Halachah 16, if the open portions of a barrier exceed the enclosed portions, it is not acceptable.</i> a pole, or a beam are not sufficient to make it possible for people to carry within a public domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Herein lies one of the points of controversy regarding the <i>eruvim</i> that are constructed around communities today. For few modern cities or villages are enclosed by actual walls with gates, and in practice, most of these <i>eruvim</i> employ a frame of an entrance, using telephone wires and the like.<br>As mentioned in Chapter 14, Halachah 1, and its notes, the Rambam does not subscribe to the opinion that a public domain must contain 600,000 people passing through it. Although the later Ashkenazic authorities accept this more lenient view, they also suggest that those who are careful in their observance accept the Rambam's ruling.<br>Whether this principle is to be applied with regard to great metropolises like Manhattan, Brooklyn, London, and the like which have more than 600,000 passersby or with regard to smaller communities which are considered a public domain only according to the more stringent view, the public domain must be enclosed by proper walls.

It is permissible to carry in [the portion of] the lane that is under the beam or opposite the pole.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Although the inner portion of the beam or the pole is of most importance, it is, nevertheless, permitted to carry under the beam or opposite the pole, because that area is considered to be a <i>makom patur</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 365:6).</i> When does the above apply? When these structures are constructed near a public domain.<br>When, by contrast, [a lane is] near a <i>carmelit</i>, it is forbidden to carry in [the portion of] the lane that is under the beam or opposite the pole,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling is based on Rabbenu Chanan'el's interpretation of <i>Eruvin</i> 8b,9a.

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 365:27, however, mentions the more lenient views. Furthermore, many authorities (e.g., <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 365:6) agree that if a beam is four handbreadths wide and is strong enough to support a roof, it is permitted to carry beneath it. In that instance, the outer end of the beam is considered to descend and serve as a fourth wall.</i> unless one erects another pole to permit carrying within the entrance.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In that instance, the area between the poles is considered to be a distinct entity, with walls on either side.</i><br>[The rationale for this stringency is that according to the Torah, a <i>carmelit</i> is a <i>makom patur</i>.

A pole may be constructed employing any substance, even a living entity,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that an animal used as a pole must be bound and may not be free to move.

[For example, if] a false deity or a tree that is worshiped<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 7:10-15 and 8:3 with regard to the different laws pertaining to an <i>asherah</i>, a tree that is worshiped.</i> is employed as a pole, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The leniency mentioned represents a novel concept, for seemingly it applies even when the pole is associated with the idol worship of a Jew. (A pole worshiped by gentiles can be used if the gentiles nullfiy its connection with idol worship before it comes into the possession of a Jew. If, however, it is owned by a Jew, the connection with idol worship can never be nullified.)<br>Generally, since we are obligated to destroy objects that are associated with idol worship, from a halachic perspective, they are considered as if they have already been burnt to ashes. For example, <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 1:3 states that it is forbidden to use a shofar belonging to an עיר הנדחת ("an apostate city") and <i>Hilchot Lulav</i> 8:1 states that a palm branch used for idol worship is unacceptable for use as a lulav. Since both a shofar and lulav have a minimum requirement for their length, an object that must be destroyed because of its connection with idol worship is unacceptable.<br>In the case at hand, however, since there is no minimum requirement for the width or breadth of a pole, there is no difficulty in using a tree that has been worshiped.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's explanation, for although there is no minimum width or breadth required for a pole, there is a minimum requirement for its height. Since the wood of the tree that has been worshiped is considered as though it had been burned to ash already, it lacks this minimum height.<br>(The Ra'avad, therefore, differs with the Rambam and maintains that a pole, like a beam, is merely a distinction. Therefore, no minimum height is required.)<br>Many of the other <i>Rishonim</i> differ with the Ra'avad and accept the Rambam's decision. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> differentiates between a shofar and a lulav - which must have three coordinates: width, breadth, and height - and a beam, which requires only one: height. The fundamental point of his explanation is that although such a beam is considered to lack dimensions, it exists and in this instance all that is necessary is its existence. See the notes of Rav Chayim Soloveichik to this halachah.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Eruvin</i> 80b) offers a different explanation, stating that even if the tree was burned, one could stick its ashes together and obtain a pole ten handbreadths high.</i> [The rationale for this ruling is that] there is no minimum requirement regarding the width of a pole.<br>The height of the pole may not be less than ten handbreadths.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 1:6), the Rambam explains that this height is required for a pole, because the minimum height of a lane is ten handbreadths. Thus, the pole would extend for the entire height of the lane.

A person who transfers an article from a private domain into the public domain, or from the public domain into the private domain is not liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">All the authorities agree that a person is not liable until he transfers an amount of a substance large enough to be of benefit to a person, and that it is forbidden to transfer any article regardless of its size. The commentaries question, however, whether transferring less than a beneficial amount is forbidden according to Torah law or whether the prohibition is merely Rabbinic in origin.<br>Liability for most of the prohibitions of the Torah is associated with a specific measure (שיעור). For example, with regard to the majority of the prohibitions against eating forbidden foods, one is liable only if one eats a <i>k'zayit</i> (a measure of food the size of an olive). Should one eat less than that amount (חצי שיעור), one is considered to have transgressed the Torah's commandment. Nevertheless, one is not liable for punishment. (See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 3:6, 7:15.)<br>The <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> states that this same principle applies with regard to transferring objects on the Sabbath. Although one is liable only for transferring a beneficial amount, transferring any amount is forbidden by the Torah itself.<br>Note, however, <i>Totza'ot Chayim</i> (8) and others, who explain that according to the Rambam, there is no concept of חצי שיע ור with regard to the prohibition against work on the Sabbath. On the Sabbath, a person is liable only for performing מלאכת מחשבת, "purposeful work." If an activity is not in itself beneficial, it does not serve a purpose. Therefore, it is not forbidden by the Torah on the Sabbath.<br><i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> notes that in Halachah 23, the Rambam states that "A person who transfers half of the prescribed measure [of a substance] is not liable." According to the principles the Rambam states in Chapter 1, Halachah 3, the use of the term "is not liable" (פטור) indicates that the prohibition was instituted by our Sages. Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot, loc. cit.,</i> and in other places where the Rambam discusses this issue, he uses the term אסור, "forbidden." Thus the use of the term פטור in regard to the Sabbath laws clearly indicates a difference.

In the construction of the Sanctuary, articles were transfered because they were, themselves, desired. In contrast, in this instance, the person's intent is to remove impurity.

For example, if a person transfers food, he is not liable unless it is the size of a dried fig. Even if a particular person desires to eat a smaller amount, that intent is not considered significant, since most people would not appreciate such an amount. In this halachah, the Rambam is stating that in certain instances, as in the examples he mentions, there is a particular intent which requires merely a tiny amount of a substance to be accomplished. In such an instance, the person is liable for transferring an object of this small size.</i> he is liable for the slightest amount.

See the commentary of Rabbenu Chananel to <i>Shabbat</i> 80a.</i> [The rationale is] that transferring is considered equivalent to placing the object down on a substance.<br>If, by contrast, he throws the second half,<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Even if it passes within three handbreadths of the ground, as long as it does not come to rest even momentarily (see Chapter 13, Halachah 16, and notes).</i> he is not liable unless it comes to rest on a substance [within the domain where the first half was placed].<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes on the halachah cited above, it would appear that the object would have to come to rest on a substance four handbreadths by four handbreadths, or come to rest within three handbreadths of the ground.</i>

When a person transfers a portion [of a food] the size of a dried fig with the intent of eating it, it diminishes in size, and then it swells [to the size of a dried fig] again before it is placed down, there is a question [whether he is liable or not]: [Does the fact that in the interim, it was not of sufficient size for its transfer to incur liability cause that liability] to be deferred [forever] or not?<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The question of the Rambam (based on <i>Shabbat</i> 91b) is whether the fact that the object was too small for its transfer to incur liability in the time between its <i>akirah</i> and its <i>hanachah</i> causes these actions to be considered as unconnected or not.<br>Note the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> on <i>Hilchot Sh'ar Avot HaTum'ah</i> 4:13, which quotes the distinction made by Rav Yitzchak Korcus between that halachah and the present one.</i><br>When a person throws a portion of the food the size of an olive into a house that is impure<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the presence of a corpse or the presence of <i>tzara'at</i>.</i> and by doing so, complements the quantity of food<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions why the Rambam changes the wording used in the source for this teaching (<i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>), which mentions food that is <i>terumah</i> and applies this concept to all foods. The <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i>, however, resolves this difficulty, explaining that according to the Rambam's conception of the laws of ritual impurity (see <i>Hilchot Tum'at Ochalin</i> 4:1), there is no difference between <i>terumah</i> and other foods.</i> that was already in the house, causing there to be an amount [of food] the size of an egg [in the impure house], there is a question [whether he is liable or not]: Is he liable for transferring [the portion of] food that is equivalent to the size of an olive, because he completed the measure of food that is significant with regard to the laws of ritual impurity, or is he not liable?<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries cite this passage as a source, teaching that a dried fig is larger than an olive. Ordinarily, a person who transfers an amount of food the size of an olive is not liable. Nevertheless, this instance is different, because of the laws of ritual impurity.<br>Food cannot impart ritual impurity to other substances unless a portion equivalent to the size of an egg is present. Thus, before the person threw the food into the house, there was not sufficient food there to impart impurity, and the food he threw in completed that measure. Hence, the Rambam (based on <i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>) asks whether the fact that the transfer of the food is significant with regard to the laws of ritual impurity is of consequence with regard to the Sabbath laws.</i>
A person who transfers less than the standard measure [of a substance] is not liable even though he transfers it in a container. [The rationale is that] the container is subsidiary [to its contents]; [when the person transfers it,] he is concerned not with the container, but with its contents.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Since the container is desired only because of its function as an accessory for its contents, it is not considered to be an entity in its own right. Unless the person has a desire for it itself, he is not liable for transferring it, regardless of its size. (See <i>Shabbat</i> 93b.)<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (Vol. XVII, p. 48, Vol. XIX, p. 193) focuses on the homiletic dimensions of this halachah, interpreting it as an indication of how an object's spiritual qualities are of such primacy that they eclipse totally its material dimensions.</i><br>Accordingly, if a person transfers a man who is alive and who is not bound on a bed, he is not liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling depends on the principle stated in Halachah 16: "A living creature carries itself." As mentioned in that halachah, this principle does not apply if the person is bound.

These principles apply in all similar situations.<br>A person who transfers a perfumer's box is liable for only a single [sin offering], although it contains many different types [of scents].<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Although the box contains several distinct entities, the person is considered to have performed a single forbidden activity.

Chapter 19

We may not go out [wearing] any weaponry on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., this prohibition applies to all weaponry. As the Rambam continues, there are instances where carrying such weaponry violates a Torah prohibition, and other instances where the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin.<br>This chapter represents a turning point in the structure of this text. From the middle of Chapter 12 onward, the Rambam has delineated the various factors involved in the forbidden labor of transferring articles from one domain to another. In this halachah, he begins speaking of the Rabbinic safeguards associated with this forbidden labor.</i> [The following rules apply should one] go out [wearing weaponry]: If they are objects that are worn as garments - e.g., a coat of mail, a helmet, or iron boots<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 6:2).</i> - one is not liable. If, however, one goes out [carrying]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even when hanging from one's garments - e.g., a sword in a scabbard attached to one's belt.</i> articles that are not worn as garments - e.g., a spear, a sword, a bow, a round shield<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 6:4). Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 63a) renders this term as "a mace."</i> or a triangular shield - he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling is based on <i>Shabbat</i> 63a, which mentions a difference of opinion between the Sages and Rabbi Eliezer. Our Sages rule that one is liable, while Rabbi Eliezer differs and states that one is not liable for carrying weapons, for they are ornaments, like jewelry.<br>Our Sages support their position by quoting Isaiah's (2:4) prophecy of the Era of the Redemption, "And they shall beat their swords into plowshares.... Nation shall not lift up sword against nation...." Since weaponry will be nullified in that era of ultimate fulfillment, it is a sign that it is not a true and genuine ornament.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> (in his gloss on <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:7) notes that there is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's ruling. The Talmud associates the opinion of the Sages (which the Rambam accepts) with the conception that Mashiach's coming will initiate a miraculous world order, and Rabbi Eliezer's ruling with the opinion of Shemuel that "there is no difference between the present era and the Messianic era except [for the emancipation from] the dominion of [gentile] powers." In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 9:2, and more explicitly in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 12:1-2, the Rambam explains Shmuel's position, stating:<br>One should not entertain the thought that in the Messianic era any element of the natural order will be nullified, or that there will be an innovation in the order of creation. On the contrary, the world will continue according to its pattern.<br>Nevertheless, this approach does not necessarily contradict the Rambam's rulings here. The Rambam also maintains that war will be nullified in the Messianic era, as he writes (<i>loc. cit.</i> 12:5): "In that era, there will be neither famine nor war, neither envy nor competition." Nevertheless, its nullification will not come because of miracles that defy the natural order, but because of the reasons he continues to mention in that halachah - that "good will flow in abundance" and "'the world will be filled with the knowledge of God' (Isaiah 11:9 ."</i>
We may not go out wearing a sandal studded with nails to fasten it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Ritba (in his gloss on <i>Shabbat</i> 60a) states that these nails were used to fasten the soles of the sandals to the upper portion.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah [<i>Shabbat</i> 6:2 (based on <i>Shabbat, loc. cit.,</i> and <i>Beitzah</i> 14b)], the Rambam explains that in an era of religious oppression, many Jews gathered together for prayer and study in a hidden place. When they heard a noise outside, they suspected that they had been discovered by their enemies and panicked. In the confusion, hundreds were crushed by these nailed sandals.</i> Even on festivals, the Sages decreed that we should not go out wearing [such sandals].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since these are days of public assembly, our Sages felt that wearing these sandals would arouse disturbing memories of the abovementioned incident.<br>There is a question whether the prohibitions against wearing such sandals apply at present despite the fact that our nailed sandals are made differently from those of Talmudic times. Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this prohibition in his <i>Halachot</i>. Since he mentions only those laws that are relevant in the post-Talmudic era, this inclusion would seem to imply that the prohibition should be followed now as well. Rabbenu Asher differs. Significantly, Rav Yosef Karo does not mention this prohibition in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, nor does the Ramah refer to it in his gloss on that text.</i><br>It is permitted to go out wearing a belt with pieces of gold and silver imbedded into it as kings wear, for this is a piece of jewelry, and it is permitted [to wear] all jewelry. [This license is granted] provided [the belt] does not hang loosely, lest it fall in the public domain and one go and bring it.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This reason, that perhaps an article will fall and be carried in the public domain, is mentioned several times throughout this chapter and is relevant to both men and women.</i>
A ring that has a seal<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As reflected by Esther 3:10 and other sources, in Biblical and Talmudic times men wore signet rings, using the seal to authorize their approval of documents.</i> is considered to be a piece of jewelry for a man, but not for a woman. A ring without a seal, by contrast, is considered to be a piece of jewelry for a woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries draw attention to a problematic statement in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 6:1), where he states that a ring without a seal is somewhat like, but not exactly, a piece of jewelry for women.</i> but not for a man. Accordingly, a woman who goes out wearing a ring that has a seal and a man who goes out wearing a ring without a seal are liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since these rings are not considered to be jewelry for these individuals, they are considered to be carrying them in the public domain.</i><br>Why are they liable? They did not transfer them in an ordinary manner<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Chapter 12, Halachot 12-14, a person is liable for transferring an article only when he does so in an ordinary fashion.</i> - i.e., it is not an ordinary practice for a man to wear a ring on his finger that is not appropriate for him, nor for a woman to wear a ring on her finger that is not appropriate for her. [Nevertheless,] there are times when a man gives his ring to his wife to hide at home and she places it on her finger while she is walking. Similarly, there are times when a woman gives her ring to her husband to take to a jeweler to fix, and he places it on his finger while he is walking to the jeweler's store. Therefore, [although the rings are not appropriate for the individuals mentioned above, because they do occasionally wear such rings,] they are considered to have transferred them in an ordinary manner. Accordingly, they are liable.
Although a ring that does not have a seal is considered to be a piece of jewelry for a woman, a woman should not go out wearing such a ring, lest she take it off in the public domain and show it to her friends, as women often do.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This point is mentioned several times in this chapter as a rationale for restrictions governing women's wearing jewelry in the public domain.</i> If, however, she went out wearing such a ring, she is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Although all Talmudic authorities prohibit women from wearing jewelry in public on the Sabbath, from the era of the Geonim onward, and particularly in the Ashkenazic community, it has become customary for women to do so. Among the rationales offered by the Rabbis (<i>Tosafot, Shabbat</i> 64b; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 303:18) for this leniency are:<br>a) Today, there is no concept of a true public domain, for there are no places through which 600,000 people pass at one time. Since the restrictions against carrying in a <i>carmelit</i> are only safeguards against carrying in a public domain, it would be improper to impose a safeguard against carrying in a <i>carmelit,</i> for a safeguard is not instituted to protect a safeguard.<br>[There are several difficulties with this rationale: Firstly, many <i>Rishonim</i> (including the Rambam) do not accept this principle. Furthermore, today many large metropolises are a public domain according to all views.]<br>b) The socio-economic climate of the age has changed. In the Talmudic period, most women did not have jewelry, nor did they see their friends that often, nor did they have private places in which to socialize. Therefore, there was reason for the concern that jewelry would be taken off and displayed in the public domain. When the above mentioned conditions changed, this suspicion no longer applied, and there was no reason for this stringency.</i><br>A man, by contrast, may go out wearing a ring that has a seal, for it is considered to be a piece of jewelry for him and it is not usual practice for a man to show off [his jewelry to others].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, our Sages never imposed any restrictions on men's carrying in the public domain for this reason.</i> It has, [nevertheless,] become accepted practice for people to go out without wearing any rings at all.
A woman who goes out [wearing] a pin with an eye is liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since it has an eye, it is used as a needle for sewing, and therefore is not considered an ornament. Women are liable for transferring them on the Sabbath, because they frequently sew, and often carry needles by sticking them in their clothes. Hence, they are considered to have carried the needle in an ordinary manner.</i> while a man is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">With the exception of a tailor, a man is not liable for carrying a needle stuck in his clothes on the Sabbath, since this is not the ordinary way in which these items are carried.<br>Our explanation in this and the previous note follows the interpretation of Rabbenu Avraham, the Rambam's son (<i>Birkat Avraham</i> 16). It must be emphasized that the Rambam's rulings in Halachah 21 present a difficulty to this explanation. Rav Kapach offers a resolution to this difficulty by explaining that Halachah 20 refers to a needle which is a symbol of the tailor's trade.

In one of his responsa, the Rambam deals with this issue at length.<br>In this context, note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 301:45, which states that this applies to a man, but not to a woman. For a woman, <i>tzitzit</i> are always considered a burden on the Sabbath.

Were the strands of <i>tzitzit</i> that are halachically acceptable to be considered a burden, one would be liable [for wearing such a garment] even on the Sabbath day, since a positive commandment [whose negation] is not [punishable by] <i>karet</i> does not supersede the Sabbath [prohibitions].<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements.

Chapter 20

It is forbidden to transfer a burden on an animal on the Sabbath, as [Exodus 23:12] states, "[On the seventh day, you shall cease activity,] and thus your ox and your donkey may rest."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">We have translated the verse as it appears in the Torah. The standard printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include several words that are not included in the original verse.</i> This includes [not only] an ox and a donkey, but all animals, beasts, and fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 54b explains that although the verse mentions only an ox and a donkey, the obligation to rest refers to all animals. "The Torah referred to common circumstances" - i.e., since these animals are generally those used for work, they were the ones mentioned specifically.</i><br>Although a person is commanded to have [his animals] rest, he is not liable [for causing them to work], for the prohibition is derived from a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the positive commandment of resting on the Sabbath also implies not having one's beasts perform labor.</i> Therefore, a person who directs his animal [while] it is carrying a burden on the Sabbath is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 6 and notes.</i>
Behold, there is [also] an explicit prohibition in the Torah [against working with an animal] as [Exodus 20:10] states: "Do not do any work on the Sabbath. [This includes] you, your son, your daughter, your servant, your maidservant and your beast."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is the prohibition against working on the Sabbath mentioned in the Ten Commandments.</i><br>[This means that one should not perform forbidden labors such as] plowing and the like [together with an animal]. Since this is a prohibition which is punishable by death, [its violation does not incur] lashes.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This principle (which has its source in <i>Makkot</i> 13b and which the Rambam quotes in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2) generally means that if a person transgresses a prohibition punishable by death, but for certain reasons that punishment cannot be administered, he should not be lashed instead. The rationale is that the only punishment which the Torah prescribed for this transgression is execution. There is no source in the Torah which prescribes a lesser punishment.<br>Nevertheless, within the context of this principle is also the concept that if a certain dimension of a prohibition involves capital punishment, the punishment of lashes is not given to a person who violates another act that is included in this prohibition, but is not punishable by death.<br>To apply these concepts to the case at hand: Working with an animal is the subject of a Torah prohibition. When a person works with an animal, however, he is not punished by lashes as are others who violate Torah prohibitions. Why? Because there are certain instances when working with an animal is punishable by death - i.e., when the activity is performed by a man and the animal together - for example, plowing. Therefore, even when the labor a person has the animal perform does not cause that person to incur the death sentence - for example, leading it while it is carrying a burden - he is not punished by lashes.<br>This is the interpretation of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>. The Ramban (in his gloss on <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, General Principle 14), however, interprets the Rambam's words to mean that the Torah's prohibition against working with an animal applies only to activities like plowing when the activity is performed by the man and the beast together. The only prohibition stemming from the Torah against having an animal carry a burden is the prohibition derived from the positive commandment mentioned in Halachah 1. Both these interpretations and their implications are discussed at length by the later commentaries.</i>
It is forbidden for a Jew to lend or hire a large animal to a gentile so that the latter may perform work with it on the Sabbath, since [the Jew] is commanded to have his animal rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Jew is not making the animal work himself, he is not fulfilling the Torah's command that his animal rest.</i><br>Our Sages forbade selling a large animal to a gentile,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 4:3), the Rambam emphasizes that there is no difference in this instance whether the gentile is an idolater or not.<br>Based on the rulings of the <i>Tur</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 151:4) states that it is customary not to enforce this prohibition in the present age. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 151:12 states that the socio-economic conditions under which our people live have changed, and substantial losses would be sustained if the prohibition were observed.

This activity may be prolonged past the commencement of the Sabbath. Nevertheless, since this is an infrequent possibility, and the Jew is not performing this task entirely by himself, the Rambam does not mention this matter here. (Significantly, however, he does mention it in his Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim, loc. cit.</i>)</i> A person who makes such a sale is penalized and is required to repurchase the animal, even if this requires paying ten times its worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Note the parallel in <i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 8:1.

The sale of a large animal is only a Rabbinic prohibition. Accordingly, instituting another prohibition because of it would be improper, since the Rabbis did not "institute a safeguard for a safeguard."<br>Note, however, the <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, which differs and maintains that the prohibition against selling a small animal is a safeguard for the prohibition against selling a larger one. Were this not so, the Rambam would not have mentioned the prohibition against selling a small animal in these <i>halachot.</i></i><br>In all places, however, a large non-domesticated animal should not be sold [to a gentile], just as a large domesticated animal should not be sold unless one does so via a broker.
[The following rules apply when] a person is on a journey and night falls on Friday, [but] he is not accompanied by a gentile to whom he could give his purse:<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Although we are forbidden to ask a gentile to perform a forbidden labor on our behalf on the Sabbath, as explained in Chapter 6, leniency is granted in this case. We suspect that if the person was required to abandon his money on the Sabbath, he would disobey the law and carry it himself instead. (See Chapter 6, Halachah 22, and the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 24:1.)</i> If he has an animal with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 266:4, which states that this ruling applies only when the animal belongs to him, for the verse mentioned at the beginning of the chapter states "and thus <b>your</b> ox and <b>your</b> donkey may rest."

Although we are forbidden to perform a forbidden labor with an animal (Halachah 2), that prohibition can be avoided by making sure the animal does not perform the <i>akirah</i> or the <i>hanachah</i>. There is also a Rabbinic prohibition against working with an animal that belongs to another person. That prohibition is, however, less severe than the prohibition against asking a gentile to perform labor on one's behalf.</i> he should place his purse on [the animal] while it is walking, and when [the animal] desires to stand, he should remove [the purse] from it, so that it will not stand still while carrying [the purse].

When a person - or an animal - who is carrying an article begins walking, he is considered to have performed an <i>akirah,</i> and when he stops he is considered to have performed a <i>hanachah.</i> (See Chapter 13, Halachah 8.)<br>Accordingly, were a person to place a burden on an animal while it is at rest and remove it from him after the animal has come to rest again, he would be considered as having performed labor with the animal, for the animal will have performed both the <i>akirah</i> and the <i>hanachah</i>.<br>If, however, one follows the course of action suggested by the Rambam, the animal will have performed neither of these acts. Since the article was placed upon the animal after it began to walk, it is not considered to have performed the <i>akirah</i>. Similarly, if the article was removed from the animal before it halted, it is not considered to have performed the <i>hanachah</i>.</i><br>It is forbidden for him to direct the animal, even with his voice alone, as long as the purse is on it, so that he will not be considered to be directing his animal on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rashba and others question the Rambam's ruling in this instance, arguing that since the animal does not perform the <i>akirah</i> and the <i>hanachah</i> (as explained above), what difference does it make whether one leads the animal or not? There is no possibility of the animal's performing a forbidden labor.<br>The Rambam, however, maintains that leading an animal carrying a burden is also forbidden.

Chapter 21

[Regarding the Sabbath,] the Torah [Exodus 23:12] states: "[On the seventh day,] you shall cease activity." [This implies] ceasing [even the performance of certain] activities that are not [included in the categories of the forbidden] labors.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the notes on Chapter 1, this statement has raised the attention of the commentaries concerned with how the Rambam defines the scope of the positive commandment to cease activity on the Sabbath.

Others (see the commentary of the Ramban on Exodus 23:12 encompasses holding back from performing any activity that will disturb the atmosphere of rest and peace that characterizes the Sabbath.</i><br>[The Torah left the definition of the scope of this commandment to] the Sages, [who] forbade many activities as <i>sh'vut</i>.

Since both sweeping and leveling are intended to make one's floor look attractive, it is likely that while a person is involved in one activity, he will also perform the other (Rav Yitzchak ben Sheshet, Responsum 394).<br>Other commentaries explain that the reason is that it is inevitable that a person will level an earthen floor while sweeping it. Therefore, sweeping is forbidden even though the person does not intend to level the floor, based on the principle the Rambam states in Chapter 1, Halachah 6.</i> unless [the floor] is paved with stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 337:2) follows the Rambam's ruling and allows one to sweep a paved floor. The Ramah, however, differs and maintains that it is forbidden. (See the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 337, which cites many opinions that encourage leniency.) Even those opinions that allow one to sweep emphasize that one must be careful regarding the type of broom used.

There is no suspicion that the person will level crevices, since this is not his intent.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to sprinkling water in a house to keep the dust from rising. Although there is a possibility that the water and the dust will collect and cause the floor to become level, there is no prohibition because this is not the person's intent.

Fruit that falls from a tree on the Sabbath may not be eaten until Saturday night; this is a decree lest one detach [produce].<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Moshe Cohen differs with the rationale given by the Rambam and explains that the reason these fruits are forbidden is that they are considered <i>muktzeh</i>, i.e., since picking them would involve transgressing a prohibition, one does not consider using them on the Sabbath. Others explain that they are forbidden, because they are <i>nolad</i>, i.e., the potential to use them did not come about until after the commencement of the Sabbath. Accordingly, it is forbidden to move them on the Sabbath. From the location in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> in which this law appears, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 322:3, one might infer that Rav Yosef Karo follows Rav Moshe Cohen's opinion.<br>The Rambam accepts the principle of <i>nolad</i> only in regard to the festivals, and not in regard to the Sabbath (see <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 1:17) and does not consider the concept of <i>muktzeh</i> applicable here.</i><br>One may smell a myrtle that is attached [to its bush], because the only benefit one has from it is its fragrance, and its fragrance can be appreciated even when it is attached. In contrast, it is forbidden to smell an etrog, an apple, or any other [fruit] that is fit to be eaten while it is attached [to its tree]. This is a decree enacted lest one pick it to partake of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam follows Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's version of <i>Sukkot</i> 37b. Rabbenu Chanan'el and others reverse the laws and grant the leniency regarding smelling an etrog and the like, but not a myrtle.

We may not ride on an animal on the Sabbath; this is a decree enacted<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Although one is forbidden to cause an animal to carry a burden, riding an animal is not forbidden according to the Torah, because of the principle, "a living being carries itself."

Support for this position can be derived from the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Sukkah</i> 4:6, which prohibit use of both a sukkah constructed in a tree as well as one on an animal's back on the first day of the holiday.</i> we may, however use articles hanging from an animal as a support.<br>A person<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, a utensil was placed in a tree on or before the Sabbath, it may not be removed (<i>Maggid Mishneh;</i> Ramah [<i>Orach Chayim</i> 336:1]).</i> who climbs a tree on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he climbed the tree before the commencement of the Sabbath, he may descend on the Sabbath (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).

What is implied?<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The restrictive process of unloading an animal's burden described by the Rambam in this halachah is necessary only when the articles the animal is carrying are <i>muktzeh</i> (forbidden to be moved on the Sabbath day). If the articles are not <i>muktzeh</i>, they may be unloaded in an ordinary manner, provided one does not lean on the animal.<br>From this, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 305:65 derives that the prohibition against causing an animal's suffering is not strong enough to supersede the prohibition against <i>muktzeh</i>.</i> If a person's animal is carrying a haversack of grain, [he may unload the animal in an irregular manner; he should insert his head under [the load, so that] it will be shifted to the other side and fall.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Although the grain is <i>muktzeh</i>, as long as one does not move it with one's hands, one is not violating the prohibition (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 305:24).

Regarding those that may not be carried, he should loosen the ropes that are holding the bags, and allow the sacks to fall.<br>[The following rules apply] if the sacks contain articles that might break. If the sacks are small, one may bring pillows and blankets and place them under them, so that the sacks will fall on the pillows. [This is permitted] because, if the person desires, he could slip the pillows out from under the sacks, since these sacks are small and light. Thus, one has not nullified the possibility of using a utensil prepared for use on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">There are commentaries that emphasize that this is also a leniency. It is forbidden to nullify the possibility of using a utensil even temporarily. Hence, the only reason that putting the pillows under the sacks is permitted is that there is a substantial loss involved (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 266:27).<br>Note, however, the <i>Maggid Mishneh,</i> who mentions opinions that explain that since one can remove the pillows one by one at any time, one is never nullifying a utensil from being used.</i><br>If [the sacks are large and contain] large pieces of glass, one should release the sacks and let them fall. Even if they break, there will not be a great loss, for [such pieces of glass] are intended to be melted down.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 154b) offers a slightly different interpretation of the type of glass used and the purpose for which it was intended.</i> [Therefore, only] a small loss [will be incurred],<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although the larger pieces will break when they fall, the broken pieces that will remain will also be able to be used for the original purpose.

Even though there is no way to remove the pillows from under the utensils on the Sabbath, this leniency is permitted because of the potential loss. The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 266 explains that this is a matter of controversy among the halachic authorities.</i> One may not, however, leave them on the animal [for the entire Sabbath], because of the pain the animal [will suffer].

Were he to follow his ordinary weekday practice, there is the possibility that he would press them with his hands in the container and perform the forbidden labor of collecting food.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Although the prohibition against gathering produce is explicitly stated in <i>Shabbat</i> 143b, the rationale for the prohibition is a matter of debate among the halachic authorities. The reason suggested by the Rambam is not accepted by most, and other reasons are offered:<br>a) it is possible that pebbles might be mixed in with the produce and thus one might come to perform the forbidden labor of separating (Rashba);<br>b) gathering produce is a weekday activity and its performance runs contrary to the atmosphere of peace and rest prevalent on the Sabbath (<i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 335). These are the rationales reflected in the rulings of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 335:5).</i><br>Similarly, salt or the like should not be collected into a single block, because it appears as if one is collecting food.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Torah, the forbidden labor of collecting food applies only with regard to the produce of the earth (<i>Shabbat</i> 73b; Chapter 8, Halachah 5).

A person who extracts [food from raw produce is liable for performing a derivative of] threshing. One who squeezes olives and grapes is liable for extracting.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachot 7 and 10. Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 143b, explains that the reason is that the primary purpose that grapes and olives are grown is for these liquids. With regard to other fruits, by contrast, it is not as common to use them for juice. From his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 22:1), it appears that the Rambam also accepts this rationale.<br>(Rabbenu Nissim gives another reason: The juices of other fruits are not considered to be liquids, but rather food. See <i>Hilchot Tum'at Ochalin</i> 1:4. The <i>Pri Megadim</i> and others consider these to be two separate rationales.)</i> Therefore, it is forbidden to squeeze berries or pomegranates.

Significantly, however, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) states that one may squeeze lemons. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 320:22, however, questions that decision, because it is customary in many places to use lemons for juice. A similar question applies regarding many other fruit juices that are now far more popular than they were in previous generations.</i> like olives and grapes, [were this to be allowed,] one might come to squeeze olives and grapes. It is, however, permitted to squeeze other fruit - e.g., quince, apples, and crab apples - on the Sabbath, since they are not usually squeezed.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The basis for this opinion is that even if a person desires to squeeze the fruit juice for use as a beverage, since the popular practice is not to do so, his individual intent is of no consequence. There are, however, opinions that maintain that a person is forbidden to squeeze juice from fruit if he desires to use it as a beverage.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 320:1 states that, even though the halachic basis of the first view is sounder, in places where it is customary to follow the second view, the stringency should be maintained.

It is permitted to squeeze pickled or cooked foods to soften them.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Or to prepare them to be used as food in any other way.

The rationale is that when a liquid is absorbed in food, its own identity is of no consequence. Hence, it is as if one is separating food from food. This concept is reflected in the rulings of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 320:7).</i> it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition is, however, only Rabbinic in origin. This follows Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's interpretation of <i>Shabbat</i> 145a.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> continues, explaining that other commentaries (see Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 51b, <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 320) maintain that the prohibition stems from the fact that one is bringing into existence a new entity (<i>nolad</i>) on the Sabbath. It appears that the Rambam and the Rashba do not accept that rationale.</i> One may, however, crush [snow] into a bowl or into a cup.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Rabbenu Nissim, and others state that this refers to a cup or a bowl filled with liquid. They explain that this is permitted because the water from the snow will flow directly into this other liquid and will never exist as a separate distinct entity. The Rambam does not make such a distinction, and appears to allow squeezing the snow into an empty cup. It is possible that, according to the Rambam, this leniency also applies to the pickled and cooked foods mentioned in the first clause of this halachah. See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 320:6.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 320:9) states this law slightly differently: "One may place [snow] into a cup of wine or water so that it melts."

The <i>Mishnah</i> in <i>Eruvin</i> follows Rabbi Natan's opinion. Therefore, in his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains Rabbi Natan's position.

We do not suspect that one will grind herbs.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Although a person is forbidden to perform any activity that is solely therapeutic in nature for the sake of a human being who is in discomfort, this restriction is not imposed regarding an animal's discomfort. The rationale is that a person generally is not disturbed about his animal's discomfort to the extent that he might be motivated to grind herbs for medication on the Sabbath (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 332:3; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 332:5).<br>It must, however, be emphasized that when an animal is very seriously afflicted, greater leniency is allowed. For example, one may have a gentile perform forbidden labors to save the animal. This is allowed because our Sages feared that when an animal's life was in danger, its owner would not hesitate to perform the forbidden labors himself to save the animal if he were not given any other alternative (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
A person may not cause himself to vomit food on the Sabbath. When does this apply? When he uses a drug,<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 328:39), which states that because this is a wasteful activity, it is forbidden during the week as well, unless one is suffering discomfort.</i> for he may come to crush herbs.

Sifting is one of the categories of forbidden labor.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachot 11 and 16.</i> Therefore, we may not sift straw in a sieve or place a sieve with straw in a high place so that the chaff will fall,<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., exposing the straw to the wind so that the chaff will be blown away.</i> since this is like sifting.

Hence, there is no prohibition involved. <i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> adds that here we are speaking about an activity that resembles sifting and which is forbidden by the Rabbis for that reason, but not about the forbidden labor of sifting itself. Therefore, forbidding carrying the straw in a sieve because some might unintentionally be sifted would be "a safeguard for a Rabbinic decree." Hence, there is no prohibition.</i>
A person who creates a mixture of small particles and water is liable for [performing a derivative of the forbidden labor of] kneading.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 8, Halachah 16.</i> Therefore, one may not make a mixture of a large amount of roasted flour,<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, mixing roasted flour with water is forbidden by the Rabbis, but does not violate the Torah's prohibition against making a mixture of solid particles and water. The Torah's prohibition involves adding water to a collection of granular substances - e.g., flour or cement - and mixing them until they cling together as a single mass.<br>Other authorities [<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 18a), the Ra'avad (see Chapter 18, Halachah 15), the Ramban, and the Rashba] differ and maintain that according to the Torah, one is liable for mixing any substance with water, even if its particles do not stick together.

Although bran does not produce a mixture resembling a dough,<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">When bran is mixed into water, the particles remain separate and do not stick together, as mentioned in the notes on the previous halachah.</i> it is forbidden to be mixed with water, lest one mix earth<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., substances whose particles do adhere to each other when mixed with water.</i> and the like.<br>One may pour water over bran and stir it with a spoon in all directions.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">But not in circular movement, lest it appear that one is kneading (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 324:3).<br>This ruling relates to another difference of opinion among the Sages which was not resolved and was, therefore, perpetuated by the later Rabbis. Rabbi Yosse bar Yehudah (<i>Shabbat</i> 155b) mentions that kneading involves actually mixing the dough with one's hands. Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi differs and maintains that one is liable for kneading as soon as one pours water into flour.<br>The Rambam follows the opinion of Rabbi Yosse bar Yehudah. Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi's opinion is, however, accepted by some authorities (<i>Sefer HaTerumot</i>), is referred to in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 321:16), and is preferred by the Ramah. According to this view, we may not stir a mixture of bran and water on the Sabbath unless the water was added before the commencement of the Sabbath (<i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>).</i> One may not mix it with one's hands, so that it will not appear that one is kneading. If it does not mix well, one may pour it from one container to another until it mixes well, and then give it to the chickens or the oxen.<br>It is permissible to mix bran in the above manner in one container and then divide it into several containers, giving each animal [its portion]. One may mix even a <i>kor</i> or two <i>korim</i> [of bran together] in one container.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one is allowed to mix as large a quantity as one needs for that Sabbath.

One may not [force-]feed domesticated animals, beasts, or fowl on the Sabbath in the same way as one feeds them during the week, lest one crush beans, knead flour, or [perform another] similar [activity].<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Levush</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 324), which offers a different reason for this prohibition: It represents an expenditure of effort that is not necessary to provide the animal with food for the Sabbath.</i><br>What is implied?

Similarly, one may feed fowl by hand as long as they can spit the food up.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">This issue has import within the context of the socio-economic history of the Jewish people. In Eastern Europe, one of the main sources of income for the Jewish people was raising fattened geese. These geese were force-fed during the week to the extent that they were unable to consume enough food to satiate themselves on the Sabbath unless they were force-fed. Some Rabbis allowed force-feeding them on the Sabbath, while others forbade it. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 324:27.) There are authorities who forbade the practice entirely, because of cruelty to animals, and because of the problems in kashrut that might arise.</i> Needless to say, one may place food before the animals so that they can eat.
When does [the license to feed animals] mentioned above apply? Regarding an animal that one is responsible for feeding - e.g., one's domesticated animals, one's beasts, doves raised within one's home, geese, and chickens.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 324, which draws attention to the following question: Is one Jew allowed to feed animals that another Jew is responsible to feed? Seemingly, since their owner is allowed to feed them, that same license is granted to other Jews. The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> favors granting this leniency.</i> One may not, by contrast, provide food or water for animals that one is not responsible for feeding - e.g., pigs,<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the pigs belong to a Jew, he is forbidden to feed them on the Sabbath. This decree was imposed because the Rabbis prohibited raising pigs (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat</i> 409). Therefore, if one possesses pigs in a manner that does not violate this prohibition - e.g., a gentile pays one a debt with a pig - one may feed them on the Sabbath (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 324:30).</i> doves raised in a dovecote, and bees.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, even though a person owns these animals, since they usually are left to find their own food, providing them with food is considered to be an unnecessary expenditure of effort (<i>Shulchan Aruch Harav</i> 324:7; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 324:29).</i><br>A person may lead his animal directly to grass that is still growing and allow it to eat. He may not, by contrast, lead it to [food] that has been set aside [not to be used on the Sabbath].<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Rav David Arameah explains that this is a decree imposed lest one pick up the food that has been set aside and feed it to the animal.</i>One may, nevertheless, stand in front of the animal until it turns, and, on its own accord, heads to the food that has been set aside and partakes of it. The same [laws apply] on the holidays.

Chapter 22

Although removing a loaf [of bread from the side of an oven] does not involve a [forbidden] labor, our Sages forbade doing so, lest one be prompted to bake.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 18, and Chapter 5, Halachah 19, where this subject is discussed at length. As the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 254:5) states, if one places the loaf of bread into the oven in time for it to form a crust, there is no prohibition against removing it on the Sabbath. When, however, there was not enough time for a crust to form, one must follow the instructions mentioned by the Rambam.</i><br>If one stuck a loaf to [the side of] an oven before the commencement of the Sabbath, and afterwards the Sabbath began, one may remove enough for three meals. Similarly, one may tell others, "Come and take for yourselves."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Note the parallel in Chapter 23, Halachah 24.</i> Although removing a loaf does not involve a [forbidden] labor, in this situation, when one removes a loaf, one should not do so with a baker's peel, but rather with a knife, in order to deviate from one's ordinary procedure.
Why did the Sages forbid entering a bathhouse on the Sabbath?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to the Torah, there is no prohibition against bathing.</i> Because the attendants would heat up water on the Sabbath, and say that it has been heated before the commencement of the Sabbath. For this reason, our Sages decreed that one should not enter a bathhouse<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Even one without attendants (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 326:1).</i> on the Sabbath, even to use [merely] as a steam bath.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>Shabbat</i> 40a relates, a series of Rabbinic decrees were passed regarding bathhouses. When the Sages saw that the bath attendants would heat up water on the Sabbath, they forbade bathing, but allowed the people to enter a bathhouse to use as a steam bath. Afterwards, they saw that because of this leniency their original prohibition was not being observed, and they forbade entering a bathhouse altogether.<br>The Rambam permits bathing in cold water, and this ruling is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 326:1). Nevertheless, most of the later Ashkenazic halachic authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 326:6; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 326:21) state that it is customary not to bathe on the Sabbath at all, even in cold water. As is mentioned in Chapter 23, Halachah 8, an exception to the above rules is made regarding immersion in the <i>mikveh</i>.</i><br>Similarly, they decreed that a person should not rinse his entire body with hot water<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even when one does not enter a bath.</i> - even if the water was heated on Friday. One may, however, wash one's face, hands, and feet<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Or other select portions of the body. A woman may wash her vaginal area in preparation for a <i>hefsek taharah</i>.</i> [with hot water that was heated before the commencement of the Sabbath]. When do the above [restrictions] apply? To water that is heated by fire. One may, however, rinse one's entire body in the hot springs of Tiberias and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, leniency is granted regarding open bodies of water that have been heated by the sun, as stated in Halachah 9.</i><br>It is forbidden to bathe in hot springs located in caves, for the cave is filled with hot air, and one will sweat [as in a steam bath].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 326:2 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 326:11, which favor opinions that do not accept this restriction.</i> Thus, it resembles a bathhouse.

He may not, however, rinse his entire body in cold water<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See the following halachah and notes, which deal with the question whether this restriction applies after rinsing, not only one's entire body, but even a single limb.</i> and then warm himself by a fire. By doing so, the water on his body will become lukewarm, and it would be as if he washed his entire body in warm water.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> emphasizes that in this instance, it is not heating the water in itself that is forbidden, since one is heating it to a minimal temperature. (See the following halachah.) Rather, the problem stems from the resemblance to bathing in warm water.</i><br>When a person causes a duct of cold water to pass through hot water,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a duct or pipe containing cold water passes through a body of hot water and thus becomes warm. Even if one does not take the water from the duct itself, but has the duct flow into a pool, the water is forbidden (<i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>:3). <i>Shabbat</i> 3:3 relates that the inhabitants of Tiberias actually had such a heating system constructed, but the Sages forbade its use.</i> even water coming from the hot springs of Tiberias, the water is considered as if it was heated [by fire] on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that even if the pipe was brought into the hot water on Friday, the water may not be used on the Sabbath.</i> and one is forbidden to wash in it or drink it.
A person may bring a cask of water and place it in front of a fire, not in order that it will be warmed, but to dispel its chill. Similarly, one may place a flask of oil in front of a fire so that it will become lukewarm, but not so that it will be heated.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's intent is that the water or the oil may be heated to the point that it becomes hot enough to burn a infant's belly.<br>This decision is questioned by the Rabbis. Rashi and the Rambam interpret the Talmudic passage (<i>Shabbat</i> 40b) that serves as the source for this halachah as meaning that one may not allow the temperature of the liquid to reach the point where it could burn an infant's belly. The Rashba, <i>Tosafot</i> and others, however, follow a more stringent ruling and forbid placing a liquid in a place where the potential exists for it to become hot enough to burn a infant's belly, even if one removes it before that time. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 318:14) accepts the latter view.</i><br>A person may dip his hand in water or oil and warm it in front of a fire,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 326:5) mentions opinions that differ and maintain that the restriction mentioned in the previous halachah applies not only after rinsing one's entire body, but after washing a single limb. For example, a person who washes his hands should not warm them by a fire. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 326:4 counsels following this stringency.</i> provided the water [or oil] on his hand will not become so hot that it could burn an infant's belly.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This is the halachic definition of the term יד סולדת בו.

We may not place cold water in a tub in a bathhouse<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">With this statement, the Rambam emphasizes that the tub is very hot and contains a large amount of water. Therefore, even though it is a כלי שני - i.e., not a vessel that was itself heated on a fire, but a vessel into which hot water was poured - there are still restrictions, as the Rambam explains. Implied is that even though we generally follow the rule that the heat of a כלי שני is not sufficient to cook something placed within, a tub in a bathhouse is an exception.<br>The above represents the interpretation of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>. In the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, by contrast, Rav Yosef Karo explains that the tub we are speaking about is a כלי ראשון, a vessel in which water was heated. Were it to be a כלי שני, there would be no restrictions. His ruling in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 318:11), appears to reflect this same view. The Ramah differs and clarifies in his gloss that the tub here is a כלי שני, adopting the explanation of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>.</i> that is filled with hot water, for [the cold water] will become very hot.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah 318:12 states that if the amount of cold water the person adds at one time is so great that the it will not become hot, there is no prohibition against adding it, even to a כלי ראשון.</i> Similarly, one may not place a flask of oil in such a tub, for it is considered as if one is cooking it.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 40b mentions that oil that is placed in a כלי שני does not cook. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> thus uses this as a support for his thesis that the Rambam is speaking about a tub that is a כלי ראשון. Others explain that, as stated above, even though in most instances we follow the rule that the heat of a כלי שני is not sufficient to cook something placed within, a tub in a bathhouse is an exception.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 3:15, where it appears that the Rambam maintains that if a כלי שני is hot enough to burn a person's hand, oil that is placed inside will be cooked. The Radbaz, however, explains that the laws applying to cooking on the Sabbath are different from those applying to cooking regarding <i>ma'aser</i>.</i> One may, however, place hot water in a tub of cold water.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Even according to the opinions that the Rambam is referring to a כלי ראשון, this is permitted. Although there are restrictions against pouring water from a כלי ראשון onto spices and the like, these restrictions do not apply when water is poured into other water. The rationale is that the waters mix and there is no time when the heat of the water from the כלי ראשון will be concentrated in a single space (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 318:20; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 318:78).</i>
After hot water was removed from a cooking urn, it is permitted to pour in cold water so that it will become lukewarm.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rav Yosef Karo (in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 318:12), this refers to a heating urn that was emptied entirely of hot water. One might think that pouring cold water in it would be forbidden, since the possibility exists that by doing so one will refine the metal of the urn. (See Chapter 12, Halachah 2, and notes.) Nevertheless, since this is not one's intent (אינו מתכוין), nor is it absolutely certain that this will take place (i.e., it is not a פסיק רישא), this is permitted (Chapter 1, Halachah 6).<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the Ramah accept this law, but they explain that it is also possible to interpret the Rambam's words as referring to an urn that was partially emptied of the water that was cooked in it, and then cold water was added. Even though the urn is a כלי ראשון, as long as so much cold water is poured in that it cannot become hot enough to burn an infant's belly, there is no prohibition involved.</i> It is permitted to pour hot water<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even hot water that is in a כלי ראשון.</i> into cold water or cold water into hot water,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Which is in a כלי שני.</i> provided [the hot water] is not in a vessel that was cooked on a fire,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 318:82 emphasizes that if there is a small quantity of cold water, the restriction against using water from a כלי ראשון applies in both instances. One may not pour a small amount of cold water into a large amount of hot water, nor may one pour a large amount of hot water into a small amount of cold water. This ruling is not, however, accepted by all authorities. As mentioned above, according to the Ramah, one may pour hot water into a large amount of cold water, and a large amount of cold water into hot water, even if the hot water is in a כלי ראשון.</i> since this will raise the temperature [of the cold water] greatly.<br>Similarly, when a pot is boiling, one should not place spices in it, even after one has removed it from the fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This law applies to most other substances, for most substances will cook in a כלי ראשון even after it is removed from a fire.</i> One may, however, salt it, since salt cooks only on a very large flame.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion concerning this matter among the Rabbis. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 318) and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 40b) differ and maintain that salt requires only a minimal amount of cooking and should not even be placed in a כלי שני. The later authorities emphasize that this depends on the type of salt used. In many communities, it is common to follow the more stringent ruling.</i> If one poured the food from a pot to a bowl, one may place spices on it, even if it is boiling, since a vessel into which food has been poured does not [possess sufficient heat to] cook.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">It must be emphasized that our Sages mention that there are certain substances that do not require much cooking and can be cooked even in a כלי שני. For that reason, some authorities maintain that we should be stringent and not place any uncooked articles in a כלי שני, for we are unsure of which substances are included in the category of foods that do not require much cooking. See Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 318:5.</i>
[On the Sabbath,] we may not place <i>chiltit</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 21, Halachah 22.</i> in hot water nor in cold water to soak.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's placement of this halachah in this chapter, it would appear that he sees this as falling into the category of prohibitions instituted as a safeguard against cooking on the Sabbath, and not as one of the prohibitions instituted because it is forbidden to prepare remedies on the Sabbath.</i> One may, however, soak it in vinegar. If one drank <i>chiltit</i> on Thursday and on Friday, one may soak it in cold water on the Sabbath, place it in the sun to warm, and drink it, lest ceasing to drink it cause one to become sick.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since soaking <i>chiltit</i> in cold water is forbidden only because of a Rabbinic prohibition, this prohibition is overridden because of the possibility of the person's becoming ill.</i>
When food has been cooked before the Sabbath or soaked in hot water before the Sabbath, one is permitted to soak it in hot water on the Sabbath even though it is presently cold.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This law touches on the principle, אין בישול אחר בישול, "One is not liable for cooking something that is already cooked." Although this principle is accepted by all authorities, the scope of its application varies. To focus on the approach of the Rambam and to compare it to the perspective of other authorities, it is worthy to focus on each point in particular:<br><b>When food has been cooked before the Sabbath -</b> According to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 318:4), this refers only to food that has been thoroughly cooked.<br><b>or soaked in hot water before the Sabbath -</b> In contrast to the Rambam's decision, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 318:31 rules that food that was soaked in hot water before the Sabbath may be placed in hot water in a כלי שני, but should not be placed in hot water in a כלי ראשון.<br><b>one is permitted to soak it in hot water -</b> This refers to water in a כלי ראשון that was removed from its cooking surface.

If the food is liquid, placing it in a כלי ראשון that is hot is considered to be cooking. From the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 22:2), it would appear that he also accepts this limitation.

What food may a person save?

Since one is not carrying the garments, but wearing them, we rule more leniently than regarding foodstuffs. This ruling is followed by the Rashba and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 334:8).</i> [Similarly,] one may tell others, "Come and save for yourselves."

Texts containing such teachings are also considered sacred articles and may be saved from a fire, just like the books of the Bible (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 334:12; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 334:31).

Chapter 24

There are activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath despite the fact that they do not resemble the [forbidden] labors, nor will they lead to [the performance of] the [forbidden] labors.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Chapter 21, Halachah 1, these two reasons are the source for the prohibitions placed in the category of <i>sh'vut</i>.</i><br>Why then are [these activities] forbidden? Because it is written [<i>Isaiah</i> 58:13], "If you restrain your feet, because of the Sabbath, and [refrain] from pursuing your desires on My holy day..." and it is written [<i>ibid.</i>], " And you shall honor it [by refraining] from following your [ordinary] ways, attending to your wants, and speaking about [mundane] matters."<br>Therefore, it is forbidden for a person to go<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This restriction stems from the fact that the verse mentions, "Restraining your feet."</i> and tend to his [mundane] concerns on the Sabbath, or even to speak about them<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher, in his gloss on <i>Shabbat</i> 150a, associates this prohibition with discussing matters that are forbidden to be performed on the Sabbath itself. This thrust is reflected in the decisions of <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 307:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 307:1.<br>The Rambam mentions these principles in Halachah 3. In this context, it can be noted that all the examples the Rambam gives in this halachah reflect activities forbidden on the Sabbath.</i> - e.g., to discuss with a partner which merchandise should be sold on the morrow or which should be bought, how this building should be constructed, or which merchandise should be taken to a particular place. Speaking about all matters of this like is included in the prohibition [against] "...speaking about [mundane] matters."<br>It is speaking that is forbidden. Thinking [about such matters] is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For the verse specifically mentions speech, thus excluding thought from the prohibition. Nevertheless, as the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 306:8) emphasizes, "It is a mitzvah not to think of these matters at all. Instead, one's attitude should be that all of one's work has been completed."</i>
It is forbidden for a person to check his gardens and fields on the Sabbath to see what they require or to see how their fruit is growing, for this involves going to "pursue your desires."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to the later authorities, this prohibition applies only when it is obvious that one's intent is to take care of one's own needs. If, however, it appears that one is merely taking a pleasure stroll, there is no prohibition (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 306:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 306:1). See, however, the notes on the following halachah.</i><br>Similarly, it is forbidden for a person to go to the end of the Sabbath boundary<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">2000 cubits from one's place at the commencement of the Sabbath. (See Chapter 27, where this concept is discussed at length.)<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that by mentioning "the end of the Sabbath boundary," the Rambam alludes to a concept stated by <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 150a) - i.e., that if one's field is within the Sabbath boundary, there is no difficulty and one may walk to it on the Sabbath so that one can begin work on Saturday night. If the field is at the end of the Sabbath boundary, it is obvious that one is walking to proceed to one's field. When the field is within the Sabbath limits, by contrast, it is not obvious that one's intent is to perform forbidden labor.<br>Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 307:9 quotes this law, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 307:13 questions the rationale, for the verse from Isaiah quoted above appears to prohibit walking to facilitate the performance of any activity forbidden on the Sabbath, regardless of the appearance created.</i> on the Sabbath and wait there until nightfall so that he will be closer to performing a task<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the following halachah, this refers to a task that is prohibited on the Sabbath itself.</i> he desires to fulfill on Saturday night, for in this manner he is walking on the Sabbath in "pursuit of his desires."
When does the above apply? When one goes to the end of the Sabbath boundary to wait until nightfall to perform an activity that is forbidden on the Sabbath itself. It is, however, permitted to [go to the boundary and] wait until nightfall in order to perform a task that is permitted on the Sabbath.<br>What is implied? We may not go to the boundary and wait until nightfall in order to bring produce that is still attached to the ground or to hire workers. One may, however, go and wait until nightfall in order to guard one's produce, since it is permitted to guard [produce] on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 8.</i><br>Similarly, one may go and wait until nightfall in order to bring an animal or fruit that has already been detached. For one calls to an animal and it will come even if it is outside the [Sabbath] boundary,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 306:1), which states that this refers only to an animal that is able to walk on its own. If the animal is too young to walk on its own, it is forbidden to go and wait for it, since even if there were houses, one would be forbidden to carry the animal, because of the prohibition of <i>muktzeh</i>.</i> and had there been enclosures, one would have been able to bring the detached produce on the Sabbath.<br>Similarly, a person may tell a colleague, "I am going<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">One may not, however, say, "I am riding," for riding is forbidden on the Sabbath (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 307:30).</i> to this or that city tomorrow,"<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, he may ask the colleague to accompany him (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 307:8).</i> for if there were [a chain of] huts [located between the two places], one would be permitted to walk there on the Sabbath. The same applies in all similar situations.
It is permitted for a person to tell a worker whom he sees [on the Sabbath], "Stand near me in the evening."<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Although both the employer and the employee understand the implication, since the employer is not making a direct statement - but merely an allusion - this is permitted. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> associates this with the concept mentioned at the conclusion of the first halachah: speaking about forbidden matters is prohibited, but not thought. Since no forbidden matters are discussed, the fact that they are implied is of no consequence.</i> One may not, however, tell him, "Be prepared for me in the evening," since by doing so," the person is attending to his wants on the Sabbath.<br>It is forbidden to run and jump on the Sabbath, as [Isaiah, <i>loc. cit.</i>] states, "[Refraining] from following your [ordinary] ways" - i.e., the manner in which you walk on the Sabbath should not resemble the manner in which you walk during the week. A person may, however, descend to a cistern, pit, or cave, even if they are 100 cubits deep, climb down to drink and then climb up.<br>It is forbidden to speak extensively about idle matters, as it is written [<i>ibid.</i>], "...speaking about [mundane] matters" - i.e., the manner in which you speak on the Sabbath should not resemble the manner in which you speak during the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 307:1) mentions that a person who enjoys talking about news and matters of this nature may engage in such discussions on the Sabbath, since this brings him pleasure. Needless to say, Torah scholars are encouraged to direct their attention to loftier matters (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 307:2).</i>
It is permitted to run on the Sabbath for matters involved with a mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> equates activities which involve a mitzvah with matters of communal interest. He emphasizes that it is only the prohibitions against involvement with mundane matters that are relaxed because of the performance of a mitzvah. Other prohibitions - e.g., telling a gentile to perform a forbidden activity, or performing an act that resembles or that may lead to the performance of a forbidden labor (i.e., <i>shvut</i>) - are never relaxed, even for the sake of a mitzvah .<br>As the Rambam mentions (Chapter 6, Halachot 9-10), the prohibition against instructing a gentile to perform an act that is forbidden as a <i>sh'vut</i> is relaxed when a mitzvah is involved, but only when the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 307:5) mentions an opinion permitting us to instruct a gentile to perform a forbidden act for matters of serious communal need, and also a more stringent opinion, that even forbids giving a gentile such instructions. The Ramah also notes a more lenient approach that allows one to tell a gentile to perform a task forbidden by the Torah. In practice, the Rambam's view, as interpreted by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, is accepted by most authorities except in cases where a great loss is involved. In those instances, the leniency mentioned by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> is accepted.</i> - e.g., to run to the synagogue or the house of study.<br>We are permitted to calculate accounts associated with a mitzvah,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 306:10 gives as an example, calculating the cost of a feast associated with a mitzvah.</i> to make measurements concerning a mitzvah - e.g., to measure a <i>mikveh</i> to see if it contains [the required] quantity,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mikveh</i> must contain 40 <i>seah</i> to be halachically acceptable.</i> or a cloth to see if it is [large enough to] contract ritual impurity.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Keilim,</i> Chapter 22, a piece of cloth is susceptible to contracting ritual impurity only if it is of a specific size.

The phrase cited by the Rambam is also used as the basis of the <i>Mi Sheberach</i> prayers recited for a sick person in the synagogue on the Sabbath.</i><br>One may go to the end of the Sabbath boundary to wait until nightfall to take care of the needs of a bride or to take care of the needs of a deceased person [- e.g.], to bring a coffin or shrouds.<br>[When involved in these matters,] one may tell [a colleague,] "Go to....

One may set out on a ship on the Mediterranean Sea on Friday for the sake of the fulfillment of a mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam mentions in Chapter 30, Halachah 13, generally one is not allowed to set out on a sea journey less than three days before the Sabbath so that one will have already acclimated oneself to the travails of sea travel by the Sabbath.

Therefore, if he were not able to nullify it on the Sabbath, he would never be able to nullify it in the future. To preserve this right, our Sages did not forbid nullifying vows on the Sabbath (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> One may ask a wise man to absolve [a person] of a vow if this is necessary for the sake of the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, only the vows that are necessary to be absolved for the sake of the Sabbath may be absolved on the Sabbath, since there is nothing preventing one from absolving the other vows on the following day (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>This is possible despite the fact that the person had the opportunity to have [himself] absolved [of the vow] before the Sabbath. [This license is granted] because all of the above matters concern a mitzvah.
Punishments may not be administered [by the court] on the Sabbath. Although [administering] punishment fulfills a positive command [of the Torah], the observance of a positive commandment does not supersede [the observance of] the Sabbath [laws].<br>What is implied?

He explains that it is inevitable that the administration of lashes will result in bleeding.<br>Alternatively, the commandment teaches us that no cases of this nature may be judged on the Sabbath. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 114) favors this answer, for it also resolves another problem: Why is this restriction given the status of a separate mitzvah? Since the principle that the observance of a positive commandment does not supersede the observance of the Sabbath laws is already known, why is it necessary for the Torah to give us this commandment?</i> This [verse serves as] a warning to the court not to [execute a person by] burning on the Sabbath.

A person is permitted to guard his produce on the Sabbath regardless of whether it is detached from the earth or not. If another person comes to take it, or an animal or a wild beast comes to eat it, he may shout at them and beat them to drive them away.<br>[One might ask:] This involves tending to one's own concerns. Why is it permitted? Because<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that this explanation is an original thought developed by the Rambam.</i> one is prohibited only against acquiring new property that one does not possess, earning a wage, making a profit, or seeking to accrue [new] benefits. It is, however, permitted for a person to protect the interests that he already possesses. To what can this be compared? To locking one's house [to prevent] thieves [from entering].
A person who protects his grains from birds or who protects his cucumbers and squash from beasts should not clap his hands and dance as he does during the week.

There is room to differentiate between them, because during <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> on Friday, the prohibition against these activities has not yet taken effect. On Saturday evening, by contrast, since the prohibitions have been in effect throughout the Sabbath, one might think that they need not be relaxed until the Sabbath has definitely concluded. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 342:1 rules that one may follow the more lenient view.

In one of his responsa (<i>Birkat Avraham,</i> Responsum 14), Rabbenu Avraham, the Rambam's son, explains that the Rambam changed his perspective when composing the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and adopted a more stringent view than he had originally held.</i><br>What is implied? During <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> it is permitted to climb a tree<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This is forbidden as a <i>sh'vut,</i> as stated in Chapter 21, Halachah 6.</i> or to swim across water<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This is forbidden as a <i>sh'vut,</i> as stated in Chapter 23, Halachah 5.</i> to bring a lulav or a shofar.

The present ruling does not, however, represent a change of opinion. It is referring to an instance where the <i>eruv</i> was made before the commencement of the Sabbath, and the person merely desired to move it on the Sabbth.</i><br>Similarly, if one is concerned, anxious, and pressed concerning a matter, [an activity forbidden as] a <i>sh'vut</i> is permitted during <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>. If, however, the matter is not pressing, nor does it concern a mitzvah, it is forbidden. Therefore, one may not tithe produce that definitely has not been tithed,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Birkat Avraham, loc. cit.,</i>, which states that, even though tithing is itself a mitzvah, there is no obligation to tithe at a particular time.

If that is true regarding tithing produce that definitely has not been tithed - e.g., to provide one with food for the Sabbath - one may separate tithes <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>.</i> although the prohibition against tithing produce on the Sabbath was instituted as a <i>sh'vut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Chapter 23, Halachot 9 and 14.</i> One may, however, tithe produce of which one is unsure whether or not it has been tithed.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 23, Halachah 15.

When a minor performs an activity on the Sabbath that is forbidden as a <i>sh'vut</i> - e.g., he plucks from [a plant growing in] a flower pot that does not have a hole, or he carries in a <i>carmelit</i> - the court is not obligated to prevent him from doing so. Similarly, if his father allows him to act in this manner, [the father] need not be rebuked.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's rulings here have aroused the attention of the commentaries. To understand his perspective, it is worthy to quote Chapter 12, Halachah 7:<br>Should a child desire to extinguish [a fire], he should not be allowed if he is acting on his father's behalf. If he is acting on his own initiative, the court is not obligated to restrain him.<br>Relevant concepts are also reflected in the Rambam's rulings, <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:27- 28:<br>[When] a minor eats a forbidden food or performs a [forbidden] labor on the Sabbath, the court is not obligated to restrain him, for he is not of intellectual maturity.<br>When does the above apply? When [the child] acts on his own initiative. We may not, however, feed him [forbidden food] ourselves. This applies even to foods that are forbidden because of Rabbinic decree. Similarly, it is forbidden to accustom him to desecrating the Sabbath, even regarding matters that are forbidden as a <i>sh'vut</i>.<br>Although the court is not obligated to restrain a child [from eating forbidden foods], the [child's] father is obligated to rebuke him... to train him [to conduct himself] in a holy manner.<br>According to the Rambam, the court is never obligated to restrain a child from performing a prohibited act, regardless of whether it originates from the Torah itself, or from Rabbinic decree. The child's father, however, is obligated to educate him. If the father fails to do so, the court should rebuke the father if he allows his child to violate prohibitions that stem from the Torah. If, however, the prohibitions stem from Rabbinic law, the court is not obligated to rebuke the father.<br>This explanation of the Rambam's approach is based on the statements of Rav Yosef Karo in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and on his rulings in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 343:1). The Ramah (based on <i>Tosafot, Shabbat</i> 121a) introduces a different perspective: that when a child has reached an age when it is fit to educate him in the performance of the mitzvot, the obligation to educate him falls on the court as well. Therefore, they are obligated to restrain him from transgressing Jewish law.</i>
The Sages forbade the carrying of certain objects on the Sabbath in the same manner as [one carries] during the week. Why was this prohibition instituted?<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In this and in the following halachah, the Rambam sets the conceptual basis for the prohibitions described as <i>muktzeh</i>. The particular laws that result from these principles are described in the following two chapters.</i> [Our Sages] said: If the prophets warned that the manner in which a person walks on the Sabbath should not resemble the manner in which he walks during the week, and similarly, one's conversation on the Sabbath should not resemble one's conversation during the week, as it is written, "[refraining from]... speaking about [mundane] matters," surely the manner in which one carries on the Sabbath should not resemble the manner in which one carries during the week.<br>In this manner, no one will regard [the Sabbath] as an ordinary weekday and lift up and repair articles, [carrying them] from room to room, or from house to house, or set aside stones and the like. [These restrictions are necessary] for since the person is idle and sitting at home, [it is likely that] he will seek something with which to occupy himself. Thus, he will not have ceased activity and will have negated the motivating principle for the Torah's commandment [Deuteronomy 5:14], "Thus... will rest."<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See the notes on the beginning of Chapter 21, which use this halachah as a support for the principle that the positive commandment to rest on the Sabbath is more than just a restatement of the negative commandment not to perform forbidden labor.</i>
Furthermore, when one searches for and carries articles that are used for a forbidden activity, it is possible that one will use them and thus be motivated to perform a [forbidden] labor.<br>[Another reason for this prohibition is] that there are some people who are not craftsmen and are always idle - e.g., tourists and those that stand on the street corners. These individuals never perform labor. Were they to be allowed to walk, talk, and carry as they do during the week, the result would be that their cessation of activity on [the Sabbath] would not be discernible. For this reason, [our Sages instituted] refraining from such activities,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Walking, talking, and carrying.</i> for the cessation of such activities is universally applicable.<br>These are the reasons for the restrictions against carrying [objects].<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The three reasons mentioned by the Rambam are the product of his own original thought. The Ra'avad notes that the Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 124b) mentions a further reason: lest one come to carry articles from one domain to another.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam did not intend to negate the reason mentioned by the Talmud. Nevertheless, as <i>Shabbat</i> 123b mentions, the prohibition originally instituted was partially relaxed. The reasons why it was not relaxed entirely are stated by the Rambam.</i> The Sages forbade a person from carrying on the Sabbath, with the exception of articles that he requires, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's wording implies that it is forbidden for a person to carry an article unless his act is purposeful. (See Chapter 25, Halachah 3 regarding which purposes are acceptable.) One may not carry a utensil, even one that is used for a permitted activity, without a purpose. (See also the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> on that halachah.)</i>

Chapter 25

There are utensils that are used for permitted purposes - i.e., a utensil that may be used on the Sabbath for the same purpose for which it is used during the week - e.g., a cup to drink from, a bowl to eat from, a knife to cut meat or bread, a hatchet to crack open nuts,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In many manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the text reads "a hammer to crack open nuts." A blacksmith's hammer is considered as a utensil that is used for purposes that are forbidden (see Halachah 7). Nevertheless, a hammer specifically used to crack nuts is placed in a different category. The need to make this distinction is avoided by our version of the text which refers to a hatchet.</i> and the like.
There are utensils that are used for forbidden purposes - i.e., a utensil that is forbidden to be used on the Sabbath for the same purpose that it is [ordinarily] used - e.g., a grinder, a mill, and the like - for it is forbidden to crush or grind on the Sabbath.
All utensils used for purposes that are permitted may be carried on the Sabbath, whether they are made of wood, earthenware, stone, or metal. [They may be moved] for the sake of the utensil, for the use of the place [it occupies], or to use it [for a purpose that is permitted].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the conclusion of the previous chapter, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets the Rambam's statements as meaning that we are not allowed to carry a utensil for no purpose at all, even one that is generally used for a permitted purpose. This law is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 308:4).</i><br>All utensils used for purposes that are forbidden, whether they are made of wood, earthenware, stone, or metal may be moved [with certain restrictions]. [Such a utensil may be moved] for the use of the place [it occupies], or to use it [for a purpose that is permitted]. It is, however, forbidden [to move it] for its own sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">There are, however, several leniencies suggested by the later authorities - e.g., using such a utensil for a permitted purpose and then placing it down where one desires (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 308:12; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 308:16). Alternatively, one may move it with one's feet or in a manner that is considered irregular (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 308:15).</i>
What is implied? One may move a wooden bowl to eat from it, to sit in the place [where it is located], or so that it will not be stolen. The latter is [what is meant by the expression] "for the sake of [the utensil] itself."<br>Similarly, [a utensil] may be taken out of the sun so that it will not become parched and break. It may also be removed from the rain so that it will not become saturated with water and deteriorate.

Therefore, we cannot be certain of the length of time the mother was pregnant. Furthermore, the advances in medical technology have enabled us to save the lives of many babies who would surely not have survived in previous generations. At present, it is a mitzvah to attempt to save the lives of all premature babies, even if doing so involves performing a forbidden labor on the Sabbath.</i>
It is permitted to carry a utensil to perform tasks other than those for which it is intended to be used. What is implied? One may take a hammer to crack nuts, a hatchet to cut a dried fig, a saw to cut cheese, a rake to collect dried figs, a winnowing shovel or a pitchfork to feed a child, a spindle or a weaver's shuttle to pierce with, a sack-maker's needle to pick a lock,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation of the above terms is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 17:2).</i> or a mill-stone to sit on.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, this is the only one of the examples given by the Rambam that is not mentioned in the Mishnah (<i>op. cit.</i>).

A person may carry a sewing needle that is whole to remove a splinter.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam uses this statement as proof that there is no prohibition against removing a splinter on the Sabbath.</i> If, however, its head or its point has been broken off, it may not be carried.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is no longer useful as a utensil (<i>Shabbat</i> 123a).

Nevertheless, since they are fit to be attached to their original utensil, they may be moved.<br>In the following clause, the Rambam mentions "on the Sabbath" after "before the Sabbath," because it is the greater inclusion, as explained in the following note.</i><br>Similarly, whenever a utensil that can be carried on the Sabbath breaks, whether before the Sabbath or on the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">When an article breaks on the Sabbath and it is no longer fit to be used for its original purpose, there is a difficulty. There is a difference of opinion among the Sages whether an object that is <i>nolad</i> - i.e., "comes into existence initially" on the Sabbath - is permitted or not. Since it was on the Sabbath that it first became possible to use the broken pieces of the utensils for this new purpose, it is possible to consider them as <i>nolad</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 308:14).<br>The prevailing view is that objects that are <i>nolad</i> are permitted to be moved on the Sabbath. They are, however, forbidden to be moved on a festival. Accordingly, if an article breaks on a festival, it would be forbidden to move its broken pieces even if they were fit to be used for a constructive (other than one resembling the article's original) purpose <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 308:24].<br>It must, however, be noted that the <i>Magen Avraham's</i> conception is not accepted by all authorities. Many maintain that since these pieces were always fit for use - either as part of the larger utensil or in their own right - they should not be considered <i>nolad</i> (<i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 308).</i> its broken pieces may be carried on the Sabbath, provided these pieces can be used for a purpose that resembles the purpose for which they could be used [originally].<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows the standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, even though there appears to be a printing error. To explain: In the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 17:5), there is a difference of opinion between the Sages. The first opinion of the Mishnah states that the broken pieces of a utensil may be carried provided they can be used for any constructive purpose. Rabbi Yehudah differs and maintains that the broken pieces may be carried only when they can be used for a purpose that resembles the intent for which they had originally been used.<br>Although the wording of the standard printed text follows Rabbi Yehudah's opinion, the examples he gives and the continuation of the halachah follow the other view. Significantly, many manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state "provided the pieces can be used for a constructive purpose."<br>Although the <i>Baal Halachot Gedolot</i> and other sages of the early generations follow Rabbi Yehudah's opinion, in the later generations almost all the authorities accept the other view.</i><br>What is implied? The broken pieces of a kneading trough can be used to cover the opening of a jug. Broken pieces of glass can be used to cover the opening of a flask. The same rules apply in other similar situations. If, by contrast, the broken pieces are unfit for any purposeful use, it is forbidden to carry them.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For they are no longer a utensil, and hence may not be carried, as stated in Halachah 6.

All the covers of utensils may be carried on the Sabbath, provided they, themselves, are considered to be utensils.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">With the latter clause, the Rambam excludes objects that were never used as the coverings of utensils before the Sabbath, nor were they prepared for to be used for this purpose. Furthermore, if it is not common practice to use an object for this purpose - e.g., a stone - it may not be moved on the Sabbath despite the fact that it was used as a covering several times during the week (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 308:36).<br>(See also Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 126b), who states that we may carry a cover only when it is fit to be used as a utensil in its own right.

Since it is built in this manner, the Sages apply the laws governing pits and vats to it, lest people be unable to distinguish between them. If, however, a utensil that is attached to the ground projects from the ground, its cover does not require a handle, as will be explained (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 308:10).</i> If its cover has a handle, it may be carried. If not, it may not be carried. Similarly, the coverings of cisterns and ditches should not be carried<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to covers that are not attached with a hinge, as is obvious from Chapter 10, Halachah 14.</i> unless they have a handle.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">By mentioning this law in this context, it would appear that the Rambam considers the rationale for the prohibition to be that without handles, the cover is not considered a utensil (Rav David Arameah).<br>Other authorities explain that when a cover lacks handles, its removal or placement resembles building. If, however, the cover has a handle, it is clearly distinguished as a separate entity that is intended to be handled (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 308:37; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 308:42). The Rambam touches on the latter prohibition, albeit in a slightly different manner, in Chapter 22, Halachah 25.</i> The covering of an oven [by contrast] may be carried, even though it does not have a handle.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In Talmudic times, an oven was a separate utensil whose base was attached to the ground, but which protruded from the ground entirely. Therefore, it could not be confused with a pit or a vat (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). As the structure of ovens has changed throughout the ages, there has also been a variation in the laws governing their covers.</i>
[The following rules apply when] there are two entities, one permitted to be carried and one forbidden to be carried - one adjacent to the other, one on top of the other, or one within the other - and when one is moved the other will also be moved:<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Tosafot, Shabbat</i> 43b, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 311:8) describes these laws with the term טלטול מן הצד, "carrying in an indirect manner."</i> If a person requires the article that is permitted [to be carried], he may move it, even though the forbidden article is drawn after it. If he requires to move the forbidden article, he should not move it by moving the permitted article.

Therefore, there is no prohibition involved. If, as in the following clause, the bolt is detached from the rope, there is nothing to indicate that it is a useful article. Hence, it is forbidden (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's interpretation of the Hebrew ניטל באגדו.

Although the prohibition against carrying an entity (the corpse) that is <i>muktzeh</i> will be violated in a more serious way, it is preferable to violate that prohibition (which is associated with a <i>sh'vut</i>) than the prohibition against carrying into a <i>carmelit</i>, which has its source in the forbidden labor of transferring articles.<br>Although the Rashba's view is accepted by the later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 311:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 311:9), one may rely on the Ramban's view if there is not another useful article available, and carry the corpse out without anything else.</i> into a <i>carmelit is permitted</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The corpse may be carried into a <i>carmelit</i>, but not into a public domain (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 311:5; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 311:10).<br>The <i>Tur</i> allows carrying a corpse even into the public domain; since one does not intend to use the corpse, carrying it is a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה, and the prohibition against performing such an activity is waived in this instance. The Rambam would surely not accept this premise, for he maintains that one is liable according to the Torah for performing a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה. Even the later Ashkenazic authorities who accept the basic principle of the <i>Tur</i> do not accept this leniency.</i><br>[This leniency was granted because] the honor of the creatures is great enough to supersede [the observance of] a negative commandment of the Torah, namely: "Do not swerve right or left from the words they tell you" [Deuteronomy 17:11].<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 1:2, which interprets this as a commandment prohibiting us from transgressing a directive instituted by the Rabbis.

Chapter 27

A person who goes beyond [his] city's Sabbath limit should be punished by lashes, as [Exodus 16:29] states: "No man should leave his place on the seventh day."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 321) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 24) include this prohibition as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>Having covered all the prohibitions associated with the performance of labor on the Sabbath, in this and the next chapter the Rambam focuses on another Biblical prohibition associated with the Sabbath - the prohibition against departing from one's location. With regard to this prohibition, it is also significant to consult <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i>, Chapters 6-8, which mention extending the Sabbath limits mentioned here through a convention of Rabbinic origin known as <i>eruv t'chumim</i>.</i> [The term] "place" refers to the city's Sabbath limits.<br>The Torah did not [explicitly] state the measure of this limit. The Sages, however, transmitted the tradition that this measure was twelve <i>mil</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mil</i> is approximately one kilometer.<br>There are those who interpret the Rambam's ruling here as a change in his position from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot,</i> which can be interpreted as stating that the limit of two thousand cubits has its source in the Torah itself. In a responsa, however, the Rambam explicitly states that his statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> were intended to be general in nature, to be clarified in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.<br>It must also be noted that there are many authorities (among them the Ramban and the Rashba) who maintain that the Sabbath limits are a Rabbinic prohibition. (According to this view, the allusion to Exodus 16:29 is merely an <i>asmachta</i>.) Significantly, there is an early reference in the Rambam's works (Commentary to the Mishneh, <i>Sotah</i> 5:3) which supports this view.<br>The fundamental basis for these positions can be explained as follows: The measure of twelve <i>mil</i> is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i> 1:10), but not in the Babylonian Talmud. The Babylonian Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i> 17a) cites a dispute between Rabbi Akiva and other Sages. Rabbi Akiva maintains that the Torah established a Sabbath limit of two thousand cubits, but the other Sages differ. According to the Rambam, the ruling of the Jerusalem Talmud is accepted. According to the other view, this represents a difference of opinion between the majority opinion in the Babylonian Talmud (which appears to state that the Torah did not establish Sabbath limits) and the Jerusalem Talmud. Generally, when there is a difference between the majority opinion in the Babylonian Talmud, and the Jerusalem Talmud, the majority opinion of the Babylonian Talmud is accepted.<br>The Rabbinic origin of the prohibition of two thousand cubits is universally accepted. It would appear that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 404:1) accepts the position that the entire concept of Sabbath limits is a Rabbinic institution. The Ramah, however, requires that consideration be taken of the Rambam's view.<br>Note also the <i>Tzafenat Paneach,</i> which emphasizes that all authorities agree that the observance of limits on travel on the holidays is Rabbinic in origin.</i> the length of the Jews' encampment [in the desert]. Thus, Moses our teacher was instructing them, "Do not go out beyond the camp."<br>Our Sages ruled<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, as a safeguard to the prohibition of the Torah. According to the other view, as an independent prohibition.</i> that a person should go only two thousand cubits beyond the city. [Going] beyond two thousand cubits is forbidden. [The rationale for the choice of this figure is that] two thousand cubits represents the pasture land [given to] a city.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 35:5.</i>
[From the above,] it follows that a person may walk throughout the expanse of [any] city, even if it is as large as Nineveh, whether or not it is surrounded by a wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Nineveh is used as a classic example of a metropolis because of the description of the city's size in the Book of Jonah  3:3, 4:11). Significantly, the Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i> 61b) gives Antioch as the example, and not Nineveh.<br>The entire city is considered to be the person's "place," in the wording used in Exodus (<i>loc. cit.</i>). Hence, as long as he stays within the city's confines, or goes less than two thousand cubits beyond them, he is not considered to have "left his place."<br>With the expression, "whether or not, it is surrounded by a wall," the Rambam touches on a Halachic point of particular relevance in the diaspora where it is not common for a city to have an <i>eruv</i>. There is a question if the term "city" used throughout this chapter refers to all cities, or only to those surrounded by a wall.<br>The rationale behind the latter thesis is that only when a city is surrounded by a wall is it a private domain, and fit to be described as a person's "place." When the city lacks a wall, the person's place is his individual domain. See Rashi, <i>Eruvin</i> 61b, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 396:1.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (in his gloss to these halachot, and more specifically, in his gloss to <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 7:4), explains that the Rambam does not subscribe to this restriction, and considers even a city without a wall as "one's place" even if it is forbidden to carry within it.</i><br>Similarly, it is permitted for a person to walk two thousand cubits in all directions outside the city. [When calculating these two thousand cubits, the entire area] is considered to be square, like a tablet,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">There is a difference of opinion among the Sages of the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 4:8) whether the city is considered to be the center of a circle with a radius of two thousand cubits, or the center of a square whose sides are twice that length. The Rambam follows the latter opinion, thus expanding the permitted area to include the corners of the square.<br>The determination of the limits of the city's boundaries from which these two thousand cubits are measured is discussed at the beginning of the following chapter.</i> so that [the area in between] its furthest corners will also be included.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that although the corners of the square are included, one is allowed to walk 2800 cubits (the approximate distance to the corner of the square) only when one is, in fact, pointed in the direction of that diagonal. One may not arbitrarily rotate the area encompassed by the square so that one will always be walking along its diagonal.</i><br>If a person goes beyond two thousand cubits up to a distance of twelve <i>mil</i>, he should be given "stripes for rebelliousness"<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is the punishment given for the violation of a Rabbinic prohibition.</i>. If he goes even one cubit beyond twelve <i>mil</i>, he should be punished by lashing [as prescribed] by the Torah.
[There is a question whether] a person [is liable] if he goes beyond the Sabbath limit, [travelling] at a height of more than ten handbreadths above the ground<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since a public domain and a <i>carmelit</i> extend only to a height of ten handbreadths, the Sages questioned whether or not this same concept applied with regard to the Sabbath limits.</i> - e.g., he jumps from one pillar to another - when none of the pillars has a surface area of four handbreadths by four handbreadths.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A surface less than four handbreadths by four handbreadths is not comfortable to use. Therefore, it is a matter of question (Rashi, <i>Eruvin</i> 43a).</i> For there remains an unresolved question [among the Sages] whether or not the Sabbath limits apply ten handbreadths above the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite one of the Rambam's responsa, which states that this entire question applies on dry land only. On the sea or on a river, all authorities agree that if the sea or river is more than ten handbreadths deep, the Sabbath limits do not apply.<br>The rationale for this leniency is that the laws concerning the Sabbath limits are also derived from the encampment of the Jews in the desert, and there the Sabbath limits were measured only on the land, and more particularly, in a public domain. When a domain is classified within the category of <i>carmelit</i>, e.g., seas and rivers, the establishment of the Sabbath limits is merely Rabbinic in origin. Therefore, since the case at hand - whether the Sabbath limits apply above ten handbreadths - is a point in question, we follow the principle: When in doubt regarding a point of Rabbinic law, the more lenient view should be followed. (See Chapter 30, Halachah 13 and notes, for a further discussion of this issue.)</i>.<br>[The matter is one of question only in an instance similar to the example given.] If, by contrast, a person walks on a surface that is four [handbreadths] by four [handbreadths], it is as if he is walking on the ground [even though the surface is ten handbreadths above the ground].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 43a uses the expression, "It is like thick ground."</i> The Sabbath limits apply in such an instance.
A person who spends the Sabbath in a barn in the desert,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The intent is a private domain that is located outside a city and that was enclosed for the purpose of dwelling, or that is less than 5000 square cubits (Rashba, as quoted by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). (See Chapter 16, Halachah 12, and <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 7:4.)<br>Halachah 2 emphasizes that a person's "place" can refer to the entire city in which he lives. Similarly, in this instance, since this private domain is a distinct entity, it is considered to be the person's "place," and the calculation of a person's Sabbath limits begins from the end of its borders.</i> in a corral, in a cave, or in a similar type of private domain may walk through its entire space and [may continue] to the limits of a square extending two thousand cubits in every direction [from that domain].<br>Similarly, a person who spends the Sabbath in an [open] valley<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a <i>carmelit</i> that is not enclosed (Chapter 14, Halachah 4). Needless to say, the same laws would apply in a public domain (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>In this instance, the four square cubits surrounding the place where he is standing at the commencement of the Sabbath is considered his "place," and the two thousand cubits are calculated accordingly (Rashba, as quoted by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>may walk to the limits of a square extending two thousand cubits in every direction from the place [at which he is located at the commencement of the Sabbath]. [This applies] even when he was sleeping at the time of the commencement of the Sabbath and thus did not consciously acquire the place as his Sabbath base.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This point is the subject of a difference of opinion among our Sages (<i>Eruvin</i> 4:5). There are opinions that maintain that a person must consciously acquire his place on the Sabbath. Otherwise, he is allowed to move within a square of four cubits alone. <i>Eruvin</i> 46a substantiates the opinion that the Rambam quotes as halachah.</i><br>A person who is walking in an open valley and does not know how far his Sabbath limit extends may take two thousand ordinary steps. This is [his] Sabbath limit.
When a person walks the two thousand cubits that he is entitled to walk and his limit ends in a barn, in a corral, in a cave, or in a city, he is allowed to proceed only to the end of his limit. We do not say that since his limit ends within a private domain, he is entitled to walk throughout that domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quotes sources that allow a person to proceed throughout a domain - but no further - even though his Sabbath limits end within that domain. This view is also cited by the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 408:1).</i><br>When does the above apply? When his limit ends in the midst of the city or in the midst of the cave. If, however, that private domain is included within his two thousand cubits,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">These concepts also apply in regard to a city. If it is included within the two thousand cubits of a person's Sabbath limits, it is only considered as four cubits. In this context, the commentaries clarify that when the urban area of a city is included within a person's two thousand cubits, but the city possesses some pasture land that extends beyond the two thousand cubits, the pasture land is not significant, and the city is still counted as four cubits (Ra'avad, as quoted by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> that entire domain is considered to be only four cubits, and the remainder [of the two thousand cubits] is calculated accordingly.
What is implied? If there were one thousand cubits from the place a person established as his base for the Sabbath, or from the town [in which he spent the Sabbath],<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, we have based our translation on Rav Kapach's Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, because the precise meaning of the wording employed in the standard printed text is extremely difficult to comprehend.</i> to a city or a cave that is a thousand cubits long or less, he may walk through the entire city or cave that he encounters and [continue] beyond it for 996 cubits.
If, however, [in the instance mentioned above,] the city or the cave that begins within his Sabbath limits extends one thousand and one cubits, the person may walk only one thousand cubits - i.e., he may proceed to the end of the two thousand cubits [granted] him, [but no further].
A person whose Sabbath limits end in the midst of a town may, nevertheless, move an article to any place within the town by throwing it.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, this ruling applies when the town is surrounded by an <i>eruv.

[The following rule applies when] a person is in the midst of a journey - whether on sea or on dry land - and [intends] to enter a city: If he comes within two thousand cubits of the city before the commencement of the Sabbath, even though he did not arrive at the city until [after] the Sabbath [had commenced], he is permitted to enter,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a classic instance recorded in the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 4:2.

[The following rule applies when] a person [is in the midst of a journey and intends to enter] a city, but falls asleep on the way, and does not awake until [after] the Sabbath [has commenced]: If when he awakes, he finds himself within the city's [Sabbath] limits, he is permitted to enter, to walk throughout the entire city, and [continue] for two thousand cubits outside of it in all directions.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This also refers to a classic instance that occurred concerning Rabbi Tarfon. <i>Eruvin</i> 45a states that he was on his way to a city when night fell on Friday. Unsure of whether or not he was within the city limits, he did not proceed any further and spent the night in the fields. In the morning, the shepherds found him and told him, "Rabbi, the city is right in front of you. Why don't you enter?" He indeed did so, and lectured in the house of study throughout the entire day.<br>The Ra'avad questions why the Rambam quotes the story of Rabbi Tarfon, which is a <i>baraita</i>, rather than the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 4:4. The Mishnah states that a person who was journeying toward a city, but sat down to rest at nightfall, may enter the city on the Sabbath, if he has already passed within its Sabbath limits. Although the person was unsure whether or not he entered the Sabbath limits, since he was actually within those limits and desired to be in the city on the Sabbath, he is given the privileges of the city's inhabitants.<br>If, however, the person did not have a desire to be within the nearby city, or specifically stated "This is my place for the Sabbath," he may walk no more than 2000 cubits from that specific place, despite the fact that he is within the city limits. Since he consciously segregated himself from the inhabitants of the city, he is not granted their privileges (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch</i> and Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 400:1).</i><br>[This is permitted] because his intent was to journey to this city. Therefore, he is considered to have established his "place" for the Sabbath together with the inhabitants of this city, since he entered into their limits.
A person who goes<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a person who left the city's Sabbath limits either intentionally, for purposes not directly associated with a mitzvah, unintentionally, or because of forces beyond his control, as mentioned in the following halachah.</i> even a single cubit beyond [a city's] Sabbath limits should not reenter them. [The rationale is that] the four cubits that a person is granted in which to walk begin from the place where the person is standing. Therefore, since the person went a cubit or more beyond his Sabbath limit, he must remain in his place. He may not walk except in the four cubits that begin from the place in which he is standing, and continue in a forward direction.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A key to the understanding of this halachah and the questions it has raised among the commentaries is the principle of הבלעת תחומים, the overlapping of boundaries. What this means is that when a person has a Sabbath limit already established, but leaves - either intentionally or because of forces beyond his control - he is given a new Sabbath limit in which he may walk. If the boundaries of that new limit overlap into his previous Sabbath limit, he may return there and walk freely within that limit.<br>To apply these principles to the case at hand: When a person leaves his Sabbath limits voluntarily, the place at which he stops is considered to be his base for the remainder of the Sabbath. He is granted only four cubits in which to walk. Moreover, as indicated in the notes on Chapter 12, Halachah 15, the Rambam maintains that this does not mean that the person may walk four cubits in all directions, but that he may walk four cubits in one of the four directions. Once he walks four cubits to one side, however, he may not walk four cubits in the other direction.<br>In the case of a person who willfully departs from the Sabbath limits, he is considered to have chosen the four cubits in front of him. Therefore, it is only within these four cubits that he may walk; he may not turn back in the direction of his original place at all.<br>This is the explanation given by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> for the Rambam's ruling. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions, however, the restriction imposed by the Rambam: Why must we say that the person is restricted to the four cubits in front of him? The person has the choice of four cubits in any direction. If he chooses the four cubits behind him, he will be able to reenter his previous Sabbath limits, and, based on the principle of הבלעת תחומים mentioned above, he would then be able to conduct himself as any other member of the city. Why prevent him from utilizing this option?<br>This objection - first mentioned by the Ra'avad - is echoed by Rav Yosef Karo in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. In the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 405:1), however, Rav Karo quotes the Rambam's decision. Based on the above principles, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 405:1 allows a person to return to his previous Sabbath limits if he leaves the city's Sabbath limits unintentionally or because of forces beyond his control, provided the four cubits in which he is allowed to walk overlap his previous Sabbath limits. If, however, he intentionally leaves the city's Sabbath limits, no leniency is allowed, as the Rambam states.</i><br>Similarly, a person who is even one cubit outside a city's Sabbath limits when darkness falls should not enter the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Since the person is outside the city's Sabbath limits, he is more than two thousand cubits away. Thus, he cannot enter the city unless he transgresses and goes beyond his own Sabbath limits.</i> Instead, he may proceed only two thousand cubits from the place where he was standing when the Sabbath commenced. If a person's Sabbath limit ends in the midst of the city, he may proceed [no further] than the end of his Sabbath limit, as has been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachot 5 and 7. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> raises an obvious question: Since the person is located more than two thousand cubits outside the city, how is it possible for his Sabbath limits to end within the city? [Significantly, when quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:3) omits this clause.]<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> answers that this refers to a situation in which a person was traveling to a city when night fell on Friday, and consciously decided to be considered as an individual, rather than as a member of the city. (See the notes on Halachah 10.)<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam is speaking of a second location, a town other than the one that the person originally desired to enter. The <i>Or Sameach</i> offers a unique explanation, stating that this refers to a situation where the person was more than two thousand cubits outside the city, and thus beyond its Sabbath limits. Nevertheless, there was a large cave included within his two thousand cubits. Since that cave is considered to be only four cubits, it is possible that his own Sabbath limits will extend into the city.</i><br>If one of a person's feet is inside [a city's] Sabbath limits and his other foot is outside the Sabbath limits [when the Sabbath commences], he may enter.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">He may conduct himself as a member of the city with regard to its Sabbath limits. Although the Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) follow the Rambam.</i>
[The following rules apply to] a person who left the Sabbath limits unintentionally - e.g., gentiles took him outside [the limits], he was possessed by an undesirable temperament,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">More literally, this phrase would be rendered as "an evil spirit." Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 4:1, the source for this halachah), which interprets this phrase as referring to "any malfunction in a person's intellectual functioning, whatever the cause may be."</i> or he inadvertently went beyond [the limit]: He may walk no more than four cubits.<br>If he returned [within his previous Sabbath limits] voluntarily, he may walk no more than four cubits. If [the forces that caused him to depart] returned him, it is as if he had never departed.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">And he may walk within its limits at will. Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 405:8), which follows the ruling of Rabbenu Asher and allows a person to walk through his city at will, even if he returned voluntarily. The rationale is that since this was his original Sabbath limit, it is as though he had never departed.</i><br>If [these forces] left him in a private domain - e.g., the gentiles placed him in a barn, a corral, a cave, or another city - he may walk throughout that domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance, we apply the principle that an entire domain can be considered to be four cubits. This ruling is the subject of a difference of opinion in the Mishnah cited above, and there are <i>Geonim</i> who follow the more stringent ruling and restrict the person to four cubits in this situation as well. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 405:6) and the other later authorities follow the Rambam's decision.</i> Similarly, if he inadvertently left his Sabbath limits [and entered] a domain of this nature, and became conscious of his actions while in this domain, he may walk throughout that domain.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>Eruvin</i> 43b equates acting without awareness of the prohibition involved to being taken away forcefully by gentiles.</i>

It is, however, the Rambam's view that is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 405:6).</i><br>A person who sets out on the Mediterranean Sea may walk throughout the ship and carry throughout the ship, even though he is outside the Sabbath limits that he originally established as his Sabbath base.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling also reflects a classic incident related by the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 4:1): Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Yehoshua were on a ship that left the port of Plandarsin on the Sabbath. Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar walked throughout the ship despite the fact that it had traveled beyond their original Sabbath limits. (This follows the ruling in Halachah 12, that if gentiles take a person outside his Sabbath limits, but place him in an enclosed area, he may walk throughout the entire area. The gentiles took the Sages outside their Sabbath limits, but since the ship was enclosed, they were allowed to walk throughout its confines.)<br>The Mishnah continues, stating that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yehoshua remained within the four cubits in which they were standing. Nevertheless, the Mishnah explains that this was merely a stringency they accepted upon themselves and not a binding obligation.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.:</i>7) accepts the more lenient view and allows one to proceed throughout a ship's confines. It must be emphasized, however, that this leniency applies only when there are barriers around a ship's deck.

Halachah 8 is speaking about establishing a person's place at the beginning of the Sabbath. Hence, if the enclosure is not erected at that time, it is not significant. This halachah is speaking about a person who is removed from his Sabbath limits against his will. Since we follow the principle that any enclosure is considered to be merely four cubits - whatever the size of that enclosure - he should be granted permission to walk throughout its limits, and 1996 cubits beyond it.</i><br>When this enclosure that is created without his knowledge overlaps part of the Sabbath limit that he left [an additional leniency is granted].

According to those views, the Sabbath limits are calculated seventy and two thirds cubits from the city's boundaries. The Rambam (Commentary on the Mishnah) rejects that view.<br>The Rambam's opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 398:5).

Nevertheless, the phrase "if the middle village were placed on the line between them, there would be 141 1/3 cubits [or less] between it and both of them," appears to imply that even were the distance between the two villages on the extremities to exceed 282 2/3 cubits, as long as the villages on the extremities are not more than 141 1/3 cubits from the place the middle city would take up, it is acceptable.<br>From the diagram that the Rambam drew to accompany his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 5:3), the former interpretation would appear appropriate.

Chapter 29

It is a positive commandment from the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 155) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 31) count this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.</i> to sanctify the Sabbath day with a verbal statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> states: "With this mitzvah, we are commanded to make statements... that acknowledge the greatness and glory of this day, and how it is distinguished from the days that precede it and those that follow it."<br>Although the Sabbath is by nature a holy day, this mitzvah requires that we consciously - and verbally - acknowledge this holiness. As the Rambam mentions in Halachah 6, our Sages required that this acknowledgement be recited over a cup of wine. Nevertheless, according to the Torah itself, it is sufficient to make these statements in the prayer service.</i> as [implied by Exodus 20:8]: "Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it" - i.e., remember it with [words of] praise [that reflect its] holiness.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 12:3, this mitzvah is incumbent on women as well as on men. This concept is derived as follows: In the first mention of the Ten Commandments (Exodus, Chapter 20), we are commanded to "remember" (<i>zachor</i>) the Sabbath. In Moses' review of that event (Deuteronomy, Chapter 5), however, he uses the expression, <i>shamor</i>, "observe."<br><i>Sh'vuot</i> 20b teaches that these two terms were related by God "in a single breath" - i.e., they are two complementary expressions of respect for the Sabbath. Accordingly, all the individuals obligated to keep the mitzvah of "Observe" must also keep the mitzvah of "Remember." Since women are obligated to keep the mitzvah of "Observe" - i.e., to adhere to the prohibitions against forbidden labor - they are also obligated to "Remember" the Sabbath (<i>Berachot</i> 20b).</i><br>This remembrance must be made at the Sabbath's entrance and at its departure: at the [day's] entrance with the <i>kiddush</i> that sanctifies the day, and at its departure with <i>havdalah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam clearly states in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), his intent is that the mitzvah of remembering the Sabbath encompasses both <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdalah</i>. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> cites opinions that maintain that the mitzvah to "remember the Sabbath" applies only at the commencement of the Sabbath, but not at its conclusion. According to this view, the obligation to recite <i>havdalah</i> is Rabbinic in origin, without any connection to the Biblical commands, "Remember" and "Observe."<br>Among the practical distinction between these two approaches is the conception of a woman's obligation to recite <i>havdalah</i>. According to the Rambam, there is no difference between a woman's obligation and that of a man. The other view, by contrast, allows for the conception that women are not obligated to recite the <i>havdalah</i> prayer.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 296:8) cites both opinions (but appears to favor the Rambam's view). The Ramah suggests that a woman should fulfill her obligation by listening to a man's recitation of this prayer. When this is not possible, a woman should recite the <i>havdalah</i> herself. A man who has fulfilled his obligation should not, however, recite the prayer for the sake of a woman (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 296:19; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 296:35-36).</i>

By ceasing work every week, they recall God's kindness in delivering them.<br>The Ramban (in his Commentary on the Torah, Deuteronomy 5:15  offers a different explanation. The exodus from Egypt expresses God's infinite power. If a person doubts the narrative of creation, he can resolve those questions by considering the historical evidence of the miracles of the exodus.</i> For You have chosen us and sanctified us from among all the nations. With love and favor You have granted us Your holy Sabbath as an inheritance.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Herein, there is a unique homiletic point. God's choice of the Jewish people is expressed, not in granting them dominion over other nations or bestowing inordinate resources of wealth and prosperity upon them, but rather in granting them the Sabbath and its atmosphere of holiness and peace.<br>Rav Zerachiah HaLevi notes that the three times God's desire and favor are mentioned this passage refer to the three dimensions of the Jews' connection with the Sabbath: the Sabbath of creation, the Sabbath of the exodus, and "the age that is all Sabbath and rest for life everlasting" - i.e., the era of the Redemption.</i> Blessed are You, God, who sanctifies the Sabbath.<br>
This is the text of the <i>havdalah</i> prayer:<br>Blessed are You God, our Lord, King of the universe, who distinguishes between the holy and the mundane, between light and darkness, between Israel and the nations, and between the seventh day and the six days of activity.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">All four of the distinctions mentioned are reflected in the transition from the Sabbath to the weekdays.

Also, the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> states that a person who has eaten before reciting <i>havdalah</i> may no longer recite this prayer from Sunday onward. Although the later authorities do not accept these views, they do urge that the recitation of <i>havdalah</i> not be delayed any later than necessary.</i> [if he does not fulfill his obligation beforehand].<br>[Although the <i>havdalah</i> blessing may be recited at a later time,] one should recite the blessing on a flame only on Saturday night.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing over a flame was incorporated into the <i>havdalah</i> ceremony to commemorate the discovery of fire by Adam directly after the conclusion of the first Sabbath.

For <i>Pesachim</i> 102b states, as the Rambam himself quotes in the following halachah, "we do not observe mitzvot in bundles" - i.e., one cup of wine should not be used to fulfill two separate mitzvot.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> offers a possible resolution for the Rambam's ruling: The above principle applies only when the two mitzvot are connected with two different times - e.g., <i>kiddush</i> and grace, as mentioned in the subsequent halachah. For grace is associated with the preceding meal, and <i>kiddush</i> with the Sabbath day that will follow. In contrast, in the present halachah, both <i>havdalah</i> and grace are associated with the previous time - the Sabbath - and the previous meal. Nevertheless, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> himself agrees with the Ra'avad that the Rambam's ruling should be followed only in a situation where one does not have another cup of wine available. This opinion is also quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 299:4) and accepted by the later authorities.<br>[Rav Kapach offers another justification for the Rambam's ruling, based on the final phrase of the following halachah, which states that both <i>kiddush</i> and grace are "mitzvot of the Torah." <i>Havdalah</i>, Rav Kapach explains, is Rabbinic in origin and therefore can be combined with grace and recited over a single cup. Although this resolution appears closest to the Rambam's wording in these two halachot, it is difficult to reconcile with the Rambam's statements at the beginning of the chapter and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 155) that the mitzvah of reciting <i>havdalah</i> has its source in the Torah itself.]</i> If he is sitting and drinking,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For drinking - even drinking wine - is not considered significant enough to override the obligation to recite <i>havdalah</i>.</i> he should interrupt his drinking,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">He must stop drinking at sunset (or half an hour before the appearance of the stars), but preferably should not recite <i>havdalah</i> until after the appearance of three stars.</i>recite <i>havdalah</i>, and begin drinking again.
A person who is eating and completes his meal at the commencement of the Sabbath should recite grace first and then recite <i>kiddush</i> on a second cup of wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 271:6) also quotes the opinion of Rabbenu Asher, and states that reciting grace in such a situation generates several doubts: whether or not to mention the Sabbath in grace, whether or not to partake of the cup over which grace was recited, and whether or not a second meal is required so that <i>kiddush</i> will be "in the place of a meal."<br>Therefore, it is preferable to recite <i>kiddush</i> in the midst of the meal, as mentioned in the previous halachah, to eat a small amount on the Sabbath, and then to recite grace. The Ramah suggests following this view.</i> He should not recite grace and <i>kiddush</i> on the same cup [of wine], because two mitzvot should not be performed with the same cup [of wine].<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">See the notes on the previous halachah.</i> For both the mitzvah of <i>kiddush</i> and the mitzvah of grace are mitzvot that emanate from the Torah itself.

Nevertheless, such wine is unacceptable for <i>kiddush</i>, because using it for a mitzvah is not considered respectful (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 272:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 272:3).</i>or wine that was cooked.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In this instance as well, there are many authorities who differ with the Rambam and permit the use of such wine, based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>loc. cit.</i>).

Just as we recite <i>kiddush</i> on Friday night and <i>havdalah</i> on Saturday night, so too, we recite <i>kiddush</i> on the night of a holiday's commencement and <i>havdalah</i> on the night following a holiday and on the night following Yom Kippur, for they are all "Sabbaths of God."<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's description of the holidays as "Sabbaths of God," he appears to be implying that the mitzvah of reciting <i>kiddush</i> on these days is included in the mitzvah to "remember the Sabbath," which is the source for the mitzvah of reciting <i>kiddush</i> on the Sabbath. A similar intent appears in the comments of the <i>Mechilta</i> on that verse.<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 271:1 cites the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> as differing with this interpretation and stating that the obligation to recite <i>kiddush</i> on holidays is Rabbinic in origin.</i><br>We recite <i>havdalah</i> on the night leading from a holiday to <i>chol hamo'ed</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>chol hamo'ed</i> has a lesser level of holiness, since the prohibitions against performing the forbidden labors do not apply.

Since the uniqueness of the Sabbath was established before these events, it takes primacy. The festivals, by contrast, were established to commemorate those events that are directly associated with God's choice of the Jewish people.<br>Significantly, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> mention a slightly different text for this blessing. Instead of beginning "who has chosen us," it begins "who has sanctified us."</i> from all the nations, and raised us above people of all tongues.

On the night of a holiday, one recites <i>kiddush</i> over wine as on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This law appears to corroborate the thesis that the Rambam sees <i>kiddush</i> on the holidays as an obligation with a source in the Torah itself. Therefore, he clarifies that just as Halachah 6 states that the Sages instituted the obligation that <i>kiddush</i> be recited over wine on the Sabbath, they imposed a similar obligation on holidays.</i> Should one lack wine or should one desire bread, one may recite <i>kiddush</i> over bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 9.</i> Similarly, on [the day of a] holiday, one should recite "the great <i>kiddush</i>" as one does on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 10.</i>
What blessings should be recited on the night of a holiday that falls on a Sunday? At the outset, one recites the blessing [<i>borey pri] hagefen</i>.

This also applies to the mitzvah of observing the festivals. Needless to say, on Yom Kippur the blessing is recited in the synagogue, and not during <i>kiddush</i>. On Yom Kippur, women should recite this blessing while lighting candles and should not repeat it in the synagogue.</i> We do not recite the blessing <i>Shehecheyanu</i> on the seventh day of Pesach, because it is not a holiday in its own right,<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Shemini Atzeret is, by contrast, considered to be a festival in its own right (<i>Sukkah</i> 47a), and we recite the blessing <i>Shehecheyanu</i> on that day and on Simchat Torah.</i> and we have already recited the blessing <i>Shehecheyanu</i> at the beginning of the Pesach festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sukkah</i> 47b, which states that this wording implies that a person who failed to recite <i>Shehecheyanu</i> on the first day of the festival may compensate by reciting it later.</i>
This is the order of <i>havdalah</i> on Saturday night: [First,] one recites the blessing over the wine;<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, the Rambam does not mention the custom of reciting the passage containing select Biblical verses beginning <i>Hiney E-l Yeshuati</i>.</i> afterwards, one recites the blessing over the spices,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 29.</i> and then over the flame.<br>Which blessing is recited over the flame?

With regard to a gentile's flame, it offers another reasoning: because the gentile's flame has not rested on the Sabbath. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam also quotes Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's view. In these halachot, however, he mentions this principle only in Halachah 27, appearing to indicate that the need for a candle to "rest" on the Sabbath applies only to candles lit by Jews. Since the gentiles are not bound by the Sabbath laws, this principle does not apply to them at all.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:5) quotes Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's view and forbids using a candle that a gentile lit during the day.

According to the Rambam, however, the meaning is that since a Jew is involved, there is no intention for the worship of false divinities.</i> [If, however,] a gentile [lights a flame] from another gentile's [flame], we may not recite a blessing upon it.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, it would appear that we suspect that the gentiles lit the flame for the sake of worshiping their divinities.<br>In contrast, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 298:11 states that this is a decree, lest the gentile light from a flame kindled on the Sabbath directly after the Sabbath's conclusion.

When, however, those purposes have been accomplished and the flames continue burning, one may recite the blessing over them.</i> If coals [are glowing to the extent that] were one to put a sliver of wood between them, they would catch fire of their own accord, we may recite a blessing over them.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:9), which states that this law applies only when the fire was kindled for the purpose of producing light.

Chapter 30

There are four [dimensions] to the [observance of] the Sabbath: two originating in the Torah, and two originating in the words of our Sages, which are given exposition by the Prophets. [The two dimensions originating] in the Torah are the commandments "Remember [the Sabbath day]"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This involves the sanctification of the Sabbath, as explained in the previous chapter.</i> and "Observe [the Sabbath day]."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This involves the prohibition against labor on the Sabbath, as reflected in the first 24 chapters of this text.<br>In the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. II, Chapter 31), the Rambam explains that the commandment to remember the Sabbath commemorates the Sabbath of creation and the holiness that the Sabbath brings into the world. The commandment to observe the Sabbath reflects the connection to the exodus from Egypt and thus emphasizes the dimension connected with the cessation of labor.</i><br>[The two dimensions] given exposition by the Prophets are honor and pleasure<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The explanation of these two dimensions is the subject of this final chapter of the Sabbath laws.<br>The Ramban (in his commentary on Leviticus 23:3  considers the honor of the Sabbath and the delight in it as required by the Torah itself. For the Torah (<i>ibid.</i>) describes the Sabbath as a "holy convocation," and the <i>Sifra</i> explains that that term implies that the day must "be sanctified, honored... and delighted in."</i>, as [Isaiah 58:13] states: "And you shall call the Sabbath 'A delight, sanctified unto God and honored.'
What is meant by honor? This refers to our Sages' statement that it is a mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is not an absolute obligation. One who fulfills it receives a reward, but one who does not is not punished (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 260:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 260:1).</i> for a person to wash his face, his hands, and his feet<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Shabbat</i> 25b. Note the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 260), which mentions that a person should wash his entire body. The Rambam's decision is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 260:1), while the <i>Tur's</i> ruling is quoted by the Ramah.</i> in hot water on Friday in honor of the Sabbath. He should wrap himself in <i>tzitzit</i> and sit with proper respect, waiting to receive the Sabbath as one goes out to greet a king.<br>The Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 119a describes Rabbi Chanina as following this practice.</i> of the former generations would gather their students together on Friday, wrap themselves [in fine robes] and say, "Come, let us go out and greet the Sabbath, the king.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Our text of <i>Shabbat</i> 119a reads "Sabbath, the queen," and indeed, this analogy is employed extremely frequently. From the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> commentary, it appears that the Rambam's version of that passage reads, "Sabbath, the king." According to the kabbalah, the feminine term is more appropriate, because the Sabbath is associated with the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Malchut,</i> which reflects a feminine dimension.</i>
Among the ways of honoring the Sabbath is wearing a clean garment.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See also the <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> (quoted in the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 262:6), which emphasizes that a person must also endeavor to keep his clothes clean. For example, he should not hold a child until he covers his clothes.</i> One's Sabbath garments should not resemble one's weekday clothes. A person who does not have a different garment for the Sabbath should allow his robe to hang low,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As is the fashion of the wealthy. (See <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 5:9.)</i> so that his [Sabbath] clothing will not resemble the clothes he wears during the week.<br>Ezra ordained that the people launder their clothes on Thursday<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">But not on Friday, so that they will have time to engage in other Sabbath preparations (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 242:3).</i> as an expression of honor for the Sabbath.
In respect for the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Two reasons are given: a) to enter Sabbath with an appetite (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 249:2), b) to allow oneself time for Sabbath preparations (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 249:4).</i> it is forbidden to plan a meal or a winefest for Friday.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one should not arrange to hold a feast on Friday that one would not hold ordinarily during the week (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). This includes even feasts associated with a mitzvah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>). One may, however, hold a feast associated with a mitzvah that should be performed on that day - e.g., a circumcision or the redemption of the first-born (Ramah, <i>loc. cit.</i>). These feasts should be held as early as possible, and by no means should begin later than 3:00 PM (or the equivalent time according to the principle of "seasonal hours"), as will be explained.<br>Although the Ra'avad differs with the Rambam regarding this prohibition, the explanation offered above is accepted by most authorities.</i><br>[According to the letter of the law,] one may eat or drink until nightfall. Nevertheless, as an expression of honor for the Sabbath, a person should refrain from planning a meal<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to an ordinary meal that one might partake of during the week. Although one is not required to refrain from eating, one should preferably not plan to eat a meal at this time (<i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>).</i> for [mid]afternoon on,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prohibition begins nine "seasonal" hours after daybreak. Thus, on a day that begins at 6:00 AM and concludes at 6:00 PM, the time would be 3:00 PM.

A person should prepare his table on Friday, even if he is [to partake] only [of an amount of food] equivalent to the size of an olive.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even if the quantity of food the person eats is not great, he should prepare his table as if he is to partake of a distinguished meal.</i> Similarly, a person should prepare his table on Saturday night,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the <i>melaveh malkah</i> meal that should be eaten at a table set in the same manner as at all the other Sabbath meals (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 300:1).</i> even if he is [to partake] only [of an amount of food] equivalent to the size of an olive. [In this manner,] he shows his respect for the Sabbath when it enters and when it departs.<br>One should prepare one's house while it is still day as an expression of respect for the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Nimukei Maharai,</i> which emphasizes that כבוד ("honor") appears to refer to activities that are performed in preparation for the Sabbath, while ענג ("delight") to the appreciation of pleasure on the Sabbath itself. Note, however, the Ramah's gloss on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 262:1). There the Ramah emphasizes that one should keep one's table attractively set throughout the entire Sabbath, implying that although honoring the Sabbath begins with preparing for it on Friday, the mitzvah continues throughout the day.</i> There should be a lamp burning,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5 for a detailed discussion of the mitzvah of lighting Sabbath lights.</i> a table prepared [with food] to eat, and a couch bedecked with spreads.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In Talmudic times, people would recline on couches while eating, and this is the intent here. The word מטה also means "bed," and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 262:2 writes that it is appropriate that the beds of the house be made before the commencement of the Sabbath.</i> All of these are expressions of honor for the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 119b relates that a person returning home from the synagogue is accompanied by two angels, one with positive tendencies and the other with negative tendencies. When they enter the home and see it prepared for the Sabbath, even the angel with negative tendencies is forced to give his blessing that this setting be repeated in the week to come.</i>
Even a very important person who is unaccustomed to buying items at the marketplace or to doing housework is required to perform tasks to prepare by himself for the Sabbath. This is an expression of his own personal honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., rather than think that involving himself in such activities will be demeaning, he should appreciate that these deeds will enhance his honor. Even if it is possible to have others perform these tasks for one, it is preferable to carry out certain deeds oneself. For there is nothing more honorable than to give honor to the Sabbath. In this context, Rabbenu Chanan'el refers to <i>Kiddushin</i> 41a, "It is more of a mitzvah [to perform a positive action] oneself, rather than [to charge] an agent [with its performance]."</i><br>The Sages of the former generations<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The examples quoted by the Rambam are taken from the description (<i>Shabbat</i> 119a) of the manner in which certain of the leading Sages of Babylonia would prepare for the Sabbath.</i> [would involve themselves in such activities]: There was one who would chop wood to cook with, one who would salt meat, one would braid wicks, and one who would kindle the lamps. Others would go out and purchase food and beverages for the Sabbath, even though this was not their ordinary practice. The more one involves oneself in such activities, the more praiseworthy it is.
What is meant by [Sabbath] delight? This refers to our Sages' statement<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As a source, the commentaries point to <i>Shabbat</i> 118b, which states: "How should one delight in the Sabbath? With a dish of beets, large fish, and garlic heads."</i> that a person must prepare a particularly sumptuous dish and a pleasantly flavored beverage for the Sabbath. All of this must be done within the context of a person's financial status.<br>The more one spends [both financially,] in expenses undertaken for the Sabbath and [in effort,] in the preparation of many good foods, the more praiseworthy it is.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">One should not worry about the expense, for <i>Beitzah</i> 16a teaches that a person's income is fixed at the beginning of the year, with the exception of the money that he spends to honor the Sabbath and the festivals. A person need not be concerned with the cost of "honoring the Sabbath," since he will be recompensed for the expense by an increase in his earnings</i> If, however, this is not within one's [financial] capacity, even if one merely stews food or the like in honor of the Sabbath, this is considered to be Sabbath delight.<br>One is not obligated to strain oneself<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 242:1), which states that one should earnestly endeavor to provide generously for the Sabbath and, if necessary, minimize one's expenditures during the week to do so.</i> or to borrow from others<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 242:3 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 242:3, which state that if possible - even if this entails pawning property - one should borrow to enhance one's Sabbath meals. One may rest assured that ultimately one will be able to repay these debts. <i>Beitzah</i> 15b states that God promises, "Take a loan on My account. I will repay."<br>According to this view, the directive "Make your Sabbaths as weekdays..." applies only when a person has no property to pawn and will not be given a loan on any other terms.</i> in order to prepare more food for the Sabbath. The Sages of the former generations said,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 113a; <i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i></i> "Make your Sabbaths as weekdays, but do not depend on others."
A person who is indulgent and wealthy and conducts all his days as Sabbaths must also partake of different foods on the Sabbath from those of which he partakes during the week. If [his fare] cannot be changed, he should [at least] change the time at which he eats [his meals]. [For example,] if he usually eats early, he should eat later.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">He should not, however, delay his meals for a lengthy period of time, so that he will not experience discomfort on the Sabbath (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 288:12).</i> If he usually eats late, he should eat earlier.
A person is obligated to eat three meals on the Sabbath:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 8:7), the Rambam cites <i>Shabbat</i> 117b, which states that this obligation stems from the fact that when describing the manna, Exodus 16:25 mentions the word היום, "today," three times. In the verse, "today" refers to the Sabbath, and its threefold repetition indicates that three meals should be eaten on that day.</i> one in the evening, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that with these words, the Rambam is emphasizing that a person who does not eat his meals at these times does not fulfill the mitzvah of eating three Sabbath meals. Although the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> maintains that the times when one partakes of these meals is not significant, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 291:1) rules according to the concept explained by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>.</i> One should be extremely careful regarding these three meals, not to eat any less. Even a poor man who derives his livelihood from charity should eat three meals [on the Sabbath].<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This directive is addressed, not only to the poor person himself, but to the administrators of the communal charity funds, as reflected in the Rambam's ruling, <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 7:8.</i><br>[Nevertheless,] a person who is sick from overeating, or one who fasts constantly is not obligated to partake of three meals.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since the obligation to eat stems from the command to delight in the Sabbath, it is not applicable to these individuals, who will suffer discomfort from eating further. Note, however, the wording of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>): "A person who cannot eat at all is not obligated to cause himself discomfort."</i><br>All these three meals must be significant [sittings] at which wine is served;<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation is based on the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh,</i> which differs with the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 291) in the interpretation of the Rambam's words. The <i>Tur</i> maintains that the Rambam requires the recitation of <i>kiddush</i> before the third meal as well. Almost all the commentaries accept the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> view.</i> at each,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this ruling is that the obligation to eat three meals is derived from a verse describing the manna, and the manna was described as "bread" (Exodus 16:15 .<br>Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:4) quotes the Rambam's ruling, the Ramah adds in his gloss that there are opinions that maintain that a single complete loaf is sufficient. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> continues (<i>loc. cit.</i>:5), mentioning other views that allow one to fulfill his obligation by eating foods other than bread. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> favors the Rambam's ruling, the later authorities agree that a person who is unable to eat a third meal of bread may fulfill his obligation by eating other foods (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 291:7).</i> one must break bread on two full loaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This obligation stems from the fact that the manna did not descend on the Sabbath, and a double portion of manna descended on the previous day. To commemorate this <i>lechem mishneh</i> (Exodus 16:22 , a double portion of bread is placed on the table on the Sabbath.</i>The same applies regarding the holidays.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Most authorities interpret the Rambam's intent to be that one is obligated to break bread on two complete loaves on the holidays. [The rationale being that the manna did not descend on the holidays as well, and a double portion of manna descended on the previous day (<i>Mechilta</i>).] The <i>Tur</i>, by contrast, interprets the Rambam as requiring one to partake of three meals on the holidays as well.</i>
Eating meat and drinking wine on the Sabbath is a form of pleasure for a person,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 242:2 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 242:1, which state that there is no obligation <i>per se</i> to partake of meat, fish, or wine on the Sabbath. The intent is to eat foods that give one pleasure. It has become customary to serve these foods because most people derive pleasure from them.</i> provided this is within his [financial] capacity.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This reiterates the theme mentioned in Halachah 7, that one should not overextend oneself financially to provide for the Sabbath. The wording used by the Rambam here also allows us to appreciate the rationale for this ruling: Since the person will be putting himself under undue financial pressure, he will not derive pleasure from this indulgence.</i><br>On the Sabbaths and holidays, a significant meal at which wine will be served is forbidden to be scheduled for the time the house of study is in session.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This would prevent one from attending the house of study. (See <i>Gittin</i> 38b, which states that holding a meal at this time will lead to business misfortune.)</i> Instead, the practice of the righteous of the former generations would be as follows: A person would recite the morning service and the additional service in the synagogue. Afterwards, he would return home and partake of the second [Sabbath] meal. He would then proceed to the house of study, to read [from the Written Law] and to study [the Oral Law] until the afternoon, at which time he would recite the afternoon service. He would then [partake of] the third [Sabbath] meal, a significant [sitting] at which wine is served, and continue eating and drinking until the Sabbath passed.
It is forbidden for a person to travel more than three <i>parsa'ot</i> from the beginning of the day on Friday. [This restriction was adopted] so that one will arrive home early in the day and prepare one's Sabbath meals. [One may not rely on] the members of one's household to prepare for him, [for they] do not know that one will arrive on this day.<br>Needless to say, [this restriction applies] when one is visiting others, since [by arriving unexpectedly,] one will embarrass them, for they will not have made the preparations appropriate for hosting guests.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In the present age, when travel and communication have advanced considerably, we need not hold rigidly to this halachah. The principle that it teaches, however - that one should not drop in suddenly on one's family and surely, on others - is definitely a significant ethical point.<br>Note, however, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 249:4 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 249:3, which state that at present, since people usually prepare generously for the Sabbath meals, there is no difficulty in coming unexpectedly if this cannot be avoided.<br>Another related point is also worth keeping in mind. Although long distance travel has been greatly facilitated in the present age, one should always plan to arrive several hours before the Sabbath, lest one be held back by forces beyond one's control.</i>
It is forbidden to fast,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Radbaz (Vol. IV, Responsum 1266), who quotes the Rashba as stating that this prohibition has its source in the Torah itself.</i> to cry out [to God], to offer supplication, or to entreat [His] mercy on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In one of the Rambam's responsa, he explains that although prayer and supplication are revered media of divine service, on the Sabbath our service of God is channeled through a higher medium: rest and spiritual pleasure. As such, prayer and supplication are not appropriate.</i> Even when [a community is beset] by a distressing circumstance that would ordinarily require the community to fast and sound the trumpets,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Ta'aniot</i> 1:1, the Rambam writes that one of the Torah's commandments is to cry out to God and sound the trumpets at a time of communal distress. He continues in Halachah 4, stating that our Sages required the community to fast on such occasions. In addition to drought, the Rambam mentions several other situations in <i>Hilchot Ta'aniot</i>, Chapter 3, which are described as times of communal distress.</i>we do not fast or sound the trumpets on the Sabbath or holidays.<br>[There are, however, exceptions. They include] a city surrounded by gentiles or a [flooding] river, and a ship sinking at sea. We may sound the trumpets on the Sabbath to summon help for them, offer supplications on their behalf, and ask for mercy for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This is a restatement of a law mentioned previously in Chapter 2, Halachah 24. Chapter 2 involves questions concerning <i>pikuach nefesh,</i> the threat to life, and that is the reason why exceptions are made in these instances.</i>
We do not lay siege to gentile cities less than three days before the Sabbath, so that the minds of the warriors will become settled and they will not be agitated and preoccupied on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the siege must begin no later than Tuesday. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 248:1.) Note, however, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 248:4, which cites other views that count the three days as beginning on Thursday. Thus, the siege may begin on Wednesday.<br>Although the army will still be in a state of war, and agitation will thus not have been eliminated entirely, since three days will have passed since the siege began, we can assume that much of the initial confusion and strain will have passed, and the situation will have settled into a routine.<br>As mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 25, we may wage war against gentiles on the Sabbath. Generally, the commentaries mention two reasons why a siege should not be initiated less than three days before the Sabbath: the reason stated by the Rambam, and also that the three days before the Sabbath are considered to be days of preparation. Hence, at this time, one is forbidden to put oneself in a situation where it will inevitably be necessary to violate the Sabbath laws because of <i>pikuach nefesh</i>, a threat to life. When, however, the siege is begun earlier, the situation will have already become part of the soldiers' functional reality before the preparations for the Sabbath have begun, and they will be permitted to violate the Sabbath laws, if necessary.<br>By mentioning this law in this context, the Rambam emphasizes that the issue with which he is concerned is ensuring, to the fullest extent possible, the soldiers' peace of mind.</i><br>For this reason, we may not set sail on a ship less than three days before the Sabbath, so that one's mind will be settled before the Sabbath and one will not suffer excessive discomfort.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">There are many people who get sea-sick on the first days of a journey. After three days have passed, however, they are likely to have grown accustomed to conditions aboard ship.<br>According to the Rambam, this prohibition applies only to ocean vessels, and not to river-boat traffic. There are, however, different rationales for the requirement to leave three days before the Sabbath. Among them:<br>a) By traveling on a ship, one goes beyond the Sabbath limits. Although there is an opinion that the Sabbath limits do not apply when one is ten handbreadths above the ground - as a ship usually is above the ocean or river bed - there is, nevertheless, no definitive ruling about the matter. (See Chapter 27, Halachah 3; see Maharik, Responsum 45.)<br>b) One may be forced to perform forbidden labor on the ship or, at the very least, have a gentile perform forbidden labors on one's behalf. (See Rivash, Responsum 152.)<br>With regard to both these matters, these follow the alternate view mentioned above: that within three days of the Sabbath, since the Sabbath preparations have begun, one is not allowed to put oneself into a situation where one will inevitably break the Sabbath laws. If, however, one has put oneself into such a situation before the commencement of the Sabbath preparations, the status is different.<br>In two of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the question of whether or not the Sabbath limits apply above ten handbreadths is relevant on dry land, but does not apply to water travel at all. Hence, it does not present a difficulty in the case at hand. His view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 248:2). Although the Ramah mentions objections, the later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 248:3-4) follow the Rambam's view.<br>With regard to the performance of work, the Radbaz writes that, according to the Rambam, one may never put oneself into a situation in which one knows that one will inevitably be forced to perform forbidden labors on the Sabbath. (See <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 248.) The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 248:2) and the subsequent Ashkenazic authorities definitely do not accept this position. Moreover. from the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:4), it appears that the Sephardic community also agrees with the other view.</i> For the sake of a mitzvah, however, one may set out on a sea journey even on Friday. One should enter into an agreement that [the ship] interrupt [its journey] on the Sabbath. [If, however,] this agreement is not kept [it is not of consequence].<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 24, Halachah 6 and notes, where this law was originally stated and explained. It is repeated here to emphasize that because there is a mitzvah, the discomfort that will be caused by the journey is overlooked.</i><br>From Tyre to Sidon<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Two cities in Lebanon that are not far removed from each other.</i> and the like, one may set out on Friday, even if the journey concerns one's personal affairs.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For such a short journey is not likely to disturb one's ordinary functioning.</i> In places where it is customary not to set out on a journey on Friday at all, one should refrain from travelling.
Sexual relations are considered a dimension of Sabbath pleasure.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This applies to all people, not merely Torah scholars.</i> Therefore, Torah scholars who are healthy<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">And thus are not prevented from engaging in relations.</i> set aside Friday night as the night when they fulfill their conjugal duties.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketubot</i> 62b interprets Psalms 1:3, "who gives its fruit in its season," as referring to a person who engages in sexual relations on Friday night and not on other occasions. This is the practice of Torah scholars, who generally engage in relations only once a week (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 14:1).</i><br>At the outset, it is permitted to engage in sexual relations with a virgin on the Sabbath. It is not [forbidden because] one is creating a wound,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For the hymenal blood is considered to be a distinct entity enclosed in the membrane, and thus this situation differs from others in which bleeding is caused (Rashi, <i>Ketubot</i> 7a).<br>Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 339:11, which mentions that witnesses should observe the <i>yichud,</i> the entry into a private chamber, of the bride and groom before the commencement of the Sabbath, so that all the contractual aspects of the marriage will have been completed at that time.</i> nor because of the pain the woman [feels].
[The observance of] the Sabbath and [the prohibition against] worshiping false deities are each equivalent to [the observance] of all the mitzvot of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 3:9) derives the equivalence between the Sabbath and the entire Torah from Nechemiah 9:13-14: "On Mount Sinai You descended.... And You gave them straight judgments... and good statutes and commandments. And You informed them of Your holy Sabbath." The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Sabbath's central importance stems from the fact that it is a sign of God's constant renewal of creation.<br><i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> explains the equivalence between the Sabbath and all the other mitzvot as follows: The dynamic spiritual activity of the Sabbath, carried out against a backdrop of rest and material satisfaction, reflects the goal and purpose of the totality of our Torah observance. It is for this reason that our Sages called the Sabbath "a microcosm of the world to come."</i> And the Sabbath is the eternal sign between the Holy One, blessed be He, and us.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is borrowing the wording of Exodus 31:13,17.</i><br>For this reason, whoever transgresses the other mitzvot is considered to be one of the wicked of Israel, but a person who desecrates the Sabbath publicly is considered as an idolater. Both of them are considered to be equivalent to gentiles in all regards.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling represents more than a moral condemnation. Not only is such a person not acceptable as a witness and ineligible to take an oath in court, but all the restrictions applied with regard to gentiles - e.g., the prohibitions against gentile wine, gentile milk, and gentile bread - are applied to him. Similarly, he may not be counted in a <i>minyan</i>, nor be given any honor in the synagogue. (See <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 72:2.)<br>Many halachic authorities of the recent era (see <i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i> I, Responsum 33, and other sources) explain that there is room for leniency with regard to certain of these restrictions at present. Nevertheless, the overall attitude must still be one of stringency.<br>It must, however, be emphasized that the offspring of such Jews have a full portion in their Jewish heritage. Instead of shunning them, we must make every effort to draw them close to their spiritual roots. (See <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 3:3.)</i> Therefore, our prophets praise [Sabbath observance], saying [Isaiah 56:2]: "Happy is the man who does the following, and the mortal who holds fast to it, who keeps the Sabbath, without desecrating it...."<br>It is explicitly stated in our prophetic tradition that whoever observes the Sabbath according to law and honors it and delights in it according to his ability will receive reward in this world in addition to the reward that is preserved for the world to come,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Which the Rambam considers to be the ultimate reward, as he writes in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, Chapter 8.</i> as [Isaiah 58:14]<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">It is the observance of the Sabbath that is described in the preceding verse in Isaiah, "And you shall call the Sabbath 'a delight...,' which makes one worthy of the rewards mentioned in this verse.</i> states: "'You will then delight in God.
