Chapter 7

The <i>branches of palm trees</i> specified in the Torah (Leviticus 23:40) are freshly sprouted twigs of a palm tree, before their leaves are spread apart; they resemble a rod, called <i>lulav</i>.
The <i>fruit of goodly trees</i> specified in the Torah is the <i>ethrog</i>. The <i>boughs of leafy trees</i> specified in the Torah refer to the myrtle, the leaves of which cover the wood; it has, for example, three or more leaves growing from each bud.
The <i>willows of the brook</i> specified in the Torah do not refer to every plant growing near a brook, but to a definite kind of plant called <i>willows of the brook</i>. Its leaf is elongated like a brook and has a smooth edge, and its twig is red. This is called <i>aravah</i>, willow. Most plants of this kind grow beside brooks, hence the term <i>willows of the brook;</i> even if it grows in the wilderness or on the mountains it is fit for use.

The four species [described above] constitute one precept, and the absence of any of these makes the others useless. All of them are included under the term <i>lulav precept;</i> their number should be neither decreased nor increased.— —

How many should be taken of each species? One <i>lulav</i>, one <i>ethrog</i>, two twigs of willow, and three twigs of myrtle. If one wishes to increase the number of myrtle twigs so that the bunch should be larger, he may do so.— —





We are required to wave the <i>lulav</i> on the first day of <i>Sukkoth</i> only, anywhere and at any time, even if this happens to be a Sabbath, as it is written: "You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees" (Leviticus 23:40). Only in the Temple was the <i>lulav</i> waved on each of the seven days of <i>Sukkoth</i>, as it is written: "You shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days…"— —

After the destruction of the Temple it was ruled that the <i>lulav</i> should be waved on each of the seven days of the festival, in remembrance of the Temple usage.— —



Anyone who is required to hear the <i>shofar</i> and to dwell in a <i>sukkah</i> is also required to wave the <i>lulav;</i> anyone who is exempt from hearing the <i>shofar</i> and dwelling in a <i>sukkah</i> is likewise exempt from waving the <i>lulav</i>. A little boy who knows how to shake the <i>lulav</i> is required to do so, by rabbinic rule, in order to train him in the observance of precepts.




The custom in Jerusalem used to be that an individual would leave home carrying his <i>lulav</i>, go to synagogue with <i>lulav</i> in hand, worship with <i>lulav</i> in hand, and then go to visit the sick and comfort the mourners with <i>lulav</i> still in hand. But when he was about to enter the school-house, he would send his <i>lulav</i> home with his son or servant (Sukkah 41b).

Chapter 8












Although we are required to rejoice on all festivals, there was special rejoicing in the Temple during the <i>Sukkoth</i> festival, as it is written: "You shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days" (Leviticus 23:40). How was this done? On the day preceding the first day of <i>Sukkoth</i>, a raised section for women and a lower section for men were prepared in the Temple, so that they might not mix. They began to celebrate at the conclusion of the first day of the festival. On each day of <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i>, the celebrations began after the daily afternoon sacrifice and continued for the rest of the day and the entire night.
How was this celebration observed? Flutes were sounded, and harps, lyres and cymbals were played. Anyone who could play an instrument, played it; anyone who could sing, sang. They danced, clapping hands and leaping, each one to the best of his ability. However, this celebration was not permitted on the Sabbath or on the first day of the festival.
It was a religious duty to observe this celebration as much as possible. Ignorant individuals, or anybody who wished [to participate] took no leading part in it. Only great Jewish scholars, heads of academies, members of the Sanhedrin, elders, and men of piety and good deeds danced, clapped hands, made music and entertained in the Temple in the days of <i>Sukkoth</i>. Everyone else, men and women, came to watch and listen.
The joy which a person derives from doing good deeds and from loving God, who has commanded us to practise them, is a supreme form of divine worship. Anyone who refrains from experiencing this joy deserves punishment, as it is written: "Because you have not served the Lord your God with joy and with a glad heart" (Deuteronomy 28:47). Anyone who is arrogant and insists on self-glory on such occasions is both a sinner and a fool. King Solomon had this in mind when he said: "Do not glorify yourself in the presence of the King" (Proverbs 25:6). On the other hand, anyone who humbles himself on such occasions is indeed great and honored, for he serves the Lord out of love. David, King of Israel, expressed this thought when he said: "I will make myself even more contemptible than this, humbling myself in my own eyes" (II Samuel 6:22). True greatness and honor are attained only by rejoicing before the Lord, as it is written: "King David was leaping and dancing before the Lord" (II Samuel 6:16).
