Mishneh Torah, Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav



Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment from the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 170) and <i>Sefer Hachinuch</i> (Mitzvah 405) count this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to hear the sounding of the shofar<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The mitzvah is not the blowing of the shofar, as might be inferred from the verse, but rather listening to the blowing. The blessing recited before the fulfillment of this mitzvah, praising God for commanding us "to listen to the sounding of the shofar (Chapter 3, Halachah 10)," emphasizes this principle.<br>Accordingly, the Rambam writes (Chapter 1, Halachah 8) that a person who blows a shofar without hearing it does not fulfill the mitzvah. Conversely, he writes (Responsum 78) that if the mitzvah were the blowing of the shofar, a person who heard it being blown, but did not blow it himself, would not fulfill his obligation.<br>It must be noted that the published text of the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon states that the mitzvah is "to sound the shofar." Also, concerning the blowing of the shofar in the <i>yovel</i>, the Rambam himself writes that: "it is a positive mitzvah to blow the shofar on the tenth of Tishre... (<i>Hilchot Shemitah V'Yovel</i> 10:10)."</i> on Rosh HaShanah, as [Numbers 29:1] states: "It shall be a day of sounding [the ram's horn] for you."<br>The<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Though the ram's horn is not explicitly mentioned in the verse, our Sages derived the requirement as the Rambam explains.</i> shofar, which is sounded both on Rosh HaShanah and for the <i>yovel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">to announce the freeing of the slaves and the return of property, as explained in Leviticus 25:9-13.</i> is a bent<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rams' horns are always bent. This, too, has homiletic significance, referring to the bending over of our proud hearts. (See <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26b.)</i> ram's horn.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 16a states that a ram's horn is used to recall the <i>akedah</i> (binding) of Isaac.</i> All shofarot other than that of a ram are unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's opinion is based on the statement of Rav Levi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b), who declares: "The mitzvah of Rosh Hashanah is to be performed with bent [shofarot]," implying the use of a sheep's or ram's horn for that is their natural shape.<br>The Ra'avad, Rabbenu Asher, and many other Rishonim maintain that Rav Levi desired to designate the type of shofar which is most preferable to use, but did not intend to disqualify the horns of other animals. Their view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:1), which states that it is desirable to use the horn of a ram. However, if that is not possible, the horn of any animal may be used. The only exceptions are the horns of a cow and some wild animals whose horns are single, solid entities (Ramban).</i><br>Even though the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The above verse merely mentions יום תרועה - "a day of sounding" - without stating what must be sounded.</i> is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah [it was derived by our Sages in the following manner]. Concerning the <i>yovel</i>, [Leviticus 25:9] states: "You shall make a proclamation, sounding the shofar... you shall proclaim with the shofar." The oral tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b</i> explains that just as the "sounding" required by the Torah in the <i>yovel</i> requires a shofar, so, too, the "sounding" on Rosh HaShanah requires a shofar.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">An analogy (גזרה שוה) is drawn between the two verses, to teach that the same type of "sounding" is required on both occasions. Thus, since the Torah specifies states that the "sounding" of the <i>yovel</i> is carried out with a shofar, that same instrument is used on Rosh HaShanah.</i>
In the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained in the commentary to Chapter 2, Halachah 8, and Chapter 7, Halachah 13, in certain contexts the Rambam interprets the expression במקדש - literally, "in the holy place" - as referring to the entire city of Jerusalem. (See also the Rambam's commentary to the mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 4:1.) However, in the present context, it refers to the Temple alone. Thus, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 27a states that the shofar was sounded in this manner only "on the Temple Mount and at the eastern gate."</i> on Rosh HaShanah, they would blow [the shofar in the following manner]: There was one shofar and two trumpets, [one on either] side.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The verse from Psalms mentions "the voice of the shofar," using the singular. In contrast, it refers to "trumpets."</i> The sounding of the shofar was extended,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">for greater emphasis</i> while that of the trumpets was shortened, because the mitzvah of the day is performed with the shofar.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26b contrasts the sounding of the shofar and trumpets on Rosh HaShanah with their being blown on a fast day declared because of unfavorable conditions. On the latter occasion, the sounding of the trumpets was emphasized in keeping with the instructions of Numbers 10:9.</i><br>Why were the trumpets sounded together with it? Because [Psalms 98:6] states: "You shall sound trumpets and the voice of the shofar before God, the King."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a states that the expression "before God" implies: in the Temple.</i> However, in other places<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">even within Jerusalem</i> on Rosh Hashanah, only the shofar is blown.
At the outset, we should not blow a shofar of idol worship.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For it is not appropriate to use such a shofar for a mitzvah.</i> However, if one sounded it, one has fulfilled his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this refers to a shofar belonging to a gentile that was used in the worship of idols, or a shofar which was itself worshiped as an idol. However, as will be explained, if the shofar of idol worship belonged to a Jew or if it was made from the horn of an animal that was sacrificed to an idol, even after the fact, its use is not acceptable.</i> [In contrast,] should one sound a shofar belonging to an apostate city,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">עיר הנדחת. Deuteronomy 13:13-19 describes the laws governing a city in which the majority of the inhabitants have turned to idol worship. All the idolaters must be slain and all the homes and property burned. No benefit may be derived from them. (See also <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>, Chapter 4.)</i> one has not fulfilled one's obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a explains that the difference between a shofar of idol worship and one of an apostate city is that all the property within the latter must be destroyed. Since ultimately this shofar must be burnt, even before it is actually destroyed it is no longer considered to be an existent entity. Thus, we may not use it on Rosh HaShanah, because a shofar used for the mitzvah must be of a specific size - slightly larger than one's hand, as mentioned in Halachah 5 - and a nonexistent entity has no size at all.<br>A shofar of idol worship must also be destroyed. However, should the gentile negate its connection to idol worship before it is acquired by a Jew, it need not be destroyed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8. Since there is a possibility that it will not have to be destroyed, it is considered to be an existent entity and may be used for the mitzvah.<br>This principle applies only to aspects of idol worship belonging to a gentile. It is impossible to negate the connection between an idol worshiped by a Jew and its forbidden nature. (See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:9.) Hence, a Jew's shofar of idol worship may not be used. Similarly, if a Jew has acquired a shofar of idol worship that belonged to a gentile before the latter negated its connection to idol worship, the Jew is no longer capable of negating this connection. Therefore, such a shofar may not be used on Rosh HaShanah.<br>Also, once an animal has been sacrificed to an idol, there is no possibility of negating its connection to idol worship. Hence, its horn may not be used as a shofar.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:3-4) quotes all the above laws as halachah. The Ramah relates that certain authorities recommend not using even a gentile's shofar of idol worship unless we know that he negated its connection with idol worship before Rosh HaShanah begins.</i><br>Concerning a stolen shofar:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">one who blows it fulfills his obligation - Though in general, a mitzvah performed with a stolen article is not acceptable (see Chapter 8, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:7), this case is an exception...</i> one who blows it fulfills his obligation, because the mitzvah is only to listen to the sound,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, a person who listens to the shofar being blown fulfills his obligation</i> even though the listener does not touch [the shofar]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Based on this statement, the commentaries propose that, according to the Rambam, a person who blows a shofar without putting his lips to it fulfills his obligation. The Ramban (see <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> 1:6) does not accept this view.</i> or lift it up.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Accordingly, after the fact, by hearing such a shofar, one has fulfilled one's obligation, because</i> The laws of theft do not apply to sound alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">for sound is not a physical entity that can be possessed. Rabbenu Manoach and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite other examples from <i>Nedarim</i> 13b-15a, where the Sages differentiate between sound and material entities.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1) derives this law as follows:Everyone agrees that a stolen lulav is unacceptable. What is the difference between a shofar and a lulav?<br>Rabbi Yosse responded: "Concerning a lulav, [Leviticus 23:40] states: 'You shall take for yourself,' implying that only 'your own' is acceptable. In contrast, [Numbers 29:1] states: 'It shall be a day of blowing for you,' implying that regardless [of the nature of the shofar used, the blowing shall be 'for you']".<br>Rabbi Eliezer explained: "There, [concerning the lulav,] one must perform the mitzvah with the lulav itself. Here, [concerning the shofar,] one performs the mitzvah with its sound."Nevertheless, because a sin is associated with this mitzvah, Ashkenazic custom is that no blessing should be recited before blowing such a shofar (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 586:4).</i><br>Similarly, a shofar from an<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">animal consecrated as an...</i> <i>olah</i> offering should not be sounded,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Once an animal is consecrated as an <i>olah</i> offering, no part of its body may be used any other purpose. Therefore, we should not use such a shofar from such an animal for any purpose whatsoever.<br>This halachah applies before the blood from the sacrifice has been offered on the altar. Afterwards, the skin and horns of the animal become the property of the priests and may be used for mundane purposes (Rashi, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a).</i> but<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 5:16, the Rambam writes:Concerning the sound, sight, and smell of consecrated objects: We should not derive benefit from them. However, all the implications of the prohibition against using them for mundane purposes do not apply.</i> if one sounds it, he fulfills his obligation, because the laws of<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibitions forbidding use of consecrated articles for mundane purposes...</i> מעילה do not apply with regard to sound alone. If you ask: "Behold, he has derived benefit from hearing [the shofar's] sound?"<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Though the laws of מעילה do not apply to sound, there is still a Rabbinic prohibition against benefiting from the sound of consecrated articles. Therefore, one might think that we would be unable to fulfill the mitzvah with such a shofar (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). Accordingly, the Rambam explains:</i> - mitzvot were not given for our benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) states: "the mitzvot were not given to the Jewish people for their enjoyment, but rather as a yoke."<br>This concept has relevance in the ethical, as well as the halachic sphere. In the tenth chapter of <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, the Rambam writes:One who serves [God] out of love occupies himself with the Torah and the mitzvot...for no ulterior motive, not because of fear that evil will occur, nor in order to acquire benefit...<br>The great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: "Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a gift. Rather, since he is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him"; i.e., serve [Him] out of love.The above is not intended to imply that a person should not feel happy and fulfilled in the service of God. Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service. We should be totally committed to fulfilling God's will, and the expression of that commitment should generate satisfaction and joy.<br><b>Based on this concept -</b> that mitzvot were not given for our benefit;<br><b>a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the teki'ot required to fulfill the mitzvah. -</b> Doing so is not considered a violation of his vow.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:5) advises that the person who took the vow should not blow the shofar himself [because many consider that to be a pleasurable experience (<i>Taz</i>)]. Rather, he should hear the <i>teki'ot</i> from a colleague.<br>Also, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) notes that if a person specifically states that he vows not to listen to a colleague's <i>teki'ot</i>, he may not hear that person blow the shofar on Rosh HaShanah, because a vow (<i>neder</i>) can also negate a mitzvah. (See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:6-8.)</i><br>Based on this concept, a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the <i>teki'ot</i> required to fulfill the mitzvah.
Regarding a shofar to be used on Rosh HaShanah: It is forbidden to violate the festival laws to obtain it. This applies<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">not only when obtaining the shofar requires the violation of a <i>melachah</i> (forbidden labor) prohibited by the Torah, but</i> even when the forbidden practice is in the category of <i>sh'vut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:1, the Rambam defines <i>sh'vut</i> as a prohibition instituted by the Sages because a particular activity resembles one forbidden as a <i>melachah</i> by Torah law, or because performing it may cause one to perform a <i>melachah</i>.<br>Though these prohibitions are of Rabbinic origin, the Sages reinforced the power of their decrees and equated them with Torah law. Hence, just as one may not violate a <i>melachah</i> forbidden by the Torah to obtain a shofar, so, too, it is forbidden to violate a <i>sh'vut</i> forbidden by Rabbinic law (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). [Nevertheless, note the clarification of this principle in Chapter 2, Halachah 6.]</i><br>How is the above exemplified? If there is a shofar in a treetop or across a river<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">and that is the only shofar available - one may not climb the tree - lest one accidentally cut off a branch (ibid., 6)</i> - and that is the only shofar available - one may not climb the tree or swim across the water to bring it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lest one prepare a swimming aid (ibid., 23:5). The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b) mentions other examples of forbidden activities.</i> Needless to say, we may not cut the shofar [from the animal's head]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary on the mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to cutting the horn off with a household knife. Since a craftsman's knife is not being used, cutting the shofar off is not forbidden by Torah law. Nevertheless, the Rambam uses the expression "needless to say," because such an activity bears a closer resemblance to one forbidden by Torah law than those mentioned previously.</i> or perform a forbidden labor<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">cutting off the horn with a craftsman's knife</i> [to prepare a shofar so that we may blow it].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">[to prepare a shofar so that we may blow it].</i><br> [The rationale for the above is:] Blowing the shofar fulfills a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">as stated in Halachah 1.</i> while [the observance of] the festivals fulfills both a positive and a negative commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 1:2, the Rambam writes:Whoever rests from a <i>melachah</i> categorized as "work" on one of [these days] fulfills a positive commandment, because the Torah describes them as "days of rest"... if one performs a <i>melachah</i> that is not intended to prepare food,... one negates the performance of a positive commandment and transgresses a negative commandment, as [Leviticus 23:8] states: "You shall not perform any servile work."</i> The observance of a positive commandment does not negate the observance of both a positive and negative commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Though the performance of a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment (<i>Yevamot</i> 3b), that applies only when the negative commandment is not reinforced by a positive commandment, as in the case at hand.</i><br>It is permitted to rinse a shofar with water, wine, or vinegar in order to improve its tone.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to prepare a utensil for use on a festival. (See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 4:8.) However, this activity is not placed in that category (Rabbenu Manoach).</i> However, as an expression of deference, one should never<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., even before Rosh HaShanah</i> use urine [for that purpose], lest one view the mitzvot in a deprecating manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam concludes <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> (14:16):...lest one view the mitzvot in a deprecating manner, because the deference is not to be granted to the mitzvot in and of themselves, but to the One who commanded us to fulfill them, blessed be He.</i>
The minimum size of a shofar is [a measure] sufficient that one may hold the shofar in one's hands [with the ends] visibly [protruding]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The protrusions are necessary lest one say that a person is producing the sounds by blowing into his hands without a shofar.</i> on either side.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Niddah</i> 26a defines this measure as "an expanded handbreadth." The <i>Beit Yosef</i> notes that, in this context, a handbreadth is defined as four thumbbreadths. Thus, the difference between the width of a thumb and the other fingers accounts for the "expansion." In modern measure, a handbreadth is considered between 8 (<i>Shiurei Torah</i>) and 9.6 (<i>Chazon Ish</i>) centimeters.</i><br>Should a shofar be cracked lengthwise,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., from its mouth to its end;</i> it is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is a quote from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27b. The Rabbis have noted that, in contrast to a crack along the shofar's width, in this context no minimum figure is mentioned with regard to the portion of the shofar remaining uncracked. Two contrasting interpretations are offered to explain the difference.<br>Some maintain that as long as the entire length (or the majority of the length) of the shofar is not cracked, the shofar is not disqualified. Others maintain that even the slightest crack along the length of the shofar disqualifies it, because the pressure of the blowing will cause the crack to grow until, ultimately, the entire shofar will be cracked (Rabbenu Asher; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 586:8).<br>Concerning <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, both the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (586:8) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (586:43) write that when no other shofar is available, one may rely on the first opinion. Nevertheless, even the latter opinion does not disqualify a shofar that is cracked lengthwise if it is tied firmly so that the crack will not expand, or if the shofar is heated and the crack closed. Some opinions also allow such a shofar to be used if the crack is plugged closed with other substances.</i> Should it be cracked along its width<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">with the crack extending along the majority of the shofar's circumference (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> ibid., 9),</i> - if a measure equivalent to the minimum size of a shofar remains,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Most authorities require a handbreadth to remain from the crack to the shofar's mouth (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

This point is not accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 7), which emphasizes that if the hole is not plugged, the shofar is kosher even though its sound has changed. Nevertheless, the Ramah states that if another shofar is available, a shofar with a hole should not be used.</i> with another substance,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., any substance other than a ram's horn;</i> it is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">because the sound produced does not come from the shofar alone, but rather from the shofar and the other substance.</i> If it was plugged with its own kind, it is kosher [under the following conditions]:<br>the majority of the shofar remained whole;<br>the plugging of the holes did not alter its sound.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">These three conditions are dependent on the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27b. Rabbenu Asher interprets the passage differently. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) favors the Rambam's interpretation, but states that under difficult circumstances, when no other shofar is available, one may rely on Rabbenu Asher's interpretation.</i><br>If one [merely] perforated the insides of the horn,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">the bonelike tissue inside the horn</i> [but did not remove them,] it is kosher, because a substance of the same kind is not considered an intervening entity.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The presence of a foreign substance inside the shofar would cause it to be disqualified, as stated in the following halachah. However, since this tissue is considered to be part of the horn itself, the shofar is acceptable.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 586:15) quotes this law, but also adds that if one removed this tissue from the horn and then hollowed it out, the tissue would be unacceptable for use as a shofar.</i> Should one stick together fragments of <i>shofarot</i> until one has constructed a shofar, it is unacceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a explains that this construction is not called a shofar.

If one made any addition to a shofar<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">whether from the mouthpiece or from the wider end (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 586:11).</i> - whether of its kind<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">using a fragment of a ram's horn</i> or from another substance<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">it is unacceptable. - On the surface, this law appears to be an extension of the principle mentioned in the last clause of the previous halachah.

The manner in which we use the shofar must parallel the manner in which the ram passes by with it on its head.<br>Based on the same principle, our Sages (ibid.) explain that a shofar is unacceptable if it was heated to the point that the horn became soft, and then turned inside out.</i>

A person who hears the shofar through a microphone does not fulfill the mitzvah. In addition to the difficulties involved with the use of the microphone on a festival, there is a more essential problem. The listeners are not hearing the sound of the shofar, but rather a second sound, produced by a different mechanism. The microphone converts the sound waves of the shofar to electronic signals; these are then amplified and converted to a different set of sound waves. Hence, by hearing such a sound, we cannot fulfill the mitzvah obligating us to hear a shofar's call.</i>

The rationale is that the blessing recited before a commandment praises God "for commanding us to..." There is no commandment, either from the Torah or the Sages, requiring women to hear the blowing of the shofar. Hence, they should not recite this blessing.<br>The Ashkenazic concept differs. The Ramah (based on <i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) maintains that women may recite a blessing.

A person who occupies himself with blowing the shofar in order to learn<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">without the intention of fulfilling the mitzvah of hearing the shofar</i> does not fulfill his obligation.

However, other Talmudic sources imply that there is no need for such intention. Whenever a person performs the deed of a mitzvah, he fulfills his obligation, regardless of his intention.<br>On the surface, the Rambam's own decisions regarding this question appear paradoxical. <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:3 states:A person who eats matzah without the intention [of fulfilling the mitzvah] - e.g., if gentiles or thieves force him to eat - fulfills his obligation.There, it appears that the Rambam does not require a person to have the intention to fulfill a mitzvah, for in this instance the only reason the person ate the matzah was the coercion of the gentiles.<br>The commentaries attempt to resolve the issue. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage.<br>Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only מתעסק (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities (<i>Keritot</i> 19b).<br>Similarly, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him. In contrast, since his body did not benefit from hearing the shofar, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears the shofar blown in the proper manner.<br>As regards <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, in <i>Orach Chayim</i> 589:8, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes the Rambam's decision concerning blowing the shofar, stating that a מתעסק does not fulfill the mitzvah. Similar decisions are rendered concerning <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60) and lulav and etrog (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651).<br>Concerning matzah, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 475:4 quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>'s opinion, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> adds the explanation mentioned in the name of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. (Even so, the <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries do not accept this decision.)</i><br>If the person hearing had the intention of fulfilling his obligation, but the person blowing did not have the intention of facilitating the latter's performance of the mitzvah,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28b quotes Rabbi Zeira as instructing Shamaya: "Have me in mind and blow for me."</i> or the person blowing had the intention of facilitating his colleague's performance of the mitzvah, but the person hearing did not have the intention of fulfilling his obligation, [the person hearing] did not fulfill his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (189:4) states that if a person comes to the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah with the intention to fulfill his obligation to hear the shofar, that intention is sufficient.

There is an allusion to this in the Torah itself. Though Numbers 10:10 describes Rosh Hashanah as a day of "the sounding of the shofar," Leviticus 23:24 refers to it as a day of "the remembrance of the sounding [of the shofar" - i.e., this refers to Rosh Hashanah which falls on the Sabbath, when the shofar is not actually sounded (Rashi, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a).</i> [This law was enacted] even though blowing [the shofar] was forbidden only as <i>sh'vut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4 for a definition of the term <i>sh'vut</i>. <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b equates the blowing of the shofar with removing bread from the oven. It appears from <i>Shabbat</i> 117b that the removal of bread from the oven was forbidden only because it is "a weekday act," not in the spirit of the Sabbath. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 588:4.)</i><br>It would be appropriate for [the shofar] to be sounded, for a positive commandment of the Torah should supersede <i>sh'vut</i> instituted by the Sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A question can be raised, based on the Rambam's statements in Chapter 1, Halachah 4:Regarding a shofar to be used on Rosh Hashanah: It is forbidden to violate the festival's laws to obtain it. This applies even when the forbidden practice is in the category of <i>sh'vut</i>.The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> offers a number of resolutions to this difficulty. Among them:<br>a) Had the proper attention been paid to the matter before Rosh Hashanah, the <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 with regard to obtaining the shofar would not exist. In contrast, the <i>sh'vut</i> involved in blowing the shofar cannot be avoided.<br>b) The <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 must be violated before the mitzvah is performed. Hence, there is no way the prohibition can be relaxed in the mere expectation that a mitzvah will be performed. In contrast, in this instance, the performance of the mitzvah and the <i>sh'vut</i> occur concurrently.<br>However, the order of the halachot here suggests a different explanation. As the Rambam states in the following halachah, certain leniencies are taken regarding the <i>sh'vut</i> of sounding the shofar on Rosh Hashanah (since, as mentioned above, it is forbidden only because it is a "weekday act"). In contrast, the activities mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 are of a more severe nature, and hence no leniency may be taken in their regard.</i> If so, why is the shofar not sounded?<br>Because of a decree [of the Sages] lest a person take it in his hands and carry it to a colleague so that the latter can blow for him,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam alters the expression used by <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b, which states: "perhaps he will take it to a skilled person so that the latter will teach him."

It must be noted that while the Temple was standing, a similar decree was not enacted on the first day of Sukkot which fell on the Sabbath, even though it is possible that a person would carry his lulav in a forbidden manner. Note our commentary on Chapter 7, Halachot 13 and 14, which explains the difference between the two festivals.<br>The fact that a Rabbinic decree can cause a mitzvah to be nullified - particularly as significant a mitzvah as the blowing of the shofar - has been the subject of much discussion by the Rabbis. In his commentary on the tractate of <i>Sukkah</i>, Rabbenu Nissim states that this decree was instituted only because in most Jewish communities, the people were not aware of the date the Rabbis had established for Rosh Hashanah. Hence, since the people could not be sure that they were in fact performing a mitzvah, the Rabbinic decree had the power to negate its performance. Even in the places where they were conscious of the proper date, they would not blow the shofar in such a year, so that great divisions in Torah practice would not be created among the Jewish people.<br>In <i>Likkutei Torah</i>, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains the matter from a mystical perspective. He writes that the Sabbath itself generates spiritual influences which resemble those produced by the blowing of the shofar. Thus, there is no necessity to blow the shofar, and the Sages were therefore willing to allow such a decree to negate its observance.</i>
Children who have not reached an age at which they can be educated:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Manoach explains that this refers to children of six or seven.</i> We need not prevent them from blowing [the shofar] on a Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">even though blowing the shofar on the Sabbath is prohibited for an adult</i> which is not the festival of Rosh Hashanah, so that they will learn [to blow].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is not directly related to the laws of Rosh Hashanah, but rather to the laws of the Sabbath.

However, it is forbidden for an adult to sound the shofar on Rosh Hashanah unnecessarily. Nevertheless, even a child who has reached the age when he is educated concerning the mitzvot need not follow this stringency (Ramah, ibid.).</i>
When [the Sages] decreed not to sound [the shofar] on the Sabbath, they applied that decree only to places which lacked a court.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages forbade sounding the shofar on the Sabbath lest someone carry it in a forbidden manner, as explained in the previous halachah. However, that decree was not applied to places where the Sanhedrin, Israel's supreme court, held its sessions. The influence of the court would be felt throughout the entire city and its surroundings. Hence, the people would be more scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot.

Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai asked the family of Beteira: "Shall we blow?"<br>"Let us consider the matter," they replied to him.<br>"Let us blow, and then consider the matter after having blown," he answered them.<br>"Let us consider the matter," they replied again.<br>He told them, "The sounding of a horn has already been heard in Yavneh.

Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a) states that the shofar was sounded on the Sabbath only in the presence of the Supreme Sanhedrin. Thus, this law applied only in Yavneh and in the few other cities where the Sanhedrin subsequently held its session.<br>Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif) quotes this law in his <i>Halachot</i> even though he quotes only those laws which are applicable in his age. From this it appears that he maintains that the shofar may be sounded in the presence of any court of stature on the Sabbath, even if its judges do not possess <i>semichah</i>. Indeed, the Ramban and Rabbenu Nissim write that Rav Yitzchak Alfasi would have the shofar sounded in his own court when Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath. Similarly, the text <i>Haezer</i> records that the author saw a Sage from Damascus who stated that he saw the shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah which fell on a Sabbath.<br>(The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, ibid., does not mention the need for the judges to possess <i>semichah</i>. Thus, it is possible that he also originally subscribed to this view.)<br>In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam's position lies in between these views. On one hand, unlike Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, he requires that the judges possess <i>semichah</i> and be of sufficient stature to have sanctified the new moon (thus, excluding any contemporary courts). Nevertheless, unlike Rashi, he allows the shofar to be sounded in the presence of any court that has those qualifications, and not the Supreme Sanhedrin alone.</i> Also, the shofar is sounded only in the presence of a high court.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation of בית דין גדול is based on the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who explains that in this context the term refers to an established court of judges with <i>semichah</i>, and not the Supreme Sanhedrin, as is sometimes the case. Indeed, authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from Yemen omit the word גדול from the above expression.</i><br>It may be sounded during the entire time they are in session.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">but only while they are in session.

Since the question concerns a Rabbinic decree, the more lenient approach is taken (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> - as long as they have not risen - the shofar may be sounded before them. However, outside the court, the shofar may not be sounded.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In this aspect, there was a difference between the sounding of the shofar on the Sabbath between Jerusalem and Yavneh. In Jerusalem, the influence of the Temple and the court was felt so strongly that even outside the presence of the court, the shofar could be sounded. In contrast, in Yavneh and other cities where courts were located, the shofar was sounded only in the presence of a court (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.).</i><br>Why is the shofar allowed to be sounded in the court? Because the court is scrupulous [in the observance of the mitzvot] and, in its presence, those who blow the shofar will not carry the shofar in the public domain, for the court will warn the people and inform them.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>S'dei Chemed</i> derives a general principle from this law. <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:27 states that all Sabbath and festival prohibitions that were categorized as <i>sh'vut</i> were suspended in the Temple, because the priests were scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot and there was no danger that any infringement of Torah law would occur. Similarly, the above text continues, all decrees of this nature may be suspended in the presence of a high court, because the court will ensure that the Torah's laws will be kept.<br>This logic runs contrary to a statement of Rabbenu Nissim, who writes that although Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai instituted the blowing of the shofar on the Sabbath in the presence of a court, he was not that lenient regarding the taking of the lulav and etrog. Thus, we see that the leniency mentioned here applies to the shofar alone and not to other cases.</i>
In the present age, when we celebrate Rosh Hashanah in the exile for two days,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There is a slight imprecision with the Rambam's statements. Rosh Hashanah was celebrated for two days throughout almost the totality of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> even while the Temple was standing.

Nevertheless, it is significant that Rav Hai Gaon, one of the major authorities who preceded the Rambam, offers a different explanation for Rabbi Abahu's actions.<br>Rav Hai Gaon maintains that it is impossible that a doubt existed among the Jewish people concerning such an important manner as sounding the shofar. Since the shofar was sounded each year, surely the tradition could have been maintained. Hence, he explains that all the different manners of sounding the shofar were acceptable and that Rabbi Abahu's contribution was the establishment of a uniform custom that included all the different practices common among the Jewish people. By mentioning the "many years" and "exiles," the Rambam addresses himself to the question raised by Rav Hai Gaon.</i> is:<br>Does it resemble the wailing with which the women cry<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">thus, it would be short, staccato sounds like sobs</i> when they moan,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>teru'ah</i> is translated into Aramaic as <i>yevavah</i> (moan), as in Judges 5:28: "Sisra's mother gazed out the window and moaned through the lattice."</i> or<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">does a <i>teru'ah</i> resemble...</i> the sighs<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., longer sounds</i> which a person who is distressed about a major matter will release repeatedly?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since before a person cries, he sighs (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b).</i> Perhaps a combination of the two<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">sighing and the crying which will follow it - is called teru'ah, because a distressed person will sigh and then cry. Therefore, we fulfill all [these possibilities]. - as explained in detail in the following halachah.<br>The commentaries have emphasized the homiletic aspects of these halachot. On Rosh Hashanah, a Jew must concentrate on the coronation of God as King of the world.

The crying<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">mentioned in the previous halachah</i> refers to what we call <i>teru'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">short, staccato sounds like sobs.

One of the fundamental texts of the period directly following the conclusion of the Talmud, the <i>Sh'eltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon (note 171), mentions a different practice.<br>Three series of blasts from each pattern are not blown directly after each other. Rather, after sounding three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>, three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>, and then three series of <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> is sounded.</i><br>[Then,] he sounds a <i>teki'ah</i>; afterwards, three <i>shevarim</i>; and afterwards, a <i>teki'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">in accordance with the opinion that maintains that a <i>teru'ah</i> resembles sighing. It must be noted that from the passage on <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 34a it seems that Rabbi Abahu instituted the series of three <i>teru'ot</i> before the series of three <i>shevarim</i>.</i> He repeats this pattern [until he completes] three series.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">to fulfill the obligation explained in Halachah 1.</i><br>[Then,] he sounds a <i>teki'ah</i>; afterwards, a <i>teru'ah</i>; and afterwards, a <i>teki'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">in accordance with the opinion that maintains that a <i>teru'ah</i> resembles crying.</i> He repeats this pattern [until he completes] three series.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">as explained above.</i><br>Thus, there are a total of thirty shofar blasts,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">18 <i>teki'ot</i>, six <i>shevarim</i>, and six <i>teru'ot</i>.<br>From the Rambam's expression, it appears that he considers the <i>shevarim</i> and <i>teru'ah</i> sounded in the first series as two separate blasts. From this, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> derives a halachic insight, maintaining that according to the Rambam, one may take a breath between the two. (The <i>Mayim Chayim</i> supports this conclusion, noting that, regarding this series, the Rambam states that one should blow "three <i>shevarim</i>, and afterwards, a <i>teru'ah</i>.") Nevertheless, the Ramban and other authorities do not permit this leniency.<br>Regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:4) suggests adhering to the more stringent view regarding the <i>teki'ot</i> required by Torah law. However, the Ramah maintains that this is unnecessary. Both the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 590:9, 10 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 590:20 suggest adhering to whichever practice is customarily followed in one's local community. However, if there is no accepted custom, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> suggests accepting the more stringent practice.</i> in order to remove any doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">as mentioned in the previous halachah.<br>Though all three sounds would be included in the series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>, it would be insufficient for such a series alone to be sounded. According to the opinions that maintain that a <i>teru'ah</i> is either sobbing or crying alone, there would be another sound interrupting between either the <i>teki'ah</i> which precedes or that which follows the <i>teru'ah</i> (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34a).</i>
The required length of a <i>teru'ah</i> is that of two <i>teki'ot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These statements are the source of much controversy among the Rabbis. The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b) states: "The required length of the <i>teki'ah</i> is three <i>teru'ot</i>; a <i>teru'ah</i> is three sobs."<br>The Talmud questions:Behold, the <i>baraita</i> has taught: "the required length of a <i>teki'ah</i> is that of a <i>teru'ah</i>!"<br>Abbaye replied: "The author of the Mishnah considered the length of all the <i>teki'ot</i> in comparison to the length of all the <i>teru'ot</i>. The author of the <i>baraita</i> considered the length of each blast. There is no difference of opinion between them."In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam interprets the above to mean: "The required length of all six <i>teki'ot</i> is equivalent to the required length of all three <i>teru'ot</i>," thus establishing each <i>teru'ah</i> as twice the length of a <i>teki'ah</i>. Hence, according to the Rambam, the length of the <i>teki'ot</i> are dependent on the length of the <i>teru'ot</i>.<br>Rabbenu Nissim objects to the Rambam's interpretation, explaining that the word והעברת, the verb mentioned in the commandment to blow the shofar, implies a long blast, and hence the measure mentioned by the Rambam would not be appropriate.<br>Similarly, the Ra'avad does not accept the Rambam's interpretation, and explains that the Mishnah establishes an independent measure for the length of a <i>teki'ah</i> - three <i>teru'ot</i> - with each <i>teru'ah</i> being equal to three short sobs. Thus, the measure of a <i>teki'ah</i> is equivalent to nine short sounds. The Ramban and the Rashba also subscribe to this view.<br>Rashi and most Ashkenazic authorities accept the simple meaning of the Mishnah and explain that a <i>teki'ah</i> is equal to the length of a <i>teru'ah</i>. However, as explained in the previous halachot, there are three different interpretations of the definition of a <i>teru'ah</i>. Thus, the required length for the <i>teki'ah</i> varies accordingly.<br>Regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:3) mentions the views of Rashi and the Ra'avad, but not that of the Rambam.</i> The required length of the three <i>shevarim</i> is that of a <i>teru'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the length of the three <i>shevarim</i> should resemble a series of <i>teru'ot</i>.</i><br>When a person sounds a <i>teki'ah</i> and a <i>teru'ah</i>, and afterwards sounds a long <i>teki'ah</i>, extending it twice the length of the original one,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">with the intention that it be considered to be the final blast of the first series and the initial blast of the following series</i> we do not say that it may be considered to be two <i>teki'ot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">although it is of sufficient length</i> - thus allowing one [to complete the series merely by] sounding a <i>teru'ah</i> and another <i>teki'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This represents a rephrasing of the Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:9 and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a.</i> Rather, even if one extended a <i>teki'ah</i> the entire day, it is considered to be only a single <i>teki'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This decision runs contrary to the statements of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 3:3), which does not accept a <i>teki'ah</i> blown with such an intention at all.</i> and one must sound another <i>teki'ah, teru'ah,</i> and <i>teki'ah</i> [until he completes] three series.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This law is quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:6).

The Ramah quotes the law from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a, allowing a person to fulfill his obligation even though he heard two people blowing the shofar at the same time, provided he heard the blasts in the proper order.</i> [If he heard] a <i>teki'ah</i> from one, a <i>teru'ah</i> from another, and another <i>teki'ah</i> from a third, in sequence, he has fulfilled his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that different people sounded the shofar does not prevent the fulfillment of the mitzvah.</i><br>The above applies even if one heard [the shofar blasts] with interruptions, even if [the blowing was extended] over the entire day.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There is a certain redundancy with this statement, because the same principle was mentioned in the previous halachah. Nonetheless, the Rambam included it to emphasize that the passage of time is not considered an interruption even when the shofar is being blown by different people (Rabbenu Manoach).</i> A person does not fulfill his obligation until he hears all nine shofar blasts, for they are all [only] one mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">as explained in Halachah 1.</i> Thus, they are dependent one on the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Based on this principle, a person who does not know how to blow either the <i>shevarim</i> or the <i>teru'ot</i> should not sound the <i>teki'ot</i>, for he will accomplish nothing by doing so (<i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b). Nevertheless, if a person knows how to sound both <i>teki'ot</i> and <i>shevarim</i>, he should sound three series of such blasts even if he does not know how to sound a <i>teru'ah</i>. Since it is possible that the mitzvah may be fulfilled by these series (as explained in Halachot 2 and 3), at the very least they should be sounded (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 593:2).</i>
The congregation<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">but not an individual (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34b)</i> is obligated to hear the shofar blasts<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the nine blasts mentioned in Halachah 1</i> together with the order of blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16b explains that the Sages instituted the blowing of the shofar in the midst of the prayer service in order to confuse Satan, lest he lodge accusations against the Jews in the midst of their prayers. The Sages explain (ibid., 32b) that it would have been appropriate to institute the shofar blowing in the morning service. However, the Romans desired to stamp out the performance of the mitzvot and sent guards to make sure that the mitzvah was not fulfilled. After midday, the guards left, and then, in the musaf service, the shofar would be sounded.<br>Originally, the Sages' decree involved determining the place of the service when the mitzvah required by the Torah would be fulfilled and this halachah must be interpreted in that context. However, as explained in Halachot 11 and 12, it became universally accepted Jewish custom to blow the shofar before the musaf prayers to fulfill the Torah's commandment, and thus "confuse the Satan" even before the beginning of our prayers, and then to sound the shofar again in the midst of those prayers to fulfill the Rabbinic decree.

Generally, a person who does not know all the blessings of the <i>Amidah</i> should recite those that he knows.

(See also the <i>Bi'ur Halachah</i>.)</i><br>In each of these blessings, one is required to recite ten verses<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a explains that the number ten alludes to the ten expressions of praise used by King David in Psalm 150; or, alternatively, to the ten statements of creation; or, alternatively, to the ten commandments.

Indeed, the text of the blessings generally recited for <i>Malchuyot</i> and <i>Shofarot</i> includes eleven quotes.</i> reflecting the content of the blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">as explained in the commentary on the previous halachah</i> - three verses from the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Torah is on a higher level of holiness, its verses are mentioned first.</i> three from the Book of Psalms, and three from [the words of] the prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries question why the Book of Psalms is given prominence over the words of the prophets, when generally the prophets' statements are considered on a higher level of holiness. Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that chronologically, the Psalms were written before the prophecies quoted (<i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a).<br>Examples of the verses recited are mentioned in the following halachah and commentary.</i> One concludes with a verse from the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">because of the dearness of the Torah. <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b explains that this was the custom of the experienced Sages of Jerusalem.</i> Should a person conclude with a verse from the prophets, he fulfills his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">However, one should preferably conclude with a verse from the Torah. This is our present practice.<br>From the statements of the Rambam and the relevant passages from the Mishnah and Talmud, it would appear that originally there was no standard text containing universally accepted verses for these blessings. Rather, certain verses were commonly accepted and would be recited by almost all those who prayed. Others were left to the preference of each individual.<br>(One must remember that machzorim were uncommon in this period, and most of the prayers were recited by heart. Thus, the verses chosen by an individual might often have been those which he had been able to commit to memory.)</i><br>Should a person recite only one verse from the Torah, one from the sacred writings, and one from the prophets,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Thus mentioning three verses in each blessing, one from each division of the <i>T'nach</i></i> he fulfills his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">after the fact. However, at the outset it is desirable to recite all ten verses.</i> Even if he states: "In Your Torah, God, our Lord, it is written..." and recites one verse from the Torah and concludes, nothing further is necessary.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries have questioned the Rambam's statements, which appear self-contradictory. In the previous clause, he stated that one must recite three verses - one from the Torah, one from the prophets, and one from the writings - to fulfill one's obligation, while this clause implies that the recitation of one is sufficient.<br>The source for the difficulty is the following quotes: The Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a, states:One should not recite fewer than ten verses for <i>Malchuyot</i>, ten for <i>Zichronot</i>, and ten for <i>Shofarot</i>. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: "If one recites three - three of each - one fulfills his obligation."<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 35a quotes Rav Chanan'el as saying in the name of Rav:Even if he states: "In Your Torah, it is written..." [and recites one verse], nothing further is necessary.From the Talmud, it appears that both these statements are accepted as halachah. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam interprets Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri's requirement of three verses as the total for all three blessings. Thus, for each blessing, one must state "In Your Torah, it is written..." and recite a single appropriate verse. [This surely differs from the Rambam's statements in his commentary on the Mishnah.]<br>The Ramban, Rabbenu Nissim, and others explain that Rav Chanan'el agrees with Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri and thus, in addition to "In Your Torah, it is written...," he also requires one to say: "In Your holy writings, it is recorded...," and: "by your prophets, it was proclaimed...," mentioning an appropriate verse in each instance. (This opinion is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 586:8 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 591:11.)<br>Alternatively, one may explain the Rambam's position as follows: Ideally, one should recite ten verses for each blessing; after the fact, three are sufficient, as stated by Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri. When does this apply? Once one has recited at least one verse from the Torah. However, if one has not recited any verses, it is sufficient to say "In Your Torah, it is written..." and recite a single verse from the Torah, as Rav Chanan'el said in the name of Rav.<br>The flexibility regarding the number of quotes in each blessing was only granted in the previous generations. Since at present we have adopted a standard set of blessings, a person should not delete verses at will (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 591:6; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 591:8).</i>
One should not recite [verses for] <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot</i> which describe [Divine] retribution;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since Rosh Hashanah is a day of judgement, we are careful not to mention any factors that might lead to negative repercussions. For this reason, no confessional prayers are recited on Rosh Hashanah, and extreme care is taken regarding all aspects of our prayers and speech.

Furthermore, the Talmud mentions that Rabbi Yosse allowed verses using the verb פקד, and although Rabbi Yehudah objected, in differences of opinion between the two, Rabbi Yosse's position is generally favored. Nevertheless, since there are many verses that use the verb זכר, there is no difficulty in establishing a practice that will be accepted by all opinions (<i>Beit Yosef</i> 591).</i> One may mention verses that refer to retribution to be visited upon the gentile nations - for example, [Psalms 99:1]: "God is King, the nations will tremble..."; [Psalms 137:7]: "Remember, O God, against the Edomites, the day of Jerusalem"; or [Zechariah 9:14]: "God, the Lord, will sound the shofar and proceed in a southerly storm-wind."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Despite this decision, only the latter verse is included in the text of the blessings we recite on Rosh Hashanah.</i><br>All the following verses: [Deuteronomy 6:4]: "Hear Israel, God is our Lord, God is one"; [Deuteronomy 4:35]: "To you, it has been revealed that you may know..."; and [Deuteronomy 4:39]: "And you shall know today and draw it close to your heart..." express the concept of God's sovereignty.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">These verses all express the oneness of God and creation; thus they emphasize how "He is unique and one, with none that compare to Him.

These are the required measurements of a sukkah: Its height<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the height of its inner space, without including the height of the <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Eruvin</i> 3b)</i> should not be less than ten handbreadths<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">anything less is not considered to be a dwelling fit for human habitation (See <i>Sukkah</i> 4a.) <i>Sukkah</i> 4b-5a derives the concept as follows: The ark and the <i>kaporet</i> covering it were ten handbreadths high. This constituted a line of demarcation between the place where the <i>Shechinah</i> was manifest and the area below it. Thus, we see that a height of ten handbreadths is sufficient for an independent area.<br>Rabbenu Manoach establishes a closer relationship between the above concept and a sukkah, noting that Exodus 25:20 describes how the wings of the cherubs "shall shield the <i>kaporet</i>," using the verb סככים, which has the same root as the word <i>s'chach</i>.

(See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:2.)</i> <br>If one draped the leaves and branches of trees [over the sukkah], and then placed <i>s'chach</i> over them, and only afterwards detached them,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachot 1 and 2, branches are fit to be used for <i>s'chach</i> only after they have been detached from their source of nurture.</i> [the following rules apply:]<br>If the amount of [kosher] <i>s'chach</i> exceeded [the branches], it is kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Though at present, the branches would be acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, as explained in the commentary on Halachah 9, the Torah requires that when <i>s'chach</i> is originally put in place, it must be kosher. Otherwise, it is unacceptable even though steps were taken to correct the disqualifying factors. This is based on the principle that one must make a sukkah and not use one which is already made.<br>Nevertheless, since the prohibition against using these branches as <i>s'chach</i> does not relate to their essential nature, their presence may be nullified when there is a majority of kosher <i>s'chach</i>. This conforms to the principle of ביטול ברב.</i> If the amount of <i>s'chach</i> which originally was kosher did not exceed [the branches],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">the presence of the branches remains halachically significant.

However, if there is a greater quantity of branches, the presence of the figs is nullified. In contrast, in this halachah, that concept is not applied.<br>Rav Avraham distinguishes between the two. In Halachah 3, the person does not intend to use the fruit for the purpose of shade; he merely wants to save the effort of removing it from the branches. Therefore, their presence may be nullified. In contrast, in this halachah the substances which are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> are being employed for the purpose of shade itself. Hence, their presence cannot be nullified.</i> [the mixture] is not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, this decision depends on the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 9b. That passage reads:A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his home...<br>Ravva said: "The above applies only to a tree whose shade is greater than its open space. However, if its open space is greater than its shade, it is kosher.<br>What difference does it make if its open space is greater than its shade, the substance not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> will be combined with the kosher <i>s'chach</i> [and therefore, the sukkah will not be acceptable]?<br>Rav Pappa said: בשחבטן.The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, the Ra'avad, and Rabbenu Manoach explain that the Rambam renders בשחבטן as "when he separated them." Thus, when the two substances were combined, the Rambam's opinion would be that the sukkah is not kosher, as explained in this clause of the halachah. When they are separate, the sukkah may be kosher according to the stipulations mentioned in the following clause of this halachah and the halachot to come.<br>(The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam renders בשחבטן as "when he severed them." However, that difference in interpretation does not result in a difference in halachah.)<br>Rashi and others interpret בשחבטן as "when he lowered them (and mixed them together with the kosher <i>s'chach</i>)." Thus, according to this opinion, the sukkah is acceptable when the kosher and non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> are mixed together. Thus, this view is diametrically opposed to the Rambam's, who maintains that such a mixture is of no avail.<br>As noted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1), there are two ways of understanding this interpretation of the passage.

If one used as <i>s'chach</i> substances that were acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> and substances that were not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, and placed them alongside each other, leaving no place with non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> more than three handbreadths in area,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">so that even in a small sukkah, all the conditions mentioned in the above halachot are met, there is a further requirement before the sukkah is considered kosher.</i> [the following rules apply:]<br>If the total of the kosher <i>s'chach</i> exceeds that of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, it is kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This concept can be derived from the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 1:8): "If someone places iron staves or the frames of a bed as the roof of his sukkah, it is kosher, provided there is an equivalent amount of empty space."<br>In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam emphasizes that the word "equivalent" should be interpreted loosely, since there must be more kosher <i>s'chach</i> than the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>.</i> If there was an exactly equal amount of both substances, it is not acceptable<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This decision has raised questions from all authorities.

This implies that were it possible to know that the kosher <i>s'chach</i> is exactly equal to the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, it would be acceptable.

Though the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> attempts to justify the use of the term, his arguments seem forced. However, it must be noted that most manuscripts and printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as well as the Rambam's and most other texts of the source for this halachah - the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:2 - include this word.</i> the lower sukkah is kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">for the reason that since its roof is of no functional purpose, it is not considered an intervening substance between the sukkah and the upper <i>s'chach</i>.</i> This applies provided the height of both together does not exceed twenty cubits,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">the maximum height of the sukkah, as stated in Chapter 4, Halachah 1.</i> since [use of] the lower sukkah is permitted because of the <i>s'chach</i> of the upper one.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> - and also in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 628:1) - Rav Yosef Karo explains that this applies only when the <i>s'chach</i> of the lower sukkah is not substantial enough to allow the use of the sukkah.

Indeed, the simple meaning of the Rambam's words implies the very opposite. Furthermore, in his commentary on the Mishnah [<i>Sukkah</i> 1:1], the Rambam explains that the reason <i>s'chach</i> placed higher than 20 cubits is unacceptable is that it makes the sukkah into a permanent dwelling.

A borrowed sukkah is fit [to be used on the holiday].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Although, as stated in Chapter 8, Halachah 10, a person cannot fulfill the mitzvah of lulav as prescribed by the Torah with a lulav belonging to a colleague, that concept does not apply with regard to a sukkah.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 27b explains the derivation of this concept as follows: Leviticus 23:42 states: "Every citizen of Israel shall dwell in sukkot." The latter word is written סכת, implying one sukkah. This prompted our Sages to declare: "All Israel are fit to dwell in a single sukkah."<br>In his commentary, Rashi explains that the cost of such a sukkah would not be high enough to require every individual to pay a penny's worth. Hence, we must assume that some people would be using a borrowed sukkah, and, nevertheless, our Sages said that it was kosher.</i> Similarly, a stolen sukkah is also fit [for use].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There is a slight imprecision with the Rambam's statements. A stolen object which the thief is obligated to return cannot be used to perform a mitzvah, because it is considered a mitzvah that came about through a sin (מצוה הבאה בעבירה). However, in the instances cited by the Rambam, the sukkah itself is never considered stolen property. Hence, the use of such a sukkah is not forbidden. However, in a number of instances (see below), the sukkah itself is considered to be stolen property and must be returned. Hence, it cannot be used to fulfill the mitzvah.</i><br>What does the latter imply? If a person attacked a colleague, forced him to leave his sukkah, stole it, and dwelled in it, the attacker has fulfilled his obligation, because landed property cannot be stolen.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 8:14 relates that "landed property is never acquired by a thief, but rather remains in the possession of its owner forever."<br>Since the sukkah is built on the land, it is considered part of the property and the above rule applies to it as well. Thus, the sukkah is still considered to be the property of its original owner and the thief is viewed as merely "borrowing" the sukkah from him. As mentioned above, use of a borrowed sukkah is permitted.</i><br>[Similarly,] if he stole wood and made a sukkah from it, he has fulfilled his obligation,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 31a relates that a woman once came to Rav Nachman complaining that the exilarch's servants had stolen wood from her to build his sukkah.<br>Rav Nachman answered that they had, nevertheless, fulfilled their obligation...</i> because the Sages ordained that the owner of the wood is entitled only to the monetary worth of the wood.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">but not the wood itself. Thus, the sukkah itself is the property of the thief. Though he is obligated to pay the owner for his wood, that obligation does not prevent the sukkah from being considered as his.<br><i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 1:5 explains this principle by stating:Anyone who steals is obligated to return the stolen property itself... If it was lost or changed, he is obligated to return its monetary value...<br>Even if one steals a beam and builds a mansion [using it], since [the beam] has not been changed, the Torah law would require him to destroy the entire building and return the beam to its owner.<br>Nevertheless, the Sages instituted a decree [to encourage] those who repent; they ordained that all that is necessary is for him to return [the beam's] monetary value, and thus he will not forfeit his building.Rabbenu Manoach asks: Since the mitzvah of sukkah is commanded by the Torah, and Torah law regards these boards as stolen, how can the Sages' decree change their status in this context?<br>He explains that, as implied by the principle הפקר הפקר בית דין, the Torah has granted the Sages the right to determine the status of property. Their decree can alter entirely a person's rights to its title. Thus, in the present case, since Rabbinic law entitles the thief to use of the boards, he is permitted, according to Torah law, to use them as a Sukkah.<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (637:5) writes that if the thief refuses to pay for the wood, it is considered to be the property of its original owner, and the thief does not fulfill his obligation.</i> Even if one stole boards and merely put them in place without attaching them or changing anything about them, he has fulfilled his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is a special leniency granted out of respect for the mitzvah of sukkah (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.). Since the thief has not made any changes in the wood itself or built a permanent structure from it, the Rabbinic decree mentioned above would not apply. Thus, during the rest of the year (and even in this case, after the Sukkot festival), the wood would have to be returned. During the festival, the Sages considered it to be the property of the thief and he is allowed to use without any constraints throughout the festival (<i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i>, ibid.).<br>Nevertheless, in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 637:3), Rav Yosef Karo gives two examples of a stolen sukkah which one is forbidden to use: a sukkah that had been constructed on a ship or one that had been constructed on a wagon. Since the thief did not build anything, the abovementioned Rabbinic decree does not apply; nor are they affixed to land, and hence the principle that landed property cannot be stolen is not relevant.</i><br>If a person constructs his sukkah in the public domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Though the Jewish inhabitants of the city would surely not object to use of public property for this purpose, the gentile inhabitants of the city would.

From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he accepts this view.<br>Support for this premise can be derived from the Rambam's decision in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who ate a small meal can fulfill his obligation by listening to a child reciting the grace after meals (for both are obligated by virtue of Rabbinic decree).

Leviticus 23:42 states: "You shall dwell in sukkot (תשבו בסכת)." On that verse, <i>Sukkah</i> 26a comments: תשבו כעין תדורו - i.e., dwelling in the sukkah is comparable to living in one's own home. Thus, a person is not required to dwell in a sukkah under circumstances which would cause him to leave his own home.<br>Since a person who is sick would seek the most comfortable lodgings possible and would not camp outside, he is not obligated to do so to fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah (Rabbenu Manoach).</i> or a sore eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 26a relates that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel was granted permission to sleep outside the sukkah for this purpose.<br>The Torah's prohibitions are suspended not only when a person's life is in danger, but also when a particular limb might be lost. Though this premise is accepted by the Rambam (see <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 2:4), it does not appear that he is referring to it here. Rather, it seems that he means a minor ailment comparable to a headache.

Just as a person would seek out a comfortable permanent dwelling, he is obligated to dwell only in a sukkah which does not cause him unpleasantness.<br>Rabbenu Manoach states that this leniency does not apply on the first night of Sukkot, on which there is a binding obligation to eat in the sukkah.

A mourner<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The term אבל refers to a person in the seven days of mourning which follow the burial of a father, mother, wife, brother, sister, son, or daughter. An אונן (a person in mourning for these relatives before their burial) is freed from the obligation of sukkah, because he is absolved of the duty to perform all mitzvot (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 4:6).<br>It must be noted that none of the mourning rites should be followed during a festival. If a close relative dies before the festival, the <i>shiv'ah</i> (seven days of mourning) is completed at the festival's commencement, even though all seven days have not passed (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 10:3, 8).</i> is obligated [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 25b explains that a mourner (אבל) is obligated to fulfill all the mitzvot.

Therefore, the Talmud includes a special teaching to emphasize the mourner's obligation, explaining that one is absolved only for discomfort which comes from external factors. In this case, the mourner brings discomfort upon himself. He should compose himself and concentrate his attention on the mitzvah.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (640:13) writes that if dwelling in a sukkah will cause a mourner more discomfort than dwelling in his home, he is allowed to choose the latter alternative.</i><br>A groom,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">because he is involved in the mitzvah of marriage. <i>Sukkah</i> 25b adds that generally, a sukkah is to small to carry out the wedding celebrations in the proper manner.

Emissaries charged with a mission involving a mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., to study Torah, to greet a Sage under whom one studied Torah, or to redeem captives (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 25a).</i> are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah] of sukkah<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., they are not required to eat, sleep, or perform any of the activities in a sukkah described in Halachot 5-9.</i> both during the day and at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Sukkah</i> 25a, 26a) states that this applies even when they are lodging overnight. Since, at night they are also involved with thinking about how to fulfill the mitzvah, they are still considered as occupied with the performance of a mitzvah and are not required to seek out a sukkah. An example of this principle quoted by the Talmud supports this interpretation: When Rav Chisda and Rabbah bar Rav Huna would attend [the lecture delivered] at the home of the exilarch on the Sabbath of the festival, they would sleep along the river banks of Sura. They explained: "We are emissaries involved in a mitzvah" (<i>Sukkah</i> 26a).<br>Though these Sages were visiting a city which served as a center of Jewish life and surely could have found a sukkah to lodge in, they did not see the necessity for doing so. (See also <i>Sukkah</i> 10b.)<br>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 10b, interprets the passage differently and explains that leniency is granted these emissaries only when dwelling in the sukkah would in some way prevent them from carrying out the mitzvah which they set out to perform. If it is possible to do both - perform the mitzvah they set out to do and fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah - one must endeavor to do so.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam shares Rashi's view. However, the final halachic position followed by most Ashkenazic authorities is closer to <i>Tosafot</i>'s position: i.e., these emissaries are not obligated to trouble themselves to find a sukkah. However, if there is a sukkah available, they should make use of it. Nevertheless, if sleeping in the sukkah would prevent them from getting proper rest, and thus hold them back from fulfilling their mitzvah in a proper manner, they are not required to sleep in a sukkah (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:18; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 640:38).<br>(Abstractly, it is possible to differentiate between the two positions as follows. According to Rashi, there is no obligation of sukkah incumbent on this person whatsoever. In contrast, <i>Tosafot</i> would maintain that the person is obligated to perform the mitzvah.

In contrast, it is customary in many communities not to bring pots into the sukkah, even while eating (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:5). [Needless to say, plates that must be washed must be removed from the sukkah.]<br>The printed (as opposed to certain manuscripts) text of Rashi (<i>Sukkah</i> 29a) also shares the Rambam's interpretation. <i>Tosafot</i> explains the passage slightly differently, rendering "utensils used for food" as "utensils used in the preparation of food" - i.e., pots and pans.</i> A candelabra<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the source of light</i> [should be brought] to the sukkah.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">even when it is not burning, since it is attractive.</i> However, if the sukkah is small, it should be left outside the sukkah.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">lest it cause a fire (<i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i>, ibid.). This differs from Rashi's interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i>, ibid., which explains that the Talmud is referring to an earthenware lamp. Thus, we may assume that it should not be brought into the sukkah because it is unattractive. This, appears to justify the statements of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, who writes that the lamp should not be brought into the sukkah when it is not burning. Both opinions are quoted by the later halachic authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:3; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:7-8).</i>
We should eat, drink, and sleep in the sukkah through the entire seven days [of the festival], both during the day and at night.

The same principles are also applied to cooked foods made from the five species of grain.</i><br>One may not sleep outside the sukkah at all, even a brief nap.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to eating, where there is a difference between a fixed meal and a snack, no such difference exists regarding sleep. At times, even a rest of a few moments can have a major effect on a person. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 26a; Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:5.)<br>At present, there are many communities where leniency is taken in this regard. In some climates, the cold will cause everyone to consider sleeping in the sukkah as uncomfortable and, hence, they are freed of that obligation. Furthermore, in many communities, there is also a danger involved. In addition, if a husband would sleep in a sukkah, he would deprive his wife of some of the happiness and satisfaction that should accompany a festival. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:2.)<br>Nevertheless, many authorities explain that these leniencies apply only at night, but during the day one is obligated to sleep in the sukkah.</i> It is permissible to drink water<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">or any other beverage, including wine (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:2), outside the sukkah. There is a difference of opinion among the later halachic authorities if this decision also applies when one sits down to a party centering on drinking wine (קובע עצמו לשתות). Some (the <i>Bach</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:12) require that such drinking be carried out in a sukkah. However, others (the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:13) are more lenient.</i> and eat fruit outside the sukkah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">for these do not constitute a significant meal.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 27a relates that Rabbi Elazar ben Shamu'a ate dates and grapes outside the sukkah, because "fruit does not require a sukkah."<br>Rabbenu Manoach and some other commentaries maintain that this leniency applies only to fruit. In contrast, meat, fish, cheese, and other substantial foods which form the basis of a meal must be eaten in a sukkah. While many later halachic authorities do not accept this view, some maintain that one should not sit down with company to a meal of such foods outside a sukkah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:11; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:15.)</i> However, a person who follows the stringency of not drinking even water outside the sukkah is worthy of praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">To exemplify this principle, the Mishnah (ibid.) quotes the following:Once they brought a cooked dish for Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai to taste, and two dates and a pitcher of water for Rabban Gamliel. They said: "Take them up to the sukkah."<i>Sukkah</i> 26b explains that often our Sages counselled against accepting extra stringencies upon oneself, lest one take pride in one's piety. However, in this instance they make no such reservations.</i>
Eating in the sukkah on the first night of the festival is an obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 27a draws an analogy between the first night of Sukkot and the first night of Pesach. Just as eating a <i>k'zayit</i> of matzah on the fifteenth of Nisan is a mitzvah, so too, each Jewish male is required to eat in the sukkah on the fifteenth of Tishre.</i> If a person eats merely a <i>k'zayit</i> of bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the minimum amount required by the Torah in all mitzvot that involve eating.

Afterwards, [the matter is left to one's] volition.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The difference in the requirement between the first night and the remaining days has other ramifications. As mentioned in Halachah 2, a person who is uncomfortable in the sukkah is freed from his obligation. However, this leniency applies only on the first night after the mitzvah of eating a <i>k'zayit</i> has been fulfilled (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:3).</i> If one desires to eat a meal,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">including bread, or according to some authorities, other hearty foods, as mentioned above</i> one must eat it in the sukkah. If one desires, throughout the seven [days of the festival], one may eat only fruit or roasted grain<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">which may be eaten...</i> outside of the sukkah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Lechem Yehudah</i> explains that the Rambam is speaking only from the perspective of the mitzvah of sukkah. However, one is obligated to eat three meals on the Sabbath as an expression of the mitzvah of honoring the Sabbath and taking pleasure in its celebration. (See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:9.) Similarly, one is required to eat festive meals on the first day of Sukkot in honor of the holiday. These meals must be eaten in the sukkah.</i> The same laws apply as those regarding the eating of matzah on Pesach.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's intent is that, as explained in <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:1, after the first night of the festival a person is not obligated to eat matzah and may subsist on other foods. Similarly, on Sukkot one may eat foods that do not require consumption within a sukkah.<br>However, according to most authorities, his choice of words is not exact. The mitzvah of sukkah differs from that of matzah. In the latter instance, there is no mitzvah involved in eating matzah after the first night of the holiday. In contrast, every activity performed in the sukkah constitutes a further fulfillment of the mitzvah.<br>Accordingly, after the first night of the festival no special blessing is recited before partaking of matzah. In contrast, as stated in Halachah 12, a blessing is recited every time we make use of the sukkah. See also the Moznaim publication of <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:1.</i>
It is forbidden for a person to sit and eat with his head and the majority of his body inside a sukkah while his table is in his home or outside the sukkah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:6) records a difference of opinion on this matter between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel. In this instance, the halachah follows the School of Shammai.</i> It is considered as if he did not eat inside the sukkah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah (ibid.) continues:An incident occurred when the elders of the School of Shammai and the elders of the School of Hillel went to visit Rabbi Yochanan ben Hachoroni and found him sitting with his head and the majority of his body in the sukkah while his table was in his house...<br>The elders of the School of Shammai told him: "If this has been your practice, you have never fulfilled the mitzvah of sukkah."Rabbenu Nissim questions how the Sages' decree can negate the fulfillment of a mitzvah, and thus explains the last phrase to mean: "You have never fulfilled the mitzvah as desired by our Sages." However, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 3a explains that the Sages' decree is powerful enough to nullify the person's actions entirely, and it is considered as if he never fulfilled the mitzvah at all.</i> [Rather,] the table must also be inside the sukkah. This was decreed lest one be drawn after one's table. This law applies even in a large sukkah.
Throughout the seven days [of the festival], a person should read in the sukkah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since the person must regard his sukkah as his home throughout the festival, in addition to eating and sleeping, he must perform all his other day-to-day functions inside of it. Hence, he should also read in the sukkah.</i> However, when he attempts to comprehend what he reads in depth and appreciate its details, he should do so outside the sukkah,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> explains that any time it is necessary to study a concept in depth, one should do so outside the sukkah...</i> so that his mind will be settled.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">while he studies. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 639:13 adds a further reason to study at home: the difficulty in bringing one's texts back and forth from the sukkah.

If he is as comfortable studying in the sukkah as studying at home, he is obligated to do so.</i><br>When a person prays,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">at a time when he is unable to pray in the synagogue (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 639:14)</i> he may pray inside the sukkah or outside the sukkah, as he desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">depending on where he will be able to concentrate more.</i>
If rain descends, a person may enter his home.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The descent of rain on Sukkot implies that our actions are not desired by God. The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:8) compares the matter to a servant who came to serve his master drink and the latter poured the pitcher in his face.<br><i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there is a fundamental difference between this law and the case of a person who is uncomfortable while in the sukkah. In the latter instance, in essence, the person is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. However, because of his discomfort, his obligation is temporarily waived. In contrast, when rain descends it is impossible to fulfill the mitzvah at all, because the sukkah is not fit to dwell in. Hence, there is no obligation whatsoever.<br>There is a practical difference between these two abstract positions regarding the question whether a person is obligated to eat in the sukkah on the first night of the holiday even when it rains. (See the commentary on Halachah 7.) According to the <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, under these circumstances there is no mitzvah which one is required to fulfill. Thus, one may eat at home. In contrast, most authorities do not differentiate between rain and other uncomfortable situations. Thus, since eating in the sukkah on that night is a binding obligation, they require a person to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>There is a further aspect to this concept. The Maharil explains that a person who eats in a sukkah when he is not obligated to do so is a simple person and receives no reward for his "piety." On this basis, in many communities, people make no effort to stay in the sukkah when it rains. In contrast, there are some communities where people will continue to eat in the sukkah despite pouring rain.<br>What is the difference between these two approaches? The first approach follows the perspective that, during the rain, there is no mitzvah to dwell in the sukkah whatsoever. Hence, there is no need to strain oneself to remain there. In contrast, the second perspective does not differentiate between rain and any other uncomfortable circumstances, but maintains that, in essence, dwelling in the sukkah is a mitzvah even under such circumstances. Accordingly, they remain in the sukkah, because while they are involved in fulfilling God's will they do not feel even the slightest trace of discomfort.</i> When is one permitted to leave [the sukkah]?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Maharil writes that when a person is forced to leave the sukkah because of rain, he should depart with humility rather than with anger.</i> When enough raindrops descend into the sukkah so that they would spoil a cooked dish<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">We need not wait until the food actually spoils.

However, the Ramah includes this leniency.</i>
A person should not take apart his sukkah after he finishes eating on the seventh day [of Sukkot].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lest he require it later during the day.</i> However, from the afternoon on, he may take down his utensils and remove them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Keeping one's utensils in the sukkah is included in the mitzvah of dwelling within it, as mentioned in Halachah 5.

Whenever a person enters a sukkah with the intention of sitting down throughout the seven [days of Sukkot], he should recite the following blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Note the commentary on Halachah 7, which explains the difference between this law and the rules governing the blessing recited before eating matzah.</i> before sitting:<br>[Blessed<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam maintains that by sitting or doing any other activity which one would perform in one's home in the sukkah, one fulfills the mitzvah. Hence, the blessing is recited before one performs the mitzvah, as required by <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:2.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions why the blessing is not recited before one enters the sukkah, noting that the interpretation of the command לישב בסוכה is "to dwell in the sukkah," not "to sit in the sukkah." However, the <i>Taz</i> 643:2 explains that merely passing through the sukkah is not part of the mitzvah. Rather, one must perform an activity that reflects "dwelling." Hence, the blessing is not recited until one sits down, because previously it is not obvious that one wants to perform a significant activity in the sukkah.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision, maintaining that one should recite the blessing only before partaking of a meal in the sukkah. This reflects the decision of the Ashkenazic authorities, who maintain that though the performance of all one's activities in the sukkah is a mitzvah, it is not customary to recite the blessing except when eating. When reciting the blessing on that occasion, one should intend to include all other activities.

This blessing is recited whenever one performs a mitzvah that can be fulfilled only from time to time (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:9).<br>That halachah and, similarly, <i>Sukkah</i> 46a, imply that, at the outset, one should recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> upon construction of the sukkah. Though the Rambam makes no mention of that concept here, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 641:1) states that one should have the construction of the sukkah in mind when reciting <i>shehecheyanu</i> at night.</i><br>One should recite all the blessings over a cup of wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">as did Rav Kahana (<i>Sukkah</i> 46a).</i> Thus, one should recite <i>kiddush</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">for the festival</i> while standing,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 643:2) states that kiddush may be recited while sitting.</i> recite the blessing <i>leishev basukkah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Though one might presume that <i>shehecheyanu</i> would be recited first, since it is more frequent, precedence is given to <i>leishev basukkah</i>, because it is "the mitzvah of the day" (Rabbenu Manoach).</i> sit, and then recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">On the second night, it is Ashkenazic custom to recite to the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> before the blessing <i>leishev basukkah</i>, since on that occasion the blessing is associated with the celebration of the festival and not the mitzvah of sukkah.

Indeed, in Halachot 11 and 14, we find certain safeguards instituted because of this commandment. Nevertheless, dwelling in the sukkah on the eighth day does not constitute a violation of this commandment, because the time when the mitzvah is to be performed has already passed. Placing a fifth passage in one's tefillin during the day violates this commandment, because we are obligated to perform the mitzvah at this time. However, once the seven days of Sukkot pass, there is no mitzvah associated with the sukkah whatsoever (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28b).<br>Nevertheless, many Ashkenazic authorities would carry out additional safeguards regarding this matter. For example, the <i>Tur</i> relates (though he opposes this practice himself) that some follow the custom of eating in the Sukkah only on the day of Shemini Atzeret, but not the night. Many of the Rabbis who would sleep in the Sukkah throughout the festival refrain from doing so on Shemini Atzeret.

However, the blessing is a Rabbinic requirement; hence, there is no necessity in reciting it. Furthermore, by reciting the blessing when one is not required, one uses God's name in vain.<br>This perspective is not accepted by all authorities. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Ashkenazic practice is to allow women and others who are not obligated in the performance of a mitzvah to recite a blessing when fulfilling it.<br>The above applies only regarding the doubts concerning the obligations of a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i>.

The term "the frond of the date palm" employed by the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 23:40.</i> refers to the branches of a date palm<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> questions whether or not the tree from which the lulav is taken must actually produce dates.</i> as they sprout, before their leaves separate<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, if the leaves spread out and were later bound together by human activity, it is not acceptable (Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 645:2).</i> and spread out in various directions.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Periodically, the date palm sprouts forth new branches. Initially they are closed, and as time passes they spread out to a fanlike shape. The Torah requires that they be used for the lulav while they are still in their initial state.<br>This obligation is derived from the fact that the Torah spells the word כפת, without a ו, implying that the date branch should appear to be a single entity (<i>Sukkah</i> 32a).<br>There is a homiletic aspect to using the lulav while its leaves are closed. <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 30:12 emphasizes how the mitzvah of lulav and etrog expresses the unity and oneness which pervade the Jewish people. Not only is this unity expressed by the combination of the four species into a single mitzvah, it is reflected in each of the species themselves. Thus, the lulav is used while its leaves are together as one, before they separate into distinct entities.</i> Rather, they should appear as a scepter.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Here, too, our Sages have emphasized the homiletic lesson to be derived from this shape. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are days of judgement. The lulav can be considered as the Jews' scepter of victory, acknowledging that they have prevailed (<i>Medrash Tanchumah, Emor</i>).</i> This is called a lulav.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is called a lulav.</i>
The "fruit of the beautiful tree" mentioned in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus, ibid.</i> is the etrog.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 35a explains that this term is used to refer to the etrog because of a unique quality possessed by this fruit.

Alternatively, the word הדר can be interpreted to mean "which dwells," and thus refer to the etrog, which can grow on the tree for an entire year.</i><br>The "boughs of covered trees" mentioned in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus, ibid.</i> refer to the [species of] myrtle whose leaves surround its branch;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">thus, covering the branch</i> i.e., there will be three or more leaves in each ring.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">on the same level.<br>Our translation follows the interpretation of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, who requires that the three leaves be on the same level over the entire length of the myrtle. However, other opinions interpret the Rambam's words to mean that a myrtle may be used if the leaves of merely one ring are on the same level. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (and similarly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 646:5) maintain that a myrtle is kosher if the leaves grow properly over three handbreadths (its minimum size), or at least the majority of that distance.</i> However, if there are two leaves on one level, with a third leaf slightly higher than them, that is not considered to be "covered."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">but rather from a different species of tree.

The term "willows of the brook" mentioned by the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus, ibid.</i> does not include just any plant that grows by a brook, but rather a particular species, which is called the "willows of the brook."<br>Its<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">That species is defined as follows:</i> leaf is extended as a brook,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., it comes to a point, rather than being rounded (<i>Sukkah</i> 33b).<br>This characteristic is also quoted as an explanation of the name "willows of the brook" (Rabbenu Asher).</i> its edge is smooth,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">rather than jagged (<i>Sukkah</i> ibid.).</i> and its stem is red.

Hence, the purchaser should carefully examine the willows before purchasing them.</i><br>All the above definitions were explained according to the oral tradition transmitted by Moses, our teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, in his introduction to his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam uses the definitions of the four species as examples of how the oral tradition is explained in the Talmud:The explanations which we have received from Moses are not contested at all. Throughout all the ages, from Moses' time until the present, we have not heard of a dispute started by a Sage whether... the expression "a fruit from a beautiful tree" refers to the etrog. Nor have we heard of a dispute that the "covered tree" refers to the myrtle...<br>Concerning these and the like, it has been said: "The entire Torah, [both the mitzvot] in general, and all their particulars were given to Moses on Mount Sinai." Though the tradition was received and there is no dispute about it, one can also derive these definitions through the accepted processes of exegesis.<br>Thus, when the Talmud debates and discusses a concept and offers a suggestion...that perhaps, "the fruit of the beautiful tree" is a pomegranate...[and does not resolve the matter] until they bring proof from the exegesis of the verse..., one should not conclude that the matter was left in doubt until this point of exegesis was discovered.<br>Rather, from the time of Joshua onward, we saw that the etrog was the species taken with the lulav and there is no debate about that. They were merely investigating how they could find support from the Torah for the interpretation that had been transmitted.</i>
These four species are considered to be one mitzvah,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to putting on the head tefillin and the arm tefillin, which are considered to be two mitzvot.

The most desirable way of performing the mitzvah is to bind the lulav, myrtle, and willow together, thus making a single, unified entity from the three of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 11b explains that binding the three species together is considered more attractive than taking them each individually.

The preference of the Rabbis for binding the species together is so great that if one has not bound them together before the beginning of the festival, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651:1) recommends binding them together with a loop on the holiday rather than taking each one individually.</i> However, if he has only one species or he is lacking one species, he should not take them until he acquires the remaining species.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">as explained in the previous halachah.</i>
How many does one take of each of them?

In contrast to the other species, the myrtle is considered an adornment of the mitzvah. Since the extra myrtle branches are viewed as adornments, they are not considered to be an intervening substance separating the person from the mitzvah. (See the commentary on Halachah 11.) Nor is including them considered to be adding to the mitzvah (and thus, a violation of בל תוסיף). (See also Rabbenu Nissim and the Rashba, Vol. I, Responsum 535.)<br>There are some authorities who allow additional myrtle branches to be included even though they do not meet the requirement of having all three leaves on the same level. However, others do not accept this leniency (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:15).</i> However, it is forbidden to add to or reduce the numbers of the other species.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">because they are not considered to be "adornments."</i> If one adds to or reduces their number, it is not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to this statement, arguing that the adding to the numbers of the other species does not nullify the performance of the mitzvah. Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, writes that, based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 88b, the Rambam amended his own manuscript copy of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> to state "it does not nullify it" (<i>Birkat Avraham</i> 31).</i>
What is the required length of each of these species?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 650:8 states that if the species are smaller than the minimum limits established, they may not be used throughout the festival.

However, since all three handbreadths of the lulav must be shaken (see the following two halachot) an additional handbreadth was required for the person to hold the lulav in his hand (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah).<br>[Rashi and most other commentaries based on <i>Sukkah</i> 32b consider the handbreadth of the lulav that extends beyond the myrtle and the willow as the addition included "so that it can be shaken." From the latter clauses of this halachah, it appears that the Rambam may have also adopted this interpretation.]<br>A handbreadth is 8 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 9.6 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>. In his commentary on the above Mishnah, the Rambam emphasizes that the measure refers to three full handbreadths, each four fingerbreadths in length. This is necessary to negate the opinion of certain authorities (see the Ra'avad), who state that here the intent is three "small" handbreadths, so that the total length is only 10 fingerbreadths.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 650:1) accepts the Ra'avad's opinion.

Indeed, in general, this clause appears to be more closely related to the principles mentioned in the following chapter, where the Rambam mentions the characteristics that disqualify the various species, rather than in this chapter, where he relates the fundamental requirements of each one. Based on <i>Sukkah</i> 34a, which relates that myrtles which are not dry (a factor still common in many Diaspora communities today) are very difficult to find, we can interpret this as an almost parenthetical expression teaching that freshness is not among the fundamental requirements for a myrtle.]</i><br>If one has bound [the other species together with] the lulav, the <i>shidrah</i> of the lulav must extend beyond the myrtle and the willow a handbreadth or more.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam maintains that regardless of the length of the myrtles and the willows, the <i>shidrah</i> of the lulav must extend beyond them an additional handbreadth, so that it can be shaken.

Why was this decree not put in effect on the first day of the festival? Because [taking the lulav on that day] is a mitzvah from the Torah even outside of Jerusalem.

Hence, the Sages did not feel that the fear that perhaps a person might carry the lulav in the public domain was sufficient reason to nullify the mitzvah. In contrast, on the subsequent days the mitzvah is not considered to be so severe a matter. Hence, the mitzvah could be nullified in Jerusalem as well.<br>The Rabbis question why the Sages differentiated between the lulav and the shofar, and (as explained in Halachah 2:6), nullified the mitzvah of hearing the shofar when Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath. As explained in our commentary on that halachah, in Rabbenu Nissim's commentary on the tractate of <i>Sukkah</i>, he states that this decree was instituted only because in most Jewish communities, the people were not aware of the date the court had established for Rosh Hashanah. (Note the details of the explanation there.)</i> because on the subsequent days of the festival a person is obligated to take the lulav only in the holy place.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, while the Temple was standing, the lulav would not be taken outside Jerusalem during the subsequent days of the festival.</i>
When the Temple was destroyed, [the Sages] ordained that the lulav be taken everywhere for the entire seven days of the festival, as a remembrance of the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 41a explains the source for the establishment of remembrances for the Temple practices:[Jeremiah 30:17] states: "'I will restore health to you.

Zion, for whom no one cares.'<br>The verse states "for whom no one cares," implying that a show of our care is required.On this basis, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai established a number of practices in remembrance of the Temple practices.</i><br>On each day,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">but only once a day (Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:5).</i> one recites the blessing on it:<br><i>[Baruch Attah Ado-nai...] asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu al netilat lulav.</i><br>because<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 6, the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15 that it is preferable to conclude the blessing, <i>litol lulav</i>.

The communities which received this information before the Sukkot festival celebrated the holidays for only one day. They would be allowed to take the lulav when the first day of Sukkot fell on the Sabbath.<br><i>Sukkot</i> 41b relates:When the first day of the festival fell on the Sabbath, everyone would bring their lulav to the synagogue [on Friday]. On the following day, everyone would recognize his lulav and take it.This was the practice outside Jerusalem. <i>Sukkot</i> 42b describes the practice in the Temple.They would bring their lulavim to the Temple Mount [on Friday]. The attendants would take them from them and place them on benches. The elders would place their lulavim in chambers. They would teach them to say: "Whoever receives my lulav may consider it as a gift."<br>In the morning, they would arise and come [to the Temple]. The attendants would throw [the lulavim] to the people. They would grab them from one another and even come to violence. When the court saw that the situation was becoming dangerous, they ordained that each person should take [the lulav] in his own home.</i> However, the places which were distantly removed from Jerusalem<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">and were not informed of the day on which Rosh Hashanah had fallen, would celebrate two days.

Accordingly, they were willing to decree that many Jews forego the performance of a mitzvah from the Torah, in order to establish uniformity throughout the Jewish people.</i> [The guiding principle was] that the obligation [of taking the lulav] on the first day applies in all places,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">and the people in the distant communities could not take the lulav when the first day fell on the Sabbath because of the doubt involved</i> and there is no longer a Temple to use as a point of distinction.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., while the Temple was standing, the difference in practice between the people living in places where the date of the month was known and those where it was not known could be explained because everyone knew that the lulav was taken on the first day in the Temple. However, when the Temple was destroyed, there was no point of distinction, and the Sages established a totally uniform practice.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions why Sages did not institute the celebration of the second day of each festival in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as well. If their desire for uniformity of observance was so great, why did they not establish a single practice in this regard as well?<br>He explains that the Sages were more reluctant to exercise their authority when they had to establish a new practice (קום ועשה) - celebrating an additional day as a festival - than when all that was necessary was to have the people refrain from the performance of a mitzvah (שב ועל תעשה), as in the case of the lulav.<br>Another concept can be derived from this halachah. The Hebrew word translated as Temple - מקדש - is used by the Rambam to refer to the entire city of Jerusalem. Thus, we can infer from the statement "there is no longer a מקדש" that this distinction is conferred on the holy city only while the Temple is standing.</i>
At present, when everyone follows a fixed calendar,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5 of <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i>.</i> the matter remains as it was, and the lulav is not taken on the Sabbath in the outlying territories or in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">or in Jerusalem</i> even on the first day [of the festival].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">when the obligation to do so is from the Torah itself.</i> [This applies] even though everyone knows the actual day of the month.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned regarding the celebration of the second day of a festival (<i>Beitzah</i> 4b; <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 5:5), according to Torah law this practice should not be followed.

The Willow Branches Placed Around The Temple Altar<br>How was this mitzvah performed?<br>On each of the seven days [of the festival], branches of willows were brought<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">from Motza, a small town slightly west of Jerusalem (<i>Sukkah</i> 45a).</i> and stood upright near the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">From this fact, Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> conclude that the willows were taken by priests only because Israelites were not allowed to approach the Temple altar.</i> with their tops bent over the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These willow branches were eleven cubits high and were placed on the base of the altar.<br>Afterwards, they would be taken by the people, as stated in the following halachah.

All the species which we categorized as unacceptable because of the blemishes we described<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 36b relates that Rabbi Chanina would eat from an etrog and then use it for the mitzvah.

From this incident, our Sages concluded that, on the later days, even such an etrog is kosher.<br>According to the Rambam's opinion, the same applies to all other physical blemishes on the species. Since there is no greater blemish than an etrog which is bitten into, none of the requirements for "beauty" must be observed on the later days.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 29b and Rabbenu Asher maintain that this leniency applies only to etrogim which are lacking in substance.

However, those who follow the first opinion (the Ra'avad, the Ramban, Rabbenu Asher) forbid the use of stolen species on the later days as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) quotes the Rambam, while the Ramah follows the other view.<br>[Though the above explanation is frequently used, it is difficult to accept. First, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam mentions the reason of מצוה הבאה בעבירה. Also, in <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:7 and in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach</i> 5:7 and 5:9, he forbids the use of stolen articles for the performance of a commandment. In addition, he has not yet mentioned the halachah requiring one to own the lulav used on the first day.<br>The <i>Taz</i> (649:15) clarifies the matter slightly further by explaining that since taking the lulav on the second day is only a Rabbinic commandment, using a stolen lulav is allowed even though it is a מצוה הבאה בעבירה.]</i> On the second day of the festival<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of the Rambam's words are "from the second holiday," implying that these leniencies are granted even in the Diaspora, where the second day is celebrated as a holiday. Though all the laws of the holiday apply on the second day as well as the first, this applies only to the laws of the holiday itself. In contrast, in other contexts, since we follow a fixed calendar and know that the holidays fall on their appropriate dates, the restrictions applying to the first day do not apply on the subsequent days (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>Rabbenu Asher differs and maintains that all the restrictions that apply to the lulav on the first day must also be observed on the second day as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 649:5) writes that all the species disqualified on the first day may be taken on the second day, but a blessing should not be recited.</i> and on the other days,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chol Hamo'ed</i>, when all opinions agree that...</i> they are all kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">they are all kosher.</i><br> Those which are disqualified because of the association with idol worship<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">mentioned in Halachah 1</i> or because the etrog is forbidden to be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">as mentioned in Halachah 2</i> are unacceptable both on the first day and on the later days.
On the first day of the festival,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It appears from the Rambam's statements that even in Jerusalem, where Torah law requires that the mitzvah be fulfilled for all seven days of the festival, the obligation to own the lulav applies only on the first day.</i> a person cannot fulfill his obligation by using a lulav that belongs to a colleague and was borrowed from him,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the commentary on the previous halachah, the Biblical source for the mitzvah of taking the four species, Leviticus 23:40, states: "On the first day, take for yourself the fruit of a beautiful tree..." The phrase "for yourself" implies that a person must own the species he uses for the mitzvah (<i>Sukkah</i> 41b).<br>As mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 25, a borrowed sukkah may be used on the holiday. Though Deuteronomy 16:13 states "Celebrate the Sukkot holiday for yourself for seven days." In this context, only a stolen sukkah is disqualified and a borrowed sukkah is permitted (<i>Sukkah</i> 27b).<br>Since in both cases, the source for the exclusion is the same phrase, one might ask why the laws pertaining to each are different. Many explain that since, as explained in the commentary to that halachah, the Torah includes a special verse to teach us that a borrowed sukkah is permitted, the scope of the exclusion implied by "for yourself" is limited.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 637:3 explains that since the person owning the sukkah grants his colleague the use of it, the borrowed sukkah can be considered "as his own." Since a person has to treat a sukkah as his permanent dwelling for the seven days of the holiday, it follows that the sukkah was lent for that purpose. Thus, while a person is using it, he may consider it "as his own," i.e., just like his own dwelling.

From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he includes all minors in this category. However, Rabbenu Nissim writes that a child of six or seven can transfer property and, hence, his return of the lulav is valid.<br>Support for Rabbenu Nissim's position is brought from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:10), which relates that Rav Nachman bar Ya'akov gave his etrog as a present to his son and told him: "When you take possession of it and fulfill the mitzvah, return it to me." Nevertheless, the passage does not serve as conclusive proof, because the possibility exists that his son had already reached majority. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 6) follows the Rambam's view.</i> since, according to Torah law, a minor can acquire articles<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">which are given to him by others who consciously desire that the minor acquire the property, in contrast to ownerless articles, which he cannot acquire according to Torah law (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i> 4:7).</i> but cannot transfer them to others.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The transfer of the ownership of an article requires a conscious decision.

Thus, the Rambam's statements seem to imply that any of the four species that are acquired only according to Rabbinic law may not be used for this mitzvah.<br>A very practical point can be derived from this concept. According to Torah law, property that is purchased changes ownership only after it has been paid for. The completion of a transaction when the property are taken by the purchaser (<i>meshichah</i>) is a Rabbinic institution. Accordingly, if a person purchased a lulav and etrog on the condition that he pay for it after the holiday - even though the seller willingly consented - the purchaser has only acquired the lulav and etrog according to Rabbinic law. Thus, based on this halachah, he would not be able to use it for the mitzvah.</i><br>The above applies to the lulav and to each of the other species of the four taken with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The verse quoted above includes all the four species, and not only the lulav.

He quotes the Rashba, who explains that since the etrog was purchased with the intent that it be used by each member of that community, implicit in their agreement is that, on the first day, it will belong to each individual entirely at the time he uses it to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 648:7) quotes this statement as halachah. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 648:10 raises questions concerning it and suggests that each member of the community should grant his colleague his share as a present.</i><br>Should brothers purchase etrogim from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is the case mentioned in <i>Bava Batra</i> (ibid.), from which the above principle is derived.

Even though it is a mitzvah to rejoice on all the festivals,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">as Deuteronomy 16:14 teaches: "And you shall rejoice on your festivals." Though that verse is mentioned with regard to Sukkot, Deuteronomy 16:11 states with regard to Shavuot: "and you shall rejoice before God," and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4b explains that an analogy is established to include Pesach as well.</i> there was an additional celebration in the Temple on the festival of Sukkot,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's words present a question: The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1) refers to this celebration as <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>, connecting it with the drawing of water for the water libation. (See <i>Hilchot T'midim Umusafim</i> 10:6-10.) Indeed, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 50b; see also the Rambam's commentary on the above-mentioned Mishnah) emphasizes that connection, quoting Isaiah 12:3: "And you shall draw water with happiness." However, here, the Rambam makes no mention of that water at all!<br>We are forced to say that the Rambam views the verse from Isaiah as a mere <i>asmachtah</i> (an allusion from the Bible with which our Sages connected a verse to an independent concept) and that the celebration came about because of the unique nature of the Sukkot festival. Though this celebration was associated with the water libation, the latter is not the source for the practice. Indeed, the choice of the name <i>Simchat Beit HaSho'evah</i> (the celebration of the house of drawing the water), and not <i>Simchat Hasho'evah</i> (the celebration of the drawing of the water) allows for such an interpretation. (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XVII).</i> as [Leviticus 23:40] commands: "And you shall rejoice before God, your Lord,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., in the Temple</i> for seven days."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Although this verse is used to derive the requirement of taking the lulav in Jerusalem for each of the seven days of the festival (Chapter 7, Halachah 13), its simple meaning remains.<br>Nevertheless, this charge is not considered to be an independent commandment, but rather an extension (and an intensification) of the mitzvah of celebrating on the festivals. Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes "to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>."<br>This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another. For this reason, weddings are not held during the festivals so that the wedding celebrations should not clash with those of the festival.<br>Thus, were one to consider the celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> as associated with the water offering, one might ask why the Sages instituted such a celebration which might appear to overshadow the celebration of the festival itself. However, the above explanation resolves this difficulty as well, for as stated above, the <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> celebration is an extension of the festival celebrations and not an independent matter.

Furthermore, it was held in the Temple, where Rabbinic prohibitions of this nature were usually suspended (אין שבות במקדש, <i>Pesachim</i> 65a). Nevertheless, since there is no specific Torah obligation to celebrate in this manner, the celebrations were suspended because of the Rabbinic prohibition (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, ibid.).</i>

When an individual is conscious of God's constant presence, he will naturally be infused with these two emotions. He will feel his own smallness in God's presence, yet he will also feel real joy at the knowledge that God is with him at every moment, and that through his service of Torah and mitzvot, he can develop a greater connection with Him.<br>May our service of God with joy hasten the time when "crowned with eternal joy" (Isaiah 35:10 , we will be able to "rejoice before God, your Lord, for seven days," in the Messianic Temple.
