Mishneh Torah, Sheqel Dues



Chapter 1

The Torah commands each member of Israel to contribute half a shekel each year. Even a poor man who lives on charity is required to give; he borrows or sells the garment off his back and contributes a silver half-shekel, as it is written: "The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel" (Exodus 30:15). One must not pay the half-shekel in several instalments, a little today and a little tomorrow, but has to contribute it all at once in a single payment.



This half-shekel requirement signifies that one is to give half of the contemporary standard coin, even if this coin happens to be larger than the sanctuary standard of a shekel. However, one is never allowed to pay less than the half-shekel used in the time of Moses our teacher, which weighed one hundred and sixty barley grains.

All are required to contribute half a shekel: priests, Levites, Israelites, proselytes, and emancipated slaves; but not women, slaves or minors. If these, however, offer to pay, the half-shekel is accepted from them. If non-Jews offer it, it is not accepted from them. If the father of a minor begins paying the half-shekel on behalf of his son, he is no longer free to discontinue it, but must go on paying each year until his son grows up and pays for himself.
The shekel dues are applicable only when the Temple is in existence. As long as the Temple was in existence, shekel dues were contributed both in Eretz Yisrael and outside it. After the destruction of the Temple, the half-shekel payments ceased even within Eretz Yisrael.
On the first of <i>Adar</i> announcement is made concerning the payment of shekel dues, so that each individual may prepare his half-shekel and be ready to pay it. On the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, the money-changers sit down in each town and gently request everyone to pay. They accept from everyone who offers them the half-shekel, without using compulsion against anyone who does not. On the twenty-fifth of <i>Adar</i>, they sit down in the Temple to enforce collection. From then on, payment is obtained by force from those who have not yet paid. Anyone who refuses to pay is subjected to compulsion by levy; a pledge is taken from him forcibly, even the garment he is wearing.

Chapter 2




When each town has completed the collection of the shekel dues, they are sent by messengers to the Temple; it is permissible to convert them into gold denars to facilitate transportation. All shekel dues are gathered in the Temple and deposited in one of the Temple chambers, the doors of which are locked with keys and sealed with seals. Three large baskets of nine <i>seah</i> each are filled with collected shekel dues, and the remainder is left in the chamber. The half-shekels in the baskets are called <i>Temple fund;</i> the surplus is called <i>the residue of the chamber</i>.
Three times a year sums are taken from the Temple treasury: on <i>Rosh Hodesh Nisan</i>, on <i>Rosh Hodesh Tishri</i>, before or after the festival, and on the fifteenth day before <i>Shavuoth</i>.— —
— — If the shekel dues in the three large baskets were insufficient and all spent before <i>Nisan</i>, sums were taken again from the residue of the chamber.



The priest entering the chamber to take up the heave offering must not wear a garment in which money can be concealed, nor shoes, sandals, a phylactery, or an amulet, that people should not become suspicious and say: "He has concealed money from the chamber on his person while taking up the heave offering." Besides, conversation was maintained with him from the moment he entered the chamber until he left it, to prevent him from putting coins in his mouth. Yet, despite all these precautions, a poor man or a greedy person should not take up the heave offering, because of possible suspicion, as it is written: "You shall be clear before the Lord and before Israel" (Numbers 32:22).

Chapter 3



Chapter 4

What is done with the Temple fund? It is used for the purchase of the daily offerings, the additional offerings, and all other public offerings with their libations, as well as the salt with which all sacrifices were salted, and the firewood, if it has not been brought as a gift and is obtainable only for money.— —





The official proofreaders of biblical manuscripts in Jerusalem, and the judges who tried robbers in Jerusalem, received their salaries out of the Temple fund. How much did they receive? Ninety <i>maneh</i> (9,000 <i>zuz</i>) annually. If this was insufficient for their maintenance, they were given, whether they wanted it or not, enough additional pay to provide for their own needs and the needs of their wives and children and other members of their households.
