Mishneh Torah, Eruvin



Chapter 1

According to biblical law, if a courtyard has many tenants, each living in a house of his own, they may all move objects throughout the courtyard as well as from the houses into the courtyard and from the courtyard into the houses, because the entire courtyard is a single private domain, so that it is permissible to move objects through the whole of it. The same rule applies to an alley that has courtyards opening into it on three sides and the fourth side opening into the public road. By fastening at this fourth side a stake in the ground or a cross-beam above, the alley and the courts opening into it become a single private domain, so that all the residents of the alley are permitted to transfer objects throughout the alley as well as from the courtyards into the alley and from the alley into the courtyards.— —
By rabbinical enactment, however, it is forbidden to transfer objects within a private domain where there is a separation of tenants, each living in a separate house, unless they create a symbolical fusion of all the tenants by preparing an <i>eruv</i> on Friday. It is all the same whether it is a courtyard, an alley or a town. This regulation was originated by Solomon and his legislative body.



What is the form of the prescribed <i>eruv?</i> It consists of a quantity of food contributed by the residents jointly and deposited on Friday, as if to say: "We are all one fellowship, we all have the same food, and none of us keeps a domain distinct from that of his neighbor; just as we share equally the area of the <i>eruv</i>, so we have equal rights in each of the areas held by each individually; all of us are a single domain." This symbolical act serves to prevent people from falling into error and imagining that it is permissible to move objects from a private domain to a public domain.
The <i>eruv</i> prepared by the tenants of a courtyard is called a <i>courtyard eruv;</i> the one prepared by the inhabitants of an alley or by all the residents of a town is called a <i>shituf (cooperative eruv)</i>.








How is a <i>courtyard eruv</i> prepared? A whole loaf of bread is collected from each house, and all the loaves are placed within a single container and deposited in one of the dwellings of the courtyard.— — When gathering and depositing the food contributed by the various tenants, one should recite this benediction: "Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the precept of <i>eruv</i>." He should then add: "By virtue of this <i>eruv</i>, all the residents of this courtyard will be permitted to transfer objects from house to house on the Sabbath."— —
How should an <i>alley eruv</i> be prepared? One collects the smallest quantity of food, the size of a dry fig, from each resident, or even less than that if there are many residents, and puts it all into a single container; he then deposits it in one of the courtyards of the alley or in one of the houses, — — saying: "By virtue of this <i>cooperative eruv</i>, all residents of the alley are permitted to transfer objects between the courtyards and the alley on the Sabbath."

Chapter 6
























Just as a blessing should be recited when either a courtyard <i>eruv</i> or an alley <i>eruv</i> is prepared, so should a blessing be recited over an <i>eruv</i> prepared between Sabbath limits. One should also add: "By virtue of this <i>eruv</i>, I shall be permitted to walk two thousand cubits in any direction from this place." — —

Chapter 7

If a person goes out of town on Friday, stops at a certain spot within or at the end of the town's Sabbath limit, and says: "Let my Sabbath resting-place be here," and then returns and spends the night in town, he is permitted to walk the next day two thousand cubits in any direction from that spot. The principle underlying the <i>eruv</i> for Sabbath limits is that of actually walking to the spot of the <i>eruv</i>. The sages, however, declared that even if one does not go out of town and does not stop at a certain spot, he may prepare the <i>eruv</i> by placing food for two meals at the site through a messenger, thus making things easier for the wealthy person who does not have to go himself, but may send his <i>eruv</i> by someone else to deposit it for him.

Chapter 8




The same as it is forbidden to go beyond the Sabbath limits on the Sabbath, so it is forbidden to go beyond these limits on a holyday and on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, — — but on a holyday it is permissible to transfer objects from one domain to another. Accordingly, we must lay an <i>eruv</i> for courts and form a <i>cooperative eruv</i> for alleys for <i>Yom Kippur</i> as well as for the Sabbath, and we must prepare an <i>eruv</i> for Sabbath limits for <i>Yom Kippur</i> and for holydays just as it is required for the Sabbath.
If a holyday occurs on the day before or after the Sabbath, or in the Diaspora where two days are observed instead of the one, a person may deposit two <i>eruv</i> symbols in two different directions, relying on whichever of the two he pleases on the first day, and upon the second <i>eruv</i> on the second day.— — This applies only to the two Diaspora holydays. The two days of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, however, are considered as a single day, and only one <i>eruv</i> symbol in one direction is sufficient for both days.








If a holyday occurs on Friday, one must not prepare an <i>eruv</i> for courtyards nor for Sabbath limits on that day, but must do so on Thursday which is the day preceding the festival. If the two Diaspora holydays occur on Thursday and Friday, the <i>eruv</i> for Sabbath limits and the <i>eruv</i> for courtyards should be deposited on Wednesday.— —
