Mishneh Torah, Eruvin



Chapter 1

According to Torah law, when there are several neighbors dwelling in a courtyard, each in his private home, they are all permitted to carry within the entire courtyard, from the homes to the courtyard, and from the courtyard to the homes, because the entire courtyard is a private domain<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Included in this private domain are all the houses located in the courtyard.</i> and it is permitted to carry within it in its entirety.<br>Similarly, regarding a lane that has a pole [positioned at its entrance] or a beam positioned [above it],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:2,9.</i> all the inhabitants of the lane are permitted to carry<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that according to Torah law [<i>op. cit.</i>; see also the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 1:2) ], it is permitted to carry within a lane, even though it does not have a pole or a beam. Nevertheless, it is then considered a <i>makom patur</i> and not a private domain.</i> in the entire [lane], and from the courtyards to the lane,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As obvious from <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:2,8, a lane is an area enclosed by three walls and into which several courtyards open.</i> and from the lane to the courtyards, for the entire lane is a private domain.<br>Similarly, all [the area within] a city that is surrounded by a wall that is [at least] ten handbreadths high and has gates that are locked at night<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:10, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1508) state that the gates of the city need not actually be locked at night; it is sufficient that they are able to be locked.</i> is a private domain. This is the law of the Torah.
Nevertheless, according to Rabbinic decree, it is forbidden for the neighbors to carry within a private domain that is divided into different dwellings, unless all the inhabitants join together in an <i>eruv</i> before the commencement of the Sabbath.<br>This [restriction] applies to courtyards, lanes, and cities. It was instituted by [King] Solomon and his court.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 21b states that when King Solomon instituted the requirement for <i>eruvin</i>, a heavenly voice resounded, quoting Proverbs 23:15: "My son, if your heart is wise, My heart will also rejoice."<br><i>Sefer HaMitzvot Gadol</i> asks why this requirement was not instituted in an earlier time, and quotes a letter of Rav Hai Gaon that explains that prior to King Solomon's era, the Jews were very heavily involved in wars (to conquer the land of Canaan, and then to protect themselves from the Philistines and others). It was not until King Solomon's time that the land was blessed with peace. Since an army camp is not obligated to heed the restrictions of <i>eruvin</i> (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 6:13), the practice was not instituted until the age when peace became the norm in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i>
Similarly, people who dwell in tents,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">These all refer to dwellings that are intended to endure for an extended period (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> in booths, or in an encampment<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a camp other than an army camp, as mentioned in Note 6.</i> that is surrounded by a partition may not carry from tent to tent until they make an <i>eruv</i>. In contrast, [the members of] a caravan [who surround their encampment] with a partition are not required to [join in] an <i>eruv</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Rashba and the Ritba differ from the Rambam on this point and maintain that the travelers in a caravan are required to establish an <i>eruv</i>, and the dwellers of a camp are not. Note the explanation of their difference of opinion in the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 366.</i> They may transfer articles from tent to tent without an <i>eruv</i>, for [the very nature of their circumstance] is considered to be an <i>eruv</i>, since these are not long-lasting dwellings.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 2, the obligation to establish an <i>eruv</i> was instituted to apply to people living in separate dwellings in a single domain. Since these structures are not enduring by nature, the people are not considered to be living in separate dwellings, and the restriction against carrying is therefore not instituted. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 366:12.)</i>
Why did [King] Solomon institute this [restriction]? So that the common people would not err and say, "Just as it is permitted to transfer articles from the courtyards to the streets of a city and its marketplaces, and to bring articles in [from these domains] to a courtyard, it is permitted to take articles from the city to the fields and from the fields to the city."<br>[Moreover, they would operate under the mistaken] impression that the marketplaces and streets - since they are the public domain - are like fields and deserts.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 14:1 and notes, which discuss the Rambam's opinion that deserts are a public domain.</i> [This would lead them to a further error, causing them to] say that only a courtyard is a private domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> comments that according to this logic, it would be unnecessary to forbid taking articles out from homes to a courtyard. He continues, explaining that this restriction is also necessary so that children who are knowledgeable only about what goes on in their homes and the adjacent courtyard will be aware of the obligation of making an <i>eruv</i>.</i> and they would think that there is no prohibition against the transfer of articles, and that it is permitted to transfer articles from a private domain to a public domain [and from a public domain to a private domain].
Therefore, [King Solomon] instituted [the following rules]: Whenever a private domain is divided into separate dwelling units that are considered the private property of the individuals, and an area remains that is the joint property of all individuals and all share in it equally - e.g., a courtyard with houses<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In this halachah, the Rambam is clarifying that the distinctions between different domains with regard to the laws of ownership could create confusion with regard to the domains of the Sabbath. As a safeguard, King Solomon instituted the laws of <i>eruvin</i>.<br>The <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> (<i>Eruvin</i> 7:1) maintains that it is the Rambam's view that a group of houses adjacent to each other without a courtyard does not require an <i>eruv</i>; that is necessary only when there is jointly owned property in the private domain. The <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> himself differs from this position and requires an <i>eruv</i> in such a situation. In practice, it is not customary to require an <i>eruv</i> unless there is jointly owned property in the domain.</i> that open onto it - the area that is jointly owned is considered as a public domain. Similarly, every place that one of the neighbors owns as his private property and treats as his individual holding shall be considered as a private domain.<br>It is thus forbidden to transfer an article from a person's private property to the area that is owned jointly, just as it is forbidden to transfer from a private domain into the public domain. Instead, every person should contain his activities within his own property, unless an <i>eruv</i> is established, although [according to the Torah] the entire area is one private domain.
What is meant by an <i>eruv</i>? That all the individuals will join together in one [collection of] food before the commencement of the Sabbath. This serves as a declaration that they have all joined together and share food as one; none of them has [totally] private property. Instead, just as the jointly-owned area is the property of all, so too, everyone shares in the property that is privately owned. They are all joined in one domain.<br>[Performing] this act will prevent them from erring and thinking that it is permitted to transfer articles between a private domain and the public domain.
The <i>eruv</i> that the inhabitants of a courtyard make among themselves is referred to as <i>eruvei chatzerot</i> [the joining of the areas of courtyards]. [The joining together of] the inhabitants of a lane or of a city is referred to as <i>shituf</i>, [partnership].
An <i>eruv</i> [joining together] the inhabitants of a courtyard may not be made with anything other than a whole loaf of bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 81a states that this law was instituted to prevent quarrels among neighbors that might arise if one gave a whole loaf and one gave only a portion of a loaf. As stated in Halachah 16, every family in the courtyard gives a whole loaf. (See the notes on that halachah.) The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 366:7) states, however, that if an <i>eruv</i> is established by one person on behalf of others, without collecting flour or loaves of bread from the other inhabitants of the courtyard, it is possible to use a loaf that is not whole.</i> Even if a loaf of bread is a <i>se'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A large measure of grain, approximately 8 kilogram in contemporary measure.</i> in size, but it is sliced, it may not be used for an <i>eruv</i>. If it is whole, even if it is as small as an <i>isar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A small Italian silver coin, weighing four barley corns (<i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 1:3).</i> it may be used for an <i>eruv</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's wording, it would appear that there is no minimum measure required for the size of the loaf; as long as it is whole, it is sufficient, regardless of how many people dwell in the courtyard. Rav Moshe HaCohen and others differ, interpreting <i>Eruvin</i> 80b as requiring the loaf to be large enough to include a measure the size of a dried fig for each of the inhabitants (as the Rambam states in the following halachah regarding a <i>shituf</i>). It is Rav Moshe HaCohen's view that is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 366:6, 368:3).</i><br>Just as an <i>eruv</i> may be made using a loaf of bread made from grain,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye.</i> so too, may it be made with a loaf of bread made from rice<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 2:7), we have translated אורז as rice, and דוחן as millet. There are, however, different opinions concerning this matter. (See <i>Magen Avraham</i> 208:9; <i>Turei Zahav</i> 208:11.)</i> or lentils. A loaf of bread made from millet, by contrast, may not be used.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For it is not common to make bread from millet.</i><br>The <i>shituf</i> [for a lane or for a city, by contrast, may be made using] either bread or other foods.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Eruvin</i> 71b) explains the difference between the <i>eruv</i> established in a courtyard and the <i>shituf</i> established in a lane as follows: An <i>eruv</i> is necessary in order to consider all of the dwellings as the mutually-owned property of all the members of the courtyard. Since the establishment of a location as a dwelling is a significant halachic act, it is necessary to use a significant food, bread. In contrast, the <i>shituf</i> joining together different courtyards is a far looser arrangement. Hence, other foods are also acceptable.</i> For we may use any food for a <i>shituf</i>, with the exception of water and salt. Similarly, mushrooms and truffles may not be used for a <i>shituf</i>, because they are not considered to be foods.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 3:1), the Rambam explains that mushrooms and truffles are a very base type of food. Hence, they are not considered acceptable.<br>In his gloss on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 386:5), the Vilna Gaon writes that the exclusion does not apply to cooked mushrooms and truffles, for they are considered foods of high quality. <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> differs and refutes all the proofs brought by the Vilna Gaon.</i><br>[The restriction against using water and salt applies only] when they are set aside as separate entities. If one mixes water and salt, this is considered to be brine, and may be used for a <i>shituf</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">By themselves, these are considered to be fit to prepare food, but not to be foods themselves (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.</i>). When mixed together as brine, they are suitable as a dip.<br>When quoting this ruling, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 386:5) mentions the opinion of <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that the brine must also be mixed with oil. Without this, the brine is unfit for use as a dip.</i>
What quantity of food is necessary to establish a <i>shituf</i>? A measure equal to the size of a dried fig<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 18:1, one is liable for t ransferring an amount of food equal to the size of a dried fig from one domain to another. Therefore, this is the size of the measure chosen to establish a <i>shituf</i>. (See <i>Eruvin</i> 80b.)</i> for every inhabitant of the lane or of the city, provided there are eighteen or less. If, however, there are more than [eighteen inhabitants], the minimum measure [of the <i>shituf</i>] is [an amount of] food [sufficient] for two meals - i.e., an amount equivalent to eighteen dried figs, which is equivalent to the measure of six medium-size eggs.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, the size of an egg is 57.6 milliliters.; according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>, it is 100 milliliters.<br>See also the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who notes that based on <i>Eruvin</i> 82b-83a, there is an apparent contradiction between the Rambam's ruling here and his ruling in <i>Hilchot Tum'at Ochalin</i> 4:1. Nevertheless, a deeper analysis of the text in <i>Eruvin</i> allows for a resolution of both decisions.<br>Note also the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 368:3 which mentions an opinion that the measure is slightly less than the size of eight eggs. Since there are many halachic factors dependent on this measure, e.g., the measure of כדי אכילת פרס, the ruling is very significant.</i> Even if thousands and myriads of people desire to make use [of this <i>shituf</i>], [all that is necessary] is [an amount of] food [sufficient] for two meals.
When a <i>shituf</i> is made using any food that is eaten without further cooking - e.g., a loaf of bread, certain species of grain, or raw meat - the minimum measure is the [amount of] food [sufficient] for two meals.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The principle on which this halachah is based is expressed by <i>Eruvin</i> 29b: "For side dishes [that are eaten together with bread], the minimum measure is the amount [of these dishes] eaten at two meals. For food that is not a side dish, an amount large enough to eat two meals from it."<br>In Talmudic times, bread was the staple food that was generally served as the basis for a meal. Smaller quantities of other foods were also eaten at a meal, together with bread as "side dishes." Accordingly, if the food in question is usually eaten together with bread as a side dish, it is necessary to bring only the quantity that would usually be consumed as a side dish in a meal. If, however, the food is not usually eaten with bread, but instead is itself a staple that can be used as a staple instead of bread, the full amount necessary for two meals is required.</i><br>When the food in question is a side dish - i.e., something that people customarily eat together with bread - e.g., cooked wine, roasted meat, vinegar, fish brine, olives, and onion heads - the minimum measure is an amount sufficient to accompany two meals.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam gives several examples of the minimum amounts required for side dishes in the following halachah.</i>
When fresh wine<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the cooked wine mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> is used for a <i>shituf</i>, two <i>revi'iot</i> are required for every [participant]. Similarly, if beer is used, two <i>revi'iot</i> [are required].<br>If eggs are used, [the minimum measure] is two; they may be used for a <i>shituf</i> even when raw. [Other minimum measures are:] two pomegranates,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 6:8, which mentions this and several of the other measures cited by the Rambam in this halachah as "sufficient to satisfy" a poor man, and therefore fit to be given to him as "the tithe of the poor." Significantly, there it mentions "ten nuts," leading the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> to consider amending the text here.</i> one etrog, five nuts, five peaches, a Roman pound of vegetables - whether raw or cooked; if [the vegetables] are lightly, but not thoroughly, cooked, they may not be used;<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Raw vegetables are eaten in salads, and cooked vegetables are eaten as foods, but partially cooked vegetables are not eaten at all. The Ra'avad maintains that this restriction applies only to beets, but the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the same rationale - and therefore the same ruling - applies to other vegetables as well.</i> an <i>uchla</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam defines this and several of the other measures he mentions in the following halachah.</i> of spices, a <i>kav</i> of dates, a <i>kav</i> of dried figs, a <i>maneh</i> of crushed figs, a <i>kav</i> of apples, a handful of cuscuta,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A parasitic plant that grows on shrubs.</i> a handful of fresh beans, a Roman pound of lichen.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">A wild plant that is occasionally used for food. Some commentaries reverse the definitions of cuscuta and lichen.</i><br>Beets are considered vegetables and may be used for an <i>eruv</i>. Onion leaves may not be used for an eruv unless they are already grown, and the length of each leaf is at least that of a spread-out hand. If they are not this long, they are not considered to be food.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">When the leaves grow long, they are called scallions and are edible. Before they grow long, however, they are bitter, and unfit to be used.</i><br>All these types of food are considered to be side dishes; therefore, they have been given these measures. The same principles apply in other similar situations. All foods can be combined to reach the minimum measure required for a <i>shituf</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are based on the statements of the Mishnah (<i>Me'ilah</i> 4:7), which he interprets as referring to both an <i>eruv t'chumim</i> (an <i>eruv</i> to extend the Sabbath boundaries) and a <i>shituf</i>. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the reference is only to an <i>eruv t'chumim</i>. Significantly, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Me'ilah, loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions only an <i>eruv t'chumim</i>, seeming to imply that he originally held the same view as the Ra'avad. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 386:4) follows the ruling of the Rambam in this halachah.</i>
Whenever the term Roman pound is mentioned, it refers to [a measure equal to] two<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi differs and defines a Roman pound as equaling a <i>log</i>, four revi'iot.</i> full <i>revi'iot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>revi'it</i>, the measure on which all the other measures mentioned in this halachah is based, is 86.4 milliliters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 150 milliliters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> An <i>uchla</i> is half a <i>revi'it</i>; a <i>maneh</i>, one hundred <i>dinarim</i>; a <i>dinar</i>, six <i>ma'ah</i>; a <i>ma'ah</i>, the weight of sixteen barley corns;<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 1:3.</i> a <i>sela</i>, four <i>dinarim</i>.<br>A <i>revi'it</i> contains an amount of water or wine<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Moshe HaCohen objects to the Rambam's statements, because equal volumes of wine and water are not equal in weight.</i> equivalent to approximately seventeen and one half <i>dinarim</i>. Thus, a Roman pound is equivalent in weight to 35 <i>dinarim</i>, and an <i>uchla</i> is equivalent in weight to eight and three-quarter <i>dinarim</i>.
Whenever the term <i>se'ah</i> is mentioned, it refers to [a measure equal to] six <i>kabbim</i>. A <i>kav</i> is four <i>logim</i>, and a <i>log</i> is four <i>revi'iot</i>. We have already defined the measure and the weight of a <i>revi'it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 15:4, the Rambam defines a <i>revi'it</i> as the volume of an area two fingerbreadths by two fingerbreadths, which is two and seven tenths of a fingerbreadth high.</i> These measurements are necessary for a person to remember at all times.
[All] food that is permitted to be eaten, even if the person who uses it is forbidden to partake of it, may be used for an <i>eruv</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to an <i>eruv t'chumim</i>, for, as stated in Halachah 8, an <i>eruv</i> for a courtyard may be established only with bread.</i> or for a <i>shituf</i>.<br>What is implied? A nazirite<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Who may not partake of wine (Numbers 6:3 .</i> may establish a <i>shituf</i> using wine, and an Israelite [may establish a <i>shituf</i> using] <i>terumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Although it may be eaten only by a priest (Leviticus 22:10, Numbers 18:12 .<br>Although this law is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 386:8), <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 386:8 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 386:47 note that in the present age, even the priests are ritually impure, and are therefore forbidden to partake of <i>terumah</i>. Hence, <i>terumah</i> may no longer be used for an <i>eruv</i>.</i> Similarly, a person who takes a vow or an oath not to partake<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 386), the word "partake" is exact. Were a person to vow not to benefit from a food, he would be forbidden from using it for this purpose. (Others differ and maintain that since "the mitzvot were not given for our benefit," using the food for an <i>eruv</i> does not violate one's vow.) <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, loc. cit.</i>, suggests that one should be stringent and follow the <i>Tur's</i> ruling.</i> of a particular food may use it for an <i>eruv</i> or a <i>shituf</i>. For if it is not fit for one person [to partake of], it is fit for another.
A forbidden [food] - e.g., <i>tevel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Food from which <i>terumah</i> and the tithes have not been separated, and that is hence forbidden to be eaten. The Rambam's choice of foods is based on <i>Berachot</i> 7:1, which mentions that a blessing should not be recited when partaking of the foods mentioned in the first grouping, because they are forbidden. In contrast, a blessing should be recited over those in the second grouping. (See also <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:19-20.)</i> even food that is considered <i>tevel</i> only by Rabbinic decree<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., produce that grows in containers (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Berachot, loc. cit.</i>).</i>, the first tithe from which <i>terumah</i> was improperly taken,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to an instance in which the first tithe was separated before <i>terumah</i>. Before it is permitted to partake of the tithe, it is necessary to separate <i>terumah</i> from it (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> or the second tithe or consecrated articles that were not redeemed in the proper manner<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The second tithe may be eaten only in Jerusalem, and consecrated a rticles may not be used for mundane purposes. These articles may be redeemed and then used for mundane purposes. In this instance, however, we are speaking about a situation where the redemption was improperly performed - e.g., one used uncoined metal (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> - by contrast, may not be used for an <i>eruv</i> or a <i>shituf</i>.<br>We may, however, use <i>d'mai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Produce from which we are unsure whether the tithes were separated or not. (See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 9:1.)</i> for an <i>eruv</i> or a <i>shituf</i>, since it is fit to be used by the poor.

Nevertheless, once the value of the article itself is paid, even though the additional fifth is still outstanding, the article is considered redeemed and may be used for mundane purposes. (See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:12.)</i> For [failure to give] the [additional] fifth does not [void the redemption of these articles].<br>We may use the second tithe in Jerusalem, since it is fit to be eaten there, but [it may] not [be used] outside [that city].
How is an <i>eruv</i> [joining the entire area of] a courtyard together established? We collect a complete loaf of bread from every house<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad and Rav Moshe HaCohen differ with the Rambam and state that it was customary to collect a portion of flour from all the houses in the courtyard and then to bake a single loaf from it. Others mention the custom that one person would bake a loaf from his own flour and grant everyone a portion in it. (See Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 366:6.)</i> and place all [the loaves] in a single container<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 18.</i> in one of the houses of the courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The place where the <i>eruv</i> is stored must be fit to serve as a dwelling. All the examples that the Rambam mentions as acceptable can serve as a dwelling if necessary. By contrast, all those that he mentions as unacceptable are not fit to serve as a dwelling.<br>The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>:3) states that since, at present, since a <i>shituf</i> is established for a larger area, it is unnecessary to be placed in a dwelling. For this reason, it is permitted - and this is indeed the custom - to place the <i>eruvin</i> in the synagogue.</i> Even a granary, a barn, or a storehouse [is acceptable for this purpose]. If, however, the <i>eruv</i> was placed in a gatehouse - even a gatehouse belonging to a private individual - an <i>exedra</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">A Greek architectural structure with two or three walls.</i> a porch, or a house that is not four cubits by four cubits, it is not considered an <i>eruv</i>.<br>When the <i>eruv</i> is gathered together,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">For the blessing should be recited before the mitzvah is carried out. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 395) states that it is preferable to recite the blessing before one begins gathering the bread or the flour from each household. The later authorities, however, state that one may recite the blessing after completing the collection (<i>Shulchan Aruch Harav</i> 366:18; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 366:81).</i> one recites the blessing: "Blessed be You, God, our Lord, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the mitzvah of establishing an <i>eruv</i> was ordained by our Sages, it is proper to praise God when fulfilling His commandments, because carrying out the decrees of the Sages also fulfills God's commandments (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:3).</i> concerning the mitzvah of the <i>eruv</i>." [Afterwards,] one says, "With this <i>eruv</i>, all the inhabitants of this courtyard will be permitted to bring objects in and out from one house to another."<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 366:15) states that one should add "And from the courtyard to the houses and from the houses to the courtyard."</i><br>A minor may collect [the bread for] the <i>eruv</i> [joining the entire area of] a courtyard together. The house in which the <i>eruv</i> is placed need not give a loaf of bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 49a explains that by having the loaf of bread they gave for the <i>eruv</i> located in a house, the other people who join in the <i>eruv</i> show that they have the right to dwell in that house.

The commentaries note that this interpretation appears to differ from that of the Talmud (<i>Gittin</i> 60b), which states that it should be kept in the original house because of "suspicion." (According to Rashi, this means the suspicion that will arise when people enter the house where the <i>eruv</i> is usually held, and see that there is no <i>eruv</i> there; according to <i>Tosafot</i>, it is intended to belie the suspicion that the place of the <i>eruv</i> was changed because the person in whose house it was kept stole from it.)</i> it is proper that they should not change [to another home].
How is a <i>shituf</i> established for a lane?

The entire amount is placed in a single container in one of the courtyards in the lane, or in one of the homes.

If, however, one leaves it in the open space of the lane, it is not acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the governing principle is that the <i>shituf</i> must be kept in a protected place. A courtyard is acceptable for this purpose, because it is the private property of the inhabitants of the houses that adjoin it.

To manifest their acquisition, they are required to lift it up a handbreadth above the ground.<br>In the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo explains that, according to the Rambam, it makes no difference if the container is held in a courtyard or in a home; it should always be lifted a handbreadth above the ground so that it will be obvious. Nevertheless, in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 386:9), Rav Karo quotes the other opinion mentioned by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>.</i> [When making the <i>shituf</i>,] one recites the blessing, "... concerning the mitzvah of the <i>eruv</i>,"<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">One may use the term <i>eruv</i>, which means "joining," since a <i>shituf</i> also involves a joining together of all the courtyards in the lane (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 395:2).

If one divides the <i>eruv</i> or the <i>shituf</i>, it is no longer effective. [This ruling applies] even if [all the portions of the <i>eruv</i>] are located in a single home. If, however, one fills a container with the <i>eruv</i> and there remains some food that one put in a second container, it is acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that both these containers must be located in the same house.

It is not proper to divide it and place a portion in each of the community's synagogues.</i>
The participants in a <i>shituf</i> in a lane must, nevertheless, also make an <i>eruv</i> in their [respective] courtyards, so that their children will not forget the laws of an <i>eruv</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Although a lane is a private domain according to the Torah, and one might therefore assume that a single <i>shituf</i> would be sufficient, <i>Eruvin</i> 71b requires that the inhabitants of the courtyards establish <i>eruvin</i>.

This creates a slight difficulty, because a synagogue may not be used as a dwelling. The Ramah (366:3, 387:1) uses this as support for his thesis that at present, once a <i>shituf</i> is made, there is no need for the courtyards to make <i>eruvin</i>.

[A person may establish an <i>eruv</i> on behalf of others. For example,] if one of the inhabitants of a courtyard takes bread and says, "Behold, this is for all the inhabitants of the courtyard," or he took an amount of food equivalent to two meals, and says, "This is for all the inhabitants of the lane," he does not have to collect food from each individual.

Neither an <i>eruv</i> nor a <i>shituf</i> may be established on the Sabbath. Instead, they must be established before nightfall.

Chapter 2

When all the inhabitants of a courtyard, with one exception, have established an <i>eruv</i>, this individual [causes carrying] to be forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than consider a courtyard as being divided into small portions belonging to each of the homeowners, we consider the entire courtyard to be the joint property of all the inhabitants. Therefore, if one of them does not participate in the <i>eruv</i>, it is forbidden to carry within the courtyard as a whole.<br>It must be emphasized that this halachah and those that follow apply only in a situation where the person establishing the <i>eruv</i> did not grant all other inhabitants in the city, lane, or courtyard a share, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 20. Today, this granting of a share is standard practice, and so it is unlikely that such situations would arise.</i> [This rule applies regardless of whether the person failed to join the <i>eruv</i>] because of a willful decision<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 6:3, the source for this halachah, mentions only an accidental oversight. The consensus is that according to the development of the concept in the Gemara, the same rules apply regarding a willful decision.</i> or because of an oversight. [In such a situation,] it is forbidden for all the inhabitants to transfer articles from their homes to the courtyard or from the courtyard to their homes.<br>Should the person who did not join in the <i>eruv</i> subordinate<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The subordination (ביטול in Hebrew) of the ownership of one's domain is a halachic institution devised by our Sages for situations of this nature. It gives the others the formal rights of ownership.

He may open the door to leave, but must lock it immediately thereafter.<br>Rav Yosef Karo mentions this view in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 380:1). <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 380:2 states that one may rely on the Rambam's ruling.</i> they are permitted to carry from their homes to the courtyard and from the courtyard to their homes.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, they may carry within the courtyard itself. The person who did not participate in the <i>eruv</i> may also carry within the courtyard and to and from the homes of the others, because he is considered as a guest (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 380:1).</i> [They may not,] however, carry to the home [of this individual].<br>If he subordinates the ownership of his house and [of his share] of the courtyard [to the others], they are all permitted to carry. The others are permitted, because he subordinated the ownership of his house and [of his share] of the courtyard to them. He is also permitted to carry, because he no longer owns a domain. Therefore, he is considered to be [the others'] guest, and the presence of a guest does not [cause carrying] to be forbidden [in a courtyard].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since the guest does not own a share of the domain, his participation or lack of participation in the <i>eruv</i> is of no consequence.</i>
When a person subordinates the ownership of his property without specifying his intent, it is presumed that he has subordinated the ownership [of his share] of the courtyard, but not the ownership of his house. When a person subordinates the ownership of his domain, he must make an explicit statement to that effect to every inhabitant of the courtyard, saying, "My domain is subordinated to you, and to you, and to you."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 380:1 explains that the Rambam's intent is that if he merely said "I subordinate my domain to all of you," one might interpret his intent as "to most of you." Therefore, it is necessary to be more specific.<br>Rashi (<i>Eruvin</i> 26b) differs and maintains that it is sufficient for the person to say, "I subordinate my domain to all of you," without explicitly mentioning each person. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 380:1) mentions both opinions. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 380:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 380:5 state that one may rely on the more lenient view.</i><br>An heir may subordinate the ownership of a domain. Even when the testator dies on the Sabbath itself, the heir is empowered to act in place of the testator in all matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Although the heir would not have been able to subordinate the domain before the Sabbath began, should he consent to do so on the Sabbath itself, the <i>eruv</i> is acceptable. (See also Halachah 7.)</i><br><i>Ab initio</i>, it is permitted to subordinate the ownership of one's domain on the Sabbath itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling is the subject of a debate between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel (<i>Eruvin</i> 6:4). The School of Shammai maintains that subordinating one's domain is comparable to a transfer of property, and therefore requires that it be performed before the commencement of the Sabbath. The School of Hillel differs, explaining that it is considered to be merely the removal of one's authority, and hence may be performed on the Sabbath itself (<i>Eruvin</i> 71a).</i>
[If, conversely,] those who joined in the <i>eruv</i> subordinate the ownership of their domain to the person who did not join, he is permitted [to carry] - for he remains the sole [owner of property] - but they are forbidden to carry, for they no longer own property. We do not say that they are considered to be his guests, because many people cannot become the guests of a single individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, should one have actual guests, the fact that many guests stay in one home does not affect whether or not one is allowed to carry. When, however, we are speaking about guests merely in the halachic sense of the word, many persons are not considered the guests of one individual (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 380:18).</i>
[The following rules apply when] there are two or more individuals who do not participate in the <i>eruv</i>: If they subordinate the ownership of their domain to those who participated in the <i>eruv</i>, those who participated in the <i>eruv</i> are permitted [to carry], and those who did not participate are not permitted [to carry].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since they did not participate in the <i>eruv</i>, they may not benefit from it.

Hence, carrying in the courtyard is forbidden.</i><br>Even if one of those who did not participate subordinates the ownership of his domain to the other person who did not participate, they are still forbidden to carry, since at the time when the others subordinated the ownership of their domain to him, he was forbidden to carry.<br>[When there are only two people sharing a courtyard,] and one makes an <i>eruv</i>, he may not subordinate the ownership of his domain to the other person who did not join in the <i>eruv</i>. Conversely, however, the person who did not join in the <i>eruv</i> can subordinate the ownership of his domain to the person who made the <i>eruv</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Note the Ra'avad, who questions why the Rambam does not explain, as does <i>Eruvin</i> 70a, the source for this halachah, that this refers to an instance when a courtyard was shared by three people, two made an <i>eruv</i>, but not the third. On the Sabbath, one of the two who participated in the <i>eruv</i> died, and one of the two remaining desired to subordinate the ownership of his domain to his colleague.</i>
Just as one homeowner can subordinate the ownership of his domain to another homeowner in a single courtyard, so too, [the inhabitants of] one courtyard can subordinate the ownership of their domain to [the inhabitants of] another courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">If two adjoining courtyards open up to each other and both open up to the public domain, it is forbidden to carry from one to the other unless an <i>eruv</i> is made. Nevertheless, even if an <i>eruv</i> was not made, the inhabitants of one courtyard (A) may allow the inhabitants of the other (B) to carry within courtyard (A) by subordinating their ownership of their domain. In such an instance, the inhabitants of courtyard (A) may not carry within their domain.<br>These principles also apply when one courtyard leads to another, which ends in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>. (See the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 381:2.)</i><br>[After a person has subordinated his domain,] the recipient can, in turn, subordinate it [to its original owner]. What is implied? If two people are living together in a courtyard, and neither has made an <i>eruv</i>, the first may subordinate the ownership of his domain to his colleague, thus allowing the second colleague to carry within the domain that the first subordinated to him until he completes what he must do. Afterwards, the second colleague may subordinate ownership of the domain to the first. Indeed, this exchange may take place several times [on one Sabbath].<br>One may subordinate one's ownership of a ruin in the same manner in which one subordinates one's ownership of a courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 381:3) explain that this refers to a situation in which a ruin lies between two houses.

If he takes an article from the courtyard to his house - although he is forbidden to do so - his act does not nullify his subordination of the ownership of his property. The rationale is that since he no longer has a share in the courtyard, it can be understood that he desired to remove his property from there. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 381:1 accepts the <i>Magen Avraham's</i> ruling, while the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 381:3 does not.</i> for he did not maintain his commitment.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It appears that the Rambam's intent is that by carrying, he makes it obvious that he no longer abides by his commitment to subordinate the ownership of his property.

It is only when they would require an <i>eruv</i> themselves that the presence of a gentile makes it forbidden to carry. (See <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 382:1.)</i> This is a decree so that they do not dwell together with a gentile, lest they emulate his conduct.

It is not necessary for every individual to enter into a [separate] rental agreement with the gentile.
[The following rule applies when] there are two courtyards, one leading to the other: If a Jew and a gentile live in the inner courtyard and another Jew lives in the outer courtyard, or a Jew and a gentile live in the outer courtyard and another Jew lives in the inner courtyard, [the gentile's presence] causes carrying to be forbidden in the outer courtyard until [the Jews] rent his domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 382:17) mentions another instance when the same ruling applies: when the two Jews share the outer courtyard and the gentile lives in the inner courtyard alone.

We may enter into a rental agreement with a gentile [for this purpose] on the Sabbath itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Although making business agreements including rentals is normally forbidden on the Sabbath (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:12).</i> For this rental arrangement is comparable to the subordination of a domain; [i.e.,] it is done to make a distinction and not as a [hard and fast] rental agreement.

From <i>Eruvin</i> 62a, it would appear that the rationale for this ruling is that regarding business agreements among gentiles, a monetary value worth less than a <i>prutah</i> is significant. (See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:9.)<br>The Rambam's wording, however, suggests a second rationale - that since the agreement is more of a Rabbinic requirement than a business arrangement, an agreement which does not comply entirely with contractual law is also acceptable. The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that the concept stated by the Rambam is necessary. Otherwise, the rental agreement would not be strong enough to have bearing on halachic questions involving a Jew.</i><br>A gentile's wife can rent out [his domain] without his knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Eruvin</i> 80a, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> maintains that it is possible to rent the gentile's domain from his wife even though he himself refuses to agree to such an arrangement.</i> Similarly, [the gentile's] hired workers or his servants can rent out [his domain] without his knowledge. [This applies even when these] hired workers or servants are Jewish.<br>If a person asked a gentile permission to use a place in the gentile's domain to store some of his possessions, and the gentile agreed, he is considered as being a partner in the gentile's domain. Accordingly, he may rent out [the gentile's domain on his behalf] without his knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 63b-64a mentions that a gentile once refused to rent out his property, and the Rabbis were able to secure permission to carry in the courtyard through such an arrangement.</i> If a gentile has many workers, servants, or wives, it is sufficient if one rents out his domain from one of them.
When two Jews and a gentile are living in the same courtyard, and [only] one of the Jews rented the gentile's domain on the Sabbath, he may subordinate the ownership of his domain to the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Since neither had rented the gentile's property before the commencement of the Sabbath, it was impossible for them to establish an <i>eruv</i> (Halachah 9). As stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 21, an <i>eruv</i> must be established before the commencement of the Sabbath. Hence, in this instance, the only alternative is for one to subordinate the ownership of his domain to the other.</i> [This causes carrying] to be permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">More specifically, the person to whom the domain was subordinated may carry. The person who himself subordinated the domain may not carry unless his colleague subordinates his domain to him, as stated in Halachah 5. Nevertheless, what is significant about this halachah is that it shows that although carrying was forbidden in the courtyard at the commencement of the Sabbath, it may be permitted later on.</i> Similarly, if the gentile dies on the Sabbath, one Jew may subordinate the ownership of his domain to the other, and thus cause carrying to be permitted.
[The following rule applies when] one gentile rents his property to another:<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is based on actual incident that occurred concerning Resh Lakish and his student, Rabbi Chanina, when they were on a journey (<i>Eruvin</i> 65b).</i> If it is impossible for the owner to evict the second gentile until the conclusion of his rental contract, we must rent [the domain] from the second gentile,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the original owner retains the right to store some of his goods on the property or use it in any way, we may rent it from him (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 382:18).</i> for he takes the place of the owner.<br>When, in contrast, the owner can evict the renter whenever he desires - if the renter is not present,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the tenant is present, the property may be rented from the original owner (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 382:62).</i> the Jews are permitted to carry if they rent the property from its original owner.
[The following rules apply when] there are several Jews and a gentile living in the same courtyard, and there are windows leading from one Jew's house to another Jew's house. If they have established an <i>eruv</i> via the windows, and thus they are permitted to transfer articles from house to house via the windows, the gentile's presence causes them to be forbidden to transfer articles via the entrances unless they rent from him.

Instead of shunning them, we must make every effort to draw them close to their spiritual roots.

Nor may we rent his property, for he is not considered to be a gentile. The alternative is for him to subordinate the ownership of his domain to a Jew whose conduct is acceptable.<br>Similarly, if a Jew whose conduct is acceptable lives together with this Sadducee in a courtyard, the presence of the Sadducee causes carrying to be forbidden [in the courtyard] unless he subordinates the ownership of his domain to his colleague.

They, nevertheless, restricted the scope of that decree to carrying articles from the houses outside, and from the areas outside the houses to the houses.

One may not, however, transfer articles left in the homes to these areas unless an <i>eruv</i> is made.
What is implied? When an article was left in a courtyard at the commencement of the Sabbath, whether the inhabitants of the courtyards established an <i>eruv</i> for themselves or whether they failed to do so, it is permitted to take the article from the courtyard to the roof or to the top of the wall. Afterwards, it may be taken from the roof to another roof adjacent to it, even if [the second roof] is higher or lower than it.<br>From the second roof, it may be taken to another courtyard, and from the other courtyard to a third roof in a third courtyard.

In this instance, however, additional leniency is granted, because the entire concept of forbidding carrying within water is Rabbinic in origin.

Similarly, if a beam four handbreadths wide<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This width is required so that one person will not be drawing water from his colleague's side of the cistern. <i>Eruvin</i> 86b states that the Sages estimated that a bucket would not travel more than four handbreadths under water.</i> has been placed over the mouth of the cistern, one may fill [his bucket] from this side of the beam, and the other may fill [his bucket] from the other side of the beam.

Other authorities (Rashba, as quoted by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 376), by contrast, maintain that if there are entrances from the courtyards to the path, a projection is required. The difference between these two approaches is reflected in the rulings of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 376:2).</i>
[The following rules apply when the wall of] a small courtyard is broken down, opening [the courtyard] entirely to a large courtyard before the commencement of the Sabbath:<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the wall is broken on the Sabbath itself, the inhabitants of the smaller courtyard may continue to carry since they were permitted to do so at the commencement of the Sabbath (the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 9:2).</i> The inhabitants of the large courtyard may establish an <i>eruv</i> for themselves and they are permitted to carry, for portions of their wall still remain [standing] on each side.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 374:3) states that portions of the wall of the small courtyard must jut into the large courtyard.

Chapter 4

When the inhabitants of a courtyard eat at the same table<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's wording is not to be understood literally; if people eat in the same room, even if they eat at different tables - indeed, even if they eat their own food - they are not required to establish an <i>eruv</i>. These concepts are also reflected in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 6:7) and quoted as halachah by the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 370:4).<br>The most common application of this concept today would be a hotel or a bungalow colony, where many people eat in the same dining room, and yet have their own private rooms or dwellings.</i> - even though they have their own individual dwellings - they are not required to establish an <i>eruv</i>; they are considered to be the inhabitants of a single household.<br>Just as the presence of a person's wife, the members of his household, or his servants does not cause him to be forbidden [to carry], nor does their presence make an <i>eruv</i> necessary, so too, these individuals are considered to be the members of a single household, for they all eat at the same table.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This highlights the principle that it is the place where a person eats, and not where he sleeps, that is most significant in defining his place of residence.</i>
Similarly, if [the inhabitants of this courtyard] must establish an <i>eruv</i> together with the inhabitants of another courtyard, they are required to bring only one loaf to the place where the <i>eruv</i> is established.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In Chapter 1, Halachah 15, the Rambam states that every household participating in the <i>eruv</i> is required to contribute a loaf of bread. Nevertheless, in this instance, since all the inhabitants of the courtyard are considered to be members of a single household, only one loaf is required.</i><br>Similarly, if the <i>eruv</i> is established in their [house], they do not have to contribute to the <i>eruv</i>, just as the house in which an <i>eruv</i> is placed does not have to contribute a loaf of bread. [The rationale for both these laws is] that all these dwellings are considered to be a single dwelling.
Similarly, the inhabitants of a courtyard who established an <i>eruv</i> together are considered to be [the members of] a single household.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Although they eat in separate places, joining together in the <i>eruv</i> causes them to be considered as if they share the same table.</i> If it is necessary for them to establish an <i>eruv</i> together with the inhabitants of another courtyard, they are required to bring only one loaf to the place where the <i>eruv</i> is established. Similarly, if the <i>eruv</i> is established in their [house], they do not have to contribute a loaf of bread.
When five people collect an <i>eruv</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they collected loaves of bread from each household in the courtyard.</i> [for one courtyard] with the intent of bringing it to the place where an <i>eruv</i> will be established [together with the inhabitants of another courtyard],<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shem Yosef</i> explains that this latter phrase represents the new concept contributed in this halachah, as opposed to the previous one.

Moreover, all th at is necessary is to bring a single loaf of bread. Since the <i>eruv</i> was collected, all [the inhabitants of the courtyard] are considered to be the members of a single household.
When a father and his son, or a teacher and his student<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam uses a singular term, the same law applies to many sons or many students.</i>are dwelling in the same courtyard, it is not necessary for them to establish an <i>eruv</i>; they are considered to be a single household. Although at times they eat at a single table and at times they do not eat [together], they are considered to be a single household.
[The following rules apply to] brothers, each of whom has a house of his own, and who do not eat at their father's table, and to wives and servants who do not eat at their husband's or master's table at all times, but rather they [occasionally] eat at his table in payment for the work they do for him,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's comparison of these individuals to hired workers reflects his interpretation of the expression במקבלי פרס in <i>Eruvin</i> 73a.

For as explained at the beginning of Chapter 2, and in Halachah 12 of this chapter, a guest's presence makes no difference in this context. Rather, the point of the comparison above is to emphasize the intermediate status of these individuals. On one hand, like guests, they are at times considered to be members of the person's household. On the other hand, since they have their own dwellings and often eat there, there is reason to consider them as having separate households.</i><br>If there are no other people dwelling together with them in the courtyard, they are not required to establish an <i>eruv</i>. If they establish an <i>eruv</i> with [the inhabitants of] another courtyard, a single <i>eruv</i> suffices for them. If the <i>eruv</i> is established in [one of] their [homes], they are not required to contribute a loaf of bread.<br>If there are other people living in the courtyard together with them, each of them is required to contribute a loaf of bread [for the <i>eruv</i>] like the other inhabitants of the courtyard.

[Our Sages decreed that the presence of a person causes carrying] to be forbidden unless an <i>eruv</i> is established, only when the person possesses a dwelling in the courtyard in which he will [ordinarily] eat [a meal of] bread. The [possession of a] place to sleep, by contrast, does not cause carrying to be forbidden.<br>For this reason, even if a person decided to eat his meals consistently in a gatehouse or an <i>exedra</i>, his presence does not cause carrying to be forbidden, because this is not considered a dwelling.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For these structures are not fit to serve as dwellings. In contrast, were a person to eat continually in a barn, a wood shed, or a shed for straw, these are considered to be dwellings, and an <i>eruv</i> is necessary (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 370:1; see Chapter 1, Halachah 16).</i>
[The following rules apply when] there are ten dwellings, one within the other:<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to get to the inner dwellings, one must pass through the outer ones.</i> [The inhabitants of] the innermost dwelling and the one before it are required to provide the <i>eruv</i>. The eight outer dwellings, by contrast, are not required to contribute to the <i>eruv</i>. [The rationale is that] since many people walk through them, they are regarded as a gatehouse. [As mentioned above,] a person who lives in a gatehouse [does not cause others to be forbidden to carry].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 370:52 extends this principle and applies it to people renting separate rooms in a single home.

Therefore, his presence causes [carrying] to be forbidden unless he contributes to the <i>eruv</i>.
[The following rulings apply in the situation to be described:] There are two courtyards [each containing several houses] and three houses [in between them]. The houses have entrances to each other, and [the outer two houses]<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">But not the middle house.

Similarly, the inhabitants of the other courtyard brought their <i>eruv</i> through the house that had an entrance for them and placed it in the middle house.<br>[The inhabitants of] these three houses do not have to contribute a loaf of bread [to the <i>eruv</i> [for the following reasons]: The middle house is the house in which the <i>eruv</i> was placed. The two houses on its side are each considered to be a gatehouse for the inhabitants of the courtyard.
[Different rules apply, however, if the situation changes. For example,] there are two courtyards [each containing several houses] and two houses [in between them] with entrances to each other. [The inhabitants of one courtyard] bring their <i>eruv</i> through the house that is open to them and place it in the second house, which is adjacent to the other courtyard.<br>[The inhabitants of the other courtyard also] bring their <i>eruv</i> through the entrance that is open to them and place it in the other house [which is adjacent to the other courtyard]. In such a situation, [the inhabitants of] neither [of the courtyards are considered to have] established an <i>eruv</i>. For each of them has placed his <i>eruv</i> in the gatehouse of another courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">And an <i>eruv</i> that was placed in a gatehouse is not acceptable, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 16.</i>
Although one of the inhabitants of a courtyard is in the midst of his death throes,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This reflects a general principle in Torah law. Until a person actually stops breathing, he is considered to be alive.

[The presence of] a guest, by contrast, does not cause [carrying] to be forbidden, as explained above.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i>
[The following rules apply when] one of the inhabitants of a courtyard leaves his home and spends the Sabbath in another courtyard, even in a courtyard adjacent [to the one in which his home is located]: If he had no thought of returning to his home on the Sabbath, he does not cause [carrying] to be forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale is that a dwelling without an owner is not considered to be a dwelling (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 371:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 371:1).</i><br>When does the above apply? With regard to a Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For it is unlikely that a Jew will return to his home on the Sabbath. Moreover, even if he did so, we apply the principle that since carrying was permitted for a portion of the Sabbath, it is permitted for the entire Sabbath (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> With regard to a gentile, by contrast, he causes [carrying] to be forbidden even when he spends the Sabbath in another city,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions a more lenient view, which states that if the gentile spends the Sabbath at a place that is more than a day's journey from home, the inhabitants are allowed to carry, because it is impossible for him to arrive on the Sabbath. This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 371:1).<br>The Ramah grants a further leniency and permits the inhabitants to carry when the gentile stays in another courtyard in the same city. If the gentile returns to his home on the Sabbath, the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 371:2 permits the inhabitants to continue to carry. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 371:8, by contrast, rules that this is forbidden.</i> unless his domain is rented from him. [The rationale is] that it is possible for him to return on the Sabbath.
When the owner of a courtyard rents houses in the courtyard to others and [stipulates that] he may [continue] to leave articles or types of merchandise in each of these homes, [the presence of the renters] does not cause [carrying] to be forbidden. Since he still has authority in each of the houses, everyone is considered to be his guest.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Note the ruling of the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 370:2), which states that this decision applies only when there are no other inhabitants in the courtyard besides the owner and the persons to whom he rented dwellings, or the <i>eruv</i> was brought into the house of the owner.</i><br>When does the above apply? When he left an article that may not be carried<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) adds that this applies also when the articles are too heavy to be lifted on the Sabbath.</i> on the Sabbath - e.g., <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Produce from which <i>terumah</i> and the tithes have not been separated. These tithes may not be separated on the Sabbath (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:9,14), nor is it permitted to carry such produce on the Sabbath (<i>loc. cit.</i> 25:19).</i> or slabs of metal,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Since this metal has not been fashioned into a useful article, it is forbidden to be carried on the Sabbath (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6).</i> in these homes. When, by contrast, he leaves articles that may be carried in each of the homes, [the presence of the renters] causes [carrying] to be forbidden unless they establish an <i>eruv</i>. For it is possible that he will remove them [on the Sabbath], and then he will be left without any authority [in these dwellings].
[The following rules apply when] the inhabitants of a courtyard forgot and did not establish an <i>eruv</i>. They may not remove articles from their homes to the courtyard, nor from the courtyard to their homes. However, concerning articles that were left in the courtyard at the commencement of the Sabbath:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 372, which explains there are authorities who differ with regard to whether one is permitted to carry an article within a courtyard when an <i>eruv</i> has not been established - if that article hads been placed in one of the homes at the commencement of the Sabbath, but was inadvertently taken from the home and placed in the courtyard. Although the Rambam would appear to forbid carrying the article, Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 130b) and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Eruvin</i> 91b) maintain that carrying it is permitted within the courtyard.</i> [the inhabitants] may carry such articles throughout the courtyard and all its extensions.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachah 19.</i><br>[The following rules apply when] there is a porch<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 8:3), the Rambam describes a porch as an intermediate level, at least ten handbreadths high, through which stairs lead to the courtyard.</i> or an upper storey [that opens out to a courtyard],<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the inhabitants of the porch or the upper storey descend through a stairwell into the courtyard, and from the courtyard they proceed to the public domain. The Rabbis consider the stairwell equivalent to an entrance. Hence, they liken the situation to one in which two courtyards are positioned adjacent to each other with an entrance between them.</i> and the inhabitants of the courtyard have established an <i>eruv</i> for themselves and the inhabitants of the porch have established an <i>eruv</i> for themselves:<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., unless an <i>eruv</i> is established, the inhabitants of these domains are forbidden to carry within the others' domains and within the property shared by both.</i> Regarding articles that were left in their homes at the beginning of the Sabbath, the inhabitants of the porch or the upper storey are permitted to carry them throughout the porch and all of its extensions or throughout the upper storey and all of its extensions. The inhabitants of the courtyard may carry within the courtyard and all its extensions, [but they are forbidden to carry from the courtyard to the upper storey or the porch, or from the upper storey or the porch to the courtyard unless an <i>eruv</i> is established].<br>Similarly, if one person lives in the courtyard, and another person lives in the upper storey, and they forgot to establish an <i>eruv</i>, the owner of the upper storey may carry within the upper storey and all of its extensions, and the owner of the courtyard may carry within the courtyard and all of its extensions. [They may not, however, carry from one domain to the other without an <i>eruv</i>].
What is implied? When there is a rock or a mound within the courtyard that is less than ten handbreadths high, it is considered to be [important to] both the courtyard and the porch, and [the inhabitants of] both are forbidden to bring articles there from their homes.<br>If [the rock or the mound] is ten handbreadths high and is less than four handbreadths removed from the porch, it is considered to be an extension of the porch, for they are of similar [height]. Therefore, the inhabitants of the porch may carry on it.<br>If it is four or more handbreadths removed from the porch, even when it is ten [handbreadths high] it is considered to be an extension of both the courtyard and the porch, since both can use it by throwing [objects onto it]. Therefore, [the inhabitants of] both are forbidden to bring articles there from their homes until they establish an <i>eruv</i>.<br>When there is a pillar four [or more] handbreadths wide in front of the porch [it is considered to be a divider]. [Therefore, the presence of] the porch does not cause [carrying] to be forbidden within the courtyard, for a separation has been made between [one domain and the other].
When projections protrude from the walls [of the courtyard], all those that are below ten handbreadths high are considered to be extensions of the courtyard, and may be used by the inhabitants of the courtyard. All those that are within ten handbreadths of the upper storey may be used by the inhabitants of the upper storey.<br>The remainder, those that are located more than ten handbreadths above the ground and more than ten handbreadths below the upper storey, are forbidden to them both. Neither may use them for articles from the homes unless an <i>eruv</i> is established.
[The following rules apply to] a cistern located in [such] a courtyard: If it is filled with produce that was <i>tevel</i> - and hence is forbidden to be carried on the Sabbath - or with objects of a similar kind, it and the enclosure around it,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 15:9.</i> are regarded like a rock or a mound in a courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the cistern is filled with objects that are forbidden to be carried, it is not given any special importance, and instead is considered like any other large, distinct object in the courtyard.</i> If [the enclosure] is ten handbreadths high and close to the porch, it is considered to be an extension of the porch.<br>If, by contrast, it is filled with water,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">It is, by nature, fit to be used by the inhabitants of both domains. Therefore, neither is entitled to do so, unless they establish an <i>eruv</i>.</i> neither the inhabitants of the courtyard nor the inhabitants of the porch may bring [water] to their homes from it unless they establish an <i>eruv</i>.
[The following rules apply when] there are two courtyards, one lying behind the other, and the inhabitants of the inner courtyard enter and exit by passing through the outer courtyard: When [the inhabitants of] the inner courtyard have established an <i>eruv</i>, but [the inhabitants of] the outer courtyard have not, [the inhabitants of] the inner courtyard may carry [within their domain], but [the inhabitants of] the outer courtyard may not.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for these rulings is obvious; the concept is mentioned primarily to show the contrast with the subsequent clauses of the halachah. Unlike the inhabitants of the inner courtyard, who can reach their own dwelling only by passing through the outer courtyard, there is no reason for the inhabitants of the outer courtyard to pass through the inner one.</i><br>When [the inhabitants of] the outer courtyard have established an <i>eruv</i>, but [the inhabitants of] the inner courtyard have not, [the inhabitants of] both are forbidden to carry; [the inhabitants of] the inner courtyard because they did not establish an <i>eruv</i>, and the inhabitants of the outer courtyard because the people who pass through [their domain] did not establish an <i>eruv</i> [even within their own domain].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling reflects the principle stated in Halachah 23, that when people are forbidden to carry within their own domain, they cause carrying to be forbidden in the domain through which they pass.

[If the inhabitants of both domains have established separate <i>eruvin</i>,] but one of the inhabitants of the outer courtyard forgot to join in the <i>eruv</i> [in his domain], the inhabitants of the inner courtyard are still permitted to carry.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For their <i>eruv</i> is still intact and there is no necessity for the inhabitants of the outer courtyard to pass through the inner one.</i><br>When, by contrast, one of the inhabitants of the inner courtyard forgot to join in the <i>eruv</i> [in his domain], [not only are the inhabitants of the inner courtyard forbidden to carry, the inhabitants of] the outer courtyard are also forbidden to do so.

[The following rules apply when] both courtyards establish a single <i>eruv</i>: If the <i>eruv</i> is placed in the outer courtyard, and one of the inhabitants - whether an inhabitant of the outer courtyard or of the inner courtyard - forgets to join in the <i>eruv</i>, [all] the inhabitants of both courtyards are forbidden [to carry]<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>eruv</i> is not acceptable for the inner courtyard, because it is not located within the courtyard itself, and it is not acceptable for the outer courtyard, because one of the inhabitants of the courtyard did not participate.</i> unless he subordinates [the ownership of] his domain to them.

If [only] one person<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 6:10), the Rambam explains that this can refer to members of an extended household - e.g., a father and his children.</i> was dwelling in one [of these] courtyards and [only] one person was dwelling in the other, there is no need for them to establish an <i>eruv</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Needless to say, to carry from one courtyard to the next, an <i>eruv</i> is necessary.</i> each one is permitted to carry in his courtyard.<br>If, however, a gentile dwells in the inner courtyard, even though he is merely a single [household], he is considered as many individuals, and [his presence] causes [the inhabitants of] the outer courtyard to be forbidden to carry until his domain is rented.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages explained that gentiles are less private about the details of their personal dwellings than the Jews. Thus many people will know of the gentile's presence and the fact that his domain was not rented, but they may not know that only one Jew lives in the outer courtyard. Therefore, they might not realize that this is an exception, and generally, when one courtyard leads to another, an <i>eruv</i> is required (<i>Eruvin</i> 75b). Although when one Jew lives in a courtyard together with a gentile, he is generally not required to rent his domain (Chapter 2, Halachah 9), an exception is made in this instance.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 382:17) mentions this as a singular opinion, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 382:59 states that it is not shared by most authorities. Some have noted that the Rambam himself uses a plural form of the word "rent," and they interpret this as referring to an instance where two Jews live in the outer courtyard.</i>
[The following laws apply when there are] three courtyards with entrances to each other, and there are many people dwelling in each courtyard: When [the inhabitants of] the two outer courtyards have established an <i>eruv</i> together with [the inhabitants of] the inner courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the inhabitants of the inner courtyard have established two <i>eruvin</i>, one with each of the outer courtyards.</i> [the inhabitants of] the inner courtyard are permitted to carry within the outer courtyards, and [the inhabitants of] the outer courtyards are permitted to carry within the inner courtyard, but the inhabitants of the two outer courtyards may not carry in the other outer courtyard unless all three join in a single <i>eruv</i>.<br>If a single individual dwells in each courtyard, there is no need for them to establish an <i>eruv</i>, although many individuals pass through the outer courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that these two clauses refer to different situations. The first clause refers to a situation in which all three courtyards have entrances to the public domain, while this clause refers to a situation where only the outermost courtyard has an entrance to the public domain, and the inhabitants of this courtyard must pass through it.<br>Based on the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>, <i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i> explains that the fundamental aspect of this ruling is the interpretation of Rabbi Shimeon's statements that the inhabitants of the middle courtyard are permitted to carry in either of the outer courtyards (<i>Eruvin</i> 45b, 48b). Although these statements were made regarding a situation in which only one courtyard opened up to the public domain, one can extrapolate that the same ruling would apply when all three open to the public domain.</i> [The rationale is that] each of these individuals is permitted to carry in his own domain. If, however, there are two individuals living in the inner courtyard [different rules apply]. Since [these individuals] are forbidden to carry in their own domain until they establish an <i>eruv</i>, they cause the single individuals in the middle and in the outer domains to be forbidden [to carry] unless the two inhabitants of the inner domain establish an <i>eruv</i>.<br>This is the governing principle: When a person who is forbidden to carry in his own domain passes through another domain, his passage causes carrying to be forbidden there. When, by contrast, the person may carry in his own domain, his passage through another domain does not cause carrying to be forbidden there.
[The following rules apply when] there are two balconies positioned over a body of water, and one is positioned above the other: Although [the inhabitants of] each of them have constructed a partition ten handbreadths high descending [to the water],<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 15:15, which interprets this law as referring to a balcony with a hole in its floor, from which water is drawn and through which it is poured.

Although the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> attempts to justify the Rambam's position, most authorities (including the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 355:5) follow the Ra'avad's view.</i><br>If the distance between the upper balcony and the lower balcony is more than ten handbreadths, and [the inhabitants of] each have established separate <i>eruvin</i>, they are both permitted to draw [water].
If [the inhabitants of] the upper [balcony] did not make a partition, but the inhabitants of the lower [balcony] did, even [the inhabitants of] the lower balcony are forbidden to draw [water].

If, afterwards, he refuses to allow one of the members of the lane to take from the <i>shituf</i>, the <i>shituf</i> is nullified.</i> [The rationale is that this individual] revealed that his intent was that they are not all to be considered partners who do not object to each other's [use of the combined resources].<br>When one of the inhabitants of a lane who usually participates in a <i>shituf</i> fails to do so,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">With the intent of nullifying the <i>shituf</i>.</i> the inhabitants of the lane may enter his home and take [his share for] the <i>shituf</i> against his will. If one of the inhabitants of a lane refuses<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in contrast to the previous law, this person was not a regular participant in the <i>shituf</i>.</i> to join with the others in the <i>shituf</i>, he may be compelled to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the communal court may compel him to join the <i>shituf</i>. Nevertheless, in contrast to the previous law, the matter may not be dealt with by the inhabitants of the lane themselves (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 367:1).<br>The <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> (Vol. II, <i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, Responsum 39) points to <i>Hilchot Sh'chenim</i> 5:12 (quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat</i> 162:1), which appears to contradict this interpretation, for it states that the members of the lane may compel each other to build a pole or a beam for a courtyard. The <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> explains, however, that there is a difference between the structure of a courtyard (i.e., the pole or the beam) and participation in an <i>eruv</i>.</i>
When one of the inhabitants of a lane owns a storeroom of wine, oil, or the like, he may grant a small share to all the inhabitants of the lane and establish a <i>shituf</i> on their behalf. The <i>shituf</i> is acceptable even though he did not separate or designate [the wine he granted them, but rather left it] mixed together [with the remainder] in the storeroom.
[When the inhabitants of] a courtyard that has two entrances, each leading to a different lane, establish a <i>shituf</i> with one of [the lanes] and not the other,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to most authorities, the inhabitants of such a courtyard have the right to establish a <i>shituf</i> with the inhabitants of both lanes, if they desire. If they chose this option, they may bring articles to and from both lanes. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> maintains that the Rambam accepts this view, as well.<br>There are opinions (see Rabbenu Yehonatan) that maintain that Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi differs with this view, and maintains that in such a situation, the inhabitants of the courtyard may join in a <i>shituf</i> with the inhabitants of only one lane. Some maintain that the Rambam also accepts this view. This is surely the opinion of the Ra'avad, who objects to the Rambam's ruling here.<br>This interpretation cannot be justified in light of the Rambam's ruling in Halachah 7. Accordingly, <i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i> offers a different interpretation of Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's view, as is explained in the following note.</i> [they] are forbidden to bring articles to and from the second lane.<br>Therefore, if a person [sets aside food for a <i>shituf</i>], grants a portion to all the inhabitants of the lane, and establishes a <i>shituf</i> on their behalf, he must notify the inhabitants of that courtyard. For they must make a conscious decision to join the <i>shituf</i>, since this is not [necessarily] to their benefit,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In Chapter 1, Halachah 20, the Rambam states: "A person need not inform the inhabitants of a lane or a courtyard that he has granted them [a portion of food] and established an <i>eruv</i> for them, for these deeds are to their benefit, and a person may grant a colleague benefit without the latter's knowledge."<br>The rationale behind that ruling is that it is surely to the benefit of the inhabitants of a courtyard to be able to bring articles to and from areas outside their courtyard. In this instance, however, the establishment of a <i>shituf</i> is not necessarily to the benefit of the inhabitants of that courtyard, and they must therefore be notified beforehand.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the <i>shituf</i> is not necessarily to their benefit, because they have another alternative to transfer articles to and from the courtyard from outside. Hence, it is possible that the inhabitants of the courtyard do not desire to join in the <i>shituf</i> with this lane, lest doing so increase the amount of human traffic in their courtyard.<br>According to Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's view, the question facing the inhabitants of this courtyard is: If they do not join in a <i>shituf</i> with either of the lanes, they are allowed to transfer articles left in the courtyard at the commencement of the Sabbath to and from both the lanes. Should they join in a <i>shituf</i> with only one of the lanes, although their opportunities are greatly increased with regard to transferring articles to and from the lane with which they established the <i>shituf</i>, they lose the opportunity to transfer articles to and from the other lane. Perhaps they would desire to maintain the situation as it was originally rather than forfeit this opportunity.</i> because it is possible that they desire to join in a <i>shituf</i> with [the inhabitants of] the other lane, and not with this one.
A person's wife may participate in an <i>eruv</i> on his behalf without his knowledge, provided he does not [intend to cause] his neighbors to be forbidden [to carry].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In this ruling, the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Eruvin</i> 80a (the source for this halachah) parallels that of Rabbenu Chanan'el. Rashi, the Ra'avad, and others offer a directly opposite interpretation of that passage. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 367:1) follows the latter view.<br>The Ra'avad's objection to the Rambam's ruling revolves around the interpretation of the passage cited above, which begins:<br>A [gentile] officer lived in Rabbi Zeira's neighborhood. [The Jews] offered to rent his domain on the Sabbath, but he refused.<br>They came to Rabbi Zeira and asked whether they could rent it from his wife. He told them, "...A person's wife may establish an <i>eruv</i> on his behalf without his knowledge."<br>According to the Rambam, the law Rabbi Zeira cites as support is not entirely analogous to the situation regarding which he was asked. A Jew's wife may establish an <i>eruv</i> without his knowledge, but not against his will. A gentile's wife, by contrast, may rent out his domain even when he has already refused (<i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>).</i> If he does [intend to cause] them to be forbidden [to carry], however, she may not join an <i>eruv</i> on his behalf, nor may she join a <i>shituf</i> on his behalf unless he consents.<br>What is meant by "[intend to cause] them to be forbidden [to carry]"? That he says, "I will not join in an <i>eruv</i> or a <i>shituf</i> with them."
[The following rules apply when a courtyard opens up to two lanes and] the inhabitants of the courtyard have established a <i>shituf</i> with [the inhabitants of] one of the lanes: If they had originally established the <i>shituf</i> with one type of produce, even if the produce in the <i>shituf</i> was consumed entirely, one may establish a second <i>shituf</i> and grant them a portion; there is no need to inform them a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since they agreed to join in the <i>shituf</i> previously, we assume that they desire to continue the arrangement (<i>Levush, Orach Chayim</i> 368:1).</i><br>If they have established the <i>shituf</i> with two types<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Eruvin</i> 80b) explains that this refers to establishing the second <i>shituf</i> with a different type of produce, rather than establishing the first <i>eruv</i> with two types of produce.

If [the produce] was consumed entirely, one may [establish a second <i>shituf</i> and] grant them a portion; it is, however, necessary to inform them.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i> explains that, even according to the Rambam, using two types of produce for a <i>shituf</i> is undesirable. Therefore, if the <i>shituf</i> must be established anew, it is necessary to check whether the inhabitants of the lane consent.</i><br>If the number of inhabitants within the courtyard is increased, one may grant [the newcomers] a portion in the <i>shituf</i>, but one must notify them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For perhaps they would desire to establish the <i>shituf</i> with the inhabitants of the other lane.</i>
If the inhabitants of this courtyard have established a <i>shituf</i> with the inhabitants of this lane from one entrance, and have established another <i>shituf</i> with the inhabitants of the other lane from the other entrance, they are permitted [to carry to and from] both [of these lanes]<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See the notes on Halachah 4.</i>, and [the inhabitants of] both [lanes] are permitted [to carry within the courtyard].

[The following rules apply when the inhabitants of] this courtyard usually [pass] through one entrance [into one lane], but do not usually [pass] through a second entrance [into another lane]: They cause carrying to be forbidden [in the lane to which] the entrance through which they usually [pass opens].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Unless they join in a <i>shituf</i>.</i> They do not cause carrying to be forbidden [in the lane to which] the entrance through which they do not usually [pass opens].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Even when they do not join in a <i>shituf</i>.</i><br>If [the inhabitants of this courtyard] have established a <i>shituf</i> with [only] the lane through which they do not usually [pass], [the inhabitants of] the other lane are allowed [to carry];<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Provided they establish an <i>eruv</i> for themselves.</i> they do not have to establish a <i>shituf</i> with [the inhabitants of this courtyard].
[A leniency is granted in the following situation.] The inhabitants of the lane [through] which [the inhabitants of] this courtyard usually pass established a <i>shituf</i> by themselves. [The inhabitants of the courtyard] did not join in this <i>shituf</i>, nor have they joined in a <i>shituf</i> with the inhabitants of the lane [through] which they do not usually pass. The inhabitants of the latter lane [also] did not establish a <i>shituf</i> for themselves.<br>Since [the inhabitants of the courtyard] have not joined in a <i>shituf</i> at all, they are considered part of the lane [through] which they do not usually pass. Since both these groups of individuals have not established a <i>shituf</i>, they are classed together, so that they will not cause [the inhabitants of] the lane who established the <i>shituf</i> to be forbidden [to carry].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the principles stated in the previous halachah, it would seem that the fact that the inhabitants of this courtyard have not joined in the <i>shituf</i> of the lane through which they usually pass would cause carrying to be forbidden in this lane. Nevertheless, since the inhabitants of this courtyard have another alternative, they are considered part of the courtyard through which they do not usually pass. The rationale is that through this decision, one group of people (the inhabitants of the lane who established a <i>shituf</i>) benefits (for their <i>shituf</i> is considered acceptable), and another group (the inhabitants of the courtyard in question) does not lose (for they are forbidden to carry regardless) [<i>Eruvin</i> 49a].</i>
[The following rules apply when] a courtyard has an entrance to a lane and another entrance to a valley or to an area enclosed for purposes other than habitation, which is larger than the area [needed] to sow two <i>se'ah</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:3, this is an area of 5000 square cubits. The Sages forbade carrying in such an area, even when it is surrounded by a proper partition (<i>loc. cit.</i>:1-2).</i> Since it is forbidden to transfer articles from the courtyard to that enclosed area, [the inhabitants of the courtyard] rely only on the entrance to the lane. Therefore, they cause the inhabitants of the lane to be forbidden [to carry] unless they join together with them in a <i>shituf</i>.<br>If, however, the enclosed area is the size of the area [needed] to sow two <i>se'ah</i> or less, its presence does not cause the inhabitants of the lane to be forbidden [to carry]. Since carrying is permitted within the entire enclosed area, [the inhabitants of the courtyard] rely on the entrance that is exclusively theirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we assume that the entrance that is more important to them is the entrance to the enclosed area and not the entrance to the lane. Hence, the fact that they have an entrance to the lane is of no significance.</i>
When one of the inhabitants of a lane goes away and spends the Sabbath in another place, [the fact that he owns a domain in the lane] does not cause carrying to be forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 4, Halachah 13.</i><br>Similarly, if one of the inhabitants of a lane builds a pillar that is four handbreadths wide [or more] before his entrance, [the fact that he owns a domain in the lane] does not cause carrying to be forbidden.

[The following rules apply when] the inhabitants of a lane have joined together in a <i>shituf</i>, but several of the inhabitants forgot and did not join: [Those who forgot] should subordinate the ownership of their domain to those who joined in the <i>shituf</i>. The laws governing the subordination of the ownership of their domain are the same as the laws governing the subordination of the ownership of a domain when one or more of the inhabitants of a courtyard forgot to join in an <i>eruv</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2, Halachot 1-5.</i><br>We have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 4, Halachah 1.</i> that a person and [all] the members of his household who are dependent on him for meals are considered to be a single entity with regard to the establishment of an <i>eruv</i> for a courtyard and a <i>shituf</i> for a lane.
[The following rules apply when the inhabitants of] all the courtyards established <i>eruvin</i> for each of the courtyards, and afterwards they all joined in a <i>shituf</i> for the lane: When one of the inhabitants of a lane forgot to join in the <i>eruv</i> with the other inhabitants of his courtyard, he does not lose any [privileges]. For all of them have joined together in a <i>shituf</i>, and it is on the <i>shituf</i> that they rely.<br>The only reason it was required to establish an <i>eruv</i> within the courtyards, together with the <i>shituf</i>, is so that the children will not forget the law of the <i>eruv</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an <i>eruv</i> established within a courtyard will be seen by the children, and they will know that it is only because of this <i>eruv</i> that the restrictions against carrying are relaxed. If, however, there is only a <i>shituf</i> in the lane, it is unlikely to be noticed by the children, and they will not know about the restrictions established by our Sages (<i>Eruvin</i> 73b). (See, however, the notes on the following halachah.)</i> [And in this instance, that requirement has been met,] for <i>eruvin</i> were established in the courtyards.<br>If, however, one of the inhabitants of the lane forgot to join in the <i>shituf</i>, carrying is forbidden in the lane.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>shituf</i> requires the participation of all the inhabitants of the lane.</i> The inhabitants of the courtyards, however, may carry in their [respective] courtyards.

[The following rules apply when the inhabitants of all the courtyards] have joined in a <i>shituf</i>, but all have forgotten to establish <i>eruvin</i> for their respective courtyards: If they do not stint on sharing their bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if one person will give a colleague bread - other than the bread of the <i>shituf</i> - when asked (Ra'avad, <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Eruvin</i> 6:8).</i> they may rely on the <i>shituf</i> for one Sabbath alone. This leniency is granted, however, only because of the difficulty [of their immediate circumstance].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Moshe HaCohen notes an apparent contradiction between this halachah and Chapter 1, Halachah 19, which states that if a <i>shituf</i> was established with bread, there is no need for <i>eruvin</i> within the courtyards, because the children will be aware of the collection of loaves of bread. He maintains that this leniency may be accepted at all times. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 387:1) accepts this view.<br>The Ramah mentions an even greater leniency. He maintains that we may rely on the <i>shituf</i> although <i>eruvin</i> were not established, even when the <i>shituf</i> was established with wine or other foods. His rationale is that in Talmudic times, the <i>shituf</i> was established by one member of each courtyard, who acted on behalf of all the inhabitants. At present, however, all the inhabitants of the lane contribute individually to the <i>shituf</i>.<br>This rationale is not accepted by the later authorities; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 387:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 387:12 suggest following the opinion of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>.</i>
When <i>eruvin</i> have been established between the courtyards and the homes [of a lane], but a <i>shituf</i> has not been established, carrying [an article] more than four cubits [within the lane] is forbidden, as [would be the law] within a <i>carmelit</i>.<br>[The rationale is that] since <i>eruvin</i> were established between the courtyards and the homes, the lane is considered as though it opened only to homes, and not to courtyards. Therefore, we are not allowed to carry within its area at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling is based on his conception [<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:8; Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 6:8)] that a lane must have several courtyards and several houses open to it.<br>The Ra'avad, Rav Moshe HaCohen, and others object to the Rambam's ruling, explaining that it follows the opinion of Rav (<i>Shabbat</i> 131a). Nevertheless, the halachah ultimately follows the view of Shmuel (<i>Eruvin</i> 74a), who maintains that the lane and the courtyards are considered to be a single entity. According to this view, when a <i>shituf</i> has not been established, there is no difference whether or not <i>eruvin</i> have been established within the courtyards. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 388:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 388:4 rule according to this view.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> adds that the stringency suggested by the Rambam applies only when the open side of the lane is adjusted with a pole or a beam. If, however, the open side is adjusted with a frame of an entrance, even the Rambam would agree that one is permitted to carry articles that were left in the lane at the beginning of the Sabbath.</i><br>If the inhabitants of the courtyards have not established <i>eruvin</i>, they may carry articles left in the [lane] at the commencement of the Sabbath throughout its entire area, as is the law regarding a courtyard in which an <i>eruv</i> was not established.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Halachot 18-19.</i>

The acceptability of such an enclosure is discussed in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:16 and notes.</i> Every courtyard should establish an <i>eruv</i> for itself, so that the children will not forget [the laws of <i>eruvin</i>]. Afterwards, all the inhabitants of the city join together in a <i>shituf</i> in the same way as a <i>shituf</i> is established in a lane.<br>If the city had once been the property of a single individual, even if later it became the property of many individuals, it is possible for all [the inhabitants] to join in a single <i>shituf</i> and [be permitted] to carry throughout the entire city.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in contrast to the situation mentioned in the following halachah, there is no need to set a certain area outside the <i>eruv</i>.</i> Similarly, although a city is owned by many, if it has only one entrance, all [the inhabitants] may join in a single <i>shituf</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Since the city has only one entrance, it does not resemble a public domain, and the chance that people will develop a misconception is far less.

When a person leaves a city on Friday afternoon and deposits food for two meals at a distance from the city,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Note Chapter 7, Halachah 1, which states that one may establish an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> by actually going on Friday afternoon to the location one desires to establish as one's place for the Sabbath. The possibility of depositing food was instituted by our Sages to expedite the process of establishing an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>, by allowing a person to have an agent deposit food for him.</i> but within its Sabbath limits,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 5 regarding both these factors.</i> and by doing so establishes this as his place for the Sabbath, it is considered as if his base for the Sabbath is the place where he deposited the food for two meals, even if he returns to the city [before the commencement of the Sabbath] and spends the night in his home. This is called an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his introduction to these halachot, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions why two seemingly separate concepts, <i>eruv chatzerot</i> and <i>eruv t'chumin</i>, are considered to be part of the same mitzvah and are described together. He explains that since both are Rabbinic ordinances that involve placing food in a specific place so that the place will be considered to be one's base for the Sabbath, they can be considered to be a single mitzvah.</i>
On the following day, the person may walk two thousand cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A cubit is 48 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 57.6 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> from [the place of] his <i>eruv</i> in all directions.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A person is always allowed to proceed 2000 cubits in all directions from the place where he spends the Sabbath. (See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 27:1.) Since the place where the person's <i>eruv</i> is located is considered his base for the Sabbath, his 2000 cubits are calculated from this place.</i> Accordingly, when a person walks two thousand cubits from his <i>eruv</i> on the following day within his city, he may walk only to the end of his limit. If, however, the entire city is included within his limit, the city is considered as if it were only four cubits, and he may continue to the end of his limit beyond the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements here parallel his statements in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 27:5, which explain that if a person's Sabbath limits end within a private domain, he is not entitled to proceed to the end of the domain. If, however, that domain is included within his 2000 cubits, it is considered to be only four cubits.<br>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 408:1) quotes the view of the <i>Tur</i>, the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>, and other Ashkenazic authorities, who differ and maintain that one is allowed to proceed to the end of the private domain, even if it is further than 2000 cubits from one's <i>eruv t'chumin</i>. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 408:12 mentions that many authorities support this ruling. See note 8.</i>
What is implied? When a person places his <i>eruv</i> one thousand cubits to the east of his house in a city, he may walk two thousand cubits eastward from the place of his <i>eruv</i> on the following day. He may also walk two thousand cubits to the west, one thousand from the <i>eruv</i> to his house, and one thousand from his house westward. He may not walk to the end of the city [limits, if they are] beyond the thousand cubits.<br>If there are less than one thousand cubits from his house to the boundaries of the city<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (in his gloss on this halachah and on <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 27:5) mentions the fact that when one establishes the Sabbath limits of a city, an imaginary square is constructed around the furthermost points in the city's area, and the Sabbath limits are calculated from that square. Thus, it is possible that land that is outside the city's urban limits may still be within the square from which its Sabbath limits are calculated.<br>Although a leniency is used in the calculation of the city's Sabbath limits, and these outlying areas are considered to be part of the city proper, this leniency is not turned into a stringency. If a person's 2000 cubits end beyond the city's urban area, but not beyond these outlying areas, the city is considered to be included within his Sabbath limits, and thus only four cubits in length. This concept is quoted by the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 408:1).</i> - even if his Sabbath limits end one cubit outside the city - the entire city is considered to be four cubits, and he may proceed 996 cubits beyond it to complete [his Sabbath limits of] two thousand [cubits].
According [to this principle], if a person placed his <i>eruv</i> two thousand cubits [towards the east] of his house in a city, he would lose [the possibility of walking] throughout the entire [area of] the city [to the west]. Thus, he would be permitted [to walk] two thousand cubits from his house to his <i>eruv</i> and from his <i>eruv</i> two thousand cubits further. He may not walk even one cubit to the west of his house in the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, the <i>Tur</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 408:1) differ with the Rambam on this point and allow a person to walk throughout the entire city where his house is located, provided he sleeps in his home (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 408:11).</i><br>When a person places his <i>eruv</i> in a private domain - even if it is a metropolis like Nineveh, the ruins of a city, or a cave that is fit to be used as a dwelling - he is permitted to walk throughout its entire area and two thousand cubits beyond it in all directions.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The rationale for this decision can be explained as follows: As explained in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 27:1, the prohibition against proceeding more than 2000 cubits from one's place of residence on the Sabbath is derived from the verse (Exodus 16:29 : "No man should leave his place on the seventh day." The term "his place" refers to the private domain in which he is located, regardless if it be a house, a city, or any other location.<br>By making an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>, a person redefines the location of "his place" on the Sabbath. Even if he is not located at that place at the commencement of the Sabbath or shortly thereafter, the location where he deposits his <i>eruv</i> is considered to be "his place" for this Sabbath. Therefore, if that location is a private domain, that entire domain is considered to be "his place," and the calculation of his Sabbath limits begins from its boundaries.</i>
If a person deposits his <i>eruv</i> within the city in which he is spending the Sabbath, his actions are of no consequence and his [Sabbath limits] should not be measured from his <i>eruv</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">If his acts had been considered significant, he would have decreased his Sabbath limits, and not increased them. For without the <i>eruv</i>, he would be allowed to proceed two thousand cubits from the city limits. This follows the Rambam's conception, in contrast to that of the <i>Tur</i> mentioned above.</i> Instead, he is like the other inhabitants of the city, and may proceed two thousand cubits in all directions outside the city.<br>If a person deposits his <i>eruv</i> in the outlying areas that are included within the city's boundaries, and the calculation of [the city's] Sabbath limits begins beyond these areas,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 27:5 (see also note 6), it is explained that the Sabbath limits of a city are calculated from an imaginary square that may include several uninhabited areas in the city's periphery. If the <i>eruv</i> is placed in these outlying areas, it is as if it were placed in the city proper.</i> it is as if he had deposited it within the city [proper].<br>If a person deposits his <i>eruv</i> beyond the city's Sabbath limits, it is not considered to be a [valid] <i>eruv</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>eruv</i> is beyond his Sabbath limits, i.e., over 2000 cubits from the city's periphery, he may not reach it during <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>, the time when the acquisition of the <i>eruv</i> takes effect (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 408:30). Therefore, the <i>eruv</i> is not valid. Instead, his Sabbath limits are defined from his home (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 408:4).</i>
An <i>eruv t'chumin</i> should be established only for a purpose associated with a mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quotes the Rashba as saying that this applies only when one establishes one's <i>eruv</i> by using food. If, however, one actually walks to a place beyond a city's boundaries <i>beyn hash'mashot,</i> and in this manner establishes this location as one's place for the Sabbath, it is acceptable even if one's intent is not associated with a mitzvah. Although this view is not accepted by all authorities, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 415:1 rules that in a pressing situation, one may rely on the more lenient view.</i> - e.g., a person who desires to go to the house of a mourner, to a wedding feast, to greet his teacher or to greet a colleague returning from a journey, or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The expression "a purpose associated with a mitzvah" is used in a very extended sense in this context. As an example, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 415:1) mentions a desire to take a stroll in a pleasant orchard.</i><br>[Similarly, one may establish an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>] out of fear - e.g., a person who seeks to flee from gentiles, from thieves or the like. If a person establishes an <i>eruv</i> for other reasons,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., to proceed toward the end of one's Sabbath limits, so that one will be closer to a destination to which one desires to travel for business purposes after the Sabbath.</i> his <i>eruv</i> is still valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Although this is a matter of disagreement among the Rabbis, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 415:1) follows the Rambam's view.<br>It must be emphasized that the "fear" mentioned by the Rambam refers to a situation when there is not an obvious danger to the person's life. Were that to be the case, he would be allowed to proceed beyond the 2000 cubits even if he had not established an <i>eruv</i>, for a threat to life takes precedence over the observance of all the Torah's laws with the exception of idol worship, sexual immorality, and murder.</i>
All foods that may be used for a <i>shituf</i> may also be used for an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to an <i>eruv chatzerot</i>, for which bread alone may be used, all foods may used for an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> and a <i>shituf</i>, with the exception of water, salt, and mushrooms (Chapter 1, Halachah 8).</i> Similarly, all foods that may not be used for a <i>shituf</i> are also unacceptable for an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>.<br>What is the minimum measure of food acceptable for an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>? The [amount of] food [sufficient] for two meals for every individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 9. There is, however, a distinction. Regarding a <i>shituf</i>, even when there are thousands of inhabitants involved, it is necessary to provide two meals only for eighteen people. In contrast, regarding an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>, food must be set aside for every person who desires to use the <i>eruv</i>.</i> When the food in question is a side dish,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 10.</i> the minimum measure is an amount sufficient to accompany two meals - [i.e., it is governed by] the same [laws] as a <i>shituf</i>.
It is necessary for [the place where] a person [intends to spend the Sabbath]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This does not mean the person's home, or the place where he is standing <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>, but rather the place where he would partake of his <i>eruv</i>. There are times when it is impossible for him to partake of the <i>eruv</i> in the domain in which it is located - to cite the example given by the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 3:3: the <i>eruv</i> was placed in a tree more than ten handbreadths above the ground. In such instances, since it is not permissible to carry the <i>eruv</i> from the place where it was deposited to the place where the person would partake of it, the <i>eruv</i> is not valid.</i> and his <i>eruv</i> to be in the same domain, so that it is possible for him to partake of it <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This is the time when the Sabbath commences, and it is at this hour that the <i>eruv</i> must be established.</i><br>Therefore, if the person intends to spend the Sabbath in a public domain and places his <i>eruv</i> in a private domain, or if he [intends to spend the Sabbath in a] private domain and places his <i>eruv</i> in a public domain, the <i>eruv</i> is not valid. For it is impossible to transfer articles from a private domain to a public domain without performing a transgression.
If, however, a person intends to spend the Sabbath in a private domain or in a public domain, and he places his <i>eruv</i> in a <i>carmelit</i>, or he intends to spend the Sabbath in a <i>carmelit,</i> and he places his <i>eruv</i> in a private domain or in a public domain, the <i>eruv</i> is acceptable. For during <i>beyn hash'mashot,</i> the time when the <i>eruv</i> is established, it is permitted to transfer articles from either of these domains to a <i>carmelit</i> for the sake of a mitzvah.<br>All the [prohibitions] instituted because of a Rabbinic decree were not applied <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> in a situation involving a mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 24:10.</i> or in a case of urgent need.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">And, as mentioned in Halachah 6, it is only in situations such as these that it is permissible to establish an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>.</i>
[The following rule applies when a person] places his <i>eruv</i> in a closet, locks it, and then loses the key: If he can remove his <i>eruv</i> without performing a labor that is forbidden by the Torah, it is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, he must perform a labor forbidden by the Torah to obtain the <i>eruv</i>, it is not valid. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 22.)</i><br>If a person places his <i>eruv</i> at the top of a reed or a shaft that grows from the earth, it is not valid. This is a decree, lest he break off [the reed].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Although Rabbinic prohibitions are not normally enforced <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> when a mitzvah is involved, our Sages maintained their decree in this instance. For one might think that the reed has already been detached, and it is likely that one might break it (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 3:3).</i> If [these articles] were already detached and were implanted [in the ground], the <i>eruv</i> is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Provided that they are not implanted in the public domain and there is not a basket, four handbreadths by four handbreadths, at their top (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 409:14).</i>
Whenever a person deposits an <i>eruv</i>, he is granted four cubits [in which to carry] at the place of the <i>eruv</i>. Thus, if a person places an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> at the end of the Sabbath limits, and then the <i>eruv</i> rolled two cubits beyond the Sabbath limits,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, noting that the matter is the subject of a difference of opinion between our Sages (<i>Eruvin</i> 45a): Rabbi Eliezer maintains that a person is considered to be located in the midst of the four cubits he is granted. Therefore, as the Rambam states here, he is granted only two cubits in either direction. Rabbi Yehudah differs and maintains that he is granted four cubits in either direction. It is Rabbi Yehudah's view that is accepted as halachah.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 12:15 and 27:11, the Rambam follows Rabbi Yehudah's view. There is, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> maintains, a difference between the ruling regarding the laws of carrying and the ruling regarding the Sabbath limits. His distinction is explained by the Radbaz (Vol. VI, Responsum 2237), who states that for an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> to be effective a person must be able to reach it while standing within the Sabbath limits. If the <i>eruv</i> is within two cubits of the Sabbath limits, the person can bend over and reach it. If it is further away, he would have to leave his Sabbath limits to reach it. Hence, it is not valid.<br>The Ra'avad's decision is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 409:5).</i> the <i>eruv</i> is valid; it is not considered to have left its [original] place.<br>If, however, the <i>eruv</i> rolls more than two cubits [beyond the Sabbath limits], it is not valid, for it is beyond the Sabbath limits. And [as stated previously,]<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 5.</i> when an <i>eruv</i> is placed beyond a person's Sabbath limits, it is invalid, since the person is unable to reach his <i>eruv</i>.
The following rules apply when] an <i>eruv</i> rolled [more] than two cubits beyond the Sabbath limits,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous halachah.</i> it became lost or burned, or it contained <i>terumah</i> and it became impure:<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Impure <i>terumah</i> may not be eaten.</i> If this occurred before the commencement of the Sabbath, the <i>eruv</i> is invalid. If it occurred after nightfall, it is valid. For an <i>eruv</i> is established <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">If it is valid at this time, what happens to it afterwards is of no consequence (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 3:4).</i><br>If one is in doubt [when the above occurred], the <i>eruv</i> is valid, for when there is a doubt [with regard to the validity of] an <i>eruv</i>, it is considered acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>eruv</i> was acceptable when deposited, it is granted a <i>chezkat kiyyum</i> - i.e., we assume that the <i>status quo</i> remained the same and that it remained acceptable until immediately before the difficulty was discovered (<i>ibid.</i>).<br>(Although the Rambam mentions this concept in his Commentary on the Mishnah, his ruling in the following halachah implies that he does not accept this as a hard and fast rule.)</i> Therefore, if the <i>eruv</i> was eaten <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>, it is acceptable.
[The above rules are relevant in the following situation:] Two individuals told a person,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">They both empowered him to act as a <i>shaliach</i> (agent) and establish an <i>eruv</i> for them.</i> "Go and establish an <i>eruv</i> on our behalf." He established an <i>eruv</i> for one before the commencement of the Sabbath, and for the other, <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>. The <i>eruv</i> that was established before the commencement of the Sabbath was eaten <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>, and the <i>eruv</i> that was established <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> was eaten after nightfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This situation represents a paradox: If <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> is considered to be before the commencement of the Sabbath, the <i>eruv</i> that was eaten <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> is not valid. If <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> is considered to be after the commencement of the Sabbath, the <i>eruv</i> that was established <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> is not valid.</i><br>[The ruling is that] both <i>eruvin</i> are valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">If, however, the <i>eruv</i> that was established <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> was eaten <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>, it is not valid. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 393:3.)</i> For [the halachic status of] <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> is a matter of doubt,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beyn hash'mashot</i> is the period between sunset and the appearance of three stars. There is a question if this period is considered to be part of the day or part of the night. See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:4.</i> and when there is a doubt [with regard to the validity of] an <i>eruv</i>, it is considered acceptable.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling (based on <i>Shabbat</i> 34a) reflects a difference of opinion among the Rabbis. As mentioned in the notes on the previous halachah, most authorities maintain that an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> (in contrast to an <i>eruv chatzerot</i>) is acceptable when there is a doubt involved, only because it possesses a <i>chezkat kiyyum</i> - i.e., we knew that it was acceptable beforehand, and we presume that its status remained the same until we know otherwise. (See also Halachah 15.)<br>Therefore, other authorities (Rabbenu Chanan'el, Rabbenu Tam, Rashba) interpret this law as referring to an <i>eruv chatzerot</i>. There a <i>chezkat kiyyum</i> is not necessary, for an <i>eruv chatzerot</i> is only a Rabbinic institution (in contrast to an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>, which involves a prohibition that has its source in the Torah itself).<br>Nevertheless, it is possible to justify the Rambam's decision, for the prohibition against going beyond two thousand cubits is Rabbinic in origin (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 27:1). Accordingly, since we are sure that the food set aside for the <i>eruv</i> can be eaten before the commencement of the Sabbath, and the doubt is merely whether the <i>eruv</i> was made at the proper time, the question concerns a matter of Rabbinic law. Therefore, we follow the principle, "Whenever there is a doubt concerning a point of Rabbinic law, the more lenient opinion is followed."<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 415:3) quotes both views (although the Rambam's appears to be favored). The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 415:11 favors the other view.</i> Nevertheless, if there is a question whether or not it is past nightfall, at the outset one should not proceed to establish an <i>eruv</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Although at the outset, an <i>eruv chatzerot</i> may be established <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> (see Chapter 1, Halachah 21), the laws regarding an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> are more severe (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 2:6).</i> [After the fact,] if one established an <i>eruv</i>, it is valid.
Although an avalanche falls on an <i>eruv</i> before the commencement of the Sabbath, it remains acceptable provided it can be removed without performing a [forbidden] labor. For it is permissible to remove it <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Although the stones are <i>muktzeh</i> and removing them on the Sabbath would be forbidden, since a mitzvah is involved there is no prohibition against removing them <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>.</i>, which is the time when the <i>eruv</i> is established.<br>If the avalanche fell on it after nightfall, it is also valid, even if it cannot be removed without performing a [forbidden] labor.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For at the time the <i>eruv</i> was established it was valid, and what happens afterwards is of no consequence. (See also Chapter 1, Halachah 21.)</i> If there is a doubt whether [the avalanche] fell before the commencement of the Sabbath or after nightfall, it is acceptable, because when there is a doubt [with regard to the validity of] an <i>eruv</i>, it is considered acceptable.
If, however, one established an <i>eruv</i> with <i>terumah</i> concerning which there was a doubt about its ritual purity,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, it is forbidden to partake of <i>terumah</i> if it is ritually impure. In this instance, however, there is a doubt and we do not know if, in fact, the <i>terumah</i> has contracted ritual impurity or not.</i> the <i>eruv</i> is invalid, for the meal is not fit to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">With this phrase, the Rambam clarifies his position with regard to a question asked by many authorities based on the situation described in Halachah 13. As mentioned in the notes on that halachah, many authorities maintain that an <i>eruv</i> is considered acceptable when there is a doubt regarding its validity only when it possesses a <i>chezkat kiyyum</i>. As proof, they point to this law, which appears to indicate that the <i>eruv</i> is not considered acceptable because it was never known to be valid.<br>The Rambam explains that the reason why the <i>eruv</i> is not acceptable in this instance is not that it lacks a <i>chezkat kiyyum</i>, but because it may never be eaten. Because of the doubt involved, it is forbidden to partake of this loaf.<br>To summarize, in the instances mentioned in the previous halachot, the doubt revolves around the acceptability of the <i>eruv</i>. Therefore, we follow the principle, "when there is a doubt [with regard to the validity of] an <i>eruv</i>, it is considered acceptable." In this halachah, the doubt is whether the <i>terumah</i> may be eaten. This is a question of Torah law, and we are required to rule stringently (<i>Noda BiY'hudah, Yoreh De'ah</i>, Vol. I, Responsum 65).</i><br>[Similarly, an <i>eruv</i> is invalid in the following situation]: A person possessed two loaves of bread that were <i>terumah</i>. One of them was pure and one was impure, but he did not know which was pure and which was impure.

When an <i>eruv</i> is placed in a cemetery, it is invalid. [The rationale is that] it is forbidden to derive benefit from a cemetery.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This ruling is the subject of a debate among our Sages (<i>Eruvin</i> 26b). The Rambam follows the more stringent view. Although other authorities accept the more lenient ruling, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 409:1) cites the Rambam's decision.

The difficulty arises afterwards. Since the person desires that the <i>eruv</i> be maintained in the cemetery, he is deriving benefit from it. Hence, it is forbidden to establish an <i>eruv</i> in this manner (<i>Eruvin</i> 31a; Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 3:1).<br>(See the gloss of Rabbi Akiva Eiger, who asks why the <i>eruv</i> is unacceptable.

Chapter 7

When a person left his city on Friday and stood in a specific place within the Sabbath limits, or at the end of the Sabbath limits, and said,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 9, there is no need to make an explicit statement. It is sufficient to make a mental resolve.</i> "This is my place for the Sabbath," although he returns to his city and spends the night there, on the following day he is permitted to walk two thousand cubits from that place in every direction.<br>This is the principal manner [of establishing] an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> - actually to go there by foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This point is the subject of a difference of opinion among our Sages (<i>Eruvin</i> 4:9). Rabbi Meir maintains that the fundamental provision for establishing an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> involves depositing food. An allowance was made, however, for a poor person who could not afford to deposit food; he was permitted to establish an <i>eruv</i> by actually going to the desired place.<br>Rabbi Yehudah differs and states that the fundamental provision involves actually being at the place. Our Sages granted a leniency to a rich man, however, and allowed him to employ an agent to deposit food. As the Rambam states, the halachah follows Rabbi Yehudah.</i> [The Sages allowed] one to establish an <i>eruv</i> by depositing an amount of food sufficient for two meals in the place - although one did not actually go there and stand there - to expedite matters for a rich person, so that he will not have to travel by himself, and could instead send his <i>eruv</i> with an agent who will deposit it for him.
Similarly, when a person decides to establish his place for the Sabbath in a specific location - e.g., at a tree, a house, or a fence that he can identify, and at nightfall:<br>a) there are two thousand cubits or less between him and that place; and<br>b) he sets out to reach that place and establishes it to be his place for the Sabbath,<br>on the following day, he may proceed to that desired location and continue two thousand cubits in all directions. [Moreover, this law applies] even when he did not actually reach that place or stand there, but instead a friend had him turn back and spend the night at his home, or even if he himself decided to turn back, or was prevented [from going there by other factors].<br>[The rationale is that] since he made a resolve to establish [that location] as his place for the Sabbath, and set out for that purpose, it is considered as if he stood there or deposited his <i>eruv</i> there.
When does the above apply? To a poor person, for we do not burden him [with the obligation of] depositing an <i>eruv</i>, or to a person who is in a distant place - e.g., a person on a journey who is afraid that soon night will fall. [This leniency is granted] provided there is enough time in the day for him to reach the designated place before nightfall - if he ran with all of his strength - and there are two thousand cubits or less between him and that place at nightfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the person could not reach the intended place before nightfall if he continued at his present pace, but could reach it if he ran with all his might. We do not require him to make this effort, and allow him to establish the <i>eruv</i> by intent and continue walking at his normal pace (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 409:11).</i><br>If, however, he was not far from the place in question,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if at the outset he was at home, but was simply too lax about establishing an <i>eruv</i>. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>:13.)</i> nor was he a poor man, or<br>there was not enough time in the day for him to reach the designated place before nightfall if he ran with all of his strength, or<br>there were more than two thousand cubits between him and that place at nightfall, or<br>he did not specify the location he intended as his place for the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachot 5-7.</i><br>he is not able to designate a distant location as his place for the Sabbath. Instead, he is granted no more than two thousand cubits in all directions from the place at which he is standing at nightfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's ruling implies that the person's intent is of no consequence whatsoever, and his "place" for the Sabbath is the place where he is standing at nightfall.<br>The Ra'avad differs regarding the instance when there are more than two thousand cubits between the person and the location he intended to be his "Sabbath place." The person's intent establishes that location as his "Sabbath place." Since there are more than two thousand cubits between the person and his "place," he is compared to one who has gone beyond his Sabbath limits and is entitled to walk only within a square of four cubits. (See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 27:11.)<br>Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:11) mentions both views, it appears to favor that of the Ra'avad. The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> notes that the Ra'avad's views are shared by the Rashba, Rabbenu Asher, and many others. Hence, he suggests that it be followed.</i>
When a person stood in a private domain before the commencement of the Sabbath and designated it as his "place" for the Sabbath, or if he was traveling on a journey and had the intent of spending the Sabbath in a private domain that he knew and [thus] designated as his "place" for the Sabbath, he is entitled to walk throughout that domain and [continue] two thousand cubits in all directions.<br>If, however, this private domain was not enclosed for the purpose of habitation, or was a mound or a valley [different rules apply]: If it is the size of the area necessary to grow two <i>se'ah</i> [of grain] or less,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., 5000 square cubits.</i> one is entitled to walk throughout that domain and two thousand cubits in all directions.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there is no difference between it and an ordinary private domain.</i> If it is larger than the size of the area necessary to grow two <i>se'ah</i> [of grain],<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Because of its size, and the fact that it was not enclosed for the purpose of habitation, our Sages feared that it might become confused with a private domain. Hence, they applied more stringent rules. (See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, Chapter 16.)</i> [one's "place"] is considered to be only four cubits in that domain, [and one may proceed only] two thousand cubits from [this place] in all directions.<br>The same [law applies] when one places one's <i>eruv</i> in a domain that was not enclosed for the purpose of habitation.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's wording in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 27:4, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> infers that if the person stands within a large private domain that was not enclosed for the purpose of habitation on Friday and establishes it as his "Sabbath place," he may walk throughout its entire area and two thousand cubits in all directions. This opinion is not accepted by the Rashba and other authorities, and it is their view that is cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 396:2.</i>
When a person [desires to] establish a distant location as his "place" for the Sabbath, but does not specify its exact location, he is not considered to have established it as his "place."<br>What is implied? A person was traveling on a journey and declared, "I will spend the Sabbath in such and such a place," "...in such and such a field," "...in such and such a valley," or "...a thousand cubits..." or "...two thousand cubits away from my present place," he has not established the distant location as his place for the Sabbath. [Instead,] he is entitled to proceed only two thousand cubits in all directions from the place where he is standing at nightfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Based on their interpretation of <i>Eruvin</i> 49b, the Ra'avad, the Rashba, Rabbenu Asher, and others differ with the Rambam's ruling in this instance. Rather than totally ignore the person's intent, these authorities maintain that he is allowed to consider the distant location as his "Sabbath place." There is, however, a restriction. Since he did not specify his place, he is penalized according to the size of the location.<br>To cite the example mentioned in the following halachah: a person desires to establish a tree as his "Sabbath place." He does not specify his place and there are 20 cubits under the tree. According to the Rambam, his intent is ignored entirely, and his Sabbath limits are measured from the place where he is standing at nightfall. According to the other authorities, his "Sabbath place" is considered to be the tree, and it is from there that his Sabbath limits are measured. Nevertheless, because he did not specify his desired location, instead of being granted two thousand cubits in all directions, he is granted only 1980 cubits [i.e., 2000 minus 20 (the size of the area under the tree)].<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 409:11) mentions both views, but appears to favor that of the other authorities. The <i>Eliyahu Rabba</i> states that the view of the other authorities should be followed. The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i>, by contrast, states that consideration should also be given to the Rambam's view.</i>
[The following rule applies] when a person says, "I will spend the Sabbath under this and this tree," or "...under this and this rock." If there are eight cubits or more under the tree or the rock, the person has not established [the location] as his "place" for the Sabbath, because he did not specify an exact location. For were he to spend the Sabbath in a particular four cubits, [he could be in error,] lest the other four cubits be the ones defined as his "Sabbath place."<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">We are not concerned with which of the eight cubits the person will use while under the tree, for all these eight cubits are within the person's Sabbath limits. The question is which four of these eight cubits will be considered to be one's "Sabbath place" regarding the determination of the Sabbath limits. For this, the precise determination of one's "Sabbath place" is the matter of focus (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 4:7.)</i>
Therefore, it is necessary for a person to have the intent of establishing [a specific portion of the space - e.g.,] at [the tree's] base, its southern side, or its northern side, as his "Sabbath place."<br>If there are less than eight cubits under [the tree], and he intends to spend the Sabbath under it, he acquires it [as his "Sabbath place"]. [The rationale is that] there is no room [under the tree] for two places, and at least a portion of his [Sabbath] "place" has been defined.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., regardless of the side from which one measures the two thousand cubits of the Sabbath limits, a portion of the four cubits that a person is granted will be included in the four cubits from which the Sabbath limits are measured. This must be so, for there are less than eight cubits under the tree (<i>ibid.</i>).</i><br>[This is the course of action to follow when] two people were coming on a journey, and one is familiar with a tree, fence, or other place that he desires to establish as his place, and the other is not familiar with the place. The person who is unfamiliar [with the place] should entrust the right to establish his "Sabbath place" to the one who is familiar with the place, and the latter should have the intent that he and his colleague should spend the Sabbath in the place with which he is familiar.
[The following rules apply when] the inhabitants of a city have sent a person to deposit their <i>eruv</i> in a specific place, he set out on his way, but a colleague had him return, and he did not deposit the <i>eruv</i> [on behalf of the inhabitants]: Since their <i>eruv</i> was not deposited in the desired location, [that location] is not established as their "Sabbath place," and they are not allowed to walk more than two thousand cubits in all directions from [the boundary of] their city.<br>[The person who went to deposit the <i>eruv</i>], by contrast, is considered to have established that location as his "place" for the Sabbath, because he had set out on the way to that location with the intent of establishing it as his "Sabbath place."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 2. However, Rashi (<i>Eruvin</i> 52a), Rabbenu Yehonatan, the Rashba and many other authorities maintain that the leniency mentioned in Halachah 2 applies only when a person is on a journey, but not when the entire purpose for his setting out is to deposit an <i>eruv</i>. Their views are cited in the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 410:2.</i> Therefore, on the following day, he is permitted to proceed to the [desired] place and continue two thousand cubits from it in all directions.
The statement made previously,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Halachah 2.</i> that a person who desires to establish a location as his Sabbath place from a distance need merely set out on the way, does not mean that he must depart and begin walking through the fields. Even if he merely descended from the loft with the intent of proceeding to [the desired] place, and before he left the entrance of his courtyard, a colleague prevailed on him to return, he is considered to have set out [on his way], and may establish his "Sabbath place" in that location.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 52a relates that Rav Yehudah bar Ishtata brought Rav Natan bar Oshaya a basket of fruit for the Sabbath. Although it was late on Friday afternoon, Rav Yehudah turned to leave so that he could establish an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> to enable himself to return home on the following day. Rav Natan let him descend a single step and then told him to stay.</i><br>When a person establishes a location as his "Sabbath place" from a distance, he need not make an explicit statement, "This and this location is my 'Sabbath place.' It is sufficient for him to make a resolve within his heart and to set out on the way [to] establish that location as his "Sabbath place."<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Eruvin</i> 52a) and other authorities differ, and state that this leniency applies only when a person has two homes whose Sabbath limits are adjoining. In this instance, it is clear that even though a colleague prevailed upon him to return, his intent was to establish his "Sabbath place" at the desired location so that he could proceed to his other home.<br>When, however, a person does not own a home in the adjoining area, and a colleague is able to prevail upon him to return, he is not able to establish a "Sabbath place" in a distant location, unless he makes an explicit statement to that effect. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 410:2) quotes the Rambam's view, while the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 410:7 mentions the other opinions.</i><br>Needless to say, a person who traveled by foot and actually stood at the location that [he desired to] establish as his "Sabbath place" need not make a statement. Making a resolve within his heart is sufficient to establish [the location as his "Sabbath place"].
When students who sleep in the house of study, but go and eat their Sabbath meals [in the homes of] people who live in the fields and the vineyards who show hospitality to wayfarers passing through, [the house of study is considered their "Sabbath place"] and not the place where they eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This applies even if during <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> they are at the homes of their hosts (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 409:39).</i><br>They may walk two thousand cubits from the house of study in all directions. [The rationale is] that were it possible for them to eat in the house of study, they would not go to the fields at all. They consider the house of study alone as their dwelling.

Chapter 8

One may not deposit two <i>eruvin</i> - one in the west and one in the east - so that one will be able to walk for a portion of the day [in the direction of] one of the <i>eruvin</i>, and to rely on the second <i>eruv</i> for the remainder of the day. [The rationale is that] one may not make two <i>eruvin</i> for a single day.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This principle is based on the following concept: Since an <i>eruv t'chumin</i> establishes a particular location as a person's place for the Sabbath, only one such place can be established, and not two.</i><br>If a person erred, and established two <i>eruvin</i> in two different directions, because he thought that this was permitted, or he told two people to establish an <i>eruv</i> for him, and one established an <i>eruv</i> to the north and one established an <i>eruv</i> to the south, he may walk only in the area common to both of them.
What is meant [by the expression], "he may walk only in the area common to both of them"? That he may walk only in the area that is within [the Sabbath limits] of both of these locations. [For example,] if one [of his agents] deposited an <i>eruv</i> 1000 cubits to the east [of his city's periphery] and the other deposited an <i>eruv</i> 500 cubits to the west, the person for whom the <i>eruvin</i> were deposited may walk only 1000 cubits to the west, as would be permitted [the agent] who established the <i>eruv</i> in the east, and 1500 cubits to the east, as would be permitted [the agent] who established the <i>eruv</i> in the west.<br>Therefore, if one established an <i>eruv</i> 2000 cubits to the east and the other established an <i>eruv</i> 2000 cubits to the west, the person may not move from his place.
It is permissible for a person to establish two <i>eruvin</i> in two opposite directions and make the [following] stipulation: "If tomorrow there is a mitzvah or a necessity that arises and requires me to walk in this direction, then it is this <i>eruv</i> that I am relying upon, and the other <i>eruv</i> is of no consequence. If, by contrast, it is necessary that I go to the other direction, the <i>eruv</i> [in that direction] is the one on which I will rely, and the first <i>eruv</i> is of no significance.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions, this halachah is dependent on the concept that in cases of Rabbinic law, the principle of <i>b'reirah</i> applies. Thus, retroactively it is considered that at the commencement of the Sabbath, the person had the intent of establishing an <i>eruv</i> in the direction that he was eventually required to proceed.</i><br>"If I am required to go in both directions, I may rely on whichever of the <i>eruvin</i> I desire, and thus go in whichever direction I desire. If nothing [out of the ordinary] arises, and I am not required to go in either direction, neither of the <i>eruvin</i> is of consequence, nor do I rely on them. Instead, my situation is the same as that of any other inhabitant of my city, and I may proceed two thousand cubits in all directions from the city's wall."
Just as it is forbidden to proceed beyond a city's [Sabbath] limits on the Sabbath, so too, it is forbidden to proceed beyond those limits on the holidays and on Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> (in his gloss on <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 27:1), who states that the Rambam considers the limits on travel on the holidays and on Yom Kippur as Rabbinic in origin. In support, he cites the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i>, Chapter 19, regarding the negative commandments punishable by lashing: "A person who goes beyond the [Sabbath] limits on the Sabbath, a person who performs a forbidden labor on a holiday."</i><br>Just as a person who transfers an article from one domain to another on the Sabbath is liable, so too, a person who transfers an article from one domain to another on Yom Kippur is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The liability incurred by the violator is somewhat different. A person who willfully performs any of the Sabbath labors is liable for execution, while one who violates a forbidden labor on Yom Kippur is liable only for <i>karet</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 1:2.)</i> On the holidays, by contrast, it is permitted to transfer articles from one domain to another.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 1:4, which states that since the prohibition against the forbidden labor of transferring articles was lifted on the holidays regarding the preparation of food, it was lifted entirely.</i><br>Therefore, <i>eruvin</i> should be established in courtyards and <i>shitufim</i> should be established in lanes for Yom Kippur, as they are established for the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 416:31, which mention opinions that see a benefit in the establishment of <i>eruvin</i> in courtyards on the holidays as well.</i> Similarly, <i>eruvei t'chumin</i> may be established for Yom Kippur and the holidays as they are established for the Sabbath.
[The following rules apply to] a holiday that occurs next to the Sabbath - whether before it or after it - or to the two days of a holiday as observed in the diaspora: A person may establish two <i>eruvin</i> in two opposite directions and rely on either for the first day, and the other for the second day.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although for a single Sabbath one may not establish <i>eruvin</i> in two opposite directions, this rule does not apply when the Sabbath and a holiday follow one another. The Sabbath and the holidays represent two different expressions of holiness (<i>Eruvin</i> 38b). Therefore, the location defined as one's "place" - and thus an <i>eruv</i> established - for one does not necessarily apply regarding the other.<br>Similarly, regarding the two days of the holidays observed in the diaspora: in essence, the holidays were to be observed for only one day. The observance of a second day was instituted only because of uncertainty regarding the calendar. (See <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 5:4-5.) Therefore, the two days are also considered to be separate entities.<br>The Ra'avad suggests qualifying the Rambam's statements. The Rambam, however, appreciated the problem that he raised and clarified the issue in Halachah 12.</i> Similarly, he may establish a single <i>eruv</i> in one direction and rely on it for one of the two days, and on the other day consider himself like the other inhabitants of the city<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This also involves a redefinition of one's place. Instead of its being considered to be the location of the <i>eruv</i>, it is considered to be one's home.</i> - i.e., it is as if he did not made an <i>eruv</i>, and thus he is entitled to proceed two thousand cubits in all directions [from the city's periphery].<br>When does this apply? To the two days observed as holidays in the diaspora. Regarding the two days of Rosh HaShanah [different rules apply]. They are considered to be a single [extended] day,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since these two days were observed as a holiday even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> when the moon was sanctified on the basis of the testimony of witnesses (<i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 5:7), they are considered to be a single expression of holiness. <i>Eruvin</i> 39b refers to them as "one long day," and the halachic requirements that apply to one day apply also to the other.</i> and one may establish an <i>eruv</i> in one direction alone for both these days.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See the notes on Halachah 8 with regard to whether or not it is necessary for the <i>eruv</i> to remain in its place for both nights of the holiday.</i>
Similarly, a person who [deposits] an <i>eruv [t'chumin]</i> may make [any of the following] stipulations: "On this Sabbath, my <i>eruv</i> shall be in effect, but not on another Sabbath," or "On another Sabbath [my <i>eruv</i> shall be in effect],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The food deposited for the <i>eruv</i> must exist at <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> and be fit to eat. This is particularly important in the summer months, when it is possible that the <i>eruv</i> has become stale or has been eaten by vermin (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 416:9).</i> but not on this Sabbath."<br>[Similarly, he may stipulate that the <i>eruv</i> shall be in effect] on the Sabbaths but not on holidays, or on holidays and not on Sabbaths.
When a person tells five others, "I am establishing an <i>eruv</i> on behalf of one of you, whom I will choose [later]. If I choose, that person will be able to go. If I do not choose, he will not be able to go." Even if this person chooses [a companion] after nightfall, he may go. For the principle of <i>b'reirah</i> applies<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ordinarily, a person must establish his <i>eruv</i> before nightfall. Nevertheless, since he made a stipulation beforehand, we rely on the principle of <i>b'reirah</i>, and we say that retroactively it is considered to be as if he decided to rely on the <i>eruv</i> before nightfall (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>regarding a matter of Rabbinic law.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For other examples of the Rambam's rulings concerning this matter, see <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 5:20, <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:21, <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 7:1, and <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 4:15.</i><br>Similarly, a person may establish an <i>eruv</i> for all the Sabbaths of the year and stipulate, "If I desire [to rely on the <i>eruv</i>], I may go, and if I do not desire [to rely on it], I may not go - and I will be [governed by the same rules] as the other inhabitants of my city." He may go on whichever Sabbaths he desires, even if he does not make the decision to go until after nightfall.
[The following rule applies] when a person establishes an <i>eruv</i> for the two days of a holiday as observed in the diaspora or for a Sabbath and a holiday [that are celebrated consecutively]: Even when the person establishes a single <i>eruv</i> in one direction for both days, the <i>eruv</i> must be accessible<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>eruv</i> is not accessible - even if it is present in its designated location - it is not acceptable, as stated in Chapter 6, Halachot 8 and 12.</i> in its [designated] location on both the first and second nights throughout [the period of] <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>.<br>What should he do? He should take [the <i>eruv</i> to the desired place] on the eve of the Sabbath or on the eve of the holiday, and wait until nightfall. He may then take it in his hand and carry it away, if it is a holiday.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the removal of the <i>eruv</i> is merely a suggestion offered, lest a person leave the <i>eruv</i> in its place, and it be destroyed by vermin or the like. In a place where the <i>eruv</i> will surely be preserved, there is no point in removing it. Needless to say, on the Sabbath, when it is forbidden to carry, and it is forbidden to remove the <i>eruv</i>, this suggestion does not apply.<br>If one leaves the <i>eruv</i> in the designated place and there is a possibility that it will be destroyed, one is required to go to that place on the following day to check that it still exists (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 416:14).</i> On the following day, he should take it<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 416 asks: Since it is possible to establish the <i>eruv</i> by walking to the designated location (as stated in the following halachah), of what value is it that the person carried the food with him?

Were one to change either the location (or the food used for the <i>eruv</i>), one would have been considered as either preparing on the Sabbath for a holiday, or on a holiday for the Sabbath (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 416:2).</i> deposit it there until nightfall and eat it<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">There is no obligation to eat it. The Rambam's intent is merely that from this time onward, there is no obligation that the <i>eruv</i> remain intact (<i>Mishneh Berurah</i> 416:15).</i> if it is Friday night, or take it with him if it is the night of a holiday.<br>[This is necessary, for] they are two different expressions of holiness, and are not considered to be a single [extended] day with regard to which it would be possible to say on the first night that one established the <i>eruv</i> for both days.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statement implies that on Rosh HaShanah, it is necessary to establish an <i>eruv</i> only on the first night of the holiday. Even if the <i>eruv</i> is consumed before the beginning of the second day, it is acceptable, just as it would be acceptable for the entire Sabbath, even if it had been consumed after <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>.<br>The Ra'avad objects to this ruling. He maintains that the distinction of the two days of Rosh HaShanah as a single "extended" day applies only as a stringency, but not as a leniency. Therefore, the <i>eruv</i> established before the first night must remain in its place on the second night as well.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's view, bringing supports that indicate that our Sages' definition of these two days as "one long day" brings about a leniency as well as a stringency. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 416:11 follows the Rambam's ruling.</i>
[In the situation described in the previous halachah,] were the <i>eruv</i> to be eaten on the first day, it is effective for the first day, but the person [may not establish] an <i>eruv</i> [with food] for the second day.<br>If he established an <i>eruv</i> by walking [to the desired location] on the first day, he may establish an <i>eruv</i> for the second day only by walking to the same location<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">He may not establish the <i>eruv</i> by depositing food, for this would involve the performance of an activity on either the Sabbath or the holiday for the benefit of the other.

If he brought a different loaf, it would be considered to be preparing for the coming day (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
When Yom Kippur [would] fall on Friday or on Sunday during the era when the sanctification [of the moon] was dependent on its being sighted] by witnesses,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">According to the fixed calendar we follow at present, it is impossible for Yom Kippur to fall on either Sunday or Friday.

The statement made previously<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In Halachah 5.</i> that a person may establish two different <i>eruvin</i> in two directions for two days applies only when it is possible for the person to reach both of the <i>eruvin</i> on the first day [without departing from his Sabbath limits]. If, however, it is impossible on the first day for him to reach the <i>eruv</i> for the second day, the <i>eruv</i> for the second day is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Note the gloss of the <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> on Halachah 5, which discusses whether the law in this halachah applies only with regard to a holiday and a Sabbath that follow consecutively, or also with regard to the two days of a holiday that are observed in the diaspora. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 416:3 rules that the restrictions apply with regard to the two days observed in the diaspora as well.</i><br>[The rationale is that] the mitzvah of <i>eruv</i> [can be fulfilled only] with a meal that is fit to be eaten while it is still day. Since the person may not reach the <i>eruv</i> [intended for the second day] on the first day [because it is beyond his Sabbath limits], it is not considered to be a meal that is fit to be eaten while it is still day.
What is implied? If a person deposited an <i>eruv</i> two thousand cubits eastward of his home and relied on it for the first day [he is forbidden to walk westward at all].<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 6, Halachah 4.</i> [Therefore,] if he deposited an <i>eruv</i> one cubit, one hundred cubits, or one thousand cubits to the west and relied on it for the second day, the second <i>eruv</i> is invalid.<br>[The rationale is that] the second <i>eruv</i> is not fit for him on the first day, for he may not reach it, since he is not able to proceed toward the west at all.
If, however, he deposited his <i>eruv</i> one thousand five hundred cubits eastward of his home and relied on it for the first day, and deposited a second <i>eruv</i> within five hundred cubits to the west of his house and relied upon it for the second day, the <i>eruv</i> is valid. For it is possible for him to reach it on the first day.
When a holiday falls on a Friday, it is forbidden to establish an <i>eruv</i> [for the Sabbath] on the holiday: neither an <i>eruv chatzerot</i> nor an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For it is forbidden to prepare for the Sabbath on a holiday.

This leniency was granted only in the era when the establishment of the calendar was dependent on the testimony of witnesses, and the second day of a holiday was observed because of a doubt concerning the day on which the holiday should be celebrated. At present, there is no such doubt, and the second day is celebrated because of a Rabbinic decree requiring us to preserve the previous custom. (See <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 5:5.)<br>Other authorities (see the gloss of the Ra'avad on <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i>) take issue with the Rambam on this point; it is their view that is accepted as halachah in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 393:1).</i> He may not, however, do this with regard to an <i>eruv t'chumin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beitzah</i> 17a explains why a distinction is made between these two types of <i>eruvin</i>.

In contrast, the establishment of an <i>eruv chatzerot</i> negates one's ownership. Therefore, greater leniency is shown.</i>
What is implied? On Thursday, the person should make the following stipulation:<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 528), which states that a blessing should not be recited.</i> "If today is a holiday, my statements are of no consequence.
