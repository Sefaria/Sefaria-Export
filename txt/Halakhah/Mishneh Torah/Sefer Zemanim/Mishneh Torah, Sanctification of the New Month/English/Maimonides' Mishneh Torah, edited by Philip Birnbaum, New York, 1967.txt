Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the New Month



Chapter 1

The months of the year are lunar months — — and the years we reckon are solar years.— —
The solar year exceeds the lunar year by eleven days, approximately. Hence, whenever this excess accumulates to about thirty days, somewhat more or less, one month is added and the year is made up of thirteen months and is called leap year. The year cannot consist of twelve months plus several days, because it is written: "Months of the year" (Exodus 12:2), implying that the year should be reckoned by months and not by days.
The moon is invisible for about two days each month, or somewhat more or less: about one day at the end of the old month before it is close to the sun and about one day after its conjunction with the sun, when it reappears in the evening in the west. The night on which it becomes visible in the west after having disappeared is the beginning of the month. Twenty-nine days are counted from that day on. If the new moon appears on the night of the thirtieth day, then the thirtieth day is the first day of the new month. If it does not appear on that night, the thirtieth day belongs to the past month and the thirty-first day is the first day of the new month. We pay no attention as to whether or not the moon appeared on the night of the thirty-first day, because the lunar month never exceeds thirty days.
If the moon appears on the night of the thirtieth day, the past month has twenty-nine days and is called defective month. If the moon does not appear on the night of the thirtieth day, the past month has thirty days and is called intercalated month or full month.— —
The observation of the new moon is not entrusted to every individual, as in the case of the regular weekly Sabbath where anyone may count six days and rest on the seventh, but the authority is given to the court only, to sanctify and proclaim the day as the first of the month. The day proclaimed by the court is <i>Rosh Hodesh</i>, as it is written: "This month shall be to you" (Exodus 12:2), implying that the evidence in this matter is surrendered to <i>you</i> [members of the court].
Like astronomers who engage in calculation and know the positions and motions of the stars, the Jewish court calculates and investigates minutely so as to know if it is or is not possible for the new moon to be visible in its time, which is the night of the thirtieth day. If the members of the court found that it would be possible, they had to wait in the court house for the arrival of witnesses throughout the thirtieth day. If witnesses arrived and were duly examined and tested and found trustworthy, the thirtieth day was sanctified as the first day of the new month. If the new moon did not appear and no witnesses arrived, that day was counted as the thirtieth of the past month which became an intercalated month. If, however, the members of the court knew by calculation that the new moon could not possibly be seen, they were not required to sit and wait for the arrival of witnesses the thirtieth day. If witnesses did come to testify that they had seen the new moon, it was certain that they were false witnesses, or that a semblance of the new moon appeared to them through the clouds, and was not the real moon.

The new moon days and the leap years are computed and proclaimed only in Eretz Yisrael, as it is written: "Out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" (Isaiah 2:3). If, however, a great scholar was ordained in Eretz Yisrael and then emigrated to another country without leaving in Eretz Yisrael anyone equal to him in learning, he is permitted to compute and proclaim the new moon days and leap years outside the Land of Israel.— —

Chapter 2

Two trustworthy men only are qualified to testify concerning the new moon, men that are fit to bear witness in any legal case. Women and slaves, however, are not eligible to bear witness, and their testimony is not accepted.— —
According to the biblical law, the court is not required to be too strict in accepting evidence concerning the new moon. If the court sanctified the new moon on the evidence of two witnesses, who were found to have given false testimony, it remains sanctified. Originally, therefore, the court used to accept evidence concerning the new moon from any Jewish man, proceeding upon the assumption that each Israelite is qualified as a witness unless he is known to be disqualified. However, after the evil doings of the heretics, who tried to confuse the sages by hiring false witnesses to bear evidence that they had observed the new moon, though they had not seen it, the sages enacted that evidence concerning the new moon should not be admitted unless the witnesses were known to the court as trustworthy men, and that the witnesses should be thoroughly tested and examined.
For this reason, if the court does not know the men who saw the new moon, the people of the town should send along with the witnesses who saw the new moon other witnesses to certify them before the court, vouching for their being trustworthy men; only then is their evidence accepted.
The court employs methods of calculation similar to those used by astronomers, ascertaining whether the new moon of the forthcoming month will be seen to the north or to the south of the sun, whether it will be wide or narrow, and in which direction the tips of the horns will point. When the witnesses arrive to testify, the court examines them: Where did you see the new moon, to the north or to the south? In which direction did its horns point? How high was its altitude, in the estimate of your eyes, and how wide its latitude? If their evidence has been found to conform with the results of astronomical calculation, it is accepted; but if it has been found not to conform, it is rejected.

If the witnesses said: "We noticed the moon unintentionally, but failed to see it again when we looked and wanted to see it in order to bear witness," their testimony is not sufficient, and the court does not sanctify the new moon on the strength of it, owing to the suspicion that combined clouds produced the illusion of a moon and then disappeared.— —
The evidence concerning the new moon is accepted in this fashion: Anyone who is qualified to bear witness comes to the courthouse after seeing the new moon. Then the court assembles them all to one place; they are entertained generously with large meals, so that people may make it their habit to come. The first pair of witnesses to arrive are examined first, as we have described. The elder of the two witnesses is brought in and questioned. If his testimony is found to correspond to the data of calculation, the other one is called in. If both testimonies are found to be in agreement, their evidence is declared valid. The other pairs of witnesses are asked only a few main questions, not because their testimony is needed, but that they should not go away disappointed at not being asked, and that they may make it their habit to come.
Thereupon, when the evidence has been sustained, the chief justice of the court proclaims <i>Mekuddash!</i> [the new moon is sanctified], and after him all the people present respond: <i>Mekuddash! Mekuddash!</i> Only a court of three may carry out the calculation and the sanctification of the new moon. The formal sanctification of the new moon is proclaimed only when the new moon has been observed in its proper time; and this must be done at daytime. If it was done at night, the sanctification is not valid. — —

If the court sanctified the new moon erroneously, incorrectly or forcibly, the sanctification remains valid and everyone must fix the dates of the festivals in accordance with the day in which the members of the court sanctified the new moon. Even if someone knows that they have made a mistake, he must rely on their decision, because the authority in this matter rests only with them. He who has commanded us to observe the festivals has also commanded us to depend on them, as it is written: "The festivals … which you shall proclaim" (Leviticus 23:2).

Chapter 3


Witnesses who saw the new moon must go to the court to bear witness even if it happens to be a Sabbath, as it is written: "Which you shall proclaim, each in its proper season" (Leviticus 23:4); and wherever <i>proper season</i> is used in a biblical command, it supersedes the Sabbath. For this reason, they are allowed to break the Sabbath only when the new moon of <i>Nisan</i> and that of <i>Tishri</i> are concerned, to determine the time of the festivals. When the Temple was still in existence, the additional offering presented on <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> superseded the Sabbath, which was profaned on account of any <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> coinciding with it.





Originally, when the court sanctified the new moon, they used to light flares on the tops of the mountains, so that those who lived far away might know of it. But when the Samaritans began to cause trouble, by kindling misleading flares, it was enacted that messengers should go forth to inform the public.— —
Messengers were sent out to proclaim the beginning of six months: <i>Nisan</i>, on account of <i>Pesaḥ; Av</i>, on account of the fast of <i>Tish'ah b'Av; Elul</i>, because of <i>Rosh Hashanah;</i>— — <i>Tishri</i>, because of <i>Yom Kippur</i> and <i>Sukkoth; Kislev</i>, because of <i>Hanukkah; Adar</i>, because of <i>Purim</i>. When the Temple was still in existence, messengers would go forth to inform about the beginning of <i>Iyyar</i>, because of <i>Pesaḥ Sheni</i> [observed on the fourteenth of <i>Iyyar</i>].

Chapter 4

A leap year is a year to which an extra month is added. Only <i>Adar</i> is the month that is ever added, so that a leap year has two months of <i>Adar:</i> a first <i>Adar</i> and a second <i>Adar</i>. Why is just this month added? Because of the spring season, so that <i>Pesaḥ</i> should be observed during the barley season, as it is written: "Observe the month of <i>Aviv</i>, and keep the Passover…" (Deuteronomy 16:1), implying that this month of <i>Nisan</i> should occur during the spring. Without the addition of this month of <i>Adar</i>, Passover would occur sometimes in the summer and sometimes in the rainy season [of winter].







A year should be intercalated only by those who were invited to participate in the act of intercalation. How is this done? The chief justice of the Supreme Court should say to certain members of the Sanhedrin: "You are invited to come to such and such a place, that we may together calculate and find out whether this year should be intercalated or not." Only those invited may decide about the intercalation of the year.— —
If two of the five members of the council say that the year should be intercalated, and three say that it should not, the minority of two does not count. If three say that it should be intercalated, and two say that it should not, two members are added to the council from among those who have been invited, and they discuss the matter and decide with a panel of seven. If all seven of them unanimously decide to intercalate or not to intercalate, their decision is adhered to; but if they disagree, the opinion of the majority is followed.— —
A king or a high priest must not be placed as a member of the council on the intercalation of the year. A king is not eligible on account of his armies and far-flung campaigns, lest he may be inclined to intercalate or not to intercalate in their interests. A high priest is not eligible because he may be concerned about the cold weather; he may not be inclined to intercalate, so that the month of <i>Tishri</i> should not occur in the cold season, when he must take five baths of purification on <i>Yom Kippur</i>.
If the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who bears the title of <i>Nasi</i>, happens to be away on a distant trip, the year can be intercalated only on condition that the <i>Nasi</i> will consent. If he arrived and gave his consent, the intercalation remains valid; if he did not consent, the intercalation is invalid.— —

Chapter 5

All that we have said concerning the fixation of <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> on the basis of observing the new moon, and concerning intercalation of the year because of the season or because of some other necessity, is applicable only to the Sanhedrin in Eretz Yisrael or to the members of the court who were ordained in Eretz Yisrael, to whom the Sanhedrin gave permission to act. Moses and Aaron were told: "This month shall be to you the beginning of months" (Exodus 12:2), and the sages have derived from an oral tradition going back to our teacher Moses that the meaning of this verse is: This evidence shall rest with you and your successors. When, however, no Sanhedrin exists in Eretz Yisrael, the new-moon days and the leap years are determined only by such methods of calculation as we are employing today.

When did all Israel begin to use this method of calculation? During the last generation of the talmudic sages, when Eretz Yisrael was in ruins and no established court had survived there. In the times of [the Tannaim] the sages of the Mishnah, and also in the period of the talmudic sages prior to Abbayyé and Rava, the people relied on the courts of Eretz Yisrael for setting the calendar.
When the Sanhedrin still existed and the calendar was set by observation, the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, and the places that could be reached by the messengers of <i>Tishri</i> on time, observed each festival one day only; whereas those who lived in more distant places that could not be reached by the messengers of <i>Tishri</i> in time observed two days, because of doubt, since they failed to know which day had been proclaimed as <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> by the men of Eretz Yisrael.
At the present time, when no Sanhedrin and court of Eretz Yisrael are in existence, we set the calendar by calculation. It might be logical that the Jewish people everywhere, even those living in remote places of the Diaspora, should observe one day only [as holyday] just as the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael do, in view of the same calculation followed by all in determining the calendar. The sages, however, have made it a rule that the people must carefully follow the custom of their forefathers.
Accordingly, the localities which could not be reached on time by the messengers sent to announce <i>Rosh Hodesh Tishri</i> must observe two days even at present, just as they used to when the men of Eretz Yisrael determined the calendar on the basis of observation. But the residents of Eretz Yisrael at our time should continue to keep only one day, according to their [ancient] custom, for they never observed two days. Hence, it becomes evident that the second day of the festival that we observe in the Diaspora nowadays is something enacted by the sages.
When the fixing of the month was accomplished by the observation method, the majority of the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael observed <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> for two days, because they were in doubt as to which day had been declared as new-moon day, since the messengers could not go forth on a holyday [and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> coincides with the first day of the month].
Moreover, even in Jerusalem itself, which was the seat of the court, it frequently happened that <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> was observed for two days. If witnesses failed to arrive on the thirtieth day of <i>Elul</i>, the people were accustomed to celebrate it as <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, while waiting for witnesses to appear, observing the following day likewise as a holyday. Since they used to keep two days <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> even when the method of observation was in use, the sages ordained that even the citizens of Eretz Yisrael should keep it for two days always, at the present time when the calendar is determined by computation. You may thus infer that even the second day of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> is based on the authority of the sages.
The observance of one day of the other festivals does not depend upon the proximity of a location to Jerusalem. For example, a locality at a distance of five days' journey or less from Jerusalem could certainly have been reached by the messengers in time; yet it cannot be said that the residents of this place should observe only one day.— — Possibly no messengers were ever sent out to this place because there were no Jews there, and when the calendar began to be determined by computation the place was settled by Jews who were required to observe two days by their previous custom. Or else, no messengers ever came to this place because of insecurity in travel, as was the case between Judea and Galilee during the period of [the Tannaim] the sages of the Mishnah, or, because non-Jews, living along the road, would prevent the messengers from passing through the area.
If this matter of observing one day were to depend upon the proximity to Jerusalem, all the Jews of Egypt would observe only one day, since the messengers of <i>Tishri</i> could have reached them in time. The distance between Jerusalem and Egypt, by way of Ashkelon, is indeed only a matter of eight days' journey or less. The same applies to most places in Syria. Hence you may infer that the thing does not depend upon the proximity of a place.


When we nowadays compute, everyone in his own town, declaring such and such a date to be <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> or a festival, we do not rely upon our own calculation and determination, for it is not permissible to intercalate the years or to determine new-moon days outside of Eretz Yisrael; we may rely only on the computation and fixation performed by the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael. Our own computation is only for the purpose of making it known to the public; since we are aware that in Eretz Yisrael they use the same method of computation, we calculate in order to find out what day it is that has been determined by the residents of Eretz Yisrael.— —

Chapter 6

When the fixing of the new month used to be based upon the observation process, the sages calculated with great precision to ascertain the moment at which the conjunction of the moon with the sun occurred, according to the practice of the astronomers, so as to know whether the moon could appear on the night of the thirtieth day or not.— —
The day and the night consist of twenty-four hours: twelve for the day and twelve for the night. The hour is divided into one thousand and eighty parts. Why is the hour divided into this number of parts? Because this number may be divided by two, four, eight, three, six, nine, five, and ten, without a remainder; these denominators may again be divided into many other parts.
According to these figures, the interval between two conjunctions of moon and sun at their average motion is twenty-nine days and twelve hours of the thirtieth day, beginning with the night of that day, and seven hundred ninety-three parts of the thirteenth hour. That is the time between one <i>molad</i> [conjunction] and the other, and that is the duration of the lunar month.
The lunar year consists of twelve months of the length just defined, totaling three hundred fifty-four days, eight hours, and eight hundred seventy-six parts; but leap year, consisting of thirteen months, totals three hundred eighty-three days, twenty-one hours, and five hundred eighty-nine parts. The solar year consists of three hundred sixty-five days and six hours. Hence, the excess of the solar year over the lunar year totals ten days, twenty-one hours, two hundred and four parts.
If you subtract twenty-eight days from the lunar month, or four weeks consisting of seven days each, there will remain one day, twelve hours, and seven hundred ninety-three parts, symbolized by 1d 12h 793p. This is the remainder of the lunar month. Similarly, if you subtract the multiples of seven from the number of days of the lunar year, there will remain, in the case of an ordinary year, four days, eight hours, and eight hundred seventy-six parts, symbolized by 4d 8h 876p. This is the remainder of an ordinary lunar year. In the case of a leap year, the remainder is five days, twenty-one hours, and five hundred twenty-nine parts,, symbolized by 5d 21h 589p.
Hence, if you know the <i>molad</i> [the moment in which the new moon appears] of a given month, you can obtain the next <i>molad</i> by adding 1d 12h 793p, and you will know on which day of the week, in which hour, and in which fraction of the hour it will occur. For example: Suppose the <i>molad</i> of <i>Nisan</i> occurred in the daytime of a Sunday the fifth hour and one hundred seven parts of an hour, symbolized by 1d 5h 107p.
When you add to this the remainder of the lunar month, which is 1d 12h 793p, the <i>molad</i> of <i>Iyyar</i> will emerge, occurring at five hours and nine hundred parts on the night of Tuesday, symbolized by 3d 5h 900p. The same applies to month after month until the end of time.


Each group of nineteen years, consisting of seven leap years and twelve ordinary years, is called <i>maḥzor</i> (cycle).— —

Chapter 7

According to this computation, <i>Rosh Hodesh Tishri</i> (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>) cannot occur on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, symbolized by 1-4-6. If the <i>molad</i> of <i>Tishri</i> occurs on one of these three days, the following day is proclaimed as the first day of the month. Suppose, for example, that the <i>molad</i> occurs on Sunday, the first day of the month is postponed to Monday; if the <i>molad</i> occurs on Wednesday, it is postponed to Thursday; if it occurs on Friday, it is posponed to Saturday.
Similarly, if the <i>molad</i> of <i>Tishri</i> occurs at noon or later, the first day of the month is postponed to the following day. Thus, for example, if the <i>molad</i> occurs on Monday at noon or later, Tuesday is made to be the first day of the month. But if the <i>molad</i> occurs before noon, even though by one fraction of an hour, the very day of the <i>molad</i> is declared as the first day of the month, that is, if that day does not happen to be 1-4-6.

Chapter 8

The lunar month consists of twenty-nine days and a half plus seven hundred ninety-three parts of an hour, as we have already pointed out. But one cannot assume that the month should begin in the middle of the day, so that one part of the day would belong to the past month while the other part would belong to the next month. It is written: "A month of days" (Numbers 11:20), and the traditional interpretation of this verse has been that the month should be reckoned by days and not by hours.
For this reason, the lunar months are adjusted to an alternate succession of one defective and one full month. The defective month contains twenty-nine days only, although the lunar month is longer than that by [more than twelve] hours; and the full month contains thirty days, although the lunar month is several hours shorter. It is because we must count the month by full days and not by hours.
