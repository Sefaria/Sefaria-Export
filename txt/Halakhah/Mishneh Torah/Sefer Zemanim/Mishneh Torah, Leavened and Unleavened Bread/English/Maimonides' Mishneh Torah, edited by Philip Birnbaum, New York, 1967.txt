Mishneh Torah, Leavened and Unleavened Bread



Chapter 1



Chapter 2

The Torah commands us to put away the <i>ḥametz</i> before the time when it is forbidden to eat it, as it is written: "On the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses" (Exodus 12:15); according to the traditional interpretation, the <i>first day</i> in this verse refers to the fourteenth of <i>Nisan</i>. This is obvious from what is written in the Torah: "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven" (Exodus 34:25), which means: "You shall not slaughter the paschal lamb while leavened bread still exists"; the time for slaughtering the paschal lamb is the afternoon of the fourteenth day of <i>Nisan</i>.
What is meant by the biblical term <i>putting away</i>? It means that one should regard the <i>ḥametz</i> as nonexistent or as mere dust of the earth, impressing on his mind that he has no <i>ḥametz</i> in his possession and that all the <i>ḥametz</i> in his possession is equivalent to dust or something entirely useless.
By rabbinic enactment, one must search for <i>ḥametz</i> in hiding-places and holes, and remove it from his entire domain. Also, by rabbinic enactment, one should search and remove the <i>ḥametz</i> by lamplight at night, at the beginning of the night preceding the fourteenth day of <i>Nisan</i>, because all the people are then at home and lamplight is best for searching.— —

Chapter 4

It is written in the Torah: "No leavened bread shall be seen with you" (Exodus 13:7). One might suppose that a man commits no transgression if he hides the <i>ḥametz</i> or deposits it with a non-Jew; the Torah therefore says plainly: "No leaven shall be found in your houses" (Exodus 12:19), even if he has deposited or hidden it. Furthermore, one might suppose that a man transgresses only if the <i>ḥametz</i> is inside his house, but if it is far from his house, in the fields or in another town, he does not transgress the law; the Torah therefore says plainly: "In all your territory" (13:7), meaning: wherever you have control.— —





A Jew may say to a non-Jew: "Instead of buying <i>ḥametz</i> for one hundred <i>zuzim</i>, buy for two hundred; instead of buying it from a non-Jew, buy it from me; I may find it necessary to buy it back from you after Passover." However, one must not attach a condition to the act of selling or giving it to the non-Jew; if he does, he transgresses the law which prohibits <i>ḥametz</i> from being seen or found during Passover.
If one keeps food that contains an admixture of <i>ḥametz</i> during Passover, he transgresses the prohibition against its being seen or found.— — However, if the thing containing an admixture of <i>ḥametz</i> is not edible, it is permissible to retain it during Passover.

Chapter 5



Chapter 6

The Torah commands us to eat <i>matzah</i> on the night preceding the fifteenth day of <i>Nisan</i>, as it is written: "In the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread" (Exodus 12:18), everywhere and throughout time.— — By eating a piece of <i>matzah</i> the size of an olive [on the night of the fifteenth] one fulfills his duty.








All are required to eat <i>matzah</i> on the first night of Passover; this includes women and slaves. A child able to eat bread should be fed a piece of <i>matzah</i> the size of an olive [at least] in order to train him in the performance of religious duties.— —
By rabbinic enactment, nothing may be eaten after the conclusion of the <i>Seder</i> meal, not even parched grain, nuts or the like. Even though one has eaten <i>matzah</i> first, and then some other food, fruits and the like, he should conclude the <i>Seder</i> meal by eating a piece of <i>matzah</i> the size of an olive and stop.
The sages have forbidden the eating of <i>matzah</i> on the day preceding <i>Pesaḥ</i>, in order to make it conspicuous at night.— — The ancient sages used to go hungry on the day preceding <i>Pesaḥ</i>, so that they might eat the <i>matzah</i> with appetite.— —

Chapter 7

According to a biblical positive command, we must tell on the night preceding the fifteenth day of <i>Nisan</i> all about the miracles and wonders that were performed for our forefathers in Egypt.— — Even great scholars are required to tell about the exodus from Egypt. Anyone who relates at length about the events that occurred deserves praise.
It is one's duty to inform the children even if they ask no questions, as it is written: "You shall tell your son" (Exodus 13:8). The father should instruct his son according to the child's understanding. For example, he should say to one small or foolish: "My son, all of us were slaves in Egypt, like this maidservant or like this manservant, and on this night God redeemed and liberated us." If the son is grown up and intelligent, he should inform him about everything that happened to us in Egypt, and about the miracles that were wrought for us by our teacher Moses; all in accordance with the son's understanding.
On the first night of <i>Pesaḥ</i>, one should introduce some change at the table, so that the children who will notice it may ask, saying: "Why is this night different from all other nights?" And he in turn will reply: "This is what happened." In what manner, for example, should he introduce a change? He may distribute parched grain or nuts to the children; remove the table from its usual place; snatch the unleavened bread from hand to hand, and so on. If he has no son, his wife should ask the questions; if he has no wife, they should ask one another: "Why is this night different?"—even if they are all scholars. If one is alone, he should ask himself: "Why is this night different?"
