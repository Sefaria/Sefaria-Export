Mishneh Torah, Leavened and Unleavened Bread



Chapter 1

Anyone who intentionally eats an olive's size<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Whenever the Torah uses the verb אכל (eat) in the context of a mitzvah or a prohibition, it refers to the consumption of at least a minimum amount, established by <i>Eruvin</i> 4b as the size of an olive.<br>It must be emphasized that the measure of a כזית (an olive's size) cannot be determined by measuring an average olive today. Rather, it is dependent on the measure established by the Sages and this is the subject of debate by the Rabbinic authorities. The <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) explains that the Rambam considers an olive as one third the size of an egg (כביצה, a more familiar Talmudic measure). In terms of modern measurements, this olive size would be between 16.6 and 24 grams, according to various Halachic opinions.<br><i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Chullin</i> 103a) differs, and defines a כזית(the size of an olive) as one half the size of an egg (between 25.6 and 36 grams according to the various opinions). With regard to the practical application of the law (<i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) advises that in all questions of Torah law, <i>Tosefot's</i> opinion should be followed. However, in questions of Rabbinic law, the more lenient opinion can be relied upon.</i> [כזית, or more]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Eating less than this amount of chametz is also forbidden by Torah law. However, there is no punishment for its consumption, nor need a sacrifice be brought as atonement (See Halachah 7).</i> of chametz<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">any mixture made from grain or grain products that has come into contact with water and was allowed to become leavened. The following (and only the following) five species are referred to as grain: wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt.</i> on Pesach from the beginning of the night of the fifteenth [of Nisan] until the conclusion of the day of the twenty-first [of Nisan]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In the mitzvot mentioned above, the Rambam also mentions the prohibition against eating chametz from noon on the fourteenth of Nisan. However, the violation of that prohibition is not punishable by כרת.</i> is liable for כרת,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition against eating chametz on Pesach is counted as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, negative commandment 197; <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, mitzvah 19.</i> as [Exodus 12:15] states: "Whoever eats leaven... will have his soul cut off."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Moed Kattan</i> 28a relates that a person who violated a sin punishable by כרת would die before reaching the age of fifty.<br>In his commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 9:6, the Rambam emphasizes that premature death does not represent the totality of the retribution these individuals will receive. In addition, "their souls will be cut off."<br>In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1, the Rambam elaborates on the latter dimension:<br>The good that is hidden for the righteous is the life of the world to come... The retribution of the wicked is that they will not merit this life. Rather, they will be cut off and die.<br>This is the intent of the meaning of the term כרת in the Torah, as [Numbers 15:31] states: "That soul shall surely be cut off."</i><br>[Should one eat this amount of chametz] unintentionally,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">בשוגג</i> one is liable to bring a fixed sin offering<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam adds the word "fixed" to indicate that he is referring to the standard sin offering described in Leviticus 4:27-35, in contrast to the offering to atone for certain sins mentioned in Leviticus, Chapter 5. (See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:3.) The latter offering is not "fixed," but rather is adjustable according to the financial state of the person liable.</i> [as atonement].<br>[The above applies] equally to one who eats chametz and one who converts it into a liquid and drinks it.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Though the Torah specifically mentions "eating," Chullin 120a equates drinking a liquid made from chametz and water with the former act. In his responsum (Vol. V, 1517), the Radbaz differentiates between mixing chametz with water (the instance in question here) and mixing chametz with other substances, as mentioned in Halachah 6. The punishment of כרת applies only when nothing else but chametz and water is contained in the mixture.</i>
On Pesach, it is forbidden to derive any benefit from chametz,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">for example, to sell it or use it for purposes other than eating.</i> as [Exodus 13:3] states: "Do not eat (לא יאכל) chametz"; i.e., it is not permitted [to be used to derive benefit that leads to]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed additions are based on Rashi's commentary on Pesachim 21b.</i> eating.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are somewhat problematic. <i>Pesachim</i> 21b records the following disagreement between the Sages:<br>Chizkiyah states: What is the source from which we learn that it is forbidden to derive benefit from chametz? [Exodus 13:3] states: "Do not eat (לא יאכל) chametz"; i.e., it is not permitted [to be used to derive benefit that leads to] eating.<br>His decision is based on the fact that the Torah uses the expression לא יאכל. Had the Torah not written יאכל לא, we may presume that a prohibition against eating would be implied, but not a prohibition against deriving benefit.<br>This contradicts the opinion of R. Abahu who states: Wherever the Torah states לא תאכל, לא יאכלor לא תאכלו, a prohibition against eating and deriving benefit is implied.<br>The Rambam's statements in this Halachah quote the opinion of Chizkiyah. However, in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 8:15, he quotes the opinion of R. Abahu as accepted halachah.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves the contradiction, explaining that in the halachah at hand, there is no difference in law between Chizkiyah and R. Abahu. Therefore, although the Rambam generally accepts R. Abahu's opinion, in this instance he quotes Chizkiyah's statements because the manner in which the latter derives the concept is more explicit.</i><br>A person who leaves chametz within his property on Pesach,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in Halachah 9, once chametz becomes forbidden on noon of the fourteenth of Nisan, we may not derive any benefit from it.</i> even though he does not eat it, transgresses two prohibitions: [Exodus 13:7] states: "No leavening agent may be seen in all your territory"<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This prohibition is counted as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah: <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, negative commandment 200; <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, mitzvah 20.</i> and [Exodus 12:19] states: "No leavening agent may be found in your homes."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This prohibition is counted as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah: <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, negative commandment 201; <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, mitzvah 11.</i><br>[Though the prohibitions stated in these verses apply to שאור,]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>S'or</i> refers to leavening agents, notably yeast.</i> it is the same prohibition which forbids both חמץ (leaven) and שאור (a leavening agent).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beitzah</i> 7a explains that Exodus 13:7 mentions both chametz (leaven), and שעור (<i>S'or</i>, a leavening agent) in the same verse to emphasize that they are identical.<br>The Ra'avad comments that the equation between the prohibitions against chametz and <i>S'or</i> is not complete. Among the differences between them are: Once chametz is no longer fit to be eaten by a dog, it is no longer prohibited. In contrast, yeast is never fit to be eaten and is prohibited even in that state. Nevertheless, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> do not accept his statements.</i>
[A violator] is not lashed<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">this is the punishment given for the active violation of any of the Torah's prohibitions that are not punishable by death.</i> for [transgressing the prohibitions] not to have [chametz] seen [in his possession] and not to have [chametz] found [in his possession] unless he purchased chametz on Pesach<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> emphasizes that this law applies only to chametz purchased from a gentile. However, once chametz belonging to a Jew becomes prohibited, that Jew no longer has the authority to sell it. Thus, the purchaser will never really become the legal owner of the chametz (See Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 35a; <i>Tosefot, Chullin</i> 4b).<br>The <i>Or Sameach</i> questions how a person can become liable even for chametz purchased from a gentile, but resolves the issue based on the commentary of Rabbenu Nissim (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, Chapter 3).</i> or [caused flour] to become leavened, and thus committed a deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> raises a significant question: A person is not liable for lashes for violating any prohibition which he can correct by fulfilling a positive commandment (לעשה לאו הניתק): For example, if a person violates the prohibition against taking both a mother bird and her eggs, he can free himself from the punishment of lashes by sending away the mother bird.<br><i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 29b) states that the prohibition against chametz being seen in one's property falls into the above category, because one can correct the violation of this prohibition by fulfilling the positive commandment to destroy chametz. Thus, it appears that a person can never be held liable for lashes for this transgression.<br>Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that of Rav Chayim Soloveitchik, who explains that <i>Tosefot's</i> statements apply only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who maintains that chametz must be destroyed by burning. However, according to the Sages (whose opinion is accepted by the Rambam, Halachah 3:11), who maintain that chametz can be destroyed by any means, not necessarily burning, the prohibition against possessing chametz is not considered a לאו הניתק לעשה.<br>What is the essential difference between these opinions: Rabbi Yehudah maintains that the fundamental aspect of the mitzvah to destroy chametz revolves upon the article itself (חפצה); it is a mitzvah to destroy chametz. In contrast, the Sages maintain that the mitzvah centers on the person (גברה); he is commanded to remove all chametz from his possession.<br>According to Rabbi Yehudah, since the commandment revolves around the chametz itself, its destruction directly "corrects" the sin of its possession. In contrast, according to the Sages, the positive commandment of ridding one's house of chametz is merely a reinforcement of the prohibition against its possession, and the fulfillment of the positive commandment does not have the power to "correct" the violation of the prohibition.</i><br>However, if he possessed chametz before Pesach, and when Pesach came he did not destroy it and left it in his possession,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">However, should he remove it from his possession (by giving it to another person or declaring it ownerless), he is not liable even if he does not actually destroy the object.</i> even though he transgresses two prohibitions, according to the Torah, he is not lashed, for he did not perform a deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sh'vuot</i> 21b states: "The transgression of any prohibition which does not involve a deed is not punishable by lashing."</i> [Nevertheless,] he is given "stripes for being rebellious."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">"Stripes for being rebellious (מכות מרדות)" is a punishment instituted by the Sages for violation of a Rabbinic prohibition. A person liable for lashing according to Torah law receives a uniform number of 39 lashes unless he is physically incapable of bearing that number. In contrast, the number of lashes given to a person liable for "stripes for being rebellious" is left to the discretion of the court.<br><i>Chullin</i> 14b states that this punishment is also inflicted upon those who violate a Torah prohibition that is not punishable by lashing.</i>
It is prohibited to ever benefit from chametz<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">itself, in contrast to mixtures of chametz, as explained in Halachah 5.</i> [that a Jew]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">in contrast to a gentile (<i>Pesachim</i> 28a).</i> possessed during Pesach.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This prohibition applies to all Jews, not only to the owner of the chametz (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Pesachim</i> 28). Thus, it is prohibited to buy chametz from a store owned by a Jew who did not observe the prohibition against possessing chametz on Pesach.</i> This prohibition is a penalty instituted by the Sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 29a mentions Rabbi Yehudah's opinion that the prohibition stems from the Torah itself. However, this opinion is not accepted as halachah.<br>The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> explains that the debate between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon (who maintains that the Torah does not forbid benefiting from chametz after Pesach) revolves around an abstract concept. Rabbi Yehudah maintains that once Pesach comes, chametz itself becomes forbidden and, therefore, can never become permitted again. In contrast, Rabbi Shimon maintains that the prohibition does not affect the essence of the chametz itself. Thus, we are forbidden to benefit from it during Pesach, but after Pesach there is no prohibition.</i> Since the person transgressed [the prohibitions against chametz] being found and being seen [in his possession], they prohibited its use.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the prohibition against using a Jew's chametz after Pesach applies even when the prohibitions against possessing chametz are not violated. See Halachah 4:5.</i><br>[The above applies] even if he inadvertently left [the chametz in his possession during Pesach]<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., he forgot that he possessed it.</i> or was forced to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Nodah BiYhudah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 20) gives an example of such a case. A thief stole chametz from a person before Pesach and returned it to him after the holiday. Even though the person had no opportunity to destroy it before Pesach, it is forbidden.<br>In that responsum, the <i>Nodah BiYhudah</i> also raises the following question: A person died on the fourteenth of Nisan without nullifying or selling his chametz. Are his heirs forbidden to benefit from that chametz or not? He maintains that although the Rambam would probably prohibit benefiting from this chametz, there are rationales on the basis of which its use may be permitted. [Other authorities (note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Kuntres Acharon</i> 435) do not accept this conclusion.]</i> [These stringencies were instituted] lest a person<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">intentionally</i> leave chametz in his possession during Pesach in order to benefit from it after Pesach.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">on the pretense that he had forgotten about its existence.</i>
If, on Pesach,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> maintain that this principle does not apply until the holiday itself actually begins. Thus, even if chametz became mixed with other substances on the fourteenth of Nisan, after the time chametz is forbidden, the mixture is bound by the laws regarding the nullification of forbidden objects (ביטול איסורים) that apply throughout the entire year.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that a simple interpretation of the Rambam's statements leads to the conclusion that he accepts this opinion. Though others, among them the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, do not accept this view, it is accepted as Halachah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 447:2).</i> even the slightest amount of chametz becomes mixed together with another substance,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ordinarily, it is permissible to use a mixture of a prohibited substance and a permitted substance provided that the permitted substance is present in a greater amount, to the extent that the prohibition is nullified (ביטול איסור).</i> either of its kind<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">When the prohibited substance is of the same kind as the forbidden substance (e.g., improperly slaughtered meat mixed with properly slaughtered meat), all that is required to nullify the prohibition is that the permitted substance constitutes the majority of the mixture (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:1).</i> or not of its kind,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When the prohibited substance is of a different kind from the permitted (e.g., forbidden fats mixed with grain), the prohibition is ordinarily nullified if the taste of the forbidden article is not discernible, or the quantity of the permitted substance is at least 60 times as great as the forbidden article (ibid. 15:1, 6).</i> [the entire mixture] is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The above principles do not apply with regard to chametz on Pesach. Even the slightest mixture of chametz may not be eaten, nor may benefit be derived from it. In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> (15:9), the Rambam explains that this stringency is instituted because chametz is a דבר שיש לו מתירין (a substance which later will become permitted).<br>A דבר שיש לו מתירין which becomes mixed together with a permitted substance of its own kind is never permitted to be used because of the following rationale: Since its use in its entirety will later become permitted, there is no need to grant a leniency allowing it to be eaten when forbidden.<br>Similarly, with regard to chametz on Pesach: There is no prohibition against using a mixture of chametz after Pesach. Hence, there is no need to grant permission to eat such a mixture on Pesach itself, even though the quantity of the permitted substance far surpasses that of the chametz.<br>Furthermore, there is a stricter dimension to chametz than to any other דבר שיש לו מתירין. Generally, a דבר שיש לו מתירין is permitted if it becomes mixed with a substance of another kind to the extent that its taste can no longer be discerned. However, this leniency is not granted regarding mixtures of chametz. Since Exodus 12:20 states: "You must not eat any leaven," the severity of the prohibition obligates additional stringency.</i><br>Though it is forbidden to benefit from chametz which a Jew possessed on Pesach, if it became mixed with another substance, whether of its kind<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">for example, a dough containing yeast mixed with flour.</i> or not of its kind,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">for example, a mixture of flour with any other substance.</i> it is permitted to be eaten after Pesach.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> explains that this leniency applies whether the mixture occurred after Pesach or on the holiday itself. Nevertheless, the latter point should not be misinterpreted. Should such a mixture be discovered on Pesach, we are obligated to destroy it (<i>Ramah, Orach Chayim</i> 447:1). Nevertheless, if either intentionally or unintentionally, the mixture was not destroyed on the holiday itself, it may be used afterwards.</i> [The Sages] only penalized and forbade [the use of] chametz itself. A mixture [containing chametz possessed on Pesach] is permitted to be eaten after Pesach.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 30a explains that since the penalty is of Rabbinic origin, it was applied only to chametz itself and not to mixtures.</i>
One is liable for כרת<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">as stated in Halachah 1</i> only for eating chametz itself. However, a person who eats a mixture containing chametz—for example, Babylonian <i>kotach</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">a mixture including sour milk, moldy bread crusts, and mineral salts (<i>Pesachim</i> 42a).</i> Median beer,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">beer made of fermented barley, as our beer.

The Ramban (<i>Hasagot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>) does not accept the Rambam's view, and explains that a person who consumes an olive size of chametz within the specific time period (פרס כדי אכילת) described below should be liable for כרת as described in Halachah 1. See also Halachah 4:8 and commentary.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> supports the Ramban's view, noting that in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:3, the Rambam himself explains that any person who eats a mixture containing an olive size of a forbidden food within this time period is liable, just as if he had eaten the forbidden food itself.<br>Based on the explanation of the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442), the <i>Drisha</i> and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> interpret the Rambam as referring to a mixture to which the chametz does not impart any flavor and is added only for consistency and color.<br>The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> offers a different interpretation, explaining that were chametz to be mixed with other foods, a person eating the mixture would be liable for כרת as the Ramban states. However, the Rambam is talking about an instance when flour was mixed with another substance and became leavened as part of the mixture, without ever becoming a distinct entity of its own. The Torah considers this as a different category of chametz and holds a person who eats it liable for a lesser punishment.</i> does the above apply? When the person consumed an olive size<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">the minimum size of a prohibited substance for which one is liable for punishment, as explained in Halachah 1.</i> of chametz [while eating] from the mixture within the time it takes to eat three eggs or less.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This period (כדי אכילת פרס in Hebrew) is significant in halachah. Just as the Torah requires a specific quantity, the size of an olive, as regards many of the mitzvot and prohibitions concerning eating, it also specifies a limited period in which this amount of food must be consumed: אבילת פרס כדי.<br>This measure is also a point of Rabbinic controversy. The Rambam defines it as the time it takes to eat three eggs (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 14:8). Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 44a) takes a more lenient view, defining it as the amount of time it takes to eat four eggs. As regards this matter as well, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 612:4) advises that whenever a question of Torah law is involved, the more stringent opinion should be observed. However, in questions of Rabbinic law, the more lenient view can be relied on.<br>In converting this figure to modern measures of time, there is also a difference of opinion. The shortest opinion limits this period to two minutes. The most commonly accepted view is four minutes and there are opinions of seven and eight minutes as well.</i> Then, he is obligated for lashes by the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">as explained above.</i> However, if he does not consume an olive size of chametz from the mixture in less time than it takes to eat three eggs, even though such eating is forbidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">for as explained in the previous halachah, chametz can never be nullified within a mixture.

In contrast, חצי שיעור of chametz is forbidden even when mixed with other substances, as explained in the previous halachah. He explains that since deriving benefit from chametz is forbidden according to Torah law, that prohibition also includes eating חצי שיעור in any form.</i> Nevertheless, [a person who eats chametz] is not liable for כרת, nor must he bring a sacrifice for anything less than the specified measure, which is the size of an olive.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, [a person who eats chametz] is not liable for<br>כרת</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">as stated in Halachah 1.</i><br> A person who intentionally violates the prohibition and eats less than an olive size of chametz<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions why the Rambam begins the halachah by describing the prohibition against "even the slightest amount" of chametz, and concludes with the expression "less than the size of an olive."</i> is given "stripes for being rebellious."<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 8:16 states that anyone who benefits from forbidden substances receives "stripes for being rebellious."

It is forbidden to eat chametz on the day of the fourteenth [of Nisan] from noon onward—i.e.,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 199) and the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 485) count this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

However, in particular, the term needs elaboration: According to Torah law, a day begins at dawn (עלות השחר), the appearance of the first rays of sun, and ends when three stars appear (םיבכוכה תאצ, Berachot 2b). This period is divided into 12 and the resulting figure is referred to as one seasonal hour (שעה זמנית). [Other opinions consider the period to be divided into twelve as beginning at the appearance of the sun, נץ החמה, and ending at sunset.]<br>Thus, if dawn were at 5:09 AM and three stars appeared at 6:45 PM, each seasonal hour would be an hour and eight minutes, and the beginning of the seventh hour would be 11:57 AM.</i> Any person who eats chametz<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam explicitly states that lashes are never given for violating prohibitions against benefiting from forbidden articles (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 8:16).

Chapter 2

It is a positive commandment from the Torah to destroy chametz before the time it becomes forbidden to be eaten, as<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam describes the more practical aspects of the nullification of chametz in Chapter 3, Halachot 7-10. There, he requires a person to make a formal statement nullifying his chametz. That declaration is a Rabbinic requirement. According to the Torah itself, a firm resolve is sufficient, and no statement is necessary (<i>Binyan Shlomo</i>).</i> [Exodus 12:15] states: "On the first day, destroy leaven from your homes." On the basis of the oral tradition, it is derived that "the first day" refers to the day of the fourteenth.<br>Proof of this matter is the verse from the Torah [Exodus 34:25]: "Do not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice with chametz," i.e., Do not slaughter the Pesach sacrifice while chametz exists [in your possession]. The slaughter of the Pesach sacrifice was on the fourteenth after midday.

A person may possibly have difficulty totally removing all thoughts of ownership over the chametz from his heart (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Pesachim</i> 2a).<br>b) In contrast to other prohibited substances, chametz is used throughout the year. Thus, were he allowed to leave chametz within his property, he might accidentally forget about the prohibition and eat it on Pesach (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 2a).<br>In addition to the restriction against possessing chametz, the Sages further expanded the scope of</i> [the mitzvah<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">to destroy chametz so that it</i> involves] searching for chametz<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It must be emphasized that the obligation to search for chametz is Rabbinic in nature only when a person nullifies his chametz when required.

There is no need to suspect that perhaps a rodent took chametz from a place where chametz is usually kept to a place where it is not usually brought. The Kessef Mishneh emphasizes that the two interpretations are not contradictory and both are halachically applicable.</i> Were we to suspect [that chametz would be taken] from house to house, we would also have to suspect [that chametz might be taken] from city to city.

Nevertheless, a new search is required, for it is also possible that some chametz was left within the house (<i>Pesachim</i> 9a).<br>As mentioned in Halachot 2 and 3, according to Torah law we need not do anything more than negate our ownership over our chametz. Nevertheless, the Sages also required that we search for chametz and destroy it completely. However, when a person does not nullify his chametz, the obligation to search takes on the severity of a Torah commandment.<br>This and the following halachot (8 through 13) deal with circumstances which raise questions whether a second search is required. Throughout these halachot, the Rambam makes no mention of whether the owner of the house previously nullified his chametz or not. This fact is extremely important, for different principles apply to an obligation required by Torah law from those that apply to one instituted by the Rabbis. Indeed, other Rabbinic authorities (some of whom are quoted in the commentaries to the various halachot) devote much attention to this issue, clarifying at length whether the laws apply:a) only when a person had already nullified (or can still nullify) his chametz, or;<br>b) even when the search for chametz is required by Torah law.Since the Rambam does not explicitly state his opinion on this matter, it is impossible to be sure which perspective he adopts. However, when the chapter is considered in its entirety, it appears that these halachot describe a situation where chametz has already been nullified. Unless specified to the contrary, this should be assumed to be the case. Nevertheless, certain of the leniencies are also applicable even when the search takes on the severity of a Torah obligation.</i>

In such instances, the fact that there is a much higher probability that the article in question was taken from the permitted substances is not considered significant, and the more stringent perspective is taken. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 8:11.<br>Nevertheless, the Ra'avad and other authorities take issue with this halachah, explaining that the Talmud only made such a statement when a person has not nullified his chametz, and the responsibility to search the house stems from the Torah itself.

There were two piles: one of chametz and one of matzah, and two houses: one that had been searched and one that had not been searched.

There, he explains that the mitzvah is to destroy chametz "from" and not "on" the fourteenth of Nisan.<br>[It must be noted that the adoption of such a position represents a change of mind for the Rambam.

Thus, a person who does not nullify [his chametz] before the sixth hour<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad questions the phraseology used by the Rambam, noting that the prohibitions against owning chametz do not begin until the evening.

Many explain that since three Torah mitzvot (the two prohibitions against possessing chametz and the positive commandment to destroy chametz) are involved, their observance overrides the prohibitions of <i>muktzeh</i>. Others maintain that even if the prohibition against <i>muktzeh</i> must be observed, the chametz can be destroyed by burning it in the place where it is located.<br>Nevertheless, in practice, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 446:2), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> do not accept the latter view, and advise waiting to destroy the chametz until after the holiday. They explain that a person is allowed to light a fire on a festival only if doing so increases his festive joy. Hence, they prohibit burning the chametz in that manner. However, they mention that, if it is possible, a gentile may be asked to destroy the chametz.

Chapter 4

The Torah (Exodus 13:7) states: "No chametz shall be seen for you." Perhaps, if it were buried<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">because the chametz is not "seen."</i> or entrusted to a gentile,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">because ostensibly, the leaven is not "for you."</i> he would not transgress the commandment? The Torah (Exodus 12:19) states: "leaven should not be found in your homes," [implying] even if it is buried or entrusted.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">it is still "found in your homes." The place in which a watchman keeps an entrusted article is also considered "your homes."<br>The prohibition against entrusting chametz to a gentile is not explicitly stated in the Talmud. It can be derived from the leniency allowing one to maintain possession of chametz belonging to a gentile mentioned at the conclusion of the Halachah. Some authorities explain that the Rambam derived the concept from the <i>Mechiltah</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.<br>In his commentary on the Torah (Exodus 12:19), the Ramban differs with the concept in its entirety and states that a person does not transgress the prohibition against possessing chametz when it is entrusted to a gentile. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:4) accepts the Rambam's opinion. No later halachic authorities question the matter.</i><br>Perhaps<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">if the latter verse were taken as the source of the prohibition</i> he would only transgress [the commandment] when chametz is [found] in his house,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">as that verse states</i> but if it were outside his house, in a field or in another city, he would not violate [the commandment]?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore,</i> The Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">includes the verse originally mentioned which</i> states (Exodus 13:7): "[No leaven shall be seen for you] in all your territory"<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., in all your possessions -- in the totality of a person's domain.</i> - i.e., in all your possessions.<br>Perhaps a person will be obligated to remove from his property chametz that belongs to a gentile or that was consecrated?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">for that is also "seen." Therefore,</i> The Torah states (ibid.): "No [leaven] shall be seen for you."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">From the addition of the latter phrase</i> [We may infer]: You may not see your own [leaven]. However, you may see [leaven] belonging to others<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">for that is not "for you."

[From the above,] you can learn that chametz belonging to a Jew which was left in his possession, even though it is buried, is located in another city, or is entrusted to a gentile, causes him to violate [the commandments]: "[leaven] shall not be seen" and "[leaven] shall not be<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">for in each of these instances, chametz was present within a Jew's possession on Pesach.</i> found."<br>Chametz that either was consecrated or belongs to a gentile, and is located within a Jew's property, even if it was with him at<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As evident from the following halachah, this law applies only when the Jew does not accept responsibility for the chametz.</i> home—behold, this is permitted, for [the chametz] is not his.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">the Jew's,</i> Even if it belonged to a resident alien<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 8:10 and <i>Hilchot Avodah Zarah</i> 10:6 define this term as referring to a gentile who keeps the seven universal laws given to Noah's descendants.

Two explanations are offered why, in the present instance, a more stringent measure is required:<br>a) the amount of chametz the gentile entrusted for safekeeping is probably too large to be covered by utensils;<br>b) covering the chametz with a utensil is only a temporary measure, intended to be effective only until the end of the day of the festival. Once that day is concluded, the chametz must be destroyed. In contrast, in this instance the chametz will remain in the Jew's possession throughout the entire holiday. Hence, more severe measures must be taken.<br>The Ramban and the <i>Ba'al HaItur</i> do not accept this requirement and maintain that if a Jew does not accept responsibility for the chametz, he is not obligated to construct a partition. All that is necessary is that the chametz be placed out of the way. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:2) and the later halachic authorities all follow the Rambam's opinion.</i> [With regard to chametz] that has been consecrated, this is unnecessary; everyone shies away from consecrated property, lest they infringe on [the prohibition of] מעילה.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:15-16 describes the prohibition of מעילה, the misappropriation of consecrated property for personal use.</i>

Rashi and Rabbenu Asher obligate a Jew to destroy any chametz belonging to a gentile for which he has accepted responsibility, even if his responsibility is less than that specified above. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:13,16) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> advise following the latter opinion.</i> stolen—behold, he is obligated to destroy it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">before the sixth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan.</i> Since he accepted responsibility for it,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">and would have to pay for it if it is lost.<br><i>Pesachim</i> 5b offer two possible explanations why the chametz is considered as if it belongs to the Jew.

From this discussion, we see that the responsibility to destroy this chametz stems from the Torah itself, and is not merely a matter of Rabbinic decree.</i> it is considered as though it were his.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">and, hence, must be destroyed. <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 6a maintains that if a Jew designates a specific place within his home for the gentile and tells him to place his chametz there, he is not obligated to destroy it even though he accepted responsibility for it. Rashi does not accept this position. From the Rambam's omission of the matter, we may assume he also follows Rashi's view (<i>Lechem Mishnah</i>).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:1) quotes the Rambam and hence, requires the acceptance of the more stringent position. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (440:16) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (440:3) mention certain leniencies based on <i>Tosefot's</i> position.</i><br>If he did not accept responsibility for it,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">the gentile's chametz</i> he may keep it in his domain<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">without transgressing the prohibitions against possessing chametz</i> and may eat from it after Pesach,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">in contrast to chametz possessed by a Jew during Pesach which is forbidden to be used (Halachah 1:4)</i> for it was in the gentile's possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 6a mentions a situation where a gentile brings chametz that he wishes to entrust to a Jew, and the latter designates a particular portion of the house for him to put the chametz. Under such circumstances, there is no need to destroy the chametz.<br>There are some authorities who explain that the Talmud is speaking about a situation in which the Jew accepted responsibility for the chametz. Nevertheless, since he told the gentile to put it in one specific place, it is considered as if that place belongs to the gentile, and thus the chametz is not found in the Jew's possession.<br>The Rambam does not accept this interpretation and requires the gentile's chametz to be destroyed whenever a Jew accepts responsibility for it. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> mention the more lenient opinion, they require that the more stringent approach be followed.</i>

Nevertheless, this differentiation is not accepted by most halachic authorities.</i>
A Jew who gives his chametz to a gentile<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">before Pesach, transferring it into the latter's domain</i> as security<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Aruch</i> relates that the word רהן means security in Arabic.</i> for a loan and tells him: "If I do not bring the money between today and such and such a date, you acquire the chametz [retroactively] from the present moment,"<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This specific statement is required, because although a Jewish lender is considered to have acquired a certain degree of ownership over an article given him as security, this principle does not apply with regard to a gentile (<i>Pesachim</i> 31b, <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> the chametz is considered as<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">payment for the loan.

The Rambam maintains that since the Jew has the right to redeem his chametz during Pesach, it is still considered his (Rabbenu Ephraim). In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 441:1) accepts the Ra'avad's view.<br>Nevertheless, this leniency applies only when the Jew willingly foregoes any right to the chametz and considers to have repaid his loan with it.

The Ra'avad maintains that, generally, the fact that a borrower does not specify that the security would retroactively become the lender's property implies that he never really intended to sell it to him and always considers it as his own. Thus, were such a transaction to be carried out between Jews, the Ra'avad maintains that the security would never become the lender's property. However, he explains that this law applies only regarding business dealings carried out between Jews, and not to those involving gentiles. Therefore, in this instance, the chametz given as security becomes the gentile's property.<br>In contrast, the Rambam does not consider such an agreement an <i>Asmachtah</i>. However, he does not accept a gentile's right to an article given as security. Hence, though the date for repayment passes before Pesach, he still considers the article as belonging to its original Jewish owner.<br>In this matter, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> follows the more stringent view if the chametz is worth more than the loan, and forbids its use after Pesach. However, if it is not worth more than the loan, that text and, similarly, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>, require the Jewish borrower to redeem his chametz before Pesach. However, if he fails to so, they allow people to rely on the Ra'avad's opinion and benefit from the chametz.<br>Different laws apply to chametz given to a Jew as security by a gentile or by another Jew. In the former instance, a Jew is considered the owner of the chametz if the agreement included the clause specifying retroactive ownership, even though the time for payment is not fixed until after Pesach. If the agreement lacked that clause, and the Jew is not held responsible for the chametz (see Halachah 3 above), the Jew is not liable for that chametz (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>). Nevertheless, other authorities do not accept this decision.</i>
A Jew and a gentile are traveling together in a ship,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is a quote from the <i>Tosefta, Pesachim</i> 2:6.

Although he does not explicitly state so in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442:1) when discussing this law, the later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>) accept this opinion as binding.</i> for example: pickle-brine,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">a mixture containing brine, fish-hash, flour, and sometimes wine.</i> Babylonian <i>kotach</i>, and Median beer,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 1:6 for a description of these substances.</i> which are made from flour.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">which are made from flour.</i><br> [The same applies] to other similar substances which are eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">or drunk.</i> However, a substance which contains a mixture of chametz, but is not fit to be eaten,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">by human beings.</i> may be kept on Pesach.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is called חמץ נוקשה, "hardened chametz," and is permitted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 447:12).

The prohibition against chametz applies only to the five species of grain. They include two species of wheat: wheat and spelt; and three species of barley: barley, oats, and rye.<br>However, <i>kitniyot</i> - e.g., rice, millet, beans, lentils and the like - do not become leavened. Even if one kneads rice flour or the like with boiling water and covers it with fabric until it rises like dough that has become leavened, it is permitted to be eaten. This is not leavening, but rather the decay [of the flour].
With regard to these five species of grain: If [flour from these species] is kneaded with fruit juice alone<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">מי פירות literally means "the water of fruit." However, as the halachah explains, the practical application of the term is much broader.</i> without any water, it will never become leavened. Even if [flour] is placed in [these juices] the entire day until the dough rises, it is permitted to be eaten [on Pesach],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah is a matter of controversy among the commentators. In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 3:1), the Rambam makes similar statements. However, in the Oxford manuscript of that text, the words "permitted to be eaten" are crossed out and replaced with the words "one is not obligated for כרת." However, it appears that this emendation was made by Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, and not the Rambam himself.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:1) permits the use of fruit juice. However, the Ramah (462:4) states that it is Ashkenazic custom not to use fruit juice for matzah on Pesach out of the fear that some water might perhaps be mixed together with it (see below). Nevertheless, he does allow leniency for people who are ill or sick and have difficulty eating normal matzah.<br>Among the present day applications of this concept is commercially produced "egg matzah." According to the above guidelines, in the Ashkenazic community, such matzah:a) cannot be used in the Seder, as explained in the commentary to Halachah 6:2;<br>b) must contain only eggs and fruit juice, with no water whatsoever;<br>c) even so, should be eaten only by those with medical problems that prevent them from eating normal matzah.</i> for fruit juice does not cause [dough] to become leavened.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">and thus become chametz.

Chapter 6

It is a positive commandment of the Torah to eat matzah on the night of the fifteenth [of Nisan], as [Exodus 12:18] states: "In the evening, you shall eat matzot." This applies in every place and at every time. Eating [matzah] is not dependent on the Paschal sacrifice. Rather, it is a mitzvah in its own right. The mitzvah may be fulfilled throughout the entire night.<br>Throughout the other days of the festival, eating matzah is left to one's choice: If one desires, one may eat matzah. If one desires, one may eat rice, millet, roasted seeds, or fruit. Nevertheless, on the night of the fifteenth alone, [eating matzah] is an obligation. Once one eats the size of an olive, he has fulfilled his obligation.
A person who swallows matzah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">gulping it down, without chewing or tasting it</i> [without chewing it] fulfills his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">for as long as the matzah touches his throat and is ingested, it has been eaten. Nevertheless, it is not desirable to fulfill one's obligation in this manner (<i>Magen Avraham, Orach Chayim</i> 475).</i> A person who swallows maror<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">in the same manner</i> [without chewing it] does not fulfill his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Rashbam, <i>Pesachim</i> 115b explains that the maror was instituted to recall the bitterness with which the Egyptians afflicted our ancestors. Therefore, a person who does not taste that bitterness does not fulfill his obligation.<br>Alternatively, certain texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (and <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid.) read "A person who swallows maror fulfills his obligation." The proponents of this text maintain that it is impossible to swallow a piece of maror the size of an olive without feeling some bitterness. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (475:3) quotes the former text.</i> A person who swallows matzah and maror together fulfills the obligation of matzah,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">as above. There is an added undesirable factor in eating matzah in this manner. Preferably, no other substances should be eaten with the matzah, so that only its taste will be sensed. (Indeed, were he to chew both the matzah and the maror, he would not fulfill his obligation (See <i>Pesachim</i> 115a). To insure that nothing negate the taste of the matzah, in many communities it is customary not to dip the matzah in salt when eating it at the seder).</i> but not that of maror, for the maror is secondary to the matzah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad raises a question, noting that the latter phrase is not an explanation why one does not fulfill the mitzvah of maror.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's intention is to explain why the person fulfills the mitzvah of matzah. One might argue that the maror, like the fibers mentioned in the following clause, would prevent one from fulfilling the mitzvah of matzah. Therefore, the Rambam explains that "the maror is secondary..."<br>It must be noted that according to the second version of the text mentioned above, the passage reads with no difficulty whatsoever.</i> If he wrapped them in fibers or the like and swallowed them,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">the matzah, maror, and fibers</i> he does not even fulfill the obligation of matzah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">for unlike the maror, the fibers are considered as an interruption between the person's digestive system and the matzah.

Does a person who performs the deed of a mitzvah, without the intention to carry out God's command, fulfill his obligation, or not?</i> - e.g., gentiles or thieves force him to eat<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The source for the Rambam's statements is <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 28a, which states that when "Persians force a person to eat matzah, he fulfills his obligation."</i> - fulfills his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It appears that the Rambam does not require a person to have the intention to fulfill a mitzvah, for in this instance the only reason the person ate the matzah was the coercion of the gentiles. Nevertheless, the commentaries qualify the Rambam's statements, based on <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4:A person who occupies himself with blowing shofar to learn does not fulfill his obligation... one does not fulfill his obligation until both the person hearing [the shofar] and the one sounding it intend to fulfill the obligation.In resolution, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage from <i>Keritot</i> 19b.<br>Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only מתעסק (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities.<br>Similarly, in the present context, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him. In contrast, since his body did not benefit from hearing the shofar, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears the shofar blown in the proper manner.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 475:4) quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> opinion as regards <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> adds the explanation mentioned in the name of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. (It must be noted that the <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries do not accept this decision). In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 589:8, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes the Rambam's decision concerning blowing the shofar, stating that a מתעסק does not fulfill the mitzvah. Similar decisions are rendered concerning <i>kriat shema</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60) and lulav and etrog (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651).</i><br>A person who ate a כזית matzah in delirium, while possessed by an epileptic fit, and afterwards recovered,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This does not imply that he was necessarily healed of epilepsy entirely, but rather that the seizure was concluded and he was able to return to normal functioning.</i> is obligated to eat another [כזית].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">to fulfill the mitzvah because</i> The consumption of [the first כזית] took place while he was free from the obligation to perform any mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">because he was not in control of himself. Thus, his actions in that state do not obligate him for any transgressions he violates, nor does he receive full credit for any mitzvot he performs.</i>
A person does not fulfill the obligation of eating matzah unless he partakes [of matzah made] from one of the five species<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">wheat, rye, barley, oats, and spelt, as stated in Halachah 5:1.</i> [of grain],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 453:1) states that it is customary to use matzot made from wheat.</i> as [Deuteronomy<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 1:2), the Rambam cites two verses while explaining this principle: Exodus 12:18, "in the evening, you shall eat matzot" and the verse cited here. Similarly, certain manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> contain both verses. The fact that the mitzvah to eat matzah is derived from the verse in Exodus and not the verse in Deuteronomy tends to support the text which quotes both verses. However, <i>Pesachim</i> 35a, the source for the exegesis of this verse, only mentions one verse.</i> 16:3] states: "Do not eat chametz upon it... eat matzot for seven days."<br>[From the verse's association of chametz and matzah, we may derive:] substances which can become leavened<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">that would become leavened if left unattended for the required period.</i> may be eaten as matzah to fulfill one's obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">as evident from the following halachah, the actual dough used to make the matzah need not have the potential to become leavened.

Hence, there is no limit to the quantity of wheat required. In contrast, other <i>kitniyot</i> do not "accept" the flavor of wheat so easily (nor does rice "accept" the flavor of the other four species of grain). Hence, if they are mixed with wheat, there has to be a sufficient quantity of wheat (a כזית within פרס כדי אכילת) for one to fulfill his obligation.<br>The Ra'avad and the Rashbah do not accept the principle explained by the Ramban, and require a כזית in פרס כדי אכילת even when a dough is made of rice and wheat. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 453:2) quotes the Rambam's words exactly. The commentaries infer that this implies acceptance of the Ramban's view.

However, the Ra'avad and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:1) forbid the use of matzah made with any liquid other than water for use at the seder.</i> A person who kneaded [dough with one of these liquids] does not fulfill his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 36a relates that Rabbi Yehoshua told his sons to make him matzah kneaded with milk throughout Pesach, except on the first night.</i><br>One cannot fulfill his obligation with matzah made from thin bran or<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It is abnormal to make bread from bran alone.

One must begin [the narrative describing our ancestors'] base [roots] and conclude with [their] praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This principle is taken from the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a. The commentaries offer several rationales in its explanation. Among them:<br>a) The contrast between our nation's humble roots and the majestic level they reached through the Exodus make us more conscious of God's great kindness (<i>Tosefot Rid</i>).<br>b) Mention of our roots prevents us from becoming overly haughty (<i>Maharshah</i>).</i> What does this imply? One begins relating how originally, in the age of Terach,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham's father</i> our ancestors denied [God's existence]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam is alluding to the passage "Originally, our ancestors were idol-worshipers."</i> and strayed after vanity, pursuing idol worship.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 1:1-3.</i> One concludes with the true faith:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The redemption from Egypt representing the birth of the Jews as a nation and the beginning of their service of God as a people.</i> how the Omnipresent has drawn us close to Him, separated us from the gentiles, and drawn us near to His Oneness.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">by giving us the Torah.</i><br>Similarly, one begins by stating that we were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and [describing] all the evil done to us,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 116a, which mentions a debate between Rav and Shmuel concerning the interpretation of "One must begin [the narrative describing our ancestors'] base [roots] and conclude with [their] praise."<br>Rav maintains that it is proper to begin from "Originally, our ancestors were worshipers of idols," placing the emphasis on our degrading spiritual roots. Shmuel (according to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, Ravvah) maintains that we should begin from "We were slaves to Pharaoh, stressing the humble material origins from which our people stem. Customarily, we follow both opinions in our recitation of the Haggadah (Rav Yitzchak Alfasi), and hence the Rambam includes both opinions in this halachah.<br>There is, nonetheless, a certain difficulty with the Rambam's statements. All texts of the Haggadah begin with "We were slaves," and then relate the passage "Originally, our ancestors were idol worshipers." Here, the Rambam reverses that order. Perhaps he made this choice because the Talmud uses this order when mentioning these two opinions. Alternatively, chronologically, our ancestors' worship of idols preceded the Egyptian exile.</i> and concludes with the miracles and wonders that were wrought upon us, and our freedom.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">relating the story of the Exodus.</i><br>This [implies] that one should extrapolate<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">bringing other verses to explain and clarify the statements of this passage as found in the Haggadah.</i> [the passage beginning] from [Deuteronomy 26:5]: "An Aramean sought to destroy my ancestor..."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This passage served as the statement of thanksgiving recited by the farmers bringing <i>bikkurim</i> (the first fruits) to the Temple.

Whoever does not mention these three matters on the night of the fifteenth has not fulfilled his obligation. They are: the Paschal sacrifice, matzah, and maror.<br>The Paschal sacrifice: [It is eaten] because the Omnipresent passed over the houses of our ancestors in Egypt as [Exodus 12:27] states: "And you shall say: 'It is the Paschal sacrifice to God.'<br>The bitter herbs: [They are eaten] because the Egyptians embittered the lives of our ancestors in Egypt.<br>The matzah: [It is eaten] because of the redemption. These statements are all referred to as the Haggadah.
In each and every generation, a person must present himself<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 116b explains that the mitzvah of relating the story of the Exodus cannot remain on the intellectual level alone. Rather, it must affect a person to the extent that he personally feels that he is leaving Egypt.<br>There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements. <i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.), the commonly accepted text of the Haggadah, and even the Rambam's own text of the Haggadah, read לראות (see himself), and not להראות (present himself) — i.e., show others that he feels this way. Why does the Rambam alter the text here?<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XII, notes that the following halachot emphasize how the obligation of recalling the Exodus applies, not only to the recitation of the Haggadah, but to all the practices performed on Pesach. Since we must recite the Haggadah to others, as implied by the question-and-answer approach required by Halachah 3, the manner in which a person performs all the other Passover practices must also demonstrate to others his personal experience of the Exodus.</i> as if he, himself, has now<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">the words, "himself" and "now" are also additions to the Mishnah.</i> left the slavery of Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Here, also, the Rambam alters the text, adding the words "the slavery." Since the Rambam is addressing people who may never have seen the physical land of Egypt, it is not possible to demand that they feel as if they left that country, but rather, that they left backbreaking slavery as experienced by our people in Egypt.</i> as [Deuteronomy 6:23] states: "He took<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This and the verse quoted below were stated forty years after the redemption from Egypt, to the Jews who were prepared to enter <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.

Nevertheless, the Rambam's text of the Mishnah and the Haggadah do not include that verse.</i> Regarding this manner, God commanded in the Torah: "Remember that you were a slave [Deuteronomy 5:15]"<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It is necessary to quote this verse in addition to the one mentioned previously.

Therefore, as explained in the following halachah, it is praiseworthy for a person to eat the entire Seder meal while reclining.</i> Each and every one,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Even a person who has difficulty drinking wine must observe this practice. <i>Nedarim</i> 49b relates that Rabbi Yehudah bar Illai would have to bind his sides from Pesach to Shavuot because of the aftereffects of the four cups of wine he drank at the Seder.

Many authorities maintain that it is unnecessary for the Rambam to mention this fact, for we can assume that the all-encompassing obligation to educate one's children in Torah practice applies in this regard as well.

These four cups [of wine] should be mixed with water so that drinking them will be pleasant.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In Talmudic times, the wines were very strong and had to be mixed with water before being drunk.

Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> suggests using smaller cups, so that it is easy to drink the entire contents. Some opinions maintain that even if a person is using a very large cup, he is obligated to drink the majority of the cup. However, the prevailing opinion (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 472:19) is that for the first three cups, it is sufficient to drink the majority of a quarter of a <i>log</i> (i.e., at least 1.68 fluid ounces of wine). For the final cup, one should drink an entire quarter of a <i>log</i>.<br>The source of the latter law is <i>Pesachim</i> 108a, which mentions a person who drinks wine from his cup and then gives to his children and the members of his household. The Talmud concludes that he fulfills his obligation if he drinks the majority of the cup. The Rambam quotes only the conclusion of this statement, for he maintains that all adult members of the household, both men and women, should be given their own cups of wine and he does not mention the obligation of giving wine to children.

On each of these four cups, one recites a blessing of its own.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., one recites the blessing בורא פרי הגפן, blessing God for creating wine, before partaking of each cup of wine. Generally, when one continues drinking wine in one sitting, only one blessing is recited in the beginning.

The <i>charoset</i> is a mitzvah ordained by the words of the Sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This statement represents a change of opinion by the Rambam. <i>Pesachim</i> 10:3 states: "The <i>charoset</i> is not a mitzvah.

This is not the halachah.A change of opinion of this nature is not extremely uncommon. However, the question can be raised: why does the Rambam not require a blessing to be recited over the <i>charoset</i>? Among the answers given is that the <i>charoset</i> is considered secondary (טפל) to the substances which are dipped in it.

That measure is required only according to the Sages, who established a separate mitzvah to eat maror. Therefore, as in all other cases where eating is required, one must consume a כזית. However, since there is no Torah mitzvah to eat maror, merely that one should use it to embellish the Paschal sacrifice, that measure is not required by the Torah.<br>[Perhaps, this thesis may be questioned on the basis of Halachah 8:6, which requires a separate blessing for maror when it is eaten alone.

[Conversely, the blessing for the <i>Chaggigah</i>] offering<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Nevertheless, <i>Pesachim</i> 121a quotes Rabbi Yishmael, who offers an alternate opinion.<br><i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains these Sages' difference of opinion as follows: The blood of the Paschal sacrifice is to be poured out against the base of the Temple altar. In contrast, the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> should be sprinkled on the two opposite corners of the altar.<br>Rabbi Yishmael maintains that בדיעבד (after the fact), were a person to pour the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering on the base of the altar, he would be considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Hence, the blessing for the Pesach offering can apply to the <i>Chaggigah</i> as well.<br>In contrast, Rabbi Akiva maintains that even "after the fact," the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is not acceptable if its blood is not sprinkled on the altar as prescribed. Accordingly, the blessing for the Pesach offering has no connection to the <i>Chaggigah</i> at all.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's decision. In <i>Hilchot P'sulei HaMukdashim</i> 2:2, the Rambam writes: "Whenever [blood] is prescribed to be presented [on the altar] by sprinkling, and it was presented by pouring, one has fulfilled his obligation," accepting the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. If so, his acceptance of Rabbi Akiva's opinion here appears to present a contradiction.<br>Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Tz'lach, Pesachim</i> ibid.) attempts to resolve the issue, explaining that the Rambam follows the interpretation of Rav Chayim HaCohen (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> ibid.), who favored a different text of the Talmud and, accordingly, an alternate interpretation of the difference in opinion between the two Sages.<br>Rav Chayim maintains that Rabbi Yishmael considers the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering as secondary to the Paschal sacrifice. (See also Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7.) Hence, reciting a blessing over the Paschal sacrifice, the essential element (עיקר) of the evening, also fulfills the requirement for the secondary element (טפל), the <i>Chaggigah</i>. Indeed, regarding the blessings recited over food, the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:5) that whenever there are two foods, one essential and one secondary, it is only necessary to recite a blessing over the essential food. A blessing is not required for the secondary item.<br>This interpretation itself presents a question: Since the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted only for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice and is not an obligation in its own right, it can be considered as "secondary" to the Pesach sacrifice. If so, what is the rationale for Rabbi Akiva's opinion?<br>It can be explained that Rabbi Akiva never considers one mitzvah as secondary to another. We may use the labels "primary" and "secondary" in regard to matters dependent on our will, but not in regard to mitzvot which we fulfill in obedience to God's desires. Therefore, though the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted because of the Paschal sacrifice, once it has been instituted, it must be considered as a mitzvah in its own right, with its own importance. Hence, it requires a unique blessing of its own (R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch Haggadah).</i> does not free one of [the obligation of the blessing for] the Paschal sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Both Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael agree with this decision.<br>This law can also be explained within the context of the discussion of "primary" and "secondary" mentioned above. Since the Paschal sacrifice follows the Chagigah offering, for the Paschal sacrifice should be eaten when satisfied, one might presume that it is considered as "secondary" to the Chagigah. Hence, the Sages must negate this presumption.</i>

In contrast, maror and <i>charoset</i> are both symbols of slavery.<br>While the Temple was standing, the Ra'avad did not object to the matzah being dipped in <i>charoset</i>, because, as above, it also commemorates our ancestors' slavery. However, after the Temple's destruction and the negation of the mitzvah of maror, we may assume that the other symbols of the enslavement are also negated.

However, even at present, matzah is a Torah command, while maror, in the present age, is only of Rabbinic origin. Hence, eating the maror will negate the taste of the matzah (<i>Pesachim</i> 115a).</i> one recites the blessing, <i>al achilat maror,</i> dips the maror in <i>charoset</i> and eats it.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">without reclining.</i> One should not leave [the bitter herbs] in the <i>charoset</i> for a prolonged period, lest their<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">bitter</i> taste be negated, since [eating the maror] is a mitzvah ordained by the Sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For this reason, it is customary in many communities to shake the <i>charoset</i> off the maror after dipping.</i><br>Afterwards, one should wrap matzah and maror together,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">as was the custom of Hillel,</i> dip them in the <i>charoset</i>, and eat them without reciting a blessing, to recall the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">We follow this practice by eating the <i>korech</i> at the Seder.</i>

Accordingly, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> concludes that although it is permissible to drink a fifth cup, it is not proper to do so.<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXVII, suggests a different interpretation of this halachah, noting that the Rambam does not mention that the fifth cup is drunk. A fifth cup is mixed and placed on the table, and the "great Hallel" is recited over it. However, that cup should not be drunk. Thus, the fifth cup is not included as one of the four. Rather, it is a separate and independent obligation.<br>The Vilna Gaon (see <i>Ta'amei HaMinhagim</i> 551) associates the fifth cup with the cup of Elijah. The Talmud concludes the discussion of many unresolved questions with the statement: תיקו. Literally, the term is a shortened form of the word תיקום, "let it remain". However, it is also interpreted as an acrostic for the expression תשבי יתרץ קושיות ואביעות - "The Tishbite (Elijah) will answer all questions and difficulties."<br>Since the requirement of the fifth cup remains an unresolved question, the fifth cup is left for Elijah in the hope that he will come soon and resolve this question as well.<br>The homiletic aspects of this comment notwithstanding, from a halachic perspective a differentiation must be made between the two. The fifth cup is of Talmudic origin and may be poured for each individual. In contrast, Elijah's cup is an Ashkenazic custom of later origin, and a single cup is used for the whole family. Indeed, they are mentioned by halachists in different chapters of the Shulchan Aruch: the fifth cup by the Ramah in Chapter 481 and Elijah's cup by the <i>Chok Ya'akov</i> in Chapter 480.</i><br>One may complete the Hallel wherever one desires, even though it is not the place where one ate.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A number of different halachic questions would arise should a person decide to leave the home in which he is holding the Seder from the <i>kiddush</i> until the conclusion of the grace after meals.
