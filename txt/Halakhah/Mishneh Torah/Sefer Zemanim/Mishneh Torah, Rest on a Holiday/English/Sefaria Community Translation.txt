Mishneh Torah, Rest on a Holiday



Chapter 1

1 These six days on which Scripture prohibited labor - being the first and seventh days of Passover, the first and eighth days of Sukkot, the day of Shavuot, and the first day of the seventh month (Rosh Hashanah) - are called holidays (<i>yamim tovim</i>). The [degree of] cessation of work is equal in all of them, in that all work is prohibited except for labor that is for the sake of eating - as it is stated (Exodus 12:16), "only anything that is eaten by any person."

Chapter 2

A chick that was hatched on Yom Tov is prohibited [to eat on the Yom Tov it was born] because it is Muktzeh. A calf that was born on Yom Tov- if it's mother was going to be used for meat- it is permitted [to slaughter the calf and eat it on Yom Tov] because the animal is considered to be prepared [for Yom Tov] because of its mother's [status] and if one were to slaughter it's mother while it was still inside- it is permitted to eat [the fetus inside] even though it was not born.
Animals that go out and graze outside of the Techum and come to sleep within the Techum- these are considered to be prepared and [it is permitted] to take them and slaughter them on Yom Tov. But those [animals] that graze and sleep outside of the Techum- if they come [within the Techum] on Yom Tov- They are prohibited to be slaughtered on Yom Tov because they are Muktzeh and they are not on the minds of the people of the city [to be considered to be eaten on Yom Tov]. 
And similarly Kadshim animals that received a blemish on Yom Tov [is prohibited to slaughter and eat on Yom Tov] since [the owner] did not have his mind on it [to be slaughtered for personal use on Yom Tov] from the eve of Yom Tov- it is prohibited to slaughter it on Yom Tov. Therefore it is prohibited for one to examine blemishes on Kadshim animals on Yom Tov because it is a [rabbinic] decree lest a sage permit [Kadshim animals] with blemishes [to be slaughtered for personal use] and he [the owner] will come to slaughter it on that day [on Yom Tov]. But [the sage] may look at the blemish on the eve of Yom Tov and for the next day [tell the owner if it is] permitted or prohibited.
A Bechor that was born [on Yom Tov] with a blemish- it is considered to be prepared [for Yom Tov] and it should not be examined on Yom Tov. If one were to transgress and see the blemish, examine it and permit it [to be eaten]- it can be slaughtered and eaten [on Yom Tov]. A Bechor that falls into a pit- make for it provisions [so that it will not die] because one is not able to bring it up because it it not considered to be fit for slaughter on Yom Tov. [If] it and it's child were to fall into a pit- He should bring up the animal on condition to slaughter it and not do so and be cunning and bring up the second one on [the same] condition to slaughter and slaughter either one he wishes. Because of animal suffering it is permitted to use cunning. Hullin animals that fall from a roof and stood there from time to time- it requires examination[to determine if the animal is valid for consumption]. It may be slaughtered  and may be examined. It is possible that it would be found to be suitable and may be eaten.
 
[If] one sets aside black [birds] and sets aside white [birds] and finds the white ones in the place of the black ones- [They are] prohibited [on Yom Tov] because I [the Rambam] say- maybe those that were set aside [for Yom Tov] flew away and these are others and everything that has a doubt for being prepared [for Yom Tov] is prohibited [to be slaughtered/eaten] on Yom Tov. [If] one were to set aside two [birds] and finds three- all [the birds] are prohibited. [If] one were to set aside three and find two- they are permitted. [If] he were to set them aside within the coop and find them in front of the coop and there and they [the birds] are the only ones and are unable to fly eve though there is another coop there on the corner within fifty cubits-these [birds] are permitted because they only hop around by their coop in the vicinity.
Fish that are in large Bribbin, and similarly domesticated animals and fowl that are in large Bribbin, anything that is  lacking trapping to the point that [the owners] say "Come from the trap and we will trap it"- these [Animals in these traps] are Muktzeh and one cannot trap them on Yom Tov and if one were to trap [these animals in these large Bribbin]- it may not be eaten. Anything that does not require trapping is considered to be prepared and may be trapped on Yom Tov and eaten. Similarly and domesticated animal that is cooped up in an area near a city and gives birth to young- while they [the young] are still little and do not require to be trapped [to slaughter them]- [also] do not required to be set aside [for Yom Tov] because he had his mind on them [to be used for Yom Tov]
Traps for wild animals, birds and fish that are baited from the eve of Yom Tov- one should only take that which [was trapped] inside them if he knows that they were trapped before Yom Tov. One who dams a canal on the eve of Yom Tov and finds in it the next day [On Yom Tov] fish- they are permitted to be eaten on Yom Tov for they were already trapped on the eve of Yom Tov and are considered to be prepared.
  A [store]house that is filled with fruits are [considered to be] prepared [for Yom Tov] and one may open it and take [the fruits inside] from the opening. One who stands on Muktzeh from the eve of Yom Tov [before Yom Tov] during the Shmittah year when all fruits are considered to be owner-less require specification [to acquire them since they are owner-less (even though the fruits are in his field because it is Shmittah)] and he should say "from here until here I will take" and if he does not specify he cannot take.

Chapter 3



Chapter 4




We do not extinguish a candle, to save money, on Yom Tov, just as we do not extinguish it on Shabbat, rather one should leave it to go out. And we do not extinguish a flame in order to have sex, rather, one should cover it with a vessel or make a partition between oneself and the light, or bring the light to another room/house. And if it is not possible to do any of these things, it is still forbidden to extinguish the candle and it is forbidden to have sex until it goes out.

Chapter 6


















Regarding these the prophet says (Hoshea 9; 14), “their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all that they eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread shall be for their hunger only”; and this type of rejoicing is a disgrace, as the prophet says (Malachi 2; 3), “and I (Hashem) will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.”
