Mishneh Torah, Rest on a Holiday



Chapter 1




Any act that is culpable on the Sabbath is punishable with lashing if it is committed on a holyday and not for the purpose of food. This does not include the prohibition against conveying objects from one domain to another, and the prohibition against starting a fire on the Sabbath. Since the transfer of objects from one domain to another has been made permissible for the purpose of preparing food, it has been made permissible even for purposes other than food preparation.— — So too, it is permissible to start a fire on a holyday even when it is not needed for the preparation of food. Other acts, however, are permissible on a holyday only when they are needed for the preparation of food; for example: slaughtering, baking, kneading, and the like. — —
The sages have prohibited any work on a festival, even for the purpose of food, if it can be done on the day preceding the festival without loss or depreciation. Why have they enacted this prohibition? It has been enacted in order to prevent one from postponing the performance of tasks until the day of the festival, with the result that the whole day would be spent in performing these tasks, without having time to enjoy the festival or to eat.
For this very reason they have not prohibited the transfer of objects from one domain into another on a festival, even though each transfer is work that can be done on the day preceding the festival. Why then have they not prohibited it? In order to increase the festive rejoicing. One may therefore carry to and fro whatever he pleases, performing all that he has to do, without being like one whose hands are tied.— —














We celebrate each of the festivals for two days outside Eretz Yisrael owing to custom, the second day being observed by rabbinical enactment as one of the things newly innovated in the Diaspora. Those who reside in Eretz Yisrael, however, observe only <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> for two days. In the section of this book concerning the rules of the Hebrew calendar, we shall explain the principle of this custom as well as the reason why <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> is celebrated for two days everywhere.
Even though the second day of a festival is only by rabbinic enactment, it equals the first day regarding anything that is forbidden.— — On the second day, just like the first day of a festival, funeral eulogies and fasting are forbidden, since one is required to rejoice. The only difference between the two days is that a dead person may be buried on the second day.
Thus, non-Jews should attend to the burial of one who died on the first day of the festival; but on the second day, Jewish people may attend to it,— — because the second day is regarded as an ordinary weekday as far as the burial of the dead is concerned. This applies even to the second day of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>.

Chapter 3



Chapter 4

One may not start a fire on a holyday by rubbing sticks or stones or metal together, or by striking one against the other until fire is produced.— — On a holyday, one is permitted to start a fire only by means of an already existing fire; but not to start a new fire, since it is possible to start it on the day preceding the festival.
Although it is permissible on a holyday to light a fire for the purpose of food, it is forbidden to quench a fire that was lit for the purpose of food, because quenching a fire is work entirely unnecessary for the preparation of food.— —

Chapter 5



Chapter 6

On a holyday occurring on a Friday, one must not bake or cook food for the next day, the Sabbath. This prohibition is on rabbinic grounds, to prevent one from cooking on a holyday for a plain weekday. It stands to reason: if one must not cook food for the Sabbath, he certainly must not cook for a plain weekday. Accordingly, it is permissible to cook and bake on a holyday for the Sabbath if on the day preceding the festival one prepared a dish upon which to depend. The dish upon which he depends is called <i>eruv tavshilin</i> [a mingling of dishes designed for the Sabbath as well as for the immediately preceding holyday].
Why is it called <i>eruv?</i> The same as an <i>eruv</i>, prepared for courtyards and alleys on Friday, is a distinguishing mark preventing the residents from supposing that it is permissible to transfer objects from one domain to another, the <i>eruv</i> dish is a symbol and a reminder, lest some come to think vaguely that it is permissible to bake on a holyday what is not to be eaten on the same day. Hence, it is called the <i>eruv</i> of dishes.





When setting aside the <i>eruv tavshilin</i>, one should recite this blessing: "Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the precept of <i>eruv</i>." He should add: "By virtue of this <i>eruv</i> may I be permitted to bake and cook on the festival day tomorrow what we need for the Sabbath." If he also acts for others, he should say: "May I and so-and-so be permitted," or: "May all the inhabitants of the town be permitted to bake and cook on the festival for the Sabbath following it."


If the two days of a festival occur on Thursday and Friday, the <i>eruv tavshilin</i> should be prepared on Wednesday, the day immediately preceding the holyday.— —





Lamentation and fasting are forbidden during the seven days of <i>Pesaḥ</i>, the eight days of <i>Sukkoth</i>, and the other holydays. One is required to rejoice and be cheerful on those days, along with his wife, children, grandchildren, and all his dependents, as it is written: "You shall rejoice at your festival, you and your son and your daughter, your male and female servants…" (Deuteronomy 16:14). Although the festivity mentioned here refers to the peace-offering, as we are about to explain in the section concerning the rules of the pilgrim-offering, it includes the appropriate rejoicing of each man and his children and the members of his household.
The children, for example, should be given parched grain, nuts, and sweetmeats; the womenfolk should be presented with pretty clothes and trinkets according to one's means; the menfolk should eat meat and drink wine, for there is no real rejoicing without the use of meat and wine. While eating and drinking, one must feed the stranger, the orphan, the widow, and other poor unfortunates. Anyone, however, who locks the doors of his courtyard and eats and drinks along with his wife and children, without giving anything to eat and drink to the poor and the desperate, does not observe a religious celebration but indulges in the celebration of his stomach.— —

When one eats and drinks on a festival, he should not unduly indulge in wine, merriment and frivolity, thinking that the more anyone partakes of this the more he observes a religious celebration. Drunkenness, jesting and levity are not rejoicing but madness and folly, and we are not charged to indulge in madness and folly but in the kind of rejoicing that finds expression in the worship of the Creator of all things, as it is written: "Because you have not served the Lord your God with joy and with a glad heart for all your abundance…" (Deuteronomy 28:47). This proves that one should worship with joy, while it is impossible to serve God by jesting, frivolity, or drunkenness.

Chapter 7

Although the Torah does not attach complete rest to the intermediate days of <i>Pesaḥ</i> and <i>Sukkoth</i>, it refers to them as <i>sacred assembly</i>, and the pilgrim-offering was presented in the Temple on those days; hence, work is forbidden on <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i>, so that it may not be regarded as ordinary weekdays that are devoid of all sanctity. If anyone performs prohibited work on <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i>, he is punished for disobeying a rabbinic enactment. However, not every type of work is prohibited on <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i> as on a holyday, for the things that are prohibited on <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i> are essentially designed to show that it is not like a weekday in every respect. Therefore, some kinds of work are forbidden on <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i>, while others are permitted.
If considerable loss is likely to result from neglecting any particular piece of work on <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i>, it may be performed, provided that it does not involve excessive exertion.— —
