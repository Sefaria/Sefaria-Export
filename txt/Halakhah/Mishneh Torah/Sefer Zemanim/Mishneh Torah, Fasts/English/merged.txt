Mishneh Torah, Fasts



Chapter 1

It is a positive Torah commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 59), which mentions this in the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>Significantly, however, the Rambam's appreciation of this mitzvah differs in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. To explain: Following the verse quoted here by the Rambam as a proof-text, the Torah continues [Numbers 10:10]: "On the days of your rejoicing, on your festivals, and on your new moon [celebrations], you shall sound the trumpets for your burnt offerings and for your peace offerings."<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:We are commanded to sound the trumpets in the Temple when offering sacrifices that are offered only at appointed times.... [Also,] we are commanded to sound the trumpets at a time of distress and difficulty when we pray to Him.In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (and similarly in <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 384), the emphasis of the mitzvah is clearly on the sounding of the trumpets during the sacrifices. In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, when listing the 613 mitzvot at the beginning of the text, the Rambam mentions the sounding of the trumpets both for the sacrifices and in times of distress. Nevertheless, further on in the beginning of the text, when delineating the mitzvot according to subjects, he places the emphasis on crying out to God at a time of distress (seemingly, including crying out verbally and crying out with the trumpets in the same mitzvah). Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 3, where the Rambam mentions the practice of sounding the trumpets in connection with the offering of the sacrifices, he does not mention it as a component of this or any other specific mitzvah.<br>(Note also the commentary of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, which questions why these two different rites were included as a single mitzvah at the outset. Even in the Torah, they are included in two separate verses.)</i> to cry out<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">in prayer. Our Sages (<i>Sifre, VaEtchanan</i>) explain that זעקה is one of the ten verbs used for prayer.</i> and to sound<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The verb להריע refers to the sounding of a series of staccato notes referred to as <i>teru'ah</i>. See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:2-4. Significantly, although in practice, both types of notes were sounded, with regard to the sounding of the trumpets at the offerings, the Torah uses the verb ותקעתם, which refers to sounding a <i>teki'ah</i>, a single long note.</i> trumpets<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In the Temple, these were made of silver (<i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 3:5). Josephus describes them as being approximately a cubit long, slightly thicker than an ordinary flute, and having a bell-like end. It is questionable whether it was necessary for them to be silver outside the Temple as well.<br>See also the Ramban (<i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i>), who mentions an opinion that the shofar, and not a trumpet, should be sounded in time of communal distress. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also notes this opinion and states that either instrument, a shofar or a trumpet, is acceptable, but that - outside of the Temple premises - only one of the two should be used in time of distress. Some support for this position can be drawn from Halachah 6.</i> in the event of any difficulty that arises which affects the community, as [Numbers 10:9] states: "[When you go out to war... against] an enemy who attacks you and you sound the trumpets...."<br>[This<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As obvious from Halachah 4, this practice was observed throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and not only in the Temple. Nor is its observance dependent on the existence of the Temple, nor does the Rambam specify that it must be fulfilled only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (In this regard, there are differing opinions; see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:1) Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:1 questions: Why is the rite of sounding the trumpets (or shofarot) not observed at present?<br>The resolution of this question lies in the Rambam's words, "any difficulty that arises which affects the community." This rite should not be observed when an individual, or even a group of individuals, are in distress, but only when a "community" is affected.<br><i>Pesachim</i> 54b explains that communal fasts are possible only within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There is no concept of taking such a unified communal act of this nature in the diaspora. Therefore, this mitzvah was not relevant in all the generations of our people's existence in the diaspora. (See also the <i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i> of the Ramban.)<br>A question arises, however, with regard to the situation at present, with the renewal of the Jewish settlement in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 11, there are opinions (see the gloss of the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> to the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575) that maintain that at present, the concept of community also applies in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>According to this view, without entering into the discussion regarding the halachic status of the present government, it would appear that it would be proper for this mitzvah to be observed, since its observance is not dependent on the Temple.</i> commandment is not restricted to such a limited scope;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., it does not apply to war alone, as might be understood from the verse.</i> rather] the intent is: Whenever you are distressed by difficulties<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., famine, plague - Note <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b, which states that the trumpets should not be sounded in the case of a plague even during the week. Since a plague is a very severe matter, were the trumpets to be sounded during the week, they might also be sounded when a plague took place on the Sabbath, and thus a prohibition would be violated. The Rambam discusses this question in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:3). Similarly, in Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Rambam rules that the trumpets are sounded when a plague occurs.</i> - e.g., famine, plague, locusts, or the like<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., circumstances that cause distress to the community as a whole.</i> - cry out [to God] because of them and sound the trumpets.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 2:6, where the Rambam gives the assurance that if the Jews cry out to God as a community, He will surely heed their prayers.</i>
This practice is one of the paths of repentance,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Temurah</i>, where the Rambam writes that although all the mitzvot of the Torah are Divine decrees and thus unfathomable in nature, we should meditate upon them and, to the fullest extent of our potential, try to explain them. Similarly, with regard to the mitzvah under discussion, without claiming to be able to fathom it in its entirety, the Rambam gives a rational explanation for the practice.</i> for when a difficulty arises, and the people cry out [to God] and sound the trumpets, everyone will realize<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The very sound of the trumpets will have a startling effect, arousing the people to inspect their conduct. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:4, the Rambam writes:Although the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah is a mitzvah, it also contains an allusion. [It is as if the shofar is saying,] "Wake up you sleepy ones.... You who forget the truth in the vanities of time... look to your souls and improve your conduct."</i> that [the difficulty] occurred because of their evil conduct, as [Jeremiah 5:25] states: "Your sins have turned away [the rains and the harvest climate]."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 9:1, where the Rambam explains that God has instituted a cycle of causation into the world in which performing a mitzvah brings an individual - or a community - blessing and prosperity, which enable them to perform more mitzvot. Conversely, the failure to observe mitzvot brings about misfortune, which, in turn, makes it even harder to observe mitzvot.</i> This [realization] will cause the removal of this difficulty.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For when the Jews turn to God in repentance, He will remove their hardships.</i>
Conversely, should the people fail to cry out [to God] and sound the trumpets, and instead say, "What has happened to us is merely a natural phenomenon and this difficulty is merely a chance occurrence,"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than seeing their difficulty as part of a Divinely structured plan to motivate their repentance.</i> this is a cruel conception of things,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Misfortune is definitely not pleasant. Nevertheless, when one conceives of it as a message from God, intended to motivate a change in one's conduct, one can appreciate that, ultimately, its intent is mercy. In contrast, when one does not appreciate God's hand, one is left with a conception of an existential and cruel world in which there is no force working for man's benefit.</i> which causes them to remain attached to their wicked deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">for they refuse to pay attention to the external cues God gives to motivate repentance.</i> Thus, this time of distress will lead to further distresses.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Tum'at Tzara'at</i>, where the Rambam explains that when a person remains indifferent to the punishment God gives him, God brings more severe punishment upon him.</i><br>This is implied by the Torah's statement [Leviticus 26:27-28]: "If you remain indifferent to Me, I will be indifferent to you with a vengeance."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">מקרה, the Hebrew for "chance occurrence," shares the same root as קרי, "indifferent." Thus</i> The implication of the verse is: When I bring difficulties upon you so that you shall repent and you say it is a chance occurrence, I will add to your [punishment] an expression of vengeance for that indifference [to Divine Providence].
In addition,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">to the obligation to cry out and sound the trumpets incumbent upon us from the Torah</i> it is a Rabbinic ordinance to fast<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Or Sameach</i> mentions that this practice has its source in Biblical times. II Chronicles 20:3 relates that Yehoshafat called a communal fast when beset by war.</i> whenever there is a difficulty that affects the community<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These difficulties are listed in Chapter 2.</i> until there is a manifestation of Divine mercy.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we are not required to fast only once when a distressing situation occurs. Instead, we are obligated to continue fasting until God shows us His mercies and eliminates the source of distress.<br><i>Ta'anit</i> 14b quotes a Rabbinic opinion that maintains that no more than thirteen communal fasts should be ordained because of a difficulty. The Talmud, however, explains that this statement was made with regard to drought alone. With regard to other difficulties, we should continue to fast until our prayers are answered. This conclusion is alluded to by the Rambam's choice of wording in Chapter 3, Halachah 9, and is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:6).</i><br>On these fast days, we cry out in prayer, offer supplications, and sound the trumpets<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">blow a series of <i>teru'ah</i> notes</i> only.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., with no other instrument to accompany them.</i> In the Temple, we sound both the trumpets and the shofar.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">From the Mishnah (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 3:3), it would appear that two shofarot were sounded together (<i>Minchat Chinuch</i>).</i> The shofar blasts should be shortened and the trumpet blasts extended,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the trumpet blasts should continue even after the shofar blasts have ceased.</i> for the mitzvah of the day is with the trumpets.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast to <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 1:2.</i> The trumpets are sounded together with the shofar only in the Temple, as [can be inferred from Psalms 98:6]: "Sound trumpets and shofar blasts before God, the King."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., only "before God," in the Temple, where His Presence is manifest, should these two instruments be sounded together, not elsewhere.</i>
These fasts ordained for the community because of difficulties should not be consecutive,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">day after day.</i> for<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">even though it would be permitted to eat at night</i> the community would not be able to observe such a practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">And an ordinance for the community is not instituted unless it is possible for the majority of the community to observe it (<i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 2:5). Were a communal ordinance that could not be observed by the majority of the community to be instituted, the people's observance, not only of that particular ordinance, but of the Torah as a whole, would be weakened.</i><br>A communal fast should be ordained only on a Monday,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See the commentary on the following halachah, which deals with the question of communal fasts being instituted on days other than Monday or Thursday.</i> on the subsequent Thursday, and on the subsequent Monday.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Mondays and Thursdays are days associated with significant spiritual influences. Also, in this manner, the fasts are separated from each other and from the Sabbath.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:9), the Rambam explains that communal fasts should be held first on Mondays, because were they to be held on Thursday, the shopkeepers would assume that the possibilities for famine are great - for otherwise why would a public fast be instituted before the Sabbath - and they would raise the prices of foodstuffs.<br>(This rationale differs slightly from Rashi's interpretation of the Mishnah. Significantly, many of the traditional commentaries on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> do not mention the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah. See the <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>.)</i> This pattern<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Monday, Thursday, Monday - should be followed until [God manifests His] mercies. - From the wording of this halachah, it would appear that the second Thursday should be skipped, and the second series of three fasts begun on the third Monday. The commentaries note that although there is justification for this position in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:13), the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 15b) rules that there is no need to interrupt the sequence of fasts on the second Thursday. This ruling is also borne out by the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and some authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. There are, however, other Rabbinic opinions - which are also supported by different manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (see the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 3) - that maintain that a series of communal fasts should always begin on a Monday.</i> - Monday, Thursday, Monday - should be followed until [God manifests His] mercies.
A communal fast should not be decreed on a Sabbath, nor on a festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">for the reasons mentioned above.<br>The <i>Merchevat HaMishneh HaSefaradit</i> raises a question regarding this statement. From the previous halachah, it would appear that a communal fast is ordained only on Mondays and Thursdays, and from this halachah one might assume that, since it is necessary to exclude the Sabbath, such a fast might be ordained for other days.<br>In resolution, it is explained that the previous halachah refers only to the thirteen communal fasts instituted when the rains fail to descend. When a difficulty of another nature arises, a fast may be instituted on a day other than Monday or Thursday. Alternatively, it can be explained that if the difficulty is not a matter of immediate emergency, the fast is put off for a Monday, as mentioned above. In the case of an immediate emergency, however, a fast may be held on any day other than those mentioned in this and the following halachah.</i> On these days, neither a shofar nor a trumpet should be sounded, nor do we cry out [to God] or offer supplications in prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the atmosphere of rest and pleasure that permeates the Sabbath, it is improper to make requests about matters that are not immediate necessities. See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:12</i><br>The [only] exceptions are<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See also Chapter 2, Halachah 2, which states that we should cry out in prayer, even on the Sabbath, if our source of sustenance is threatened.</i> a city surrounded by gentiles or a [flooding] river and a ship that is sinking at sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">for these are situations where human life is in immediate danger.</i> [In these instances, and indeed,] even when a single individual is being pursued by gentiles, by thieves, or by an evil spirit<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., he loses control of his behavior and may harm himself (Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b)</i> (we may fast because of them on the Sabbath),<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is set off by parentheses in most contemporary editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, because it is not included in the quotation of this halachah in the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 576). In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo brings support for the omission of this phrase, noting that in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 2:24 and 30:12, where the Rambam discusses praying to God in the event of such imminent disasters on the Sabbath, he does not mention fasting. Hence, when mentioning appealing to God with regard to these difficulties on the Sabbath in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (288:9, 576:12), Rav Yosef Karo omits the mention of fasting.</i> cry out [to God], and offer supplications on their behalf in prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 14a states that this refers to the addition of the prayer <i>Anenu</i>. According to the authorities who maintain that we may fast on the Sabbath (and even according to some who forbid fasting), this refers to the blessing <i>Anenu</i> added to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>). According to the other opinions, it refers to the seven blessings mentioned in Chapter 4 that begin "May He who answered... answer you" (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> [The trumpets] should not be sounded<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Sounding a trumpet is not one of the forbidden Sabbath labors; it is, nevertheless, forbidden because of a Rabbinical decree (see <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:7).</i> for them,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">as an expression of prayer to arouse God's mercies.</i> however, unless they are being sounded to gather together the people to help them and [try to] save them.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they may be sounded as an alarm to call people to come to their assistance, for the Sabbath laws may be violated for the sake of saving lives (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>Note Chapter 2, Halachah 14, which states that if a community's source of sustenance is threatened מתריעים (the verb that generally means "we sound the trumpets") on the Sabbath. Note the commentary on that halachah for an explanation.</i>
Similarly, at the outset, a fast should not be ordained on Rosh Chodesh,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi (<i>Ta'anit</i> 15b) cites Numbers 10:10 as an indication that Rosh Chodesh is described as "a festival." As such, it is inappropriate for a fast to be held on such a day.</i> Chanukah, Purim,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Ta'anit</i> 18b, note that Esther 9:22 describes Purim as "days of celebration and joy." Thus, fasting is inappropriate.</i> or Chol HaMo'ed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Although it is a logical addition, it must be noted that Chol HaMo'ed is not mentioned in the source for this halachah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 2:10, nor is it mentioned in the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 572). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 572:2) quotes the Rambam's ruling.</i> If, however, the community has begun to fast because of a distressing situation for even a single day, and the schedule of fasts requires that a fast be held on one of the days mentioned above, we should fast, and [indeed,] fast for the entire day.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>) states that the fast should be interrupted before nightfall because of the positive nature of these days, <i>Ta'anit</i> 18b quotes a majority opinion that maintains that the fast should be completed.</i>
Pregnant women, nursing women,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lest their fetus or child be endangered by the lack of nourishment.</i> and children<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:10 questions the mention of children in this halachah, for it is accepted that children are never obligated to fast. He explains that, in this instance, the term refers to children past the age of majority. Males are not obligated to observe fasts of this nature until they are 18, nor females until they are 15.<br>The <i>B'nei Binyamin</i> offers another explanation, noting that on Yom Kippur children should be trained to fast by withholding food from them for several hours (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:10). This practice need not be observed on these fast days.</i> need not fast<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, as mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, they should not indulge in food and drink for the sake of pleasure.</i> on communal fasts that are instituted because of difficulties of this nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, these women are required to fast on the seven fasts observed for a lack of rain (<i>ibid.</i>).</i><br>[With regard to these fasts,] even though we are required to fast during the day, we are allowed to eat on [the preceding] night, with the exception of the fasts instituted for [a lack of] rain, as will be explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">in Chapter 3, Halachot 3 and 5.</i> Whenever we are allowed to eat on the night of a fast, whether a communal fast or an individual fast, a person is allowed to eat until dawn, provided he does not sleep. If he goes to sleep,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 12b emphasizes that this refers to a sound sleep. If one merely dozes off briefly, one may eat.</i> he may not eat after arising.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">even if he wakes up before dawn.<br>The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 564:1) state that if, before going to sleep, a person stipulates that he desires to rise before dawn and eat, he is allowed to eat, and yet his fast is still considered to be a fast.</i>
Just as the community should fast because of distress, so too, each individual should fast [when confronted by] distress.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this as an obligation. Not only is fasting advisable for a person as a means to secure Divine favor, it is an obligation incumbent upon him.</i> What is implied? When an individual to whom a person [feels close] is sick,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>B'nei Binyamin</i> cites the example of King David, who fasted when the first son born to him by Batsheva fell ill (II Samuel 12:15-16).</i> lost in the desert, or imprisoned, one should fast for his sake,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Significantly, the Rambam mentions fasting on behalf of another person. Surely, one should fast for one's own sake if that is possible. In many situations, however, were a person who confronts distress to fast, he would lack the strength to cope with the crisis he is facing. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 571:3.)<br>Nevertheless, <i>Ta'anit</i> 8b gives advice regarding such a situation as well, counselling one to vow to fast in the future. This will be considered as if the person fasted already, as implied by Daniel 10:12, "From the day on which you first <i>considered</i>... fasting before your Lord, your words were heeded."</i> ask for mercy for him in prayer, and say [the passage] <i>Anenu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2:14.</i> in<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i> in</i> all the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> prayers recited [that day]. One should not fast on the Sabbath, on festivals, on Rosh Chodesh, on Chanukah, or on Purim.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this as a prohibition. Although a community may observe a fast on some of these days, as stated in Halachah 7, an individual may not. (See also Halachah 12.)<br>Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, which raises questions about this decision, citing <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:9, where the Rambam states:If a person vowed to fast for several days, and those days included Chanukah and Purim, his vow is nullified and he should not fast. [The celebration of] these days was instituted by the Rabbis, and hence, it should be reinforced.One might infer that on the other days that should be celebrated because of the Torah's decree, a vow to fast takes precedence. Some commentaries, however, differentiate between a vow to fast and a commitment to fast made in the afternoon service of the preceding day, as mentioned in the following halachah. In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 578:1) rules that one should not fast on these days.</i>
Whenever an individual did not accept a fast [on the previous day] before sunset, it is not considered to be a fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 12a describes a person who fasts without having made such a commitment to be "a bellows full of air" - i.e., he receives no reward for refraining from eating. Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who questions why such a person does not receive at least the reward of an hourly fast, as mentioned in Halachah 13.<br>He explains that since the person desired his fast to be considered as a full day fast, it is impossible for him to receive the merit of an hourly fast. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 562:42.)</i><br>How does one accept a fast? After reciting the afternoon prayers,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., after reciting the verse, <i>Yih'yu l'ratzon</i>, but before concluding one's prayers entirely.<br>Significantly, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that some texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state that one should make this commitment in the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i>, reciting the prayer <i>Anenu</i>. Although the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others take issue with this concept, its authenticity is borne out by two responsa ascribed to the Rambam.<br>In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 562:6 mentions both possibilities, while the Ramah states that it is preferable to make this statement after the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Interestingly, the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:2 fuses together both options, stating that one should make a mental resolve while reciting the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i>, and a verbal statement after reciting the verse, <i>Yih'yu l'ratzon</i>.</i> one states, "Tomorrow I will fast," and resolves to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From the Rambam's statements, it appears that a mental resolve is not sufficient. This is borne out by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 563:1). Note the ruling of the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 563:3, which state that, after the fact, it is sufficient to have made a mental resolve for one's commitment to fast to be binding.</i> Although one eats at night, this does not detract from one's commitment to fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to what might be inferred from the Rambam's statements and the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) also mention that, after the fact, it is not necessary for the commitment to be made in the afternoon service. As long as it was made during the previous day, whether before the service (according to the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> only) or afterwards (according to both sources), it is binding.</i><br>Similarly, if one resolved to fast for three or four days consecutively and accepts such a fast upon oneself, the fact that one eats each night does not detract from his fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">provided that in the daylight hours one refrains from eating.</i> It is unnecessary for him to state his intent on the afternoon before each succeeding day.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:8) questions whether this applies only when one intends to fast on several consecutive days. If, however, one intends to fast on several non-consecutive days - e.g., on a Monday, on the following Thursday, and on the following Monday - perhaps one is required to make a separate commitment for each day.<br>With regard to the fasts of <i>B'hav</i> (the Monday-Thursday-Monday sequence of fasts which follow the festivals), the authorities agree that a single statement of intent is sufficient. In other instances, however, the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:1 and others require a separate commitment.<br>The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:3 mentions another leniency in this instance. Were a person to desire to retract his commitment to fast on the subsequent days, he is allowed, since he did not make an explicit statement to the effect that he would fast.<br>This view is not, however, accepted by all authorities. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 162:39 cites opinions that require him to honor his commitment on the subsequent days as well.</i>
When a person accepted a resolution to fast on the following day, and indeed, did fast, and on the night [following his fast], changed his mind and decided to [continue his] fast on the following day, it is not considered a fast,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Note the comments of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> cited in the commentary on the previous halachah with regard to whether the person receives the rewards of an hourly fast.</i> because he did not accept [this commitment] while it was still day.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This halachah, quoted from <i>Ta'anit</i> 11b, illustrates clearly the principles stated in the previous halachah.</i> [This applies] even if he continued his fast overnight.

A person who has a disturbing dream must fast<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the Rambam sees this as an obligation.

It is fasting and not indulgence that will bring such a person satisfaction.<br>Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 288:5) explains that at present, it is customary to fast on the Sabbath only for certain disturbing dreams, since we are not as aware of the proper interpretation of dreams as were the Sages of the previous generations.</i> reciting the passage <i>Anenu</i> in each of the prayer services.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">During the week, this passage should be recited in the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i> as usual.

A person may fast for several hours<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., although a person did not undertake a full day fast, the fact that he refrains from eating for several hours can be considered to be a fast. Although his merit is less than that of a person who undertakes and completes a full day fast, he still receives reward for his conduct.</i> - i.e., that he not eat anything for the remainder of a day.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase has its source in <i>Ta'anit</i> 12a and serves as a point of difference between the Rambam and other authorities (among them, the Ra'avad and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). The others maintain that it should be rendered "provided he has not eaten anything the entire day." Based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 8:1), the Rambam maintains that even if a person has eaten, if he does not eat for the remainder of the day, he receives merit for fasting.</i> What is implied? A person was involved with his affairs and tended to his concerns without eating until noon or until three in the afternoon.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Although the person actually fasted for the entire day, it is considered only an hourly fast, since he did not make a commitment on the previous day.</i> Should he make a decision to fast for the remaining hours of the day, he should fast for that time<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">and he is given merit for having fasted</i> and recite [the passage] <i>Anenu</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">in the afternoon service</i> because he accepted the fast before the hours of the fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, the fact that he refrains from eating is considered significant.</i> Similarly, if a person ate or drank and then began to fast for the entire day, it is considered to be a fast for several hours.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, this is a point of difference between the Rambam and other commentaries. In his responsa (Vol. I, Responsum 6), the Rashba writes that the Rambam altered his opinion in his later years and accepted the majority view. The majority opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:10).<br>Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also mentions a more stringent view (that of Rabbenu Asher). According to this opinion, even an hourly fast has to be accepted on the previous day. Thus, an hourly fast refers to an instance when a person previously made a commitment to fast for half a day, and then decided to extend the fast for the entire day.<br>It must be noted that at present, when individuals find fasting difficult, it is customary for a community to declare an hourly fast. In these instances, the members of the community make a commitment not to eat until the afternoon. They recite the afternoon service early, and each individual recites <i>Anenu</i> (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 562:6). This passage is not, however, recited in the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> by the <i>chazan</i> (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:1).</i>
Whenever a person is fasting, whether he is fasting because of an individual distress, a disturbing dream, or distress of a communal nature, he should not indulge in pleasures, act frivolously, or be happy and of good spirits. Instead, [his conduct] should be characterized by serious concern, [as if he were] in mourning, as [implied by Eichah 3:39]: "Over what should a living man be concerned? [Each] man over his sins."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Here again, the Rambam reemphasizes the theme stated at the beginning of the text, that the purpose of fasting is to motivate a person to sincere repentance. (See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 568:12.) The <i>Chesed L'Avraham</i> states that on such days a person should make a special effort to refrain from becoming angry and should try to carry out all his dealings with his colleagues in a pleasant manner.</i><br>It is permitted for [a person who is fasting] to taste even a <i>revi'it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">But no more.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that this interpretation is borne out by the Rambam's own statements, <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 4:16. This is the ruling quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>The Ramah adds that even when a person ate despite making a commitment to fast on a specific day, he is required to fast on another day as well. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 568:8.)<br>See also the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 568:3, which states that on a communal fast, such a person may recite <i>Anenu</i> in the afternoon service. On an individual fast, however, he may not add this passage.</i>
When an individual was fasting for a sick person, and the latter recovered, or because of a distressing situation, and the difficulty passed - he should complete his fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Note the contrast to a communal fast mentioned in the following halachah.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 569:1) states that if the person had accepted several fasts upon himself, he is obligated to complete them all, even when the distressing situation passes after he completes the first fast.

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 574:1 states that this applies only when he did not explicitly accept these fasts. If he accepted the fasts himself, he is obligated to observe his commitment.</i> One who travels from a place where [the community] is not fasting to a place where [the community] is fasting should fast together with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since he did not accept the fast previously himself, he has no obligation to fast. Nevertheless, while he is in the city, he must join together with them. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 574) quotes an opinion which states that even within the city he is not obligated to fast, if he can find a private place to eat. Nevertheless, neither the Rambam nor the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> accept this leniency.</i> If he forgets and eats and drinks, he should not let himself be seen, nor should he indulge in pleasures.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The intent is that one should not show that one is enjoying comfort while others are in distress. <i>Ta'anit</i> 10b derives this principle from Jacob's instructions to his children (Genesis 42:1  to avoid contact with Esau's and Ishmael's descendants. At that time, Jacob and his family had grain, but the others did not, and Jacob did not want to arouse ill-feeling.<br>The Talmud (<i>ibid.</i> 11a) concludes its discussion of this issue with the following principle: Whoever separates himself from the community will not witness their being comforted. In contrast, one who joins in their distress will merit to join in their being comforted.</i>
When a community is fasting for the sake of rain, and it begins to rain before noon, the people should not complete their fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This teaching, quoted from the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:9), conveys an important lesson.

Whenever there is a communal fast that was instituted for a distressing circumstance, the [community's] court and [its] elders sit in the synagogue and review the conduct of the city's [inhabitants] from the time the morning prayers were concluded until noon. They remove the stumbling blocks that lead to sin. They give warnings, enquire, and investigate all those who pursue violence and sin, and [encourage them] to depart [from these ways]. Similarly, [they investigate] people who coerce others and humble them. They also occupy themselves with other similar matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This continues the theme developed by the Rambam at the beginning of the text, that the difficulties God brings upon a community should motivate them to repentance.<br>Significantly, the Rambam does not mention reading the Torah in the morning service. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 566:2) mentions that the Torah should be read in the morning, as on other communal fasts, and mentions that the reading <i>Vay'chal</i>, which is usually read on a communal fast day, should be read on such an occasion as well.</i><br>[This is what would happen] from noon until the evening: During the [third] quarter of the day, they would read the blessings and the curses in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the portion of <i>Bechukotai</i> (Leviticus, Chapter 26), and not the blessings and curses in the book of Deuteronomy (Rashi, <i>Megillah</i> 31a).

It must be noted that Rav Kapach maintains that the Rambam's intent is not that these passages from the Torah and the Prophets should be read communally with blessings recited beforehand and afterwards, as is our present custom. Instead, the intent is that they should be read merely to motivate repentance in a manner similar to the recitation of Eichah on Tish'ah B'Av.

Chapter 2

We should fast and sound the trumpets in the [following] situations of communal distress:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Having explained the nature of the obligations to fast and sound the trumpets in the previous chapter, the Rambam devotes this chapter to explaining the various situations in which these obligations apply.<br>It must be noted that the advances of civilization have cushioned us against many of these natural disasters and it is not common for us to fast because of these situations. Nevertheless, the obligation for a community to fast in such times of distress applies even in the present age and in the diaspora. Thus, both the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> devote an entire chapter (576) to the discussion of fasts of this nature. Nevertheless, in the present era, even in times of genuine communal distress, it is infrequent for the Rabbis to declare a communal fast, because our physical stamina is not as great as that of the previous generations.</i> because of the distress that the enemies of the Jews cause the Jews, because of [the passage of] an armed [force], because of a plague, because of a wild animal [on a rampage], because of various species of locusts,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Both Hebrew terms <i>arbeh</i> and <i>chasil</i> refer to species of locusts. The exact names of the species intended is a source of debate.</i> because of the black blight and the yellow blight, because of falling buildings,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">And because of earthquakes or hurricanes strong enough to cause buildings to topple.</i> because of an epidemic, because of [the loss of our source of] sustenance, and because of rain [or a lack of it].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The lack of rain is the most common and the most widely discussed of all the phenomena mentioned. Nevertheless, it is precisely for that reason that it is discussed last. All the other phenomena are discussed briefly in this chapter, while the fasts concerning rain are discussed in several halachot in this chapter and in the following two chapters in their entirety.</i>
A city afflicted by any of these difficulties should fast and sound the trumpets until the difficulty passes.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">From Chapter 1, Halachah 5, it appears that the the intent is not to fast on consecutive days until the difficulty passes, but rather to fast on the Mondays and Thursdays in this period. Nevertheless, in times of great distress, the Rabbis occasionally ordained consecutive fasts.</i> The inhabitants of the surrounding area should fast,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Only the people in the immediate vicinity of the distressed area are obligated to fast. Were we to be obligated to fast for difficulties in distant places, we would be constantly fasting, for there are, ל"ע, a multitude of difficulties throughout the world (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Although this ruling is generally followed, there are times when public fasts are called when Jews in distant lands are in profound distress. In particular, this applies with regard to the Jews in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (See Halachah 6.)</i> but should not sound the trumpets. They should, however, ask for mercy on [their brethren's] behalf. We do not cry out [to God] or sound the trumpets on the Sabbath, as was explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, Halachah 6. See also <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 2:24.</i> except in the case of distress over [the loss of our source of] sustenance. In this instance, we cry out [to God] even on the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In that halachah, it is mentioned that we also cry out to God in prayer on the Sabbath on behalf of people whose lives are in immediate danger - e.g., a besieged city or a ship in danger of sinking.</i> but we do not sound the trumpets for this reason on the Sabbath.
What is meant by "the distress that the enemies of the Jews cause the Jews"? When gentiles come to wage war against the Jews, to impose a tax upon them,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to an unfair tax imposed on the Jews alone, and not a tax on all the inhabitants of the country.</i> to take land away from them, or to pass a decree [restricting the observance of our faith,]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Here too, mortal danger is involved. As the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:3, we are obligated to sacrifice our lives if gentiles pass a decree forbidding the observance of even a seemingly slight mitzvah (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).</i> even concerning merely a slight mitzvah, we should fast and sound the trumpets until [God shows] mercy.<br>All the surrounding cities should fast, but they should not sound the trumpets unless they are doing so to gather the people together to come to their aid.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For the latter purpose, this is permitted even on the Sabbath, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 6.</i>
What is meant by "[the passage of] an armed [force]"? This applies even to an armed [force] that has peaceful intentions. For example, gentiles were waging war against other gentiles and they passed a Jewish settlement.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This also refers to Jewish settlements in the diaspora.</i> Although they are not at war with the Jews, this is still considered a time of distress<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam proves his point through Biblical exegesis, anyone who reads the chronicles of the rampages of "friendly" armies through the various periods of Jewish history will realize how the passage of any armed forces can constitute communal distress for our people.</i> for which we should fast, as [implied by the blessing, Leviticus 26:6] "A sword will not pass through your land." From this, it can be understood<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the lack of passage of an armed force is considered a blessing, it can be assumed that the passage of an armed force is the opposite.</i> that seeing war is itself a sign of distress.
"Because of plague." What constitutes a plague? When three people die on three consecutive days<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> associates this ruling with the concept of <i>chazakah</i>, i.e., once a phenomenon is repeated three times, it can be presumed to recur.</i> in a city that has 500 male inhabitants,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In one of his responsa, the Rambam writes that the numbers mentioned in this halachah also include gentiles. If a city is smitten by a plague, it will spread among all its inhabitants, whether Jew or gentile. This concept is quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 576:3).</i> this is considered to be a plague. If [this many people] die on one day or on four days, it is not considered a plague.<br>If a city has 1000 male inhabitants and six people die on three consecutive days, it is considered to be a plague. If [this many people] die on one day or on four days, it is not considered a plague. Similarly, this ratio should be followed [with regard to all cities, regardless of their size].<br>Women, children, and older men who no longer work are not included in the census in this context.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:1) uses the expression רגלי for inhabitants. From Exodus 12:37, "600,000 men on foot (רגלי) aside from children," we know that the term refers to adult males able to perform military service (i.e., below the age of sixty). The commentaries explain that elderly men, children, and women are considered to have a weaker constitution than adult males. Hence, it is only when a significant number of adult males die that one may be sure that the deaths can be attributed to a plague. (See also the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 3:5.)</i>
If there is a plague in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, [the Jews in] the diaspora should fast on [its inhabitants'] behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 21b explains the rationale for this halachah: "If a Matron (<i>Eretz Yisrael</i>) is stricken, is it not likely that the maid-servant (the diaspora) will be stricken." The welfare of the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is a matter of concern for all Jews.<br>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 576:2) states that this applies only when the plague has affected <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in its entirety.</i> If there was a plague in one country and caravans frequently travel from it to another country, they should both fast,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:2 states that it is not customary at present to fast because of a plague. The nature of our physical constitutions has changed, and, were the inhabitants of a city afflicted by a plague to fast, it is more likely that they would succumb to it. Similarly, if caravans frequently travel from one city to another, there is the danger of infection. Therefore, even people in the distant city should not fast (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:10).</i> even if they are distant from each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in Halachah 2, in such an instance the surrounding cities should fast as long as there is no danger of infection (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
We do not fast because of a wild animal unless it is on a rampage.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">We have translate the word משלחת in this manner so that its intent will be easily understood. It is, however, worthy to mention the interpretation of Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 22a, who interprets the word as "sent from Heaven," i.e., a minister of Divine retribution. (See also the gloss of the Ra'avad to Halachah 9.) This implies that the animal is not acting according to its natural pattern and is therefore more dangerous than normal.</i> What is implied? If it is seen in a city during the day, it is on a rampage.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A wild animal would not ordinarily enter a populated area during the daytime.</i> Should it be seen in a field during the day, encounter two men and not flee from them, it is on a rampage.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Although wild animals occasionally wander through fields, their tendency is to flee when they encounter humans.</i> If the field was close to a swamp, and it saw two men and pursued them, it is on a rampage; if it did not pursue them, it is not on a rampage.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam mentions, it is common to find wild animals in a swamp. Therefore, the fact that they do not flee when discovered close to a swamp is not considered extraordinary. If, however, the animal pursues them, this is considered a departure from the norm and a sign that it was "sent from Heaven."</i><br>If it was in a swamp, even if it pursued them, it is not considered to be on a rampage<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">It is not out of the ordinary for a wild animal to pursue intruders to its natural home.</i> unless it slew both of them and ate [only] one.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that the animal ate only one of the men is a clear indication that it was motivated by reasons other than natural hunger when it slew the men.</i> If, however, it ate both of them in a swamp, it is not considered to be on a rampage, for this is its place, and it slew them because it was hungry, not because it was on a rampage.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:23 states that a deep forest is governed by the same laws as a swamp.</i>
When houses are constructed in deserts or in other abandoned areas,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 22a mentions this teaching in connection with hunters' huts.</i> since this is a natural place for bands of wild animals, [it is only when] an animal climbs to the top of a roof and takes a baby from a cradle that it is considered to be "on a rampage." Otherwise, it is not considered to be "on a rampage." [The fault lies rather] with these people who endangered their lives and came to a place where wild animals live.

The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 576:5) quotes this as halachah.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains the difference between the two as follows: Plague refers to an instance when death hits the city before there is an outbreak of illness.

For a dry itch [which affects the entire community], we merely cry out [to God].
What is meant by "because of [the loss of our source of] sustenance"? That the price of the articles on which the livelihood of most of the inhabitants of a city depend - e.g., linen goods in Babylon and wine and oil in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> - has fallen, and the trade in these articles has decreased to the extent that a merchant must offer them for sale at only 60% of their real value in order to be able to find a purchaser. This is considered a communal distress [that warrants] us to raise a clamor<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Although we have translated מתריעים as "sound the trumpets" throughout the text, we have altered our translation in this halachah, because in Halachah 2, the Rambam explicitly states that we call out to God on the Sabbath because of the loss of our source of sustenance, but we may not sound the trumpets.

What is meant by "because of rain"? When the rainfall is so abundant that it causes difficulty, prayers should be recited. There is no greater difficulty than this, that homes should fall and become the graves [of their inhabitants].<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 22b mentions this with regard to Babylon, which is a valley and whose homes are not built with sturdy foundations.<br>Note the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, who quote the Rambam's statements (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 576:11), but also mention (577:1) a less extreme instance of abundant rainfall, in which the rains prevent the land from being tilled properly.</i><br>In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, we do not pray [for the cessation of the rains] when there is an abundant rainfall.

If, after grain has already sprouted, the rains cease<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following two halachot, in contrast to the fasts for lack of rain mentioned in Chapter 3, describe a situation in which rain has already begun to descend and then ceases. To a certain degree, since crops have already sprouted, this situation is more distressing than if the rains had never descended at all. These three halachot are quoted without emendation in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:8).</i> and the produce begins to dry, the people should fast and cry out [to God] until rain descends or the produce dries out entirely.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">At which point, there would be no purpose in continuing the fast.</i><br>Similarly, if the Pesach season, which is the time when the trees flower in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, arrives and there is no rainfall,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">At this time, more water is necessary to allow the trees to produce fruit.</i> the people should fast and cry out [to God] until rain that is fit for trees descends or until the season passes.
Similarly, if the festival of Sukkot<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This and the previous halachah apply only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> where the rains are seasonal in this manner.

The Rambam's choice of this version of the text can be explained in that it is very unlikely for rain to descend in the summer (the season of Shavuot) in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. In contrast, it is possible for rain to descend on Sukkot, although this is slightly earlier than usual. Thus the Rambam chose the version that is closer to the prevailing circumstances.</i> arrived and a sufficient amount of rain had not descended to fill the storage vats, the irrigation ditches, and the caverns, the people should fast until sufficient rain descends for the storage vats.<br>If the people have no water to drink, they should fast for rain at all times whenever there is no water to drink, even in the summer.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Ritba states that, in such circumstances, one should call out for Divine mercy, even on the Sabbath.</i>
When the rains ceased for more than forty days in the rainy season, it is a drought, and the people should fast and cry out [to God] until the rains descend or until the rainy season passes.

Chapter 3

[We should adhere to the following procedure when] no rain at all has descended from the beginning of the rainy season onward:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 6a relates that the rainy season in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> begins in the month of Marcheshvan.

On these three fasts, all people are forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As the Rambam mentions in Chapter 1, Halachah 4, all the fasts mentioned in this text are Rabbinic in origin. The only fast mentioned in the Torah is Yom Kippur. Accordingly, when the Sages instituted communal fasts, they used Yom Kippur as a paradigm. Therefore, just as it is forbidden to perform work, wash, anoint oneself, engage in sexual relations, or wear shoes on that holy day, these activities were also forbidden on other fast days.<br>Nevertheless, on fast days other than Yom Kippur, certain leniencies were instituted, and these restrictions were not enforced to the same degree as on Yom Kippur.</i> to perform work during the day,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 12b brings support for this concept from the exegesis of Joel 2:15: "Sanctify the fast day; call an assembly, and collect the elders."

If these [fasts] pass without [their prayers] being answered, the court decrees another seven communal fasts, [beginning on the next] Monday, [and continuing as follows]: Thursday, Monday, Thursday, Monday, Thursday, and Monday.<br>It is only on these seven fasts<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam, based on his interpretation of <i>Ta'anit</i> 14a, does not consider the nature of the situation during the first two sets of fasts serious enough to warrant that these women fast.

Most follow Rashi's interpretation of the passage, which requires these women to fast during the second set of three fasts only. The rationale for that ruling is that he feels that the drought has already become serious enough to warrant their fasting during the second set of three fasts. In principle, these women should also fast during the final seven fasts, but the Rabbis felt that such a long period of fasting would be too taxing for them. Hence, they restricted their fasts to the second set alone. This is the ruling quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:5).</i> that pregnant and nursing women<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The same applies to other individuals who are ill and would suffer from the fast.</i> are required to fast.

Instead, they should eat only what is necessary to maintain their babies.
On these seven fasts the men serving in the [weekly] priestly watch should fast for the entire day. The men of the <i>beit av</i> should fast for a portion of the day, but should not complete their fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the severity of the situation, the leniencies that applied in the previous sets of fasts were withdrawn, and the men of the priestly watch who were not required to serve in the Temple that day were required to complete the fast.

The Torah scholars alone continue to fast,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries do not mention whether it is preferable that all the students of the Torah join in these fasts, as was stated in Halachah 1.

Other opinions - and these are followed by the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> - maintain that all cycles of fasts begin on Monday. Hence, if a cycle of fasts ends on Monday, the next cycle begins on the following Monday.<br>This difference of opinion involves much more than one day, for these fasts are decreed in series of three. Thus, according to the opinion followed by the standard texts, the scholars would fast three days in every two weeks for the duration of the period.

When communal fasts are decreed because of other distressing circumstances, we should continue fasting until our prayers are answered.</i><br>When these individuals fast until Nisan passes, they are allowed to eat at night<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the fast begins at dawn.

For God to display His beneficence at such a time, after the time had passed when the rain could have helped, is a further sign of Divine disfavor (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro).</i>
Where does the above apply? In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and in similar lands.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned, in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the rainy season should begin at the start of Marcheshvan.</i> In contrast, in places where the rainy season begins before or after the seventeenth of Marcheshvan,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:24 states that this applies even if a country's rainy season begins after Shavuot. Note also <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2:16-17, in which the Rambam discusses the question of requesting rain in lands other than <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. This question is particularly relevant in regard to countries in the southern hemisphere.</i> when the time [for the rains] arrives and no rain descends, individuals should [begin a series of three] fasts, [starting on] Monday [and continuing on the following] Thursday and Monday. They should not fast on Rashei Chodashim, Chanukah, or Purim.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For individual fasts should not be held on these days.</i><br>Afterwards, they should wait approximately seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is approximately the time between the conclusion of the three fasts begun on the seventeenth of Cheshvan, and the beginning of the second series of fasts after Rosh Chodesh Kislev.

[The following laws apply to] all the communal fasts decreed in the diaspora: It is permitted to eat during the night,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Until dawn. See Chapter 1, Halachah 8.</i> and they are governed by the same laws as other fasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Halachah 9. Thus, there are no prohibitions against work, washing, anointing oneself, sexual relations, and wearing shoes on these fasts.</i> A communal fast resembling Yom Kippur is decreed only in <i>Eretz Yisrael,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta'anit</i> 11b states, "There is no communal fast in Babylon other than Tish'ah B'Av" - i.e., in Babylon, there is no fast as severe as Yom Kippur, with the exception of Tish'ah B'Av. Significantly, <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 54b) explain that this refers to the land of Babylon, where rains were always plentiful and there was never a need for fasts.<br>The Rambam - and other commentaries and authorities, including the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:10) - explain that the law which applies to Babylon, applies to the entire diaspora. It is not that there can be no need for a communal fast of this nature, but rather that, outside of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the Jewish court lacks the authority to declare such a fast. (See the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 2:1.)<br>The Ramban explains that the reason for the lack of authority is that there is no <i>Nasi</i> in the diaspora, and the declaration of a communal fast would require his approval. The Rashba states that the lack of authority stems from the lack of judges who have received the <i>semichah</i> (ordination) extending back in a chain to Moses. (See <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i>, Chapter 4.) According to these opinions, even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> today it is impossible to ordain communal fasts of this nature. Note the gloss of the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575), where this concept is discussed and a rationale is given for fasting in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> today.<br>(Homiletically, it can be explained that the unity necessary to establish a community is possible only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. In contrast, in the diaspora our greater involvement with material affairs prevents the establishment of true oneness among our people.)</i> and only because of [a lack of] rain.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, such severe fasts are not ordained for any of the other difficulties mentioned in the second chapter. Although the Ramban differs with the Rambam on this point, the Rambam's view is accepted as halachah.</i> This refers to the latter ten fasts - i.e., the middle series of three fasts and the final series of seven fasts.

Chapter 4

On each and every day of the final seven fasts for lack of rain, we pray in the [following] manner. The ark is taken out to the street of the city, and all the people gather together, while dressed in sackcloth.<br>Ashes are placed on the ark and on the Torah scroll to heighten the grief and humble [the people's] hearts. One of the people should take some ashes and place them on the head of the <i>Nasi</i> and on the head of the chief justice, so that they will be ashamed and repent. [The ashes] are placed on the place where one puts on <i>tefillin</i>. Everyone else should take ashes and place them on his [own] head.
Afterwards, one of the wise elders [of the community] stands before them while they are sitting. If there is no wise elder, a man of wisdom should be chosen. If there is no man of wisdom, a man of stature should be chosen.<br>He should speak words of rebuke to them, telling them: "Brethren, it is not sackcloth and fasting that will have an effect, but rather repentance and good deeds. This is evident from [the story of] Nineveh. It is not stated with regard to the people of Nineveh, 'And God saw their sackcloth and their fasting,' but rather, 'And God saw their deeds' [Jonah 3:10]. Similarly, in the words of the prophetic tradition, it is written, 'Rend your hearts and not your garments' [Joel 2:13]." He should continue in this vein according to his ability until they are humbled and turn [to God] in complete repentance.
After this person has completed his words of rebuke, the community stands up to pray. They should choose a person suitable to serve as a leader of prayer on such fast days.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>chazan</i> is not considered a mere functionary. Rather, since he is the leader of prayer, it is hoped that he will motivate all the members of the community to sincere prayer. Moreover, his personal merits can influence the standing of the community as a whole and cause their prayers to be acceptable more readily.</i> If the person who spoke the words of rebuke is suitable to [lead the congregation in] prayer, he should.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is the wisest and most distinguished member of the community, it would be appropriate for him to lead the prayers.</i> If not, another person should be chosen.
Who is fit to [lead the congregation in] prayer on these fasts? A person who leads the prayers frequently and who frequently reads the Torah, the Prophets, and the Sacred Writings. He should have children, but lack means and have work in the field.<br>None of his children, nor any member of his household, nor any of his relatives who are dependent upon him, should be transgressors; rather, his house should be empty of sin; nor should any unfavorable report have been made concerning him during his childhood.<br>He should be humble, appreciated by the community, and have a voice that is appealing and sweet. If he possesses all these virtues and is also an elder, this is most desirable. [Nevertheless, even when he] is not an elder, since he does possess these virtues, he is fit to [lead the congregation in] prayer.
The <i>chazan</i> should begin and recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> [in the usual fashion]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 579) maintains that changes are made in the previous blessing, <i>S'lach lanu</i>, as well. To the usual text of that blessing, we add the confessional prayers recited on Yom Kippur.</i> until the blessing <i>Go'el Yisrael</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Go'el Yisrael</i>, "the Redeemer of Israel," is the seventh blessing of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh.</i> Instead of reciting that blessing in its usual manner, the following additions should be made.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that the Rambam apparently had a different version of the Mishnah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 2:3. According to the version of the Mishnah in common use at present, the six passages mentioned above form the body of the six blessings added on these fasts. In contrast, according to the simple interpretation of the Rambam's text, all these passages should be added in the blessing <i>Go'el Yisrael</i>. Significantly, almost all other authorities follow the former view.</i> He then recites <i>Zichronot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Verses recalling God's remembrance of the Jewish people. (See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:8-9.)</i> and <i>Shofarot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Verses recalling the unique influence of the shofar. (See <i>Hilchot Shofar, ibid.</i>)</i> that relate to the difficulty [facing the people].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the <i>chazan</i> does not recite the same verses that are recited in the Rosh HaShanah prayers, but different verses, more appropriate to the present circumstances.</i> He should also recite the psalms, "I called to God in my distress and He answered me" (Psalm 120), "I lift up my eyes to the mountains" (Psalm 121), "Out of the depths, I called to You, O God" (Psalm 130), "A prayer of the afflicted, when he becomes faint" (Psalm 102).
[In this blessing,] he recites supplicatory prayers according to his ability.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to the Rambam, there is no set text for these prayers, and their text is chosen by the <i>chazan</i>.</i> He says, "Please, behold our affliction and wage our battle; speed our redemption."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text of the blessing <i>Go'el Yisrael</i> that is recited every day.</i> He then recites supplications and states at the conclusion of these supplications, "He who answered Abraham our patriarch at Mount Moriah,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., at the binding of Isaac. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:4) questions the nature of this reference. The intention surely is not that Abraham prayed to God to spare Isaac, for he was totally willing to sacrifice him to fulfill God's will. Instead, this refers to a short prayer that Abraham recited after God told him not to sacrifice his son. In this prayer, he implored God to remember the merit of his act and come to the assistance of his descendants whenever they would be in distress. God "answered Abraham" and acquiesced.</i> will answer you and will hear the sound of your outcry on this day. Blessed are You, God, Redeemer of Israel."
He then begins to add six blessings; these are added one after the other. In each of them, he recites supplicatory prayers which include pleas [for mercy] and verses<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., according to the Rambam, there is no set text for the main body of these six blessings. Instead, it must be chosen by the <i>chazan</i>. The conclusions for each of these blessings are listed in the halachot that follow.</i> from the Prophets and the Holy Writings with which he is familiar.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned above, for this reason it is necessary that the <i>chazan</i> be familiar with the entire Bible.</i> He concludes each of these blessings with the concluding phrases mentioned below.
For the first of these blessings, he concludes: "He who answered Moses and our ancestors at the Red Sea<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">There they prayed to be saved from their Egyptian pursuers. (See Exodus 14:15 and Rashi's commentary.)</i> will answer you and will hear the sound of your outcry on this day. Blessed are You God, who remembers the forgotten."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 15a, explains that this conclusion is appropriate because after the many years of exile in Egypt, the Jews despaired of being redeemed and considered themselves to have been forgotten by God.<br>This differs from the conclusion of the <i>Zichronot</i> blessing on Rosh HaShanah, which is "...who remembers the covenant." Significantly, even the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 579) and the authorities who differ with the Rambam and maintain that the six passages mentioned in Halachah 5 form the body of these six blessings agree with the Rambam concerning the conclusion of this blessing.<br>See also Rashi (<i>Ta'anit</i> 15a), who explains the connection between each of the blessings and the correspondent passage of these six.</i>
For the second of these blessings, he concludes: "He who answered Joshua at Gilgal<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Joshua's prayers that he be able to conquer Jericho. That city fell after the people encircled it blowing the shofar. Joshua's prayer is mentioned as Gilgal because that was the site of the encampment of the Jewish people at that time. (See Joshua, Chapter 5.)</i> will answer you and will hear the sound of your outcry on this day. Blessed are You, God, who hears the sounding [of the trumpets]."<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This is the conclusion of the <i>Shofarot</i> blessing on Rosh HaShanah, according to the Rambam. The <i>Tur</i> has a different text in both places. See note 14.</i>
For the third of these blessings, he concludes: "He who answered Samuel at Mitzpeh<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Samuel's prayer that the Jews be rescued from the Philistines. (See I Samuel 7:8-10.)</i> will answer you and will hear the sound of your outcry on this day. Blessed are You, God, who hears an outcry."<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The verses cited in the previous note speak of Samuel "crying out to God."</i>
For the fourth of these blessings, he concludes: "He who answered Elijah at Mount Carmel<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal. Elijah prayed to God to accept his offering. Afterwards, he also prayed on Mount Carmel for rain. (See I Kings, Chapter 18.)</i> will answer you and will hear the sound of your outcry on this day. Blessed are You, God, who hears prayer."<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the use of this conclusion for one of the blessings of the daily <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is also employed here.</i>
For the fifth of these blessings, he concludes: "He who answered Jonah in the belly of the fish<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">After fleeing from the fulfillment of the mission which God had assigned him, Jonah was thrown to the sea and swallowed by a large fish. Out of the fish's belly, he called out in prayer to God. (See Jonah, Chapter 2.)</i> will answer you and will hear the sound of your outcry on this day. Blessed are You, God, who answers in a time of distress."<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah began his prayer, "I cried out to God in my distress and He heard me."</i>
For the sixth of these blessings, he concludes: "He who answered David and Solomon, his son, in Jerusalem<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 15a, explains that this refers to David's prayer, II Samuel 21:1, after the land suffered a famine for three successive years. Solomon's prayer refers to the prayer he uttered at the dedication of the Temple, I Kings 8:22-53, in which he beseeched God to hear the prayers of the Jews in their time of need.</i> will answer you and will hear the sound of your outcry on this day. Blessed are You God, who has mercy on the land."<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Although King David and King Solomon preceded Elijah and Jonah chronologically, the prayers of the former are chosen as the subject for this concluding blessing, because the intent of their prayers resembles that of the people praying in these communal fasts, that God have mercy on His people and on His holy land in a time of distress (<i>Tosafot, Ta'anit</i> 16b).</i><br>The people all answer <i>Amen</i> after each of these blessings<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam emphasizes this point, because when these blessings are recited in the Temple, the people respond in a different manner, as explained in Halachah 15.</i> in the same manner as <i>Amen</i> is recited after all blessings.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:13-14.</i>
For the seventh of these blessings, he begins, "Heal us, O God, and we will be healed," and concludes the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> in its usual order. The trumpets are sounded. This is the order of prayer [on these fasts] in all places.
When [the people] would pray according to this order in Jerusalem, they would gather on the Temple Mount, before the eastern gate, and pray in this manner. When the <i>chazan</i> reached the passage, "He who answered Abraham,..." he would say, "Blessed are You God, our Lord, the Lord of Israel, for all eternity. Blessed are You God, Redeemer of Israel." They would respond to him, "Blessed be His name and the glory of His kingdom for ever and ever."<br>The attendant to the synagogue would tell those who blow [the trumpets]: "Sound a <i>teki'ah</i>, priests. Sound a <i>teki'ah</i>." The person reciting the prayers then repeats, "He who answered Abraham our patriarch at Mount Moriah, will answer you and will hear the sound of your outcry on this day." Afterwards, the priests [blow the trumpets,] sounding a <i>teki'ah</i>, a series of <i>teru'ot</i>, and a <i>teki'ah</i>.
Similarly, in the second of these blessings, which is the first of the six [blessings] that are added, the <i>chazan</i> concludes the blessing, "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, the Lord of Israel, for all eternity. Blessed are You, God, who remembers the forgotten." [The people] would respond to him, "Blessed be His name and the glory of His kingdom for ever and ever."<br>The attendant to the synagogue would tell those who blow [the trumpets]: "Sound a <i>teru'ah</i>, sons of Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">"Sons of Aaron" is analogous to "priests."</i> Sound a <i>teru'ah</i>."<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The repetition of the phrase "Sound a <i>teru'ah</i>," implies that a series <i>teru'ah, teki'ah, teru'ah</i> is sounded.</i> The person reciting the prayers then repeats, "He who answered Moses and our ancestors at the Red Sea, will answer you and will hear the sound of your outcry on this day." Afterwards, the priests [blow the trumpets,] sounding a series of <i>teru'ot</i>, a <i>teki'ah</i>, and a series of <i>teru'ot</i>.
Similarly for each [of these] blessings: for one, he announces "Sound a <i>teki'ah</i>," and for the other, he announces "Sound a <i>teru'ah</i>," until all seven blessings are concluded. Thus, at times, the priests blow a series, <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>, and at times, they blow a series, <i>teru'ah, teki'ah, teru'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam on this point, explaining that when the announcement "Sound a <i>teki'ah</i>" was made, only a <i>teki'ah</i> was sounded. Conversely, when the announcement "Sound a <i>teru'ah</i>" was made, only a <i>teru'ah</i> was sounded. The <i>B'nei Binyamin</i> (based on his text of the <i>Tosefta, Ta'anit</i> 1:10) mentions a third opinion, that for all seven times, they blew a series <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>.</i> Seven series are blown.<br>This order is followed only on the Temple Mount. When they blow <i>teki'ot</i> and <i>teru'ot</i> there, they sound the trumpets and the shofar together, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 4. Only in the Temple is the shofar sounded together with the trumpets. Outside the Temple, only the trumpets - or according to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, either the trumpets or the shofar - is sounded.</i>
In all places<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and also in the diaspora, not only on the Temple Mount as in the previous halachot.</i> where these seven fasts are decreed, all the people go out to the cemetery after praying and weep and offer supplications, as if to say, "Unless you return from your [sinful] ways, you are like these deceased people."<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This emphasizes the theme expressed several times in this text, that distress and relief from it are dependent on our virtuous conduct or lack thereof.<br>Significantly, <i>Ta'anit</i> 16a gives two rationales for this custom: the one quoted by the Rambam, and a second one, "so that the dead will intercede on our behalf." That passage continues, "What is the difference between these two opinions? A non-Jewish cemetery."<br>Rashi explains that in a non-Jewish cemetery, there is no concept of the dead interceding on our behalf. Nevertheless, even such a place is sufficient to communicate the message "Unless you return...." In light of this, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> mentions that if there is no Jewish cemetery available, the community may go to a non-Jewish cemetery. Significantly, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 579:3) quotes this as halachah. (Note, however, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 579:4.)</i><br>In each of the communal fast days that are decreed because of distressing circumstances,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This includes all the thirteen fasts declared because of rain and all communal fasts decreed because of the distressing circumstances mentioned in Chapter 2. As the Rambam explicitly states (<i>Hilchot Nesiat Kapayim</i> 14:2), <i>Ne'ilah</i> is not recited on commemorative fasts such as Tish'ah B'Av or the Seventeenth of Tammuz. It is, however, recited on Yom Kippur.</i> the <i>Ne'ilah</i> service<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>Ne'ilah</i> means "closing." It refers to "the closing of the gates of heaven for the setting sun" (<i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 1:7). This service is added just before sunset. Thus, on communal fasts, four services are recited.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 4:1) states that this extra prayer service was added because "All those who increase their prayers are answered."</i> is recited in all places.
When the rains descend [in response to] their [prayers] - to what extent is it necessary for them to descend in order for the community to cease fasting?<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 1, Halachah 16.</i> When they descend a handbreadth into parched earth, two handbreadths into ordinary earth, and three handbreadths into cultivated earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In all three instances, a similar amount of rain is required. Parched earth does not allow the water to penetrate easily. Conversely, cultivated earth is broken up and thus allows for greater penetration.</i>

Chapter 5

There are days when the entire Jewish people<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">All healthy adult men and women</i> fast<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It appears that the Rambam considers these fasts to be obligatory in the present era. Based on his interpretation of <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 18b in his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 1:3, the Rambam explains that in the era of the Second Temple, these fasts were of an optional nature. After the destruction of the Temple, however, every Jew is required to observe them.

"The glory of Israel" is a reference to <i>tefillin</i>.<br>The Rambam's choice of wording appears to indicate that the arm <i>tefillin</i> may be worn. Similarly, he does not mention any change in practice regarding the <i>tallit gadol.</i> The custom at present in most communities (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 555:1) is not to wear <i>tefillin</i> - neither the head <i>tefillin</i> nor the arm <i>tefillin</i> - nor to wear the <i>tallit gadol</i> in the morning service.

After the Temple was destroyed, the Sages of that generation ordained<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Bava Batra</i> 60b, one may infer that this refers to the destruction of the Second Temple.</i> that one should never build a building<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 560 cites texts which maintain that this prohibition applies only to a person's private home, but not to synagogues or houses of study.

The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 560) differs, maintaining that if one leaves this space unpainted, one may decorate one's walls as one desires. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 560:1 states that the <i>Tur's</i> opinion may be followed.<br>The latter text (560:2, as does the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 126:1) questions why the observance of this practice is not more widespread.</i> If, however, a person buys a dwelling whose walls have been decorated, it may remain as is; he is not obligated to scrape [the designs] from the walls.
Similarly, they ordained that a person who sets a table for guests should serve slightly less [than usual] and should leave a place empty, [so that it obviously] lacks one of the dishes that would ordinarily be placed there.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 560:5, which states that this applies even with regard to feasts served in association with a mitzvah - e.g., wedding feasts, bar-mitzvahs, and the like.</i><br>When a woman has a set of jewelry made for her, she should refrain from having one of the pieces appropriate for the set made, so that her jewelry is not perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis have also cited other reasons for women to be modest in their wearing of jewelry.

Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not remember you, if I do not recall Jerusalem during my greatest joy."
Similarly, they ordained that one should not play melodies with any sort of musical instrument.

Afterwards, they ordained that grooms<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> emphasizes that this prohibition applies to brides and grooms, who must be reminded to minimize their rejoicing at this time of celebration, but not to other individuals at ordinary times.</i> should not wear crowns at all, nor should they wear any diadems at all,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Sotah</i> 49b, this includes even a crown of flowers.</i> as [implied by Ezekiel 21:31]: "Remove the miter and lift up the crown."

When a person sees the cities of Judah in a state of destruction,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">One of the most sensitive differences of opinion in the religious community in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> at present revolves around this law. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 561) states that the obligation to rend one's garments applies only when <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is under gentile rule.

The commentaries on this verse explain that these measures were taken in mourning over the Temple.</i> When one sees Jerusalem in a state of destruction,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Even if a person sees the cities of Judah, Jerusalem, and the site of the Temple on the same journey, he is obligated to rend his clothes three times. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> emphasizes, however, that the converse is not true. If one sees Jerusalem before any other city and rends one's garments on its behalf, there is no need to rend one's garments for the other cities (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 561:3).</i> one should recite [the continuation of the verse,] "Zion is a desert...." When one sees the Temple in a state of destruction, one should recite [<i>ibid.</i>:10]: "Our holy and beautiful House [...has been burned with fire]" and rend one's garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 561) emphasizes how one should prostrate oneself in mourning, overcome with grief at the sight of this holy place in ruins.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 561:5 emphasizes that this refers to seeing the Temple from afar. It is forbidden to enter the Temple Mount itself, because we are all ritually impure, and the sanctity of that holy place is still intact. (See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:16.)</i><br>From which point is one obligated to rend one's garments? From Tzofim.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a point from which one could see the Jerusalem of the Biblical and Talmudic eras. The location of the present city is slightly different. Tzofim is not identical with present-day Mount Scopus.</i> Afterwards, when one reaches the Temple, one should rend them a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">A parallel exists in the laws of mourning. If one parent dies after one has rent one's garment over the passing of another relative, it is not sufficient merely to add slightly to the tear; one must rend the garment a second time (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 8:10).</i> If one encountered the Temple first, because one came from the desert, one should rend one's garments because of the Temple, and add to the tear because of Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Here also we see a parallel in the laws of mourning. If one hears of the death of a relative other than a parent after one has rent a garment over the passing of another relative, all that is necessary is to add slightly to the tear (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>
In all these situations, one must rend one's garments with one's hands and not with a utensil.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 9:2, the Rambam equates the obligation to rend one's garments over the cities of Judah, Jerusalem, and the Temple with the obligation to rend one's garments over one's parent's death. In mourning over others, one may cut one's garments with a utensil (<i>loc. cit.</i> 8:2). For one's parents and in these situations, the tear must be made with one's hands (<i>loc. cit.</i> 8:3).<br>Significantly, the Ra'avad objects to a complete equation between seeing these sites in destruction and one's parent's death, and therefore maintains that there is no obligation to rend one's garments with one's hands and reveal one's heart. The later halachic authorities, however, do not accept his ruling.</i> While standing,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Whenever one is required to rend one's garments, one must stand (<i>loc. cit.</i> 8:1).</i> the person should rend all the garments he is wearing until he reveals his heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In mourning over others, one need not rend one's garments more than a handbreadth (<i>loc. cit.</i> 8:2). For one's parents and in these situations, one must continue tearing until one's heart is revealed (<i>loc. cit.</i> 8:3, 9:3).</i> He should never mend these tears at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a usual pattern of stitching, which does not make it obvious that the garment had been rent. If one mends a garment using a less perfect method of sewing, it is permitted, as explained below.<br>The prohibition against mending one's garments in this manner applies in these instances and for one's parents. When mourning the passing of others, one may mend the garment afterwards (<i>loc. cit.</i> 9:1).</i> He may, however, have them stitched, hemmed, gathered closed, or sewn with a ladder pattern.
[The following rules apply when a person] comes to Jerusalem frequently in his travels: If he comes within thirty days of his last visit, he is not required to rend his garments. If he comes after thirty days, he is.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">At present, rather than rend one's garments every time one comes to Jerusalem, it is customary to sell one's garments to another person, so that it would be forbidden to tear them (see <i>loc. cit.</i> 8:7).</i>
All these [commemorative] fasts will be nullified in the Messianic era<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">With the conclusion of the exile, there will be no need to mark the dates that led to it with mourning and fasting. Thus the Rambam writes at the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Megillah</i>: "All memories of the difficulties [endured by our people] will be nullified as [Isaiah 65:16] states: 'For the former difficulties will be forgotten.'<br>As mentioned previously, fasting is not an end in its own right, but a means to motivate the Jews to return to God and correct the faults in their behavior. The coming of the redemption will be a sign that the service of repentance is complete, and thus there will be no further need for fasting.</i> and, indeed ultimately, they will be transformed<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Through repentance, sins are transformed into merits (<i>Yoma</i> 86a).

There the Rambam elaborates on how, instead of asceticism and fasting, God desires intellectual development ("truth") and emotional harmony ("peace").<br>From a different perspective, it can be understood that by quoting the conclusion of the verse, the prophet was also alluding to the means by which the Messianic redemption - and thus the transformation of these fasts - could be brought closer.<br><i>Yoma</i> 9b relates that the Temple was destroyed because of unwarranted hatred among the Jewish people. By spreading peace and truth, we will nullify the cause for the exile, and this will cause the effect, the exile itself, also to cease (<i>Likkutei Sichot,</i> Vol. 15, pp. 415ff.).</i>
