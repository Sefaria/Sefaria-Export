Chapter 5

There are days that all the people of Israel observe as fasts on account of the tragic events which occurred on them, the purpose being to appeal to the hearts and to lay open the paths of repentance. This serves as a reminder of our evil doings, and the deeds of our fathers which were like ours now, resulting in the afflictions endured by them and by us. By remembering these things we are likely to repent and do right, as it is written: "They shall confess their sins and the sins of their fathers…" (Leviticus 26:40).
They are as follows: The third day of <i>Tishri</i>, on which Gedaliah the son of Ahikam was slain, the last ember of Judea's independence was extinguished, and her dispersion was made complete. The tenth of <i>Teveth</i>, on which wicked Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, pressed on Jerusalem and placed it under siege and stress. The seventeenth day of <i>Tammuz</i>, on which five things occurred: the tablets were broken, the daily offering was discontinued before the destruction of the first Temple, the walls of Jerusalem were breached before the destruction of the second Temple, wicked Apostomos burned the Torah and set up an idol in the Temple.
The ninth of <i>Av</i>, on which five things happened: it was decreed in the wilderness that the people of Israel were not to enter the promised land; the Temple was destroyed both the first time and the second time, and a great city named Betar was captured. It was inhabited by tens of thousands of Jews. They had a great ruler, thought by all of them, including great scholars, to be King Messiah. But he fell into the hands of [the Roman] pagans, who killed them all, a calamity as great as the destruction of the Temple. On that day, the ninth of <i>Av</i>, predestined for Israel's reverses, the wicked Turnus Rufus plowed up the Temple site and its surroundings, in fulfillment of the prophetic utterance: "Zion shall be plowed up like a field" (Jeremiah 26:18).
These four fast days are distinctly mentioned in the prophetic books: "The fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth" (Zechariah 8:19). The fast of the fourth month is the seventeenth of <i>Tammuz</i>, which is in the fourth month; the fast of the fifth is <i>Tish'ah b'Av</i>, which is in the fifth month; the fast of the seventh is the third of <i>Tishri</i>, which is in the seventh month; and the fast of the tenth is the tenth of <i>Teveth</i>, which is in the tenth month.
All the Jewish people are accustomed nowadays to fast on the thirteenth day of <i>Adar</i> in remembrance of the fast observed in the days of Haman, as it is written: "Regarding their fasting and wailing" (Esther 9:31). If the thirteenth of <i>Adar</i> happens to coincide with the Sabbath, we observe the fast earlier, on Thursday, the eleventh. If one of the other four fast days coincides with the Sabbath, it is postponed until after the Sabbath. If it falls on Friday, it is observed on Friday.— —













All these fasts will be abolished during the messianic days. Furthermore, they will be turned into festive days of rejoicing and gladness, as it is written: "The Lord of hosts declares that the fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth shall become occasions of joy and gladness and cheerful festivals for the house of Judah; only love truth and peace" (Zechariah 8:19).
