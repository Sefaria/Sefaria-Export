Mishneh Torah, Fasts



Chapter 1

It is a positive commandment from the Torah to cry out and to sound trumpets for all troubles that come upon the community, as it is said, "upon an enemy who attacks you and you sound trumpets (Numbers 10:9)."  That is to say, every matter that troubles you like famine, plague, locusts, and so forth, cry out because of them and sound the trumpets.

But if they do not cry out and sound trumpets, but rather say: "What has happed is the way of the world, is merely happenstance". This is a cruel way, and it causes them to stick to their bad deeds. And the trouble will add other troubles. About this it is written in the Torah (Not an exact quote, seems to be referring to Leviticus 26, 27-28): "but walk contrary unto Me  then I will walk contrary unto you in fury". That is, when I will bring upon you troubles, if you will say that it is happenstance I will increase the fury of this tear.
