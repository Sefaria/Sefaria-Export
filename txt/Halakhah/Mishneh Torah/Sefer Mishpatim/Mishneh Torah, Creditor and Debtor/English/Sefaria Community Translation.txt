Mishneh Torah, Creditor and Debtor



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4













Some of the Geonim have taught that the borrower who waives the interest a lender has charged or will in the future charge on his behalf, even if he [affirms his] waiver through <i>kinyan</i> or gives [it as] a present, [his words] accomplish nothing. [Their rationale is] that all interest [that is given], [the borrower] always waives it. But the Torah does not waive [it] and forbids this waiver [specifically]. Therefore, waiver of interest is not effective, even interest [forbidden by] the rulings [of the rabbis]. It appears to me that this teaching is not correct. Instead, because they tell the lender to return to him [the interest], and the lender knows that he did a prohibited thing, and [the borrower] can take from him [the money], if [the borrower] wants to waive [the obligation to return the interest], he can waive, just as a person can waive [the return of] a stolen object. The Sages said explicitly that when thieves and lenders [of money] at interest return [the interest], we should not receive it from them, from the general rule that waiver [of the requirement to return interest] is effective.

Chapter 6








Some of the Geonim have taught that all [that is given as] a pledge and nothing is deducted from it, it is fixed interest. They did not go down to the depth of the matter to differentiate between a field and a courtyard. Therefore, they were perplexed by the words of the Sages in the Gemara. Similarly, they taught that [giving property] as a pledge even with a deduction is prohibited, whether for a courtyard or a field, except in a certain situation. How so? . . .

The [lender] produces a verified promissory note. The borrower makes a claim [before a court] and says, "This note is a fake, and I never wrote it"; or, "It involves interest" or "a shade of interest"; or, "The note [was given] on faith"; or, "I wrote it [in order] to borrow, but I didn't borrow" (that is, he makes a claim that if agreed to by the lender would make the note void). The lender maintains that his note [is valid] and says that [the borrower's] claim is false. The borrower demands [that the lender] take an oath [before] collecting. There is a disagreement between Geonim [regarding this situation]. There are Geonim that teach that the holder of the note is obligated to take an oath resembling one from the Torah, just like when [the borrower] claimed that he paid [the debt]. My teachers taught that the lender should only be made to swear when the borrower says that he paid [the debt]. [The rationale is that] he acknowledged the note and it remains to be paid. But we do not accept all these claims to extinguish a valid debt, rather [the borrower] should pay and after that make a claim against the lender to the extent he desires, that if [the lender] acknowledges [the claim] he shall return [the money] to him. If he denies [the claim], he should take <i>sh'vua hesset</i>. My opinion leans toward this [view].

If there are many promissory notes each bearing the same date (or the same hour, where the custom is to write the time of day) - whoever claims first wins, whether with regards to land or movable property.
