Mishneh Torah, Plaintiff and Defendant



Chapter 1

If a man sues another concerning movables and the other admits that he owes a portion of the goods claimed, he must pay what he admits and take a biblical oath about the balance, as it is written: "Where one claims that the thing is his, both parties shall present their case before the judges" (Exodus 22:8). So too, if the defendant denies everything and says: "It never happened," and one witness testifies that it did, he must take a biblical oath. It has been traditionally inferred that wherever the testimony of two witnesses subjects a party to payment liability, the testimony of one witness subjects him to taking an oath.— —
None but the following three is required to take a biblical oath: 1) one who admits that he owes a portion of the movables claimed ; 2) one against whom a single witness testifies that he owes money; 3) the bailee. — — Every one of these three takes an oath and is released from payment. But all those who take an oath and collect — — do so only by virtue of a rabbinic ordinance. All these oaths, though taken on rabbinic grounds, resemble the biblical oaths and are administered while holding a sacred object.
If a man lodged a claim against another concerning movables and the defendant denied the entire claim and said <i>it is absolutely untrue</i>, or if he admitted the claim in part and immediately handed it to him, saying: "This is all you have on me, take it," or if the defendant said: "It is true that you have had a claim on me, but you have remitted it to me," or "you have presented it to me," — — in all such cases the defendant is exempt from a biblical oath, but the sages of the Talmud ordained that the defendant should take an exemption oath and be released. This oath is unlike the biblical oath, since it is administered without holding a sacred object. We have already explained, in the section concerning oaths, how the biblical oath and the exemption oath are administered.


Anyone who is required to take an exemption oath may shift it to the plaintiff, if he so desires, so that the plaintiff swears and collects from the defendant. This is the only case where the plaintiff collects from the defendant by taking the exemption oath which has been shifted to him by the defendant. Only an exemption oath can be so shifted; but a biblical oath, or a rabbinic oath that is quasi-biblical cannot be shifted.
An exemption oath is imposed only in the case of a certainty claim; if the claim is based on doubt, the defendant is exempt from such an oath. If, for example, the plaintiff says: "It seems to me that you owe me one hundred <i>zuz</i>," or if he says: "I lent you one hundred <i>zuz</i>, and it seems to me that you have not repaid me" — — and the defendant says: "I owe you nothing," he is free from taking even an exemption oath. The same applies to all similar cases.

Chapter 6

If litigants came into the law court, and one of them said: "I have a claim on this man for one hundred <i>zuz</i> which I lent him, deposited with him, he stole from me, he owes me in wages," and the like, and the defendant replied: "I owe you nothing, you have no claim on me, you are making a false claim," it is not a correct answer. The court will say to him: "Refute his claim, and be specific in your reply as he was in his claim. State whether you did or did not borrow money from him, whether he did or did not deposit with you, whether you did or did not rob him, whether you did or did not hire him. And so with other claims.<br>Why does not the court accept a reply that is not specific? For fear that the defendant is in error and might unwittingly swear falsely; for it is possible that the plaintiff lent money to the defendant, as he claims, and that the defendant paid the debt to the plaintiff's son or wife, or presented him with a gift equivalent to the debt, and he imagines that he has thereby been released from the debt. He is therefore told by the court: "How can you say <i>I owe him nothing</i> when you may be lawfully required to make restitution without your being aware of it? Inform the judges precisely what you mean, and they will let you know whether or not you owe anything. Even if the defendant is a great scholar, he is told: "You will lose nothing by replying to the plaintiff's claim and informing us as to why you do not owe him anything, whether because his claim is absolutely untrue or because you have repaid what you owed.— —<br>If the plaintiff lodged a claim against the defendant for one hundred <i>zuz</i> that he had lent him, and the defendant answered him <i>it is absolutely untrue</i>, and the plaintiff produced witnesses thereafter who testified that he had lent him the money in their presence, whereupon the defendant retracted and said : "It was indeed so, but I borrowed and repaid," we should lend no attention to him; he is considered a liar, and must make restitution. If, however, he answered: "I do not owe," or "you have no claim on me," or "you are making a false claim," and the like, and the plaintiff produced witnesses thereafter that he had lent him in their presence, while the defendant said: "Yes indeed, it was so, but I have returned his deposit," or "I have repaid what I owed him," he is not considered a liar; he takes an exemption oath and is released.
If witnesses saw a man count money and give it to another, but they did not know what the money was for, and then the first man lodged a claim against the other, demanding: "Give me the money I lent you," and the second man said: "You gave me the money as a gift," or "in payment of a debt," he is believed ; he takes an exemption oath and is released. If, however, the defendant said <i>it is absolutely untrue</i>, and then witnesses appeared and testified that the plaintiff had counted the money and given it to the defendant in their presence, the defendant is deemed a liar. A man is never deemed dishonest unless he makes a denial in court and two witnesses come and contradict his denial.

Chapter 7



Chapter 8

All movable goods are presumed to be the property of the person in whose possession they are, even though the plaintiff has produced witnesses that those movables are known to be his. If, for example, the plaintiff says: "This garment, or this instrument which you have in your hand, or in your house, is mine, or I deposited it with you, or I lent it to you, and here are witnesses who know that it was previously in my possession," while the defendant says: "It is not so; you have sold it to me, or presented it to me as a gift," the defendant takes an exemption oath and is released.

This applies only in regard to things that are not likely to be lent or rented out, such as garments, farm products, household utensils, merchandise, and the like. But things that are likely to be lent or rented out are presumed to be the property of the original owner, even though they are in the possession of the defendant, and even though the plaintiff did not lend or rent out the object in the presence of witnesses. If, for example, Reuben owned an instrument that was likely to be lent or rented out ; he has witnesses that it was known to be his ; the instrument is now in the possession of Simeon; Reuben claims that it was lent or rented, while Simeon claims: "You have sold it to me, you have presented it to me as a gift, you have left it with me as a pledge," he is not believed. Reuben takes an exemption oath to offset Simeon's claim and recovers his instrument. Even if Simeon died, Reuben recovers the instrument. But the Geonim have taught that Reuben must take an exemption oath, because the court pleads for the heir.





Do not be confused, as many great men were, concerning the difference between things that are likely to be lent or rented out and things that are usually lent or rented out. Indeed, all things are suitable to be lent or rented out; even a man's undershirt, his mattress and bed are fit to be lent. But things that are likely to be lent or rented out are those instruments which the residents of a particular town produce primarily for the purpose of lending or renting them and receiving a fee for them. They are to the owner like landed property, the products of which he enjoys while the principal remains. These utensils, too, are made essentially for the purpose of enjoying the fee they bring, as in the case of the large copper kettles which are used for cooking at banquet halls, or the [gilded] copper ornament which is rented out to a bride for adornment. These objects are not made for sale or for use by the owner in his home, but for the purpose of lending them to others in order to receive in return an equivalent benefit, or renting them out and receiving a fee for their use.— —
— — This is an essential legal principle. It is sensible and should be relied upon in judging. It is clear to those who find knowledge, and the judge should duly place it before his eyes, so that he may not depart from the truth.

Chapter 9



Chapter 10



Chapter 11

All landed property known to belong to a certain owner is presumed to be the property of that owner, even though it is now in the possession of others. If, for example, Reuben was using a courtyard in the manner people use their courtyards: he lived in it or leased it to others, or built and tore down. But after some time Simeon came and lodged a claim against him, saying to him: "This courtyard which is in your possession is mine; it is merely rented, or lent, to you." Whereupon Reuben answered him: "It was yours and you sold it to me," or "you presented it to me as a gift." If Simeon has no witnesses that the courtyard was known to have been his, Reuben takes an exemption oath and remains where he is; if, however, Simeon produced witnesses testifying that this courtyard was his, it is presumed to be the property of Simeon, and the court tells Reuben: "Produce evidence that he has sold it to you or presented it to you." If he has not produced evidence, we evict him from the property and seize it for Simeon, even though Reuben does not admit that it was Simeon's; indeed, Simeon has witnesses to that effect.
What has just been stated, that we make it necessary for Reuben to produce evidence or else he is evicted from the property, applies only in case he has not been using the property for a long time. If, however, he has produced witnesses that he has enjoyed the produce of the land for three years in succession, and derived as much benefit from the whole of it as every person would from that type of land, provided the original owner could know that another took possession of it and he entered no protest, we let it remain in the possession of Reuben who takes an exemption oath that Simeon sold or presented it to him, and he is released. Because we say to Simeon: "If what you claim is true, namely that you have neither sold it nor given it away, why have you not protested when this man has made use of your land year after year without your having a rent note or a mortgage note?" If he put forth a claim, saying: "Because I was in a distant country, the information failed to reach me," we say to him: "It is impossible that the information should not have reached you in the course of three years, and when it reached you, you should have entered a protest in the presence of witnesses, telling them : So-and-so has robbed me ; I will sue him at law tomorrow. Since you have not protested, you have occasioned your own loss." Accordingly, if it was a time of war, or a dangerous road between the locality where Reuben was and the locality where Simeon was, the property is taken away from Reuben and restored to Simeon, even if Reuben enjoyed its produce for ten years, because Simeon may say : "I was unaware that he was using my land."
