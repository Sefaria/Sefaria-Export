Mishneh Torah, Inheritances



Chapter 1











A husband whose wife dies, and afterwards her father dies, or her brothers, or one of her heirs, the husband does not inherit them. Instead, the inheritance goes to her living heirs, and if there are none the inheritance returns to her father's family. For the husband does not inherit assets that come to him after her death, only those who already came before she died. 

Chapter 2





A day-old child reduces from the firstborn share, though this is not the case by a fetus.  [Likewise,] a son born after the death of his father does not cause a reduction of the firstborn share.

Chapter 3

The firstborn does not take a double share from property destined to come after the death of his father; rather, just property that is [already] held by his father that [already] came into his domain, as it says (in Deuteronomy 21 17) "in all that is found to him".  For example, if one of those from whom his father would inherit dies after his father's death, the firstborn and regular son inherit that one's estate as one [i.e. on equal footing].  Likewise, if his father was due repayment of a loan [he had made to a borrower] or if he owned a ship at sea [at the time of his death], they inherit [these not yet present assets on equal footing, i.e. with no special double portion for the firstborn].

Chapter 7








If someone voluntarily departed [from his place of residence] and left his property and it is unknown where he went or what happened to him, [the court] does not give his estate over to a relative [of his who stands to inherit it]. If, however, [the relative] takes possession [of the estate on his own, the court] does not remove [the relative from the estate]. The court is not required to tend to [such an abandoned estate] nor to appoint [for it] a guardian, neither for real estate nor for movables, for he voluntarily departed and left his property.  How should this [abandoned] property be treated legally? The movables remain with the one in whose possession they are till [the owner] comes and claims them or until he dies and the heirs claim [them].

Chapter 8

When the [court designates] a relative [to attend] to the properties of the captive or fleer [about whom it is suspected that they are deceased], or to the properties of the one who departed voluntarily, about whom it was heard that he is deceased, [the court] does not [appoint] a minor [to attend the properties] lest he cause a loss to the properties.  [The courts also] do not [appoint] a relative [to attend in a sharecropping arragnement] to the property of a minor, lest [the relative] will [take advantage of the minor's inexperience and falsely] claim, "This [property] is my share that belongs to me through my own inheritance." Even a relative of a relative is not [given the property to attend, because of this concern].  What is an example [of this law]?  [If] there were two brothers, one an adult and one a minor, and the minor was taken captive or fled, [the court] does not [appoint] the adult  [brother as a sharecropper] of [the minor's] field, since the minor [brother] cannot protest [effectively if] the [adult] brother takes possession [of the field] and after [some] years claims, "This is my portion that I received in my own inheritance and it is in my possession because of [my own] inheritance."  Even a nephew of this minor who was taken captive is not given the property [in a share-cropping arrangement], lest he say that, "I inherited this portion because of my [own] father."

Chapter 9

The brothers that did not yet divide their inheritance from their father, but rather they are all using what their father left them together, they are considered like partners for every matter [related to the inherited estate].  Likewise other heirs [to an estate] are considered partners with regard to the estate of the one they inherit.  And whenever any of them engaged in [profitable] transactions using the money [of the estate], the profit goes to the middle [i.e. is shared].

Chapter 10



Chapter 11



If someone has in his possession [investment] beer that belongs to orphans [and there is a risk that] if he leaves it [in place] until it is sold, it may sour, but if he brings it to the market [there's a risk that] an accident may occur to it en route - he should treat it as he would treat his own [investment beer]. Likewise for all similar cases.
