Mishneh Torah, Inheritances



Chapter 1

Following is the order of legal heirs: If a man died, his children are his heirs; they have priority over anyone else; the males have priority over the females.
A female does not share an inheritance with a male. If a man died without leaving children, his father inherits his property; the mother does not inherit from her children. This rule is based upon tradition.
Whoever has priority in the order of heirs, his descendants have priority likewise. Accordingly, if anyone died, man or woman, leaving a son, he inherits everything. If there is no son living, we look carefully into the son's descendants, males or females ; even the son's daughter's daughter's daughter, to the end of the line, shall inherit everything. If the son left no descendants, we resort to the daughter, who inherits everything. If there is no daughter living, we look to the daughter's descendants, males or females, to the end of the line, who shall inherit everything. If his daughter left no offspring, the inheritance returns to his father. If his father is not living, we look to the father's offspring, being the brothers of the deceased. If he had a brother, or the descendant of a brother, he shall inherit everything; if not, we resort to the sister. If the deceased had a sister living, or her children, they shall inherit everything.— — In this manner the inheritance keeps ascending to the beginning of the generations. Accordingly, there is no man in Israel without an heir.

Chapter 2

The firstborn son receives a double share of his father's estate, as it is written: "To give him a double portion" (Deuteronomy 21:17).— —
The firstborn son who was born after his father's death does not receive a double share of his father's estate, as it is written: "When he wills his property to his sons … he must recognize as his firstborn the son of the unloved one" (16-17).— —





The firstborn does not receive a double share of his mother's estate. A firstborn and a plain brother, for example, share equally their mother's estate ; it makes no difference whether he is a firstborn [from the side of his father] with the privilege of a double share or a firstling [from the side of his mother].
A firstborn with the privilege of a double share is the first son of his father, as it is written: "Since he is the first fruit of his vigor" (17). We disregard the mother: even if she previously gave birth to several children, the firstborn from the side of his father inherits a double share.

Chapter 3

The firstborn does not receive a double share of the property that is due to his father posthumously, but only of property held in the possession of his father, as it is written: "Of whatever he happens to own" (17).— —
