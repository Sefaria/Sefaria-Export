Mishneh Torah, Other Sources of Defilement



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4








The bones of the swarming creature and its sinews and claws are pure. And the skin of the "choled" (rat, weasel, mole rat, or mongoose), of the mouse, of the "tzav" (toad or spiny-tailed lizard), and of the "tinshemeth" (mole rat, gecko, chameleon, or monitor) are pure even when still moist and not yet tanned nor trodden upon. However, the skin of the  "anakah" (gecko, hedgehog, or glass lizard), of the "koach" (chameleon), of the "letaah" (lizard), and of the "chomet" (snail) are like their flesh and a lentil-sized portion of it imparts impurity. And if they were tanned, or trodden upon till tanned, they are pure. And how much [must one tread on a skin ] to tan it? As much as it takes to walk four "millin" (~3.7 miles).
