Mishneh Torah, Those Who Defile Bed or Seat



Chapter 1

A <i>zav</i>, a <i>zavah</i>, a woman in the <i>nidah</i> state, and a woman after childbirth: all these four types of individuals are primary sources of impurity. They impart impurity to implements through touching them and impart impurity to other persons by touching them or carrying them. They impart impurity to the objects on which they lie, sit, or ride and cause them to also be considered as a primary source of impurity. And they impart impurity to the objects above them.
Whether a woman is a minor <i>zavah</i> or a major <i>zavah</i>, whether her bleeding is natural or comes as a result of an outside cause, and whether a <i>zav</i> experienced two <i>zav</i> emissions or three, her or his impurity is the same with regard to imparting impurity to others.
An infant girl one day old can contract <i>nidah</i> impurity. At ten days old, she can contract <i>zivah</i> impurity. A female of three years old can impart impurity to a man with whom she engages in relations, as will be explained.
A male minor can contract <i>zav</i> impurity at the age of one day. Converts, servants, and natural-born Jews are all the same with regard to contracting the impurity of <i>nidah</i> and <i>zivah</i>.
A person who was castrated or one who is born sexually impotent may contract impurity because of a <i>zav</i> discharge like other men.
A woman does not contract impurity because of a <i>zav</i> discharge, nor does a man contract impurity because of reddish discharge. Instead, only a woman contracts impurity because of reddish discharge, and a man, because of a <i>zav</i> discharge.
The stringencies applying to both males and females are applied to a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynus</i>. They contract impurity because of a <i>zav</i> discharge like a man and because of uterine bleeding like a female. Their impure status is a matter of question. Hence <i>terumah</i> or sacrificial food that they touch is not burnt, nor are they held liable for entering the Temple or partaking of sacrificial food in a state of impurity. If a <i>zav</i> discharge and uterine bleeding is secreted from such a person at the same time, <i>terumah</i> or sacrificial food that they touch is burnt. Nevertheless, they are not held liable for entering the Temple or partaking of sacrificial food in a state of impurity, as Numbers 5:3: "Male and female alike shall you send forth." Implied is that the impurity of a male must be definitive and the impurity of the female must be definitive.<br>Similarly, even if one touches a <i>zav</i> discharge and uterine bleeding from such a person simultaneously, he is not liable for entering the Temple in a state of impurity or for partaking of sacrificial foods in such a state. If a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynus</i> himself touched both a <i>zav</i> discharge and uterine bleeding that secreted from him, he is liable for entering the Temple in a state of impurity.
Even the slightest amount of the blood of <i>nidah</i>, the blood of <i>zivah</i>, or the blood of a woman who gave birth imparts impurity when touched or carried, as implied by Leviticus 15:33: "A woman who suffers because of her <i>nidah</i> state and one who experiences a flow...." According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught her secretion imparts impurity like she does.<br>We already explained with regard to the prohibition of a <i>nidah</i>, that there are five shades of impure bleeding experienced by a woman. If, however, she secretes a green blood-like discharge, it is pure. It does not resemble her saliva or other fluids that she discharges. The difference is that saliva collects and is discharged as drops, while this flows out and descends.
When a woman gives birth to a child through Cesarean section and uterine blood was released from her body together with the child, that blood is a primary source of impurity like the blood of <i>nidah</i>, childbirth, or <i>zivah</i>. The rationale is that the uterus is a place of impurity for all blood that emerges from it. The woman is ritually pure unless the blood flows out through her vaginal channel.
When the uterus of a woman is ripped away from its place and falls to the earth, the woman is impure until the evening. Similarly, if the uterus discharged two pearl-like drops of fluid, the woman is impure until the evening. She is, however, not a <i>nidah</i> unless she discharges one of the five types of blood that render her impure.
If a woman discharged one drop of a white fluid, she remains pure, for that certainly comes from outside the uterus.
The discharge of a <i>zav</i> is considered as a primary source of impurity like a <i>zav</i> himself, as implied by Leviticus 15:2: "His discharge is impure." Even the slightest amount of it imparts impurity when touched or when carried.<br>The first discharge of a <i>zav</i> does not impart impurity when carried. It is considered like semen. This applies whether it was discharged by an adult man or a male child. Similarly, any bed or seat on which such a person sat between the first discharge and the second discharge is pure, for one is not categorized as a <i>zav</i> until he experiences two discharges, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i>. If he experiences one discharge that lasts as long as two, only one who moves the last drop contracts impurity.
The first <i>zav</i> discharge of a person afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i> imparts impurity when touched or when carried, as implied by Numbers 5:2: "All those afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i>, every <i>zav</i>, and all those impure because of contact with a corpse." The verse establishes an association between a person afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> and <i>zav</i> in the complete sense of the term. Just as the discharge of a <i>zav</i> in the complete sense of the term imparts impurity when carried, so too, even the first discharge of a person afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> imparts impurity.
The saliva, semen, and urine of a <i>zav</i> - all three of them are primary source of impurity according to Scriptural Law. Even the smallest amount of each of them imparts impurity when touched or carried. These concepts are derived as follows. With regard to the saliva of a <i>zav</i>, Leviticus 15:8 states: "When a <i>zav</i> will spit upon a pure person,... he shall be impure until the evening." And it is impossible that the urine or the semen of a <i>zav</i> will not have some drops of his <i>zav</i> discharge.
The same laws that apply to a <i>zav</i> apply also to a <i>nidah</i>, a woman after childbirth, and a <i>zavah</i>. The saliva and the urine of each of them is a primary source of impurity like that of a <i>zav</i>. Similarly, whenever the term <i>zav</i> is used in these laws, the intent is either a <i>zav</i> or one of the other three.
There are nine types of fluids produced by a <i>zav</i>. Three of them are primary sources of impurity: his saliva, his semen, and his urine. Even the slightest amount of them imparts ritual impurity to a person or an implement, as we explained.<br>Three of them are considered as a derivative of impurity: tears, blood from a wound, and a woman's milk. Each one of these is considered as an impure fluid that does not impart impurity to humans, but does impart to implements according to Rabbinic Law, as will be explained. And there are three which are pure: sweat, puss, and feces. The laws that apply to these three fluids from a <i>zav</i> and the others like him are the same as when these fluids that are discharged by an ordinary person who is pure.<br>His phlegm, spittle, and mucus are considered like saliva in all contexts and they are included in the term saliva. When blood flows from the male organ or from the mouth, it is considered as the blood of a wound. If a person sucks a wound and spits out the blood, it imparts impurity like saliva does. For it is impossible that the blood that he sucks will not have drops of saliva.

Chapter 2

Uterine bleeding of a <i>nidah</i>, a <i>zavah</i>, or a woman in childbirth, imparts impurity whether it is moist or dry. Nevertheless, the discharge of a <i>zav</i>, his saliva, and his semen impart impurity only when moist. If, however, they are overly dry, they do not impart impurity.<br>To what extent must these substances be dry not to impart impurity? If they would return to their natural state after being soaked in lukewarm water for 24 hours, they impart impurity as if they were moist. If they would not return to their natural state after this, they are considered as having been dried out, even if the water was lukewarm at the outset even though it was not lukewarm at the end of the 24 hour period. All of these matters are part of the received tradition.
When flax was spun by a woman in the <i>nidah</i> state, one who moves it is pure. If it was moist, it imparts impurity because of the saliva from her mouth.
When a <i>zav</i> places his mouth on a cup and then changes his mind and decides not to drink from it, one who moves the cup remains pure. If the <i>zav</i> drank even the slightest amount from it, a person who moves it is impure because of the liquid from the mouth of the <i>zav</i>.
When a <i>zav</i> bites into a piece of bread or an onion, a person who moves them is considered pure. If he bites into a zucchini or a cucumber, one who moves them is impure, because of the liquid from the mouth of the <i>zav</i> which becomes mixed with them.
When the shells of beans and vetch were cut off by a gentile, one who moves them is impure, because gentiles are considered like <i>zavim</i> in all contexts, as will be explained. The ruling concerning shells in the marketplace depends on the majority.
When impure blood becomes mixed with water, the entire mixture is pure if there is no appearance of blood. If such blood becomes mixed with pure blood and/or with wine, we consider the wine and the blood as if they were water.<br>Similar laws apply if impure saliva becomes mixed with water. If the saliva remains a viscous entity as is its natural state, it is impure. If it is reduced to nothing in the water and it is no longer visible as a distinct entity, everything is pure. If it becomes mixed with other saliva, we consider the pure saliva as if it was water.<br>Similarly, when the urine of such an impure person becomes mixed with water, if it is no longer visible as a distinct entity, the entire mixture is pure. If not, it is impure. If it is mixed with wine or pure urine, we consider the wine or the pure urine as if it was water.<br>If the urine of a Jew becomes mixed with the urine of a gentile, the ruling is determined by the majority. What is implied? When there is a urinal into which both gentiles and Jews would urinate, if the majority of those who use the urinal are gentiles, all its contents are impure. If the majority are Jewish, all its contents are pure. If equal numbers use it, all its contents are impure. Similarly, if the urine of one gentile is mixed with the urine of one Jew, the ruling is determined by the majority.
Urine can be borrowed from Jews in all situations. We do not suspect that it is from a <i>nidah</i>, for Jewish women were not suspect to save their urine when in the <i>nidah</i> state.
When a urinal into which a <i>zav</i> or a <i>zavah</i> would urinate was washed once or twice, the fluid with which it was washed is deemed impure. After the third washing, whether it was washed with water or other urine, the fluid is pure, because it can be assumed that none of the impure urine remained.
When at the conclusion of the seven spotless days she is required to count, a <i>zavah</i> felt that she had already begun to urinate, but nevertheless contained herself, descended to a <i>mikveh</i> immersed herself, and only urinated after the immersion, the status of the urine is in doubt. It is unresolved whether we consider the urine as if it had emerged originally while she was a <i>zavah</i> or after it actually emerged when she is pure. Similarly, if a gentile woman who had already begun to urinate, but nevertheless contained herself, converted, immersed herself, and only urinated after the immersion, the status of the urine is in doubt. It is unresolved whether we consider the urine as if it had emerged originally and it is considered as the urine of a gentile woman or after it actually emerged, and is considered as the urine of a pure Jewish women.
Canaanite maidservants and servants contract impurity due to <i>zivah, nidah</i>, and childbirth, like Jews do. Gentiles, by contrast, do not contract impurity not through <i>zivah,</i> <i>nidah</i>, or childbirth according to Scriptural Law, as can be inferred from Leviticus 15:2 which states: "Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: 'A man should he experience a discharge.'" Implied is that the children of Israel contract impurity through <i>zivah</i>, but not the gentiles.<br>Our Sages, however, decreed that all gentiles impart impurity like <i>zavim</i> in all contexts, both males and females, provided the male is nine years old or more and the female is three years old or more. They did not decree that children under these ages contract impurity, for the primary reason for the decree is that a Jewish child will not be involved in sodomy with gentiles and there is no concept of sexual intimacy for children of younger ages.<br>When this decree was instituted, they did not decree against the semen of a gentile. Instead, the semen of a gentile is pure, as is its status according to Scriptural Law. Why was a decree not instituted to render it impure? To make it known that the gentiles' impurity is of Rabbinic origin. For everyone knows that if their status as <i>zavim</i> was Scriptural in origin, their semen would be impure like the semen of a <i>zav</i>. And since they know a gentile's impurity is of Rabbinic origin, they will not burn <i>terumah</i> and sacrificial food to which they imparted impurity.<br>Thus we can infer that all of the following: a gentile male's <i>zav</i> discharge, a gentile woman's <i>nidah</i> blood, her <i>zivah</i> blood, and the blood that comes at childbirth, a gentile man and a gentile woman, even though they are pure from any uterine bleeding and discharges, the saliva of gentiles, their urine, the couches on which they lie, the saddles on which they ride, and one who has relations with a gentile woman are all primary sources of impurity according to Rabbinic Law.<br>Therefore, one is not liable for entering the Temple or partaking of sacrificial food if one contracted impurity from one of these sources, nor is <i>terumah</i> burnt if it contracted impurity from such a source. All of them do, however, impart impurity to people and implements through physical contact and impart impurity to a person when carried as a <i>zav</i> does in all contexts. It is just that the impurity is of Rabbinic origin, as stated above.<br>Blood from a gentile woman's uterine bleeding is considered as her saliva and her urine and it imparts impurity when moist, but not when dry.

Chapter 3

A person who has intimate relations with a <i>nidah</i> is impure like she is. He is one of the primary sources of impurity according to Scriptural Law. He imparts impurity to <i>keilim</i> by touching them and imparts impurity to people through carrying, touching, and moving, and he imparts impurity to the surface on which he lies or rides like a <i>nidah</i> does.
The status of the impurity imparted by a man who was intimate with a <i>nidah</i> to a surface on which one lies or rides is not the same as that imparted by a <i>nidah</i> to a surface on which one lies or rides. For a surface on which one lies or rides that was stepped on by a <i>nidah</i> is a primary source of ritual impurity. In contrast, a surface on which one lies or rides that was stepped on by a man who was intimate with a <i>nidah</i> is a derivative of ritual impurity like <i>keilim</i> that he touched which do not impart impurity to other people or to other <i>keilim</i>, only to foods and liquids.<br>Why is the impurity that he imparts of a lesser status than the impurity that she imparts? Because with regard to a man who was intimate with a <i>nidah</i>, Leviticus 15:24 states: "Her <i>nidah</i> impurity will be imparted to him and he will be impure for seven days" and continues: "Any surface on which he lies shall be impure." Now, since it is stated: "Her <i>nidah</i> impurity will be imparted to him," would it not be obvious that he imparts impurity to a surface on which one lies? Why then was it stated? According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that the Torah removed it from the severe category of impurity in which it imparts impurity to people and <i>keilim</i> and placed it in a lesser category in which a surface on which he lies is a derivative and does not impart impurity to people and <i>keilim</i>, only to foods and liquids like other derivatives of impurity.
A man contracts the impurity of one who is intimate with a <i>nidah</i> or a <i>zavah</i> when he is intimate with such a woman or if he is intimate with a woman who is watching one day because of a day of impurity, or a woman after childbirth, whether the two engaged in vaginal or anal intercourse, whether he inserted only the corona or inserted the entire male organ, and whether it was an adult male who was intimate with a minor or a male minor who was intimate with an adult woman.<br>When does the above apply? When the male involved is at least nine years old and the woman involved at least three years old. If, however, either is younger than this, the male does not contract the impurity of one who has relations with a <i>nidah</i>, only that of one who touches a woman in the <i>nidah</i> state. His impurity is thus considered a derivative; he is not a primary source. Similarly, one who sodomizes a <i>zav</i> is considered as one who touches a <i>zav</i>. Also, the same laws that apply to one who touches a <i>zav</i> apply to a woman who is intimate with such a person.
All of the following - <i>nidah</i>, a <i>zavah</i>, a woman who is watching one day because of a day of impurity, or a woman after childbirth even if she did not experience uterine bleeding - contract impurity retroactively for a twenty-four hour period or until the last vaginal inspection the woman made. This is referred to as the twenty-four period of a <i>nidah</i>.<br>What is implied? A woman who did not have a fixed time when she would menstruate was pure. She made a vaginal inspection in the morning and found that she was pure. At noon, she made another vaginal inspection and discovered blood. Accordingly, any ritually pure entities that she touched between the first inspection and the second inspection are impure retroactively. Similarly, if she made a vaginal inspection one day and found herself pure and made another inspection two or three days afterwards and discovered uterine bleeding, all of the articles she touched within twenty-four hours before the inspection during which she discovered the bleeding are considered as impure retroactively.<br>A checking cloth used after intimacy is considered as a vaginal inspection, but one used before intimacy is not, because she does not make a thorough inspection with it.
A woman who has a fixed time when she menstruates and discovers uterine bleeding at that time is impure only from that time onward. She is not impure retroactively. If the fixed time when she menstruates arrives and she did not inspect herself and then inspected herself after the passage of several days and discovered uterine bleeding, she is considered as impure retroactively and is assumed to be a <i>nidah</i> from the fixed time that she usually menstruates. This is the impurity associated with the fixed time for menstruation referred to universally.<br>If the woman discovered that she was pure when she inspected herself after her fixed time for menstruation, she is pure.
Whenever a woman has a fixed time during which she menstruates, she will also experience physical symptoms at the onset of menstruation, e.g., she will yawn, sneeze, feel heaviness and strain at the opening to her stomach and lower body, become overcome by trembling, or feel that her head and limbs are heavy, or the like.<br>There are women whose pattern is to experience bleeding immediately after one of these physical symptoms begins. And there are other women who will wait, and continue experiencing these symptoms for an hour or two and experience bleeding only at the end of the expected time. When a woman's pattern is to experience bleeding at the beginning of the expected time, any pure articles she touches during the expected time are impure. If her pattern is to experience bleeding at the end of the expected time, any pure articles she touches during the expected time are pure. She is only concerned about the articles she touched from the time she is accustomed to experience bleeding until she actually discovers bleeding.
When a woman discovers a bloodstain, she is retroactively impure until the time she made an inspection. Similarly, a garment on which a stain was discovered is retroactively impure.<br>Until when? Until such a time concerning which the woman says: "I checked this garment and it did not have a bloodstain." Even if she washed the garment, but did not inspect it, it is impure retroactively from before she washed it until the time when it was inspected. Even if a moist stain was found, she is considered impure retroactively until the time she made an inspection. The rationale is that there is reason to say that it was there previously and now water fell upon it and caused it to become moist.
A bloodstain discovered by any of the women who are impure only from the time they discover uterine bleeding onward is equivalent to the discovery of uterine bleeding and does not cause her to contract impurity retroactively.<br>Any of the women who contract impurity retroactively, whether they discovered uterine bleeding or a bloodstain, also impart impurity retroactively to surfaces upon which one lies or rides, causing them to impart impurity to a person or to garments. Similarly, their saliva and urine impart impurity retroactively. They even impart impurity retroactively to an earthenware container that is sealed closed.<br>They do not, however, impart the severe impurity associated with intimacy with a <i>nidah</i> to a man who is intimate with them. He is considered only as if he touched them. Whenever a woman discovers a bloodstain, a man who is intimate with her after she discovered the stain is considered impure as one who was intimate with a <i>nidah</i>.
When a fetus sticks out his hand from the womb of a pregnant woman, his mother contracts the impurity of a woman who gave birth.<br>The impurity of a woman whose fetus sticks out its hand, the impurity imposed retroactively for 24 hours or until the previous inspection that was mentioned, the impurity associated with the fixed time when a woman usually menstruates, and the ritual impurity associated with bloodstains are all Rabbinic decrees and were instituted because of a doubt. Therefore <i>terumah</i> and sacrificial foods are not burnt because of them. Instead, the ruling concerning them is held in abeyance. Similarly, the ruling concerning ordinary foods that were treated with the sanctity associated with sacrificial foods that contracted impurity from one of these sources is held in abeyance. Nevertheless, ordinary food that is treated with the sanctity associated with <i>terumah</i> and ordinary food from which <i>challah</i> has not yet been separated do not contract impurity from any of these sources, for they are Rabbinic decrees.<br>Thus one can conclude that: all of these women mentioned previously in this halachah, an object on which one lies or rides to which they imparted impurity, their saliva, their urine, one who is intimate with a woman who discovered a bloodstain after the bloodstain was discovered, one who was intimate with a woman after the fetus stuck out a limb and then returned it, are all primary sources of impurity according to Rabbinic decree.

Chapter 4

There are four women who are impure only from the time they discover uterine bleeding onward. They do not impart impurity retroactively. They are: a woman who is pregnant, one who is nursing, a maiden, or one who is elderly.<br>What is meant by a pregnant woman? A woman whose pregnancy has become obvious. If she was considered as pregnant and then experienced uterine bleeding and discharged a sack full of air or an entity that is not considered as a fetus, her status continues without and she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward. If she experienced uterine bleeding and directly afterwards, her pregnancy became obvious, she becomes impure retroactively like other women.<br>What is meant by a woman who is nursing? A woman within 24 months of childbirth, even if her child died within this time, she weaned him, or gave him to a nursemaid, she is impure only from the time bleeding is discovered. After 24 months, even if she continues to nurse, she becomes impure retroactively like other women.<br>What is meant by the term "a maiden"? A girl who has never menstruated, i.e., the intent is a maiden with regard to menstruation and not a maiden with regard to hymeneal bleeding. What is implied? Even if she was married and experienced uterine bleeding because of marriage or she gave birth and experienced uterine bleeding because of birth, she is still considered as a maiden with regard to the ruling that she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward.<br>What is meant by the term "elderly woman"? A woman who did not menstruate for three months as she approached advanced age. When is she considered elderly? When she is called an old woman by others in her presence and she does not protest. If three 30-day intervals pass and then she menstruates, another three 30-day intervals or more or less pass, and she menstruates, she is considered like other women and imparts impurity retroactively.
When a girl menstruates for the first time, even if her blood is flowing or dripping for all seven days, it is considered as if she experienced bleeding once. If she experienced bleeding, it stopped and then started again, it is considered as if she experienced bleeding twice.
When a young girl who had not yet reached the age when she is expected to menstruate experiences uterine bleeding for the first and second times, she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward. If she experiences bleeding a third time, she imparts impurity retroactively. If three months then pass without her menstruating and then she menstruates, she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward. If three other months then pass without her menstruating and then she menstruates, she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward. If three other months then pass without her menstruating and then she menstruates, she is impure retroactively.
When a young girl reaches the age when she can be expected to menstruate and experiences uterine bleeding for the first time, she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward. From the second occasion onward, she imparts impurity retroactively. If three months then pass without her menstruating and then she menstruates, she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward. If three other months then pass without her menstruating and then she menstruates, she is impure retroactively.
If a pregnant woman, one who is nursing or elderly, or a girl who has never menstruated, but has reached the age when that is likely experiences uterine bleeding once, she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward. If such a woman experiences bleeding a second time, she imparts impurity retroactively like all other women, as explained. If, however, the first time she experienced bleeding, it came because of external factors, she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward, even if she experiences bleeding a second time.
When a pregnant or nursing woman experienced uterine bleeding and then a three month interval passed before she experienced bleeding again, she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward. If another three months pass without her menstruating and then she experiences uterine bleeding again, i.e., a third experience of bleeding when counting the first, she imparts impurity retroactively.<br>When a woman experiences uterine bleeding within 24 hours of experiencing "the bleeding of purity," she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward.<br>Any woman about whom it is said, "she is impure only from the time she discovers uterine bleeding onward," must continuously inspect herself even though she does not impart impurity retroactively. All women who inspect themselves frequently are praiseworthy, with the exception of a woman in the <i>nidah</i> state and a woman who is granted "the bleeding of purity," for whom the inspections are of no consequence whatsoever.
The Sages ordained that Jewish women should inspect themselves every day in the morning because of the pure articles that they touched the previous evening and in the evening, because of the pure articles they touched in the morning. Whenever a woman partakes of <i>terumah</i>, she should inspect herself when she partakes of the <i>terumah</i>.<br>Every woman should inspect herself before she is intimate with her husband, because she also inspects herself for the sake of pure articles. If, however, she does not have to do with pure articles, she need not inspect herself for the sake of intimacy with her husband. For every woman who has a fixed time when she is expected to menstruate can operate on the presumption that at other times, she is pure with regard to relations with her husband, as we explained with regard to the laws of <i>nidah</i>.
Jewish young girls who have not reached puberty may operate under the assumption that they are pure. It is not necessary that women inspect them. Once they reach puberty, they must undergo an inspection and they should be inspected by mature women.
When a woman who is a deafmute, an intellectually or emotionally compromised woman, or one who lost control of her mental faculties due to sickness has an intellectually capable woman who cares for her, they may partake of <i>terumah</i>.
Any garments stained with blood coming from Jewish homes are assumed to be impure. Those coming from gentile homes are considered to be pure. Those found in Jewish cities are considered to be pure. For Jews are not suspected of casting away their bloodstained garments. Instead, they are hidden away.<br>Accordingly, any bloodstained garments that are discovered are considered as pure with the exception of those in holes and around an impure room. In all instances, the impurity is only a decree, imposed because of doubt, as we explained.
Whenever a bloodstained garment is found, it should be treated with seven detergent agents. Afterwards, whether or not the stain is purged, the garment is immersed in a <i>mikveh</i> and then is deemed pure.<br>The rationale is that if it is not purged at all, it was a tint. If it was purged or its color faded, it is assumed to be a bloodstain. Since it was treated with these seven detergents, the blood has already been nullified even though a trace of it is still apparent. Even when a stain definitely came from <i>nidah</i> bleeding, once it was treated with these seven detergent agents, the blood is considered as nullified. The garment may be immersed and then used in connection with ritually pure entities.
When a bloodstain on a garment is no longer detectable, the entire garment should be treated with the seven detergent agents and then immersed.<br>The following laws apply when semen is no longer detectable on a garment: If it the garment was new, it should be checked with a needle. If the garment was worn, it should be inspected in the sun.
The following laws apply when a garment that was stained was immersed in the <i>mikveh</i> and then brought into contact with ritually pure articles. If afterwards it was treated with the seven detergent agents and was not purged, it is a tint. The ritually pure articles with which it came into contact remain ritually pure and there is no need to immerse it again. If the stain was purged or faded, it is a bloodstain. The pure articles are impure, because the person was concerned with the stain as evidenced by his removal of it. The garment must be immersed a second time to purify it.
When a stain was treated with six of the seven detergent agents and it was not purged and then it was treated with soap and it was purged, the pure articles with which it came into contact contract impurity. Although soap removes tints as well, since the garment was not treated with all seven detergent agents, it is presumed that it was a bloodstain and that, had the seventh agent been used, it would have been purged.<br>If one treated a stained garment with all seven detergent agents and the stain was not purged and then treated it with them again and it was purged, but a trace remained, all of the pure articles with which it came into contact between the first washing and the second washing are pure. All of the pure articles with which it came into contact after the second washing are impure. The rationale is that since he showed his intent that he objects to any trace of the stain and desires to remove all remnants of it, the garment is impure until all remnants are nullified and it is immersed in a <i>mikveh</i>.<br>In <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>, we already explained the seven detergent agents with which a stain is treated and how it is treated with them.
When a woman dies and afterwards menstrual blood flows from her body, it imparts impurity to garments it stains. The rationale is that the uterus is an impure place. Hence, even though the blood flowed out after she died and the laws of <i>nidah</i> no longer apply, since it emerged from an impure place, it imparts <i>nidah</i> impurity to garments it stains. If it comprises a <i>revi'it</i>, it imparts impurity to everything under the same shelter and it imparts impurity to garments it stains.

Chapter 5

A <i>zav</i>, a <i>zavah</i>, a <i>nidah</i>, and a woman after childbirth remain impure and impart impurity to humans, articles, and articles on which one sits or lies until they immerse. Even if they remained several years without an impure emission, but did not immerse, they remain impure.
When a woman after childbirth does not immerse after the seven days of impurity obligated after the birth of a male child and the fourteen days obligated after the birth of a female child, any blood that will be discharged afterwards even though it is discharged during her days of purity, is like the blood of a <i>nidah</i> and imparts impurity whether it is moist or dry. Scripture did not make the matter dependent on days alone, but on days and immersion.
When a woman who gave birth descended to immerse herself to make the transition from impurity to purity and she discharged blood as she was descending and emerged from the inner space of her uterus, it is impure. Immersion has no effect on this blood even though it is still within her body. If she discharges it as she ascends from immersion in the <i>mikveh</i>, it is pure. For it is "pure blood" and the immersion is effective with regard to all the blood that is within her body and causes it to be considered as "pure blood."
When a woman after childbirth immersed after the seven impure days that follow the birth of a male, after the fourteen impure days that follow the birth of a female, or after counting seven spotless days if she gave birth in a state of <i>zivah</i>, throughout her days of purity, she is considered as an impure person who immersed but nightfall has not arrived. She is not required to undergo another immersion at the conclusion of her days of purity. Instead, when those days are completed, she is like a person who immersed in the <i>mikveh</i> and the day passed.<br>In which contexts is she considered as a person who has immersed that day? With regard to <i>terumah</i> and the second tithe. But with regard to sacrificial food, she is like a person who is a derivative of impurity who did not immerse. She is like a person who touched a <i>nidah</i> or a person who is impure due to contact with a corpse who has not yet immersed, or the like. Thus it can be concluded that a woman in the midst of her days of purity may partake of the second tithe and disqualifies <i>terumah</i> like a person who has immersed that day does, as will be explained.<br>If some of her saliva or her pure blood fell on a loaf of bread that was <i>terumah</i>, the loaf remains pure. For fluids coming from a person who immersed that day are pure, as will be explained. Such fluids do, however, impart impurity to sacrificial foods as a derivative of impurity would until her days of purity are completed and she is pure in all respects. It appears to me that since she imparts impurity to sacrificial foods during these days of purity, she must immerse herself at the end of her days of purity and only then may she touch sacrificial food. This applies even though she does not require another immersion to partake of <i>terumah</i>.
When a woman who gave birth and who is afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i> immersed herself after the seven days of impurity required after giving birth to a male or the fourteen days required after a female, her "pure blood" is impure like her saliva and her urine. They are all considered as impure fluids, for all fluids that become impure that are discharged from impure people are like liquids that they touch with the exception of a <i>zav</i> and the like. For the three fluids they discharge are sources of ritual impurity, as we explained.
When a minor <i>zavah</i> immerses on the day she is watching after sunrise, the status of the articles she touches and a man with whom she is intimate is indefinite, as we explained with regard to the prohibitions of <i>nidah</i>. If she completes the day without experiencing further uterine bleeding, anything she touches is pure and one who is intimate with her is pure and he is exempt. If she experiences uterine bleeding after she immerses, any pure objects that she touched are impure, the laws concerning the impurity imparted by a <i>zav</i> to an article on which one lies or rides apply and a man who is intimate with her is liable for a sin-offering.<br>If she immersed herself before dawn during the night before the day on which she should be cautious, it is as if she never immersed and the laws concerning the impurity imparted by a <i>zav</i> to an article on which one lies or rides apply.
When a woman experiences uterine bleeding on the eleventh day of <i>zivah</i>. and immersed herself in the evening, on the night of the twelfth, the laws concerning the impurity imparted by a <i>zav</i> to an article on which one lies or rides apply even though she is not fit to become a major <i>zavah</i>, as we explained with regard to the prohibitions of <i>nidah</i>.
If she immersed on the twelfth day after sunrise, although she is forbidden to engage in intimacy until the evening, if she was intimate, the man with whom she was intimate is pure and articles on which one lies or rides that she touches are pure even if she experiences uterine bleeding on the twelfth day after immersion. The rationale is that this day is the beginning of the days of <i>nidah</i>, as we explained with regard to the prohibitions of <i>nidah</i>. The twelfth day is never joined to the eleventh day. Therefore even if she experiences bleeding on the eleventh day, she need not be cautious regarding the twelfth day. Instead, she may immerse herself and touch articles that are ritually pure.<br>If, by contrast, she experiences uterine bleeding on the tenth day, she should immerse herself on the eleventh day and be cautious with regard to it. For if she experiences uterine bleeding after immersing herself all the pure articles she touches become impure. Similarly, a man with whom she engages in relations becomes impure, even though she will never become a major <i>zavah</i> as a result of this bleeding, as we explained with regard to the prohibitions of <i>nidah</i>.
When a <i>zav</i> and a major <i>zavah</i> immerse on their seventh spotless day as we explained, they should not touch articles that are ritually pure until the evening, lest they experience an impure discharge that day. In such an instance, that would disqualify the seven days which were counted and retroactively, the pure articles would become impure. Although the laws concerning the impurity imparted by a <i>zav</i> to an article on which one lies or rides apply retroactively, they do not retroactively impart impurity to an earthenware utensil that they moved after they immersed even though they experienced an impure discharge after immersing and disqualified all the days that they had counted. Nevertheless, any earthenware utensil that they touched until they experienced the discharge is pure.

Chapter 6

We have already explained that a <i>zav</i> and the others in that category impart impurity to an article on which one lies, sits, or rides.<br>An article on which one lies and one on which he sits are essentially the same. Why then did the Torah mention them separately? To teach that although a seat is fit for sitting and a couch is fit for lying, whether one sits on a couch or lies on a seat, he causes it to become impure. Therefore I will mention a surface on which one lies alone and it should be understood that the same applies to a surface on which one sits.<br>What is meant by a surface on which one rides? The surface on which one sits when riding, e.g., a donkey's packsaddle or a horse's saddlecloth.
Any article on which one lies or rides to which a <i>zav</i> or the like imparted impurity becomes a primary source of impurity according to Scriptural Law. It imparts impurity to a person and <i>keilim</i> when touching them and to a person when being carried by them.<br>What is the difference between the laws pertaining to an article on which one lies and one on which one rides? With regard to touching an article on which one lies, if a person touches clothes and other <i>keilim</i> while he is still touching the impure article, he imparts impurity to them and makes them a primary derivative of impurity. One who touches an article on which one rides, by contrast, does not impart impurity to clothes and <i>keilim</i> even when he touches them while touching the impure article. Nevertheless, one who carries either an article on which one lies or rides imparts impurity to clothes and other <i>keilim</i> until he severs contact with the source of his impurity.<br>What is the source that teaches that a distinction is made between touching and carrying with regard to the impurity of an object on which one rides and no such distinction is made with regard to the impurity of an object on which one lies? With regard to an object on which one lies, Leviticus 15:5 states: "A man who touches his couch.... shall launder his clothes," while with regard to an object on which one rides, <i>ibid.</i>: 9-10 states: "Any object on which he will ride... anyone who touches anything that will be beneath him will be impure until the evening." In the latter instance, it is not said that he must launder his garments. This teaches that he does not impart impurity to his garments when touching the source of impurity. And it is written <i>ibid.</i>: "One who carries them shall launder his garments." This applies equally to one who carries an article on which one rides and an article on which one lies.<br>Thus it can be concluded that a <i>zav</i>, a <i>zavah</i>, a <i>nidah</i>, and a woman after childbirth, the articles on which they lie, their saliva, their urine, the blood of a <i>nidah</i>, a <i>zavah</i>, and a woman after childbirth, and the discharge of a <i>zav</i> are all primary sources of impurity. If a person touches any of these or carries them, he imparts impurity to his clothes and other <i>keilim</i> while he is touching them or carrying them. He does not, however, impart impurity to another person or to an earthenware container. For any entity that imparts impurity to a human imparts impurity to an earthenware container and any entity that does not impart impurity to a human does not impart impurity to an earthenware container.<br>Thus it can be concluded that whenever it is said about an impure person: "He shall launder his clothes," he imparts impurity to clothes that he touches as long as he does not separate from the entity imparting impurity to him. He makes those garments primary derivatives of impurity, like he is. He imparts impurity to other <i>keilim</i> like garments with the exception of earthenware containers. For he does not impart impurity to another person or to earthenware containers even though he has not separated from the entity imparting impurity to him.<br>Whenever, by contrast, Scripture does not say about an impure person: "He shall launder his clothes," his status is the same before he separates from the entity imparting impurity to him as it is afterwards. He does not impart impurity to garments, because he is merely a derivative of impurity. Needless to say, he does not impart impurity to another person or to earthenware containers. Therefore a person who touches an article on which a <i>zav</i> rode does not impart impurity to garments when touching it. One who carries such an article, by contrast, imparts impurity when carrying it, as we explained.
All <i>keilim</i> that rest above a <i>zav</i> or the like are called <i>madaf</i>. They are considered as articles that he touches and they do not impart impurity to another person or to an earthenware container. They do, however, impart impurity to food or liquids like other derivatives of impurity. The impurity of <i>madaf</i> is a Rabbinic decree.
When a <i>zav</i>, a <i>zavah</i>, a <i>nidah</i>, a woman after childbirth, or a person afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i> die, they impart impurity to an object on which they lied or rode after their death just as they would during their lifetime until their flesh decomposes. This is a Rabbinic safeguard, decreed lest one of these individuals lose consciousness and it appear that they died, but they did not actually die. Thus a surface on which one of these lie or ride after death is a primary source of impurity by Rabbinic decree. When, by contrast, a gentile dies, a surface on which he lies after death is not considered as a source of impurity, for even when he is alive, he imparts impurity only due to Rabbinic decree, as we explained.
Whenever you hear the terms "the impurity of an object upon which one lies or rides," the intent is not necessarily that the impure person touch the object on which one lies or rides while resting on them. Instead, even if there are large stones above the entity made to lie or ride on and the <i>zav</i> rested on the stones from above, the surface on which one lies or rides becomes a primary source of impurity. Even when there are 1000 surfaces on which a person lies or rides one on top of another and a stone is on the uppermost and a person who imparts impurity to an object on which he or she lies or sits on top of the stone, everything becomes impure. Both the article on which one lies that touches the earth and the uppermost one become primary sources of impurity when they are affected by the <i>zav's</i> lying down.<br>Similarly, if one of the individuals who impart impurity to an object on which he or she lies or sits was below, there was a stone on top of him, and food, liquids, <i>keilim</i>, and/or a person on the stone, one on top of the other, they are all impure and are considered as primary derivatives of impurity. Whether a <i>k'li</i>, food, a liquid, or a person touches a <i>zav</i> or the <i>k'li</i>, food, liquid, or person was on a stone that was above the <i>zav</i>, there is no difference. In both instances everything is considered as a derivative of impurity and does not impart impurity to a person or to <i>keilim</i>. The only exception is a person who is above a <i>zav</i> who is still in contact with the <i>zav</i> who imparted impurity to him. He imparts impurity to other <i>keilim</i>, as we explained.
When food, liquids, and <i>keilim</i> that are not made to lie, sit, or ride upon were below other articles and a <i>zav</i> or the like sat above them without touching them, they are all pure. If, however, a person was below and a <i>zav</i> was above, he is impure even if he does not touch him, because he is carrying the <i>zav</i>, like anyone who carries an article that imparts impurity when carried. The one carrying it becomes a primary derivative of impurity.<br>Thus one can conclude that anything that is above a <i>zav</i> is impure, whether a person, articles on which one lies, sits, or rides, all other <i>keilim</i>, food, and liquids. Everything is a primary derivative of impurity. Everything that is below a <i>zav</i> and does not touch him is pure except a person or an article made to lie, sit, or ride upon. There is a difference between them. The person is a derivative of impurity and the article made to lie, sit, or ride upon is a primary sources of impurity, as we explained.

Chapter 7

A <i>zav</i> imparts impurity to articles on which one lies, sits, or rides in five ways: by standing above them, sitting above them, lying above them, hanging from them, or leaning on them.<br>What is implied? When there is an article on which one lies, sits, or rides - even if it is under a stone - if one of the persons who imparts impurity to articles on which one lies stands, sits, lies on the stone, hangs from it, or leans on it, since he was in someway supported by the article, it becomes a primary source of impurity. Any of these five acts is included in the term <i>midras</i> whenever it is used.
Similarly, an object on which one lies and rides imparts impurity to a person in seven ways, in the five listed in the previous halachah, by touching and by carrying.<br>What is implied? When a <i>zav</i> was supported by an article on which one lies or rides and thus imparted impurity to it, if a person touches or carries that article, he contracts impurity. Similarly, one contracts impurity if one sits on it, stands on it, lies on it, hangs from it, or leans on it, even if there is a stone separating between the person who was pure and the impure support, as Leviticus 15:6 states: "One who sits on the article on which the <i>zav</i> had sat." According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that the place on which a <i>zav</i> sits and imparts impurity causes a person who is pure who sits there to contract impurity. Now just as a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity to an object on which one rides or sits that is beneath a stone, so too, a pure person can contract impurity from an object on which one rides or sits that is beneath a stone, even though the <i>zav</i> is not on the object on which one sits. A person who contracts impurity who is above the <i>midras</i> imparts impurity to his garments as long as he does not separate from the article that imparted impurity to him, as we explained.
A <i>zav</i> does not impart impurity to an object upon which one lies until the majority of his body is supported by the object upon which one lies, sits, or rides. Similarly, when a pure person is supported by a <i>midras</i> made impure by a <i>zav</i>, he does not contract impurity because of the <i>midras</i> until the majority of his body is supported by it. If, however, only the lesser portion of his body is supported by it, since he did not touch it, he remains pure.<br>What is implied? If the lesser portion of an impure person's body is on a surface on which one lies and the lesser portion of the pure person's body is on that same surface, the surface is pure and the pure person whose body was supported in part by it is pure. When the majority of the impure person's body was supported by the lesser portion of the surface on which one lies or rides, that surface becomes impure in its entirety. Similarly, if the majority of a pure person's body was supported by the lesser portion of an impure <i>midras</i>, he becomes impure even though he was supported only by the lesser portion of the object on which one sits.
When a <i>zav</i> was sprawled over five benches that are positioned lengthwise, they are all impure, because each one of them supported the majority of his body. If they were positioned widthwise, they are pure, because the majority of his body was not supported by any of them. If he slept upon the benches, they are all impure, because maybe he turned over and each one supported the majority of his body at a given time.<br>If he was sprawled over six supports, each of his two hands on one, each of his two feet on one, his head on one and his trunk on one, the only one which is impure as a surface on which one lies is the one under his trunk, because the majority of his body is supported by it.<br>If he is standing on two supports, one foot on one and the other on the second, they are both impure.
If a person was sitting on a bed and there were four surfaces, each one under one of the four legs of the bed, they are all impure. The rationale is that the bed cannot stand merely on three.
If a <i>zav</i> was riding on an animal and there were four surfaces, one under each of the animal's four feet, they are all pure. The rationale is that the animal can stand on three feet. Thus the fourth is merely an assist and an assist is not significant. Thus each of the legs is fit to be considered as merely an assist. Since we do not know which forefoot or hindfoot the animal was not using for support, none of them are considered as impure. Hence they all remain pure.<br>Therefore if one support was under the two forefeet of the animal, its two hindfeet, or a forefoot and a hindfoot, the support is impure, for this support definitely served as a base for the <i>zav</i>, for an animal cannot stand on only two feet.
When an impure person sat on the beam in an olive press, all of the <i>keilim</i> in the net are impure, for they are pressed directly under the beam. When, by contrast, a person sits on a launderer's press, the garments under the board in the press are pure. The press rests on its own feet and not on the garments that are under it. Thus if a person would desire to insert a knife or the like between the garments that are under the press and the press, he would be able to, even though the press is tied close.
When a <i>zav</i> used for support an implement that was not made for one to lie, sit, or ride on, since he did not touch it, it is pure even though it could have been used to lie on. The rationale is that we tell him: "Stand up and let us perform our work with this article."<br>What is implied? If one turned over a measuring container for grain or a kneading trough and sat on it, or sat on a curtain or the sail of a ship, they are pure, as implied by Leviticus 15:4 which states "that he sits upon," indicating an article set aside for sitting and not one concerning which would be said: "Stand up and let us perform our work," for this article was not made for sitting.<br>If the article was used to be sat upon together with the purpose it was made, it can contract impurity as a <i>midras</i>, for example, a veil, a cloak, an outer garment, a drinking pouch, and a carrying bag. Even though none of these entities were made to lie upon, if such an article could be used to lie upon together with the purpose for which it was made. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. In <i>Hilchot Keilim</i>, I will explain which <i>keilim</i> can contract impurity through <i>midras</i> and which do not, which <i>keilim</i> are fit for sitting, which are fit for lying, and which are fit for riding.

Chapter 8

At the beginning of this text, we explained that with regard to other types of impurity, if a person moves a source of impurity which imparts impurity when carried, he contracts impurity. If, however, the source of impurity caused a person to move, he does not contract impurity.
None of the sources of impurity imparts impurity when moving a pure person or a pure <i>k'li</i> except a <i>zav</i> and the like. This is the extra dimension of impurity - that if a <i>zav</i> moves something that is pure, that entity contracts impurity - that exists with regard to a <i>zav</i> that has no comparison in the entire Torah.<br>What is implied? A beam was positioned on top of a fence and a pure person or pure <i>keilim</i>, even earthenware containers, were on one side and a <i>zav</i> moved the other side. Since the person or the <i>keilim</i> were moved by the <i>zav</i>, it is as if he touched them. They become impure and are considered as a primary derivative of impurity according to Scriptural Law. Needless to say, the person or the <i>keilim</i> become impure if the <i>zav</i> lifted them up. All the laws that apply to a <i>zav</i> also apply to a <i>zavah</i>, a <i>nidah</i>, and a woman after childbirth.<br>Thus it can be concluded that when a pure person moves a <i>zav</i>, he is impure because it is as if he carried a <i>zav</i>. And when a <i>zav</i> moves a pure entity, whether a person or a <i>k'li</i>, even an earthenware container, that entity is impure, because having the <i>zav</i> move other entities is equivalent to him touching them.
There is a more stringent dimension to the impurity imparted by a <i>zav</i> moving an entity than to the impurity he imparts by touching it. If a <i>zav</i> touches an earthenware container that is firmly sealed close, it is pure. If, however, the <i>zav</i> moves the article, it becomes impure.<br>A similar stringency applies to an earthenware container that is hollow like a ball for which an opening was not made, e.g., a double frying pan. If it was moved by a <i>zav</i>, it is impure, even though it would be considered pure were it to have been located in a tent containing a human corpse, for it is like an earthenware container that is sealed close, for its opening is sealed. Similarly, when a needle is entirely embedded in a piece of wood or a ring is entirely embedded in a brick, if a <i>zav</i> moves the wood or the brick, the <i>keilim</i> embedded within become impure. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When a <i>zav</i> inserts his hand or foot into the inner space of an earthenware container, since he did not touch the inside of the container, nor did he move it, it remains pure. The rationale is that a <i>nidah</i> or the like do not impart impurity through their limbs alone.
When a <i>zav</i> had a rod held fast in the folds of his skin and used the end of the rod to move a person or a <i>k'li</i>, he or it remain pure, as implied by Leviticus 15:11: "Anything that will be touched by the <i>zav</i> when his hands were not washed in water." According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that this verse is speaking about a <i>zav</i> moving entities. It uses the wording "touch" to teach the following concept: Just as touch involves one's hand and other parts of the body like one's hands, i.e., revealed limbs that can touch, so too, moving an object must be performed by a revealed portion of the body and not by a hidden portion.<br>If a rod was in the folds of the skin of a pure person and he moved a <i>zav</i> with it, he contracts impurity. For one who moves an impure object is considered as if he carried it. Hence, just as one who carries an article in the hidden portions of his body contracts impurity, as we stated at the beginning of this book, so too, one who moves an impure object with the hidden portions of his body contracts impurity.
The following laws apply when a <i>zav</i> was on one side of a scale and a <i>k'li</i> made to lie on or ride on was placed on the other side. If the <i>zav</i> outweighed them, causing them to rise, they are considered as <i>keilim</i> which he touched, for he moved them. If they outweighed him, they contract the impurity associated with articles on which one lies and become a primary source of impurity. The rationale is that they lifted up the <i>zav</i>. Thus it is as if he stood on them.<br>If there were other <i>keilim</i>, foods, liquids, or another person on the other side of the scale, whether they outweighed the <i>zav</i> or he outweighed them, they are all considered a primary derivative of impurity.
The following laws apply when a <i>zav</i> and a pure person:<br>a) were sitting on opposite ends of a bench or a board that moved up and down,<br>b) both climbed a tree that was not strong, i.e., its trunk is not thick enough for a cavity fit to contain a fourth of a <i>kab</i> to be hollowed out within,<br>c) ascended a booth that is not strong, i.e., one that can be bent over by a person's hand and when he does so, he presses it and moves it,<br>d) climbed an Egyptian ladder that was not affixed with nails, or<br>e) ascended a ramp, a beam, or a door which was not firmly held in place with mortar.<br>In all these instances, they are impure because the entity they are ascending will shake back and forth and it would be as if the <i>zav</i> is moving the pure person. If, however, they sat in a large boat which would not be affected by the movement of one person, on a board or a bench that was not shaky, or climbed a tree or a booth that was strong, or an Egyptian ladder that was nailed down, or a ramp, a beam, or a door that was held in place with mortar, the pure person remains pure, even if they ascended from the same side.
When both a <i>zav</i> and a pure person were closing or opening a door at the same time, the pure person remains pure. If one was closing the door and the other opening it, the pure person contracts impurity.<br>The following laws apply when one lifted the other out of a pit. If the impure person lifted out the pure person, he imparted impurity to him, because he moved him. If the pure person lifted up the impure person, he contracts impurity, because it is as if he carried the impure person, as we explained.
When a <i>zav</i> and a pure person where pulling ropes back and forth, one pulling in one direction and the other, in the other direction, the pure person contracts impurity. If they were weaving together, whether standing or sitting, or working a mill, unloading or loading a donkey, if their burden is heavy, the pure person contracts impurity. If it is light, he remains pure.
When a pure person was administering lashes to a <i>zav</i>, he is pure. When a <i>zav</i> is administering lashes to a pure person, he is impure. The rationale is that that if the pure person will move, the impure person will fall. Thus he is leaning on him. Accordingly, even the clothes of the pure person contract impurity.
When a portion of a <i>zav's</i> body was resting above a pure person or a portion of a pure person's body was resting above a <i>zav</i>, the pure person contracts impurity.<br>What is implied? If a finger of a <i>zav</i> was placed above a pure person or a pure person placed his finger above a <i>zav</i>, even if there is a stone, a beam, or the like between them, the pure person contracts impurity.<br>Similarly, when entities joined to a <i>zav's</i> body rest on a pure person or entities joined to a pure person's body rest on the <i>zav</i>, the pure person contracts impurity. It is as if each one carried the body of the other. These are what is meant by the term "entities joined to the body": the teeth, the nails, and the hair. It appears to me that this impurity is of Rabbinic origin.

Chapter 9

The following laws apply when a support is firmly joined to the earth or nailed down. If it is sound and strong and a <i>zav</i> banged upon it and when doing so, a <i>k'li</i>, food, or liquids that were resting on it were moved or caused to fall from the power of his blow, they are pure. If the support was not sound or strong, but shaky and a <i>zav</i> banged upon it and caused <i>keilim</i>, food, or liquids to fall or move from the power of his blow, they are impure. It is as if he moved them, because they fell as a result of his power.<br>This is the general principle: Whatever falls as a direct result of the power of the <i>zav's</i> movement is impure. Anything that falls due to the trembling of the support is pure.<br>What is implied? If he knocked on a tree or a booth that were not sturdy, on an Egyptian ladder that was not affixed with nails, on a ramp, a beam, or a door that was not firmly held in place with mortar or he knocked on a door-bolt, a lock, or an oar, and when he knocked upon these entities, he caused food, liquids, or <i>keilim</i> to fall - or even caused them to shake without falling - they are impure. If, however, he knocked on a tree or a booth that was strong, or an Egyptian ladder that was nailed down, or a ramp, a beam, or a door that was held in place with mortar, a central building beam or an oven, and when he knocked on that entity, <i>keilim</i>, foods, and liquids on it were moved - and even if they fell - they remain pure. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.
When there was a loaf of bread attached to the wall of an oven and a <i>zav</i> knocked on the oven and caused the loaf to fall, it is pure, even if the loaf is <i>terumah</i>. If a shard from the oven is clinging to the loaf that fell, it is impure, even if the loaf is ordinary food.
A surface on which one lies or rides that has contracted <i>midras</i> impurity does not impart impurity to <i>keilim</i>, foods, or liquids, unless it touches them. If, however, the <i>keilim</i>, foods, or liquids were above the impure <i>midras</i> or the impure <i>midras</i> was above them, as long as they do not touch it, even if there is only a paper separating between them, they are pure. Similarly, if an object on which one sits caused <i>keilim</i>, foods, or liquids to move, they are pure.
When a <i>zav</i> and a pure person were sitting in a small boat that could tip due to the movement of one person, on a dinghy, or riding an animal together, even if their clothes are not touching each other, the clothes of the pure person are considered to have contracted <i>midras</i> impurity. This impurity comes as a result of a doubt; perhaps the <i>zav</i> stepped upon them. Similarly, if a woman in the <i>nidah</i> state sat together with a woman who is pure on a bed, the other woman's clothes are impure because of <i>midras</i> impurity, with the exception of the cap on her head. Similarly, when a <i>zav</i> was in a small boat, clothes on top of the masthead are pure.
When one pushes into a mill in which a gentile, a <i>zav</i>, or the like is located, his clothes contract <i>midras</i> impurity.<br>With regard to which type of mill was this said? One that shakes the ground to the extent that it will raise the person standing there and force him from his place.<br>It is obvious that this impurity was decreed due to a doubt: perhaps the impure person was displaced and stepped on the clothes of the pure person.

Chapter 10

An unlearned person, even though he is Jewish and observant of the Torah and its mitzvot, is assumed to be impure and his clothes are considered a <i>midras</i> if they come into contact with pure substances. If his clothes touch food or liquids, they are impure. If he touches an earthenware container from the inside, he imparts impurity to it. <i>Terumah</i> should be burnt if such a person touches it, even though his impurity is of doubtful status.<br>The word of such persons is not accepted regarding the status of pure articles, because they are not knowledgeable regarding the intricacies of the laws of purity and impurity. We continue to operate under this presumption and the person's word is not accepted until he resolves to accept the restrictions of a <i>chavair</i>. What is meant by the restrictions of a <i>chavair</i> that he must resolve to accept? That he be careful with regard to sources of impurity, not to contract impurity from them; that he be careful with regard to pure articles that he not impart impurity to them; that he be careful with regard to washing hands and maintaining their purity; that he not take moist foods from an unlearned person; that he not accept his hospitality; nor offer hospitality to him while the unlearned person is wearing his own garments.
When a person seeks to accept upon himself all the practices of a <i>chavair</i> except one, he is not accepted. If we see he carries out these practices privately in his own home, we accept him and then we teach him the concepts of impurity and purity. If we do not see him conducting himself in this manner privately at home, we teach him and then we accept him.<br>First, a person is accepted with regard to maintaining the purity of his hands. Afterwards, he is accepted with regard to dealing with pure objects. If he said: "I only accept upon myself, the purity of hands," he is accepted. If he sought to accept the restrictions regarding pure objects, but not those that apply to the purity of hands, we do not accept him, even for pure objects.<br>When he is accepted, we are cautious with regard to his conduct for 30 days until he learns the intricacies of the laws and is used to dealing with pure objects. Once 30 days have passed since he accepted the customs of a <i>chavair</i>, his clothes are considered as pure and all of his food and liquids are considered as pure. His word is accepted with regard to pure objects like all other <i>chavairim</i> even though he is not a Torah scholar.
Torah scholars are assumed to be <i>chavairim</i>. Their word is accepted regarding pure articles and they do not have to undertake a formal acceptance of the practices of <i>chaveirim</i>. Nevertheless, after the destruction of the Temple, the priests adopted an additional measure of stringency among themselves and they would not give pure objects to anyone, even Torah scholars, until they formally accepted the practices of <i>chaveirim</i>.
An elder who is a member of a Talmudic academy does not need to formally accept these practices, for he already accepted them at the time he became a member of the academy.
When a person seeks to accept the practices of a <i>chavair</i>, he must formalize this acceptance in the presence of three <i>chaveirim</i>. His sons and the members of his household need not formalize this acceptance in the presence of three <i>chaveirim</i>, because he will teach them and train them in the ways of purity. The wife of a <i>chavair</i>, his sons, the members of his household, and his servants are considered like a <i>chavair</i>. If a <i>chavair</i> dies, his wife, his sons, and the members of his household are considered as <i>chavairim</i> until their conduct arouses suspicion.
When the widow of an unlearned person or the daughter of one marries a <i>chavair</i> or the servant of a such a person is sold to a <i>chavair</i>, the woman or the servant must accept the practices of a <i>chavair</i> as at the outset. When, by contrast, the widow of a <i>chavair</i> or his daughter marries an unlearned person or his servant is sold to an unlearned person, there is no need for them to accept the practices of a <i>chavair</i> as at the outset.
When an unlearned person accepts the practices of a <i>chavair</i>, but had pure articles that remained from the time that he was unlearned, although he says: "I know with certainty that they did not contract impurity when others were involved with them," they are forbidden, as was their status initially. If he personally was involved with these pure articles before his status changed, the articles are permitted to him, but they are forbidden to all others.<br>A <i>chavair</i> may be asked about the state of his pure articles and he may rule in his own favor, that they are permitted. We do not harbor suspicions about him in this context.
When a <i>chavair</i> becomes a tax collector, a collector of customs duty, or the like, he is stripped of his status as a <i>chavair</i>. If he abandons his evil deeds, he is considered as every other person. He must accept the practices of a <i>chavair</i> as at the outset.
When an unlearned person accepted the practices of a <i>chavair</i> and then becomes suspect with regard to a particular matter, he is suspect only with regard to that particular matter. Nevertheless, one who became suspect with regard to a severe matter is suspect with regard to a slighter matter. If he becomes suspect for a slight matter, he is not considered suspect for a more severe matter.
When a <i>chavair</i> becomes suspect with regard to permissiveness in connection with ritually pure articles, e.g., he sold ritually impure foods with the presumption that they were pure, he is no longer considered as trustworthy until it becomes known that he repented completely.
When a person is suspect with regard to the violation of the laws regarding the Sabbatical year or with regard to selling <i>terumah</i> as ordinary produce, he is considered to be suspect with regard to violating the restrictions concerning ritual purity. For a person who is suspect with regard to a Scriptural prohibition is considered suspect with regard to Rabbinic safeguards. And impure foods impart impurity to other entities only by virtue of Rabbinic decree, as will be explained.<br>Any person who is suspect with regard to a particular matter is, nevertheless, permitted to deliver testimony regarding such a matter with regard to others and to serve as a judge with regard to others. The rationale is that we operate under the assumption that a person will not transgress so that others will benefit.

Chapter 11

We have already explained that the word of unlearned persons is accepted with regard to the purification process of the red heifer. Because of the severity involved, the matter is never treated lightly. Similarly, their word is accepted with regard to the wine and oil intended for the accompanying offerings of a sacrifice. If they say that they are pure, they are assumed to be pure. Because this is a very severe matter, they are mindful of it.<br>Similarly, their word is accepted with regard to the purity of <i>terumah</i> during the time when winepresses and olive vats are active, for all people purify themselves and their utensils to prepare their wine in a state of purity. When the time when winepresses and olive vats are active passes, their word is no longer accepted.
When an unlearned person brings a priest a barrel of wine or oil that is <i>terumah</i>, he should not accept it from him, because it is assumed to be impure. If the unlearned person left it in his own possession until the next time of the winepresses and olive vats and brought it to the priest, he should accept it even though he knows it is from the previous year. For no impurity was decreed on unlearned people during the time when winepresses and olive vats are active.
When an unlearned person locks his olive press or wine vat when the people completed pressing and brought the key to a priest, even though several days pass since the pressing season was completed, there is room for leniency. The priest may come, open the press or vat in the unlearned person's presence, have him immerse himself, press the olives or grapes and take <i>terumah</i> in a state of ritual purity.<br>If he did not do this, he should only take olives and grapes that were not made fit to contract impurity from an unlearned person, for they will not contract impurity.
If an unlearned person brought a priest a barrel of <i>terumah</i> wine or oil during the remainder of the year and told him: "I have separated consecrated wine or oil from it," even if only a <i>revi'it</i>, since his word is accepted with regard to the purity of the consecrated wine or oil, his word is accepted with regard to the entire amount.<br>Even during the time when winepresses and olive vats are active and the word of unlearned people is accepted with regard to <i>terumah</i>, their word is not accepted with regard to the empty containers to say that they are pure and may be used for <i>terumah</i>. Similarly, their word is never accepted with regard to empty containers to say that they are pure and may be used for consecrated liquids.
When there was a container of wine or oil and we saw an unlearned person waiting and protecting it so that he could take accompanying offerings from it, his word is accepted with regard to the purity of the container for even 70 days before the time when winepresses and olive vats are active. Before these 70 days, by contrast, their word is not accepted.<br>Where does the above apply? In the other portions of the land of Israel. In Jerusalem, by contrast, the word of unlearned people that empty earthenware containers are pure for consecrated articles is always accepted. This applies with regard to small utensils or large ones, whether they are full or empty. Implied is that the word of an unlearned person that a container is pure is accepted even though the liquids in the container are impure. Even if the garment of the unlearned person which is considered as impure due to <i>midras</i> enters the container, the container is assumed to be pure with regard to sacrificial foods. Why was such leniency shown? Because kilns for earthenware containers are not made in Jerusalem.
From Modi'it and closer, the word of unlearned people is accepted with regard to earthenware containers. Outside that area, their word is not accepted. Modi'it itself is sometimes considered as within that area and sometimes as outside.<br>What is implied? If a <i>chavair</i> was entering that town and an unlearned person carrying an earthenware container was departing, his word - that the container is pure with regard to sacrificial food - is accepted in Modi'it. If they were both either entering or departing, the word of the unlearned person is not accepted unless he is closer to Jerusalem than Modi'it.
The following rules apply when a potter brings pots and places them down closer to Jerusalem than Modi'it. Potential customers come and he tells them that it is pure. If a <i>chavair</i> purchases a pot and brings it in, it is considered as pure with regard to sacrificial food, but not with regard to <i>terumah</i>, as we explained. If he purchased a pot and took it outside of Modi'it, it is impure, both for sacrificial foods and for <i>terumah</i>. This applies even though these are the same pots and the same potter. His word is accepted only within a radius beginning from Modi'it.
When one takes earthenware containers from a kiln no matter where it is located, they are considered pure, both with regard to sacrificial foods and with regard to <i>terumah</i>. We do not suspect that perhaps an unlearned person touched them. Even if they were taken from the first row and even if the kiln was open and half of its contents were already taken, containers taken by a <i>chavair</i> are considered as pure. For a decree was not established concerning utensils in a kiln.
During the pilgrimage festivals, the impurity decreed upon the unlearned is suspended and they are considered as pure. For the entire Jewish people are considered as <i>chavairim</i> during the pilgrimage festivals. All of their utensils, their food, and their liquids are considered as pure during the festivals, for everyone purifies themselves and ascends to Jerusalem on the festivals. Therefore their word is accepted - whether with regard to sacrificial foods or with regard to <i>terumah</i> - throughout the festivals. After the festival passes, they are considered as impure again.
When a person opened his barrel of wine or of oil or began selling his dough during the festival, once the festival passes, the remainder of the contents of the barrel and the remainder of the dough are assumed to be impure, for they were touched by an unlearned person. Although he touched them only during the time that he is considered as a <i>chavair</i>, they are only considered as pure during the days of the festival.
After the festival, on the night following the festival, the priests would immerse all the utensils that were in the Temple in a <i>mikveh</i>, because the unlearned people had touched them during the festival. Therefore they would tell the people: "Do not touch the Golden Table," when they would show it to the festive pilgrims so that, after the festival, it would not be considered as impure because they touched it and thus would require immersion and waiting until nightfall before it would regain purity. This is undesirable, because with regard to the showbread, Exodus 25:30 states: "It should be before Me continuously."<br>All of the sacred utensils require immersion and waiting until nightfall with the exception of the Golden Altar and the Copper Altar. They do not contract impurity, because their metal plating is considered as subsidiary to their inner material.
When an unlearned person says: "I have not contracted the impurity associated with a human corpse," or "This <i>k'li</i> has not contracted the impurity associated with a human corpse," his word is accepted. He or the <i>k'li</i> is immersed only because of the impurity associated with unlearned people and must wait until nightfall. There is, however, no need for the ashes of the red heifer to be sprinkled on him or it.<br>When does the above apply? When he is asked and he says that it is pure. When, however, a person takes a <i>k'li</i> from the domain of an unlearned person without clarification, it is suspected that it contracted the impurity associated with a human corpse and the ashes of the red heifer are sprinkled on it on the third and seventh days, as is the law regarding <i>keilim</i> that are found in any place outside of Jerusalem. As will be explained with regard to situations where impurity is questionable, a decree was not established with regard to the impurity of <i>keilim</i> found in Jerusalem.

Chapter 12

When a person entrusts <i>keilim</i> to an unlearned person or gives a <i>k'li</i> to an unlearned artisan to fix, they are considered to be impure because of the impurity associated with a human corpse and the impurity of <i>midras</i>. If the watchman is familiar with the owner of the <i>keilim</i> and knows that he is a priest who partakes of <i>terumah</i>, they are considered as pure with regard to the impurity associated with a corpse, but are considered to have contracted <i>midras</i> impurity. The rationale is that it is suspected that his wife sat on them while she was in the <i>nidah</i> state without his knowledge, since care is not taken with regard to ritual impurity in the homes of unlearned people.
When a person places his <i>keilim</i> down before an unlearned person and tells him: "Watch these for me," they are considered to have contracted <i>midras</i> impurity, but not the impurity associated with a human corpse. If he placed them on the shoulder of the unlearned person, they are considered to have contracted both types of impurity.<br>If one left his <i>keilim</i> in a synagogue, they are considered as pure, for it is not entirely a domain of unlearned persons. If he left his <i>keilim</i> in a bathhouse and found them as he left them, they are pure, but he is taught not to do this in the future.<br>If one left his vat or his cistern unattended, even if he entered a city and returned and found an unlearned person next to the vat or the cistern, they are considered as pure, because the unlearned person does not have license to enter.
When a person entrusts the key to his house to an unlearned person, everything in the house is considered as pure, for he entrusted only the key to him for safekeeping.
When a person places his <i>keilim</i> in the lockers of a bathhouse and locked them, the <i>keilim</i> are pure, even if he gave the key to an unlearned person. Similarly, if he sealed the locker or made a sign on it, his <i>keilim</i> are pure even if the seal has been broken.
When a <i>chavair</i> leaves an unlearned person in his house to watch it and the owner sits a certain distance away, when he sees the people who enter and depart, all the foods, liquids, and earthenware containers that are not tightly sealed are impure. By contrast, surfaces on which one lies or rides and earthenware containers that are tightly sealed are pure. If the owner cannot see the people who enter or depart, everything in the house is impure. Even if the unlearned person he left in the home was bound or had his hands and feet cut off, everything is considered as impure, because it was in the domain of an unlearned person.
When a <i>chavair</i> slept in the home of an unlearned person and his clothes were folded and placed under his head and his sandal and his jug were placed before him, they are considered as pure, because they are assumed to be guarded by their owner. The unlearned person will not touch them for he will say to himself: "Now he will wake up and see me."
When an unlearned person borrows a bed from a <i>chavair</i> and sleeps on it in the house of the <i>chavair</i>, only that bed and the area which he can touch when extending his hand from the bed are impure.
When a <i>chavair</i> told an unlearned person: "Watch this cow for me so that it will not enter the house" or "...break these utensils," the house and the utensils are pure, for he charged him only with guarding the cow. If, however, he told him: "Watch this house for me so that the cow will not enter it" or "Watch these utensils so that it will not break them," the house and the utensils are impure.
The following rules apply when one leaves an unlearned person lying down in his house and departs. Whether he left him awake and discovered him awake when he returned, he left him sleeping and found him sleeping, or left him awake and found him sleeping, everything in the house is pure. If he left him asleep and he found him awake, any place that is close to him to which he can extend his hand and touch is impure.<br>Similarly, if one leaves craftsmen in his house, only the places that they can reach when they extend their hands and touch are impure. We do not say that perhaps they climbed onto a chair or a ladder and touched a <i>k'li</i> or food that was hanging on a high place on the wall.
When the wife of a <i>chavair</i> leaves the wife of an unlearned person - or two such women - to grind flour in her home, only the places which the wife of the unlearned person can reach when she extends her hand and touch are impure. This applies even if the mill stops for a time. We do not say that while one was grinding, the other searched through everything in the house and maybe even suspended herself and ascended to high places.
When a woman standing at the entrance to her house went in to take out a loaf of bread for a poor man and when she came out, found him standing at the side of loaves of bread, they are pure - even if they are <i>terumah</i>. The rationale is that it can be assumed that he would not touch anything without permission. Similarly, if a woman departed and when she returned, found the wife of an unlearned person stirring the coals that are under her pot, the pot is pure.
When tax-collectors for the ruling kingdom entered a house to take security for money that is owed, everything in the house is impure. If they are accompanied by a gentile, their word is accepted if they say they did not touch something, because they are possessed by fear of the gentile.<br>When does the above apply? When there are witnesses that they entered or they have security which they took in their hands. If, however, they say on their own initiative: "We entered, but did not touch anything," their word is accepted. The rationale is: the same person whose words aroused our suspicion also allayed it.
When thieves entered a house, only the path where the thieves walked is impure. The rationale is that they are afraid to search through the entire house. Instead, they take only what is at hand.<br>To what do they impart impurity on the path where they walk? To food, liquids, and open earthenware containers. Surfaces on which one lies or rides and earthenware containers that are sealed closed are pure. If there is a gentile or a woman among them, everything is impure.
When tax-collectors and thieves repent and return the articles they took on their own initiative, and not because of fear, and when doing so, say: "When we entered, we did not touch anything that was in the house except what we took," their word is accepted even with regard to articles that were in their path.
When a person leaves his house open and finds it open or finds it locked - and even if he left it locked and found it open - and nothing was stolen from it, everything in the house is pure. We assume that thieves opened the door and then changed their minds and did not enter.
When a hatchet is lost in a house or left in one corner and found in another corner, all the contents of the house are impure, for we assume that an impure person entered the house and took it.
When a person lives together with an unlearned person and shares a common courtyard, if he forgot articles in the courtyard - even barrels that were sealed close or an oven that was sealed close - they are considered as impure. For them to be considered as pure, he must construct a barrier ten handbreadths high around the oven so that it will not be in the domain of an unlearned person.
When a <i>chavair</i> has a partition or a hut before the entrance to an unlearned person's home or an unlearned person has a partition or a hut before the entrance to a <i>chavair's</i> home, <i>keilim</i> in the hut or in the partition are impure, because the unlearned person has the right to enter this hut or this partition.
When the roof of a <i>chavair</i> is above the roof of an unlearned person, the<i>chavair</i> may lay out utensils there and place pure foods there under the presumption that their status has not changed, even though the unlearned person could extend his hand and touch them. Similarly, if his neighbor is a gentile, he need not be concerned about impurity or wine used for libations to a false deity.<br>If the roofs were next to each other on the same level or the roof of the unlearned person was higher and the <i>chavair</i> laid out utensils or left pure foods on his roof, every place to which the unlearned person could extend his hand and touch is considered to be impure.
When there are two courtyards, one inside the other, the inner one belonging to a <i>chavair</i> and the outer one, belonging to an unlearned person, the <i>chavair</i> may place his utensils in his courtyard and spread out his produce there, even though the unlearned person's hand could reach there. There is no suspicion that the unlearned person would touch them, because he would be considered as a thief.
When a courtyard is divided by a lattice-work barrier, with a <i>chavair's</i> domain on one side and an unlearned person's domain on the other side, the pure food belonging to the <i>chavair</i> is considered as pure, even though the unlearned person's hand could reach there. There is no suspicion that the unlearned person would touch it, because it is in the domain of the <i>chavair</i>.
When the bucket of a <i>chavair</i> fell into the well of an unlearned person and the <i>chavair</i> went to get materials to lift it up, it is considered as impure. The rationale is that it was left unattended in the domain of an unlearned person for a given time.
When the wife of an unlearned person enters the house of a <i>chavair</i> to take out the son or the daughter of the <i>chavair</i> or his animal, everything in the house is pure, because she entered without permission.<br>When a potter who is a <i>chavair</i> brings his pots to sell and he descends to a well to drink, those on the inner rows are pure, but those on the outer rows are impure. When does the above apply? When he placed them near the public domain, because the passersby will touch the outer ones as they walk by.<br>Different rules apply if they were placed down distant from the public domain. If he was carrying the tools of his trade in his hand, they are all impure, because his tools indicate that they were placed down to be sold and everyone will touch them. If he was not carrying the tools of his trade, they are all pure, for it can be assumed that no one touched them.<br>When a <i>chavair</i> places food or liquids down at the entrance to his store and enters, they are considered impure, for the passersby will touch them.

Chapter 13

When a priest purifies his <i>keilim</i> for the grape-pressing season and then sets them aside for the following grape-pressing season, it is assumed that their status remains unchanged, for unlearned people will not touch the <i>keilim</i> of a priest when they are in his winepress, because he partakes of pure food. If an Israelite puts away his <i>keilim</i> in a similar manner, by contrast, they are considered impure, unless he says: "Within my heart, there was a resolve to guard against an unlearned person entering the winepress and touching the <i>keilim</i>."
When a person desires to make wine that is ritually pure while using workers who are unlearned, he must make sure that those who harvest the grapes immerse themselves in a <i>mikveh</i>. Similarly, if they were involved in producing oil, he should have those who work in the olive-press immerse themselves. He must stand over the workers and have them immerse themselves in his presence, for they are not familiar with the laws of immersion and intervening substances.<br>If the workers left the entrance to the olive-press and went outside to defecate behind a fence and returned, they are still considered as ritually pure. How far may they go and still be considered as ritually pure? Until they are hidden from the <i>chavair's</i> sight. If, however, they go out of his sight, they return to a state of impurity until he has them immerse again and they wait until nightfall.
When a source of impurity was found in the presence of olive-press workers and grape harvesters, if they say, "We did not touch it," their word is accepted. This also applies if their children say: "We did not touch the wine or the oil."
The following laws apply when a person purifies olive-press workers, brings them into the vat, and locks it. If there were <i>keilim</i> there that had contracted <i>midras</i> impurity, the entire olive-press is impure, for perhaps they touched those <i>keilim</i>. Even if the <i>chavair</i> saw them previously showing care not to touch those <i>keilim</i>, the olive-press is impure, for perhaps they moved them and thus contracted impurity and they think that a person who moves <i>keilim</i> with <i>midras</i> impurity is not impure. For unlearned people are not familiar with the impurity contracted by moving <i>keilim</i>.
When a <i>chavair's</i> donkey-drivers and porters were loaded with pure foods and they were proceeding in front of him, even if they were more than a <i>mil</i> ahead of him, they are pure. The rationale is that they assume that he is watching them. Hence, they are afraid to allow others to touch impurity, for they will say: "He will come now, for he is following after us." If, however, he tells them: "Go and I will follow you," as soon as they proceed beyond his sight, the foods are impure.
The following laws apply when a <i>chavair</i> was wearing a tunic and wrapped in a cloak while proceeding on his way. If he said: "In my heart, I intended to guard the tunic from contracting impurity and I was careful about it, but I diverted my attention from the cloak," the tunic remains pure, while the cloak is considered impure, because it is possible that an unlearned person touched it.<br>If there was a basket on his shoulder with a pitchfork in the basket and he said: "In my heart, I intended to guard the basket and to guard the pitchfork from something that would make it a source of impurity, but not from something which disqualifies it," the basket is pure, the pitchfork is impure, and all the <i>terumah</i> in the basket is impure. The rationale is that the impure pitchfork disqualifies the food in the basket.<br>If <i>chavairim</i> were using a barrel while in a state of purity under the assumption that its contents were ordinary food and it was discovered that they were <i>terumah,</i> even though it is pure, it is forbidden to be eaten, for perhaps it was touched by a person who had immersed in the <i>mikveh</i> that day. Such a person disqualifies <i>terumah</i>, even though ordinary food he touches is pure, as will be explained. Guarding <i>terumah</i> is not the same as guarding ordinary food. If, however, he states: "In my heart, I intended to guard it from even an entity that will disqualify it," it is permitted to be eaten.<br>If a person's Sabbath garments become exchanged with his weekday garments and he wore his Sabbath garments on an ordinary weekday, they become impure, for one does not guard his weekday garments to the same degree as he guards his Sabbath garments.<br>An incident occurred concerning the wives of two <i>chavarim</i> whose clothes became exchanged in the bathhouse. The matter was brought to the attention of the Sages and they ruled that the garments were impure. Even if one's scarf fell and he asked a <i>chavair</i> to give it to him and he gave it to him, it becomes impure. This is a decree, enacted lest an unlearned person give it to him or lest the <i>chavair</i> not guard it, for a person will not guard articles that do not belong to him like he guards his own articles unless the other person notifies him and relies on him.
When a <i>chavair</i> dies and leaves pure foods, they are considered as pure. When he leaves <i>keilim</i>, they are impure. The rationale is that we suspect that perhaps they became impure and he had the ashes of the red heifer sprinkled on them on the third day of their impurity, and not on the seventh day. Or perhaps he had the ashes sprinkled on them on the seventh day, but did not immerse them. Or perhaps he did not have the ashes sprinkled on them on the seventh day at all.
When one witness tells a person, "Your pure foods have contracted impurity," and the owner remains silent, his word is accepted and the foods are considered as impure. If he contradicts him and maintains that they did not contract impurity, it is assumed that their status has not changed unless two witnesses testify that they contracted impurity.<br>If a person was working together with a colleague with pure foods or sacrificial offerings and after a while, the colleague found him and told him when he met him: "The pure foods with which I was working with you became impure or the sacrificial offerings that I was offering with you became <i>piggul</i>, his word is accepted. If, however, he met him and did not say anything and afterwards met him a second time and he told him the above, his word is not accepted. Instead, his sacrifices are assumed to be acceptable and his pure foods are assumed to be pure.
