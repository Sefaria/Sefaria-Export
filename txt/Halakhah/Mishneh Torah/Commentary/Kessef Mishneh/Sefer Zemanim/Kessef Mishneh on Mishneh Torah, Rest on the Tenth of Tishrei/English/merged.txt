Halakhah 5

<b>We have also learned from the oral tradition that it is forbidden to wash [one's body], anoint oneself, etc.:</b> The Rosh wrote in the name of Ri and Riva that these afflictions - even though the Gemara extracts them from verses - are only [from] mnemonics, and he brought several proofs for this thing. And from this reason, we are lenient about them and say (Yoma 73b), "'A king  and a [new] bride may wash their faces and a woman after childbirth may wear shoes.' This is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Rabbis prohibit [it]." And since the Rabbis prohibit it, we are perforce dealing with cases that do not involve danger. Yet if the prohibition of wearing [leather] shoes is from the Torah (and not just rabbinic), how does Rabbi Eliezer permit it?!? And also in the Gemara (Yoma 77b), we say, "If one had scabs on his head, he may smear oil in his usual manner, and need not be concerned. And one who is dirty from mud or excrement, he may bathe in his usual manner, and he need not be concerned." But if smearing and bathing are from the Torah, how could we lenient about them like this?!? Rather they are certainly rabbinic. But the Ran asked about this and wrote that it appears to him that all of them are from the Torah. However since they are not included in the "affliction" that is written explicitly in Scripture - but rather come from inclusions [based on the word] Shabbaton, and as it is found in the Gemara - they are more lenient; and Scripture gave them over to the Sages, and they were more lenient about them, according to what they saw. So they permitted everything that is not done for pleasure. And this is also the opinion of the Rambam, that they are all from the Torah. But it is not clear to me, because of that which is learned later (in a baraita), "But infants are permitted with all of them except for wearing of shoes." And it is shown in the Gemara that, that which it said, "permitted with all of them," means it is permissible for adults to wash them and smear them. And those [things] are certainly done for pleasure. For if one were to deprive these from them for a day, they would not be endangered. Yet if it were from the Torah, how is it permissible? As behold, it is written, "you shall not eat them (<i>tokhlum</i>)" (Leviticus 11:42), and we read it as, "do not feed it to them (<i>tokhilum</i>)," to warn the adults about the minors! Moreover, since it categorically teaches, "But infants are permitted with all of them," and we do not find [a need to] educate about these [activities] in any place, as we find by fasting - it is implied that until they reach [adulthood], they are permissible concerning all of [these activities] even by way of adults. And granted, if they are rabbinic, it is fine. But if I say that they are from the Torah, how are they permissible? To here are [the words of the Rosh]. But it appears to me that even according to his opinion - that even if they have reached the age of education, they are permitted with all of them - it can be said that it is not difficult at all. Since even though they are forbidden from the Torah; given that they are not clearly explicit in Scripture, and are things that are given over to the Sages - the Sages saw fit not to be stringent with infants about it. For since with eating and drinking that are written clearly in Scripture, it is permissible to feed them and give them to drink with the hands, all the more so, other things. And even though when they reach the age of education, we need to educate them about the prohibition of eating and drinking; they did not see fit to educate them about these things, since they are not explicit in the text. And since [these activities] are [involved in] the growth of the infant, the rabbis did not make a decree about them. And according to the opinion of the Tur - who wrote that in the same way as we educate them about eating and drinking, so too do we educate them about bathing and smearing - it comes out even better. As that [statement] that infants are permitted with all of them, is about when they have not reached [the age of] education; whereas that [statement] that warns (forbids) the adults about minors is about when they have reached [the age of] education.
