Six types of forbidden relationships, etc. There it is taught (Shemot 58b): "Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother" - Rabbi Eliezer says, his father's sister and his mother's sister. In other words, and all the more so, his sister from his father's side or his mother's side. Rabbi Akiva says, his father's wife, his father's mother, his mother's mother, in the literal sense. It clings and does not include the case of a male with his wife or with another man's wife. And they will be considered one flesh, etc. Domesticated animals and wild animals that do not become one flesh, and scales and fur. In the Gemara, they explained: His father's wife - this is his father's wife, and his mother's sister - this is his mother's sister. But if we say that his mother's sister is prohibited, it implies that his father's wife is also prohibited, meaning, his own wife or another man's wife. We say that it refers to a case after his father's death, etc. His mother's mother - this is his mother's mother in the literal sense, and it does not include a case after his father's death, meaning his father's wife. And despite all this, our Rabbi rules according to Rabbi Eliezer, because he derives it from the verse, and although Rabbi Akiva disagrees, we do not seek to reconcile their opinions, as there is room for dispute. However, I still have a point of inquiry, and it is this beraita that was brought there, where Rabbi Meir taught: There, with regard to any forbidden relationship among the Jewish court, a non-Jewish son is put to death for it, but he is warned about it. And Rabbi Meir holds this way, and it was taught, etc. Rashi explains, and so does Tosafos, that he asks from what was taught in that beraita that a non-Jewish son is warned about his father's wife and his mother-in-law, and we answer that it is not difficult. This is according to Rabbi Meir, according to Rabbi Eliezer's opinion, and the other is according to Rabbi Akiva's opinion. It was taught, etc. As I wrote above, and Rashi explains that with regard to any forbidden relationship among the Jewish court, a non-Jewish son is put to death for it, and he is warned about it. It supports Rabbi Akiva's opinion, for everything that can be derived from this verse includes capital offenses, and he will derive from them to all capital offenses. And now, according to our Rabbi, we rule according to Rabbi Akiva's opinion, that with regard to any forbidden relationship among the Jewish court, a non-Jewish son is put to death for it, and he is warned about them, since we do not find who disputes Rabbi Meir's opinion, saying that Rabbi Akiva does not hold this way. And this requires further investigation.
