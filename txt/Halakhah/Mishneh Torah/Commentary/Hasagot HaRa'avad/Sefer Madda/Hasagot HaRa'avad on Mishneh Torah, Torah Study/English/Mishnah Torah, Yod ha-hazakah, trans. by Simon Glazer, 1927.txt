Halakhah 3

<b>The interpreter is not permitted to diminish from or add to, or change unless the interpreter be either the father of the master or the master's master.</b> This was a singular incident when Rab was appointed an interpreter to Rabbi Shyla mention of which is made in Tract. Yoma (20b), wherein it is said that he made changes and additions because he was a greater scholar than Shyla.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> Maimonides quotes the Yer.

<b>He who causes the blind to stumble.</b> For example, one who strikes his grown-up son.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> R<small>ABD</small>. does not criticise Maimonides in this; he merely cites an example, which is not a limitation. G.</i>
<b>A scholar of a universally evil reputation:</b> And there are many others. A master who decided that a woman whose husband fell in unending waters may re-marry; likewise every tribunal that would pay attention to the request for relief of one who violated his vow is ostracised, and there are many others.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> This is no criticism. The laws mentioned by R<small>ABD</small>., Maimonides mentions in their proper place; here he only enumerates the transgressions for which man and woman are excommunicated. Moreover, he was loathe to add to the number because of the universal aversion among scholars to pronounce ostracism against a scholar, even against one of a universally evil reputation, saying that one of such character long ceased to be counted in among scholars. C.G.</i>...
<b>He who excommunicates one not guilty of an offense punishable by excommunication.</b> This law he derived from the incident of Simeon Ben Lakish (Mo'ed Katan, 17a), who kept a vineyard etc. By the life of my head there is no Pilpulistic inference here, for the matters he enumerates, the tribunal is obliged to ostracise him, but in such instance the tribunal would not pay attention to Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish; on the contrary, the one whom he excommunicated, in defending his honor, the excommunication should stand.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> Maimonides maintains that if he had brought the man to the tribunal they would have excommunicated him.

Halakhah 7

<b>How large a personnel etc.</b> This is not so; but an equal number to the tribunal pronouncing the excommunication, and of equal scholarly standing is required for release. Possibly this refers to a release during the period of sentence, but at its expiration any three or one scholar may release him. Or, when one not a scholar pronounced the excommunication on account of a transgression, after the expiration of the time of sentence, any three or an individual scholar may release him; but if many made the pronouncement, an equal number of like standing is required<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> Maimonides supports his decision on Nedarim, 8b, and Sanhedrin, 68a. C. G.</i>.

Halakhah 11

<b>A disciple of the wise etc.</b> This is not clear, if so, why did Judah not release himself, moreover, why did Jacob not release him?<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> Here is only a difference of opinion in a fundamental rule of practice. Maimonides contends that a scholar releases himself even in a matter where separation is justified, basing his decision on Mo'ed Katan 17a, and Nedarim, 7a. The apparent contradiction of Judah, is no contradiction at all, as Judah bound himself to bring Benjamin back, which is a bond to perform a definite thing, in which case Maimonides does not sanction the release by one's own self. Jacob did not release him, because Judah brought Benjamin back and delivered to Jacob, which was sufficient ground to believe that there was no need for a release. C. G.</i>
