<b>But that is saying solely concerning sins between man and man etc</b>. Likewise concerning known and open sins, though not against man; for even as the sin was public so it is necessary to make the repentance public, and let the sinner feel the disgrace of his misdoings. <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The text protects Maimonides against this criticism. That it would be impudent of him to reveal them surely can not refer to publicly known sins. With this difference: Maimonides maintains that sins, even open ones, between man and God, the sinner is not obliged to name publicly when repenting. C. G.</i>

Halakhah 1



Halakhah 2

<b>A man whose vices etc</b>. Not as he thinks that what was said by the Talmudists, 'The doom of the wicked is sealed instantly' (Rosh ha-Shanah, 17a) means that they die at once; for it is not so, as there are many wicked alive. But the meaning of 'Sealed instantly' is, that they will not complete their days of the years alloted to them at birth. And the source of this matter is found in Yebamot, 50a. <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Virtues and vices are not measured by man, to condemn one to death, or ask why he is still living. God is the sole judge thereof. One virtue of one man, or one vice, might either save or be the cause of destruction of the whole world (See Kiddushin, 39b–49a). Maimonides refers to Hosea, 7. 9. and to Genesis, 18. 20. to teach us that only God judges our iniquities, and whenever destruction comes to pass, His judgment should be justified. C. G.</i>

Halakhah 5

<b>When the vices and virtues of man are weighed etc.</b> This is part of the potpourri he made of the texts and imagines in his mind that both are of one subject, whereas they are of divers kind and very far apart. Because he saw in Rosh ha-Shanah (16b–17a) 'And the Abundant in Goodness turns the scale opposite goodness 'and then (Ibid.) 'Rabbi Ishmael's school transmitted that He removes the sins one by one in rotation, for such is the rule. Again he saw in Yoma (85b) 'Rabbi Jose Bar Judah said: 'if a man sins, the first and the second and the third time he is forgiven, but the fourth time he is not forgiven', he fixed it in his mind that both these refer to one subject; but are very far apart. Rabbi Ishmael's transmission refers to the Great Day of Judgment, and to save the intermediary category from Gehenna, in support of the House of Hillel's contention, but there is no mention there of the wiping out of sin. Whereas this of Rabbi Jose Bar Judah refers to this world and to the beginning of man's conduct, from the day he became old enough to be punished for his sins and onward, whose first, second and third transgression which he encountered, if he did repent of them, although they be of the major sins which require both, suffering and the Day of Atonement, to be wiped off, those first do not require it, for they were entirely forgiven. This is the outline of the texts and their component part. Moreover, there is no difference in the Gemara between an individual and a congregation, and I do not know where he found such distinction.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> The text in the Talmud (Yoma, 86b) does make a distinction between an individual and a congregation. (q. v.) The <small>RABD'S</small> copy of the Talmud evidently had it not. As for the subject matter of both quotations, Maimonides again showed a correct attitude. The <small>RABD</small> failed to quote Raba's provision of, "But his own sins are not wiped off", which supports the entire contention given in the text herein. C. G.</i>

Halakhah 7

<b>He who says that there is One Lord but that He is corporeal and has a form.</b> Why does he call such one an atheist? Many greater and better than he followed this opinion according to what they saw in phrases, and more particularly in the texts of the Agadot (legends of the Talmud) which misdirect opinions.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> Possibly the version of this criticism was tampered with, and should rather stand corrected in the language of the Joseph Albo (Ikkarim, 2. 41) which is much more intelligent, not to say polite: "Although the component part of belief is so, nevertheless, he who believes His Being corporeal because he understood the language of Scriptural phrases and the Midrash literally, deserves not to be called an atheist". Of course, even in the version before us, the <small>RABD</small>. does not differ in principle with Maimonides. It is merely amazing that our Master had to suffer such indignities for having purged Judaism from the dross of Anthropomorphism. C. G.</i>
<b>Likewise one who says that He alone is not the First Cause.</b> For instance, as the one who said, 'Your God was a great Architect, but found ready great drawings, such as the circle of earth, stones of the abyss, (Tohu Vobohu, see Hagigah, 12a) darkness and water, and therewith He made what He did make.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> This comment is intended by the <small>RABD</small>. as a distinction between the one who denies the existance of God mentioned before, and the one presently under discussion. What improvement this is on Maimonides only the <small>RABD</small> knew. C. G.</i>

Halakhah 9

<b>Against the whole Torah, is a convert to the religion of the idolaters.</b> And whosoever accepts the religion of the idolaters acknowledges their gods, is not such one an atheist<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">? And I say, had there been no other nation in the world excepting idolaters this criticism would be in place. But there are other religions which are not idolatrous, how can a convert be called atheist? C.</i>

It appears that he transmits the text as Shor, but it is not so, for it is Shod, the meaning whereof is: he who presses a debt against them so much that they either sell their immoveables for less than their value, or their moveables, and he maintains that he takes only what is his due.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> Alfasi, too, has the text as Shod. Possibly it is a simple typographical error, of which there are many, both in manuscripts and primted texts. Perhaps, Maimonides picked the noun Shor as a type of property. C. G.</i>

<b>This being so etc.</b> This one did not follow the custom of scholars; for no man begins a thing which he knows not how to finish it, whereas he commenced with inquiries and questions and left the matter under question and turned it around to faith. It would have been better for him to leave the matter to the innocence of the innocent, not to awaken their hearts and leave their mind in doubt, lest, during some hour, a suspicion will enter their heart concerning it. Moreover, although there is no convincing reply to this question, it is best to lean himself upon a partial answer like this, saying: If either the righteousness or wickedness of man would have been dependent upon the decree of the Creator, may He be blessed!, we would be saying that His knowledge is His decree, then would the question be to us very difficult, indeed. But now, since the Creator ceded this power from His Hand to the hand of the man himself, His knowledge can not be said to be a decree, but it is similar to the knowledge of the astrologists who know by another power what the conduct of a certain person would be. And, it is common knowledge that from the smallest to the biggest thing which happens to man the Creator transmitted to the power of the planets, only He endowed him with an intelligence to sustain himself, and be delivered from the influence of the planet, and this very same is the power endowed to man to be either good or bad, and only the Creator knows the power of the planet and its movements whether it be within the power of the intelligence of one to be delivered from its influence or not. And, such knowledge is not a decree. But even this is not a comparison.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> Maimonides deemed it best to manifest the shortcomings of man's mind, particularly for the benefit of such who do ask questions of this kind, to teach that the human mind has its limitations, and that because it can not attain man shall not say: "It is not so", but, "I do not know". As for the <small>RABD</small>'s attempt to make a comparison between the knowledge of the Creator and that of the astrologist, it is evident that he was still under a certain influence of a school of thinkers to which, evidently, Maimonides did not belong. See, Shabbat, 152b; Nedarim, 32b: and Rashi and Nachmanides on Gen. 15.5. C. G.</i>

Halakhah 5

<b>Now.. is it not written etc.</b> These are unseasoned, lengthy words; by the life of my head, I am tempted to say, they are childish words. Should the Creator say to the perverters: "Why did thou turn aside, I made no mention of thy name, to afford thee the excuse of saying that I decreed it against thee", the perverters will say to Him: "Upon whom then is Thy decree applicable, if on those who did not turn aside, behold, Thy decree was not established". But of, this Verse "And this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land", we long ago suggested that in the subject of the foreknowledge of God there is no connection with predestination, much less can it be utilized here, seeing that even Moses said: "For I know that after my death ye will in any wise deal corruptly" (Deut. 31.29), and preceding this he, moreover, said: "Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after my death?". How much more, then could the Creator speak thus without it being a decree? As for the subject of the Egyptians, it is no question at all for two reasons: first, it is a known doctorine that God inflicts no punishment against a wicked man unless it be through a more wicked man than he, whenafter that wicked man will have retribution visited upon him; For, so it is said: "O Ashur, the rod of Mine anger", (Is. 10.5), but, "When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spiled" (Ibid. 33.1); because of thy wickedness, and haughtiness of thy heart, and vain glory against Me. The Egyptians, too, were wicked and it was meet that they receive the plagues; yet, if they had listened to Moses at first and let the children of Irsael go forth, they would neither have been plagued nor drowned in the Red Sea; but the spitefulness of Pharoah, and his insulting words against the Creator in the presence of His messenger caused the punishment to be visited upon him. Second, because the Creator said: "And they shall afflict them" (Gen. 15.13), but they afflicted them with rigour, put some of them to death, and killed others by drowning, as the subject is spoken of saying: "I was but a little angry, but they helped for evil" (Zech. 1.15); they were, therefore, found guilty". <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Abraham De Butin, too, criticises Maimonides for delving into this subject again, after he already gave his opinion that we can not comprehend the foreknowledge of God in the preceding chapter. The RiTBa, in defending Maimonides, here falls in an error regarding the <small>RABD</small>, by attributing to him knowledge of Kabalah, an attribute belonging to <small>RABD</small> I. With all the commentaries silent, it is evident that, as far as this defence of the doctorine of self-will versus predestination is concerned, it must be considered weak. The text of this paragraph, however, lends itself to very strong points. The parallelism herein contained is more than of passing strength. Of course, Maimonides establishes the ultimate point upon Faith; but his arguments are chiefly directed to offset contradictions to the Torah. In this he succeeded. The <small>RABD</small>, too, upholds the doctorine of choice of action as against predestination. C.G.</i>

Halakhah 2

<b>The World to Come harbors neither body nor aught of a concrete form etc.</b> This man's words are in my eyes nigh to such who assert that there is no resurrection to body but the souls alone. But, by the life of my head, this was not the opinion of our sages, may their memory be blessed! Behold, they have said: "The righteous are prepared to rise up in their garments, deduct major from minor, by comparison of a grain of wheat" (Ketubot, 111b); and they left instructions to their children, saying: "Bury us not in either white or black garments, lest I be meritorious and be resurrected" (Shabbat, 114b); and they have again said: "The righteous will never again return unto dust, but remain standing in their concrete form" (Sanhedrin, 92a); and yet again they said: "They will rise in their deformities, but will be healed" (Ibid. 91b). All of which is conclusive proof that the dead will arise with their bodies and remain alive. Nevertheless, it is possible that the Creator will set them in strong, healthy forms as are the forms of angels, and as is the form of Elijah, of good memory!, when the garlands, too, will be literally and naturally, not in similitude". <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Evidently the <small>RABD</small> erred in placing the World to Come instead of resurrection. <small>RAB</small> (Berakot, 17a) is authority for the contents of this paragraph in the Maimoni text, in so far as the World to Come is concerned. Of course, the <small>RABD</small>'s words are true with respect to resurrection, but Maimonides herein speaks of the World to Come, and not of resurrection. C. G.</i>

<b>And the sages, figuratively, named etc.</b> If this be the Banquet, no Cup of Benediction can be herein. Silence would have been best for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> The <small>RABD</small> refers to Pesahim. 119b, and to Psalms, 116. 13. The entire conception of the <small>RABD</small> is contradictory to the opinion of Rab (Berakot, 17a), even though it is established that he erred in placing the World to Come instead of resurrection. The accepted doctorine, according to all commentaries on Maimonides is this: The dead will be resurrected. Life will then go on for a time. Then life as we know it will cease completely, when the era of the World to Come will be inaugurated. In all there are four distinct eras: (1) this world, as at present; (2) Messianic era; (3) era of Resurrection; (4) era of the World to Come. C. G.</i>

<b>As for the reason why the sages called it etc.</b> It appears that he denies that the world will again be without form and void, and that the Holy One, blessed is He! will renew His world, as the sages have said: (Sanhedrin 97a.) Six thousand years will this world last, and one thousand years it will be desolate, as a consequence the world after that is a new one.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"> It is strange, indeed, that those who criticised Maimonides should have given so little of their thought to his text. What if this world will be desolate a thousand years, and a new one created, would that alter the life after death of which he speaks? C. G.</i>

<b>It is a known and clear matter etc.</b> This "tremoring" we know at what he is pointing. We interpret this word-Shogeh-as refering to either of two subjects: singing, as "Shiggaion" of David (Ps. 7.1), and the other, because of its love you will "err" in the subjects, that is you will pay no attention to it. <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides knew his Hebrew.
