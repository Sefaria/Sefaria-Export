Since a woman cannot see herself when she is immersing, there is a concern that maybe a hair on her head may still be floating on top of the water, such that her immersion would be invalid. Hence there is a need for a responsible woman to stand by and see that all of the immersing woman's body and hair are in the water (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 198:40). Since that is so, there are those that have become accustomed to request from that woman to also assist them to check that there is nothing on their bodies on the places they cannot see that is separating [between them and the water]. From this, the custom was established to have an attendant at every mikveh (ritual bath house), who guides new immersers and assists more experienced ones to immerse according to the halakha, without anything separating.
